It was refreshing to find a single text that espouses solid, fundamental design issues such as scope creep and reusable sources coupled with advanced DreamWeaver tools usage and building web applications.If you know DreamWeaver and are now prepared to look at the bigger web development picture, this book is a great single source. It has joined the very short list of recommended books I offer my own design students."},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX Web Development","review":"I received this book, expecting it to be heavy on the server-side lingo and practices, but was pleasantly surprised to see that it dealt with the basics right through to the advanced areas of site conception, layout and design, static and dynamic sites.If you are familiar with Dreamweaver MX (Self taught) and want to know more about actual web development, both static and application, then this is a must read book for you. The book is clearly for the web developer starting out through to those that are somewhat familiar with 'the way of the web' through surfing and brain picking in the newsgroups.Drews writing style made the book very easy to read and although I consider myself to be html knowledgable, the book taught me a few things especially related to tables and accessability.Thanks Drew for the great book!"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX Web Development","review":"First I have to say the author of this book is one of the original people who helped me learn ASP using Ultradev back in June of 2000.

I am nearly embarrassed to say, but I can write asp code in my head but I didn't know what the &lt;tbody&gt; tag was.. this chapter goes over all those freaky details it even goes over a non graphical browser such as a PDA (personal digital assistant) Chapter 17 talks about packaging extensions, which is also nice. In closing this book goes over a lot more then some of the complete technical books about server languages, and programming which never seem to give attention to the less glamour's topics, this book is worth owning.CheersWayne lambright"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX Web Development","review":"This book is excellent.

The epic poem is all things: a journey of self, a divine romance, an exciting personal \\"vision\\" of Hell, Heaven and Purgatory. But, as with most poems of this length from a time long, long ago (13th century), any modern reader who is not a scholar, academic, or university student is likely to keep this book on the shelf and not read it. That was me, and then I found Gallegher's book and decided to take the plunge and give Dante a fair chance. What a surprise! Dante is VERY modern, and Galleghar proves that in his very, very readable book that breaks down incredibly complex historical references, religious references, and classical allustions and obscure imagery for the modern reader. And even though THE DIVINE COMEDY has its philosophical moments, its action moves quickly through short cantos (chapters), and Gallegher (much better than Cliff's or Monarch Notes!!) causually speaks with readers, answering all of the questions that a reader would ask. It's like he has read the readers' minds.This would be a perfect text for high school teachers who are required to teach Dante but have no idea as to how to approach a modern youth with 13th century POETRYm starting off with his question and answer introduction \\"A Catechism of the Comedy.\\" A sampling of some of the questions are: \\"Is THE DIVINE COMEDY a difficult book to read?\\" \\"Do we need to know about his life?\\" \\"Why is this work so special and so highly honored?\\" \\"Is it really a comedy?\\" \\"If it is a comedy, why is it called \\"divine\\"?\\" The answers Gallegher gives are spot on, direct, modern and complete. What is great also about the answers, is that even though they are clear at a young person's level, they are just as valuable to an adult who is not a liberal arts major.In addition, Gallegher's wonderful Appendix also includes complete summaries of all of Dante's other works, including his letters and questions about \\"his remains.\\"Just as the poet Virgil takes Dante's hand and guides him through the heavenly and not so heavenly regions, Gallegher's modern -- always modern -- analysis of THE DIVINE COMEDY will make any reader feel as though the reading journey was worth it. I also understand much, much better now why THE DIVINE COMEDY is just as valuable a read as books by Homer, Shakespeare, and Anne Rice (just joking). THE DIVINE COMEDY is a lot of fun to read, but if you want to get even more from your reading experience, Gallegher's TO HELL & BACK is perfect for the non-scholar."},{"Title":"Twisting Arms: Teaching Students How to Write to Persuade","review":"This resource book is packed with ideas to teach the persuasive essay. Although I feel the lessons are geared towards middle school and the activities will be a little over our heads, the ideas are brilliant and I am planning on dissecting them to fit my student's levels. I love the analogy of \\"The Skeleton\\" and how we need to know the bare bones before we pack the meat into our argument. This was one area my students needed help on last year and is so important when we write for the state tests. No one wants to think out their thoughts before they put the pencil on the paper.The layout for the book is very handy. Depending on where you need help you can pick out a section to add to your lesson or just start from the beginning of the book and move through out the entire writing process. I like the tidbits of information splashed here and there to add to the progression of writing.I will also implement the lessons of persuasion to my writing unit next fall.

This is quite true. Sir Thomas Malory borrowed from one English poem and three lengthy French books of the thirteenth century.He modernized his sources by reducing their oratorical qualities and simplifying and strengthening the ornate style and story lines. The Tale of Sir Gareth of Orkeney That Was Called Bewmaynes is considered one of the best examples, in Eugene Vinaver's words, \\"of the technique of a modern tale applied to medieval romance.\\" Further, it exemplifies in a straightforward and colorful fashion Malory's ideas of chivalry. And it is a good story of adventure and romance.So when I was thinking of a way to introduce young children ot hte delights of Arthurian legend, the story of Gareth seemed perfect. I have condensed the plot a bit and simplified the ending without, I hope, sacrificing the spirit, tone, and intent of the original. - Barbara Schiller"},{"Title":"The Kitchen Knight","review":"I really enjoyed this version of the story beginning around age 5.

He also likes to sit by himself and thumb through them and bable to himself while doing so.I took a gamble and found someone on Ebay selling 7 brand new Miffy books for $15 -- I'm so glad I did but they'd easily be worth the retail price of $4.99 each."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I absolutely love this book, it was hilarious! I actually read it twice, and I'm not one to read anything more than once.The dialogues between the characters were laugh-out-loud funny. Although I cannot say that the sex and chemistry were hot as fire, the plot and budding friendship in this novel were a can't-miss!There were so many funny scenes in this book, it's hard to pick a favorite.A lot of sarcasm from both parties and their good friend James, oh, and who can forget the witty butler?Caroline Trent is actually one of my favorite heroines, and Blake, one of my favorite heros.I was a little sad when the novel ended, missed the sarcasm and hilarious scenarios.Definitely a must-read!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I couldn't believe how funny this book was! Quinn has a splendid way of making the rants between the characters extremely entertaining and off the wall funny. I found myself laughing all the way through this novel and the only reason I didn't give this book a 5 Star is because Quinn dumbed Caroline down a little to much for me. I really enjoyed all the characters; and although Blake wasn't the \\"hero\\" he was my favorite. I'll have to check and see if she's told his story!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"*** Back cover synopsis ***When Caroline Trent is kidnapped by Blake Ravenscroft, she doesn't even try to elude this dangerously handsome agent of the crown. After all, she's been running from unwanted marriage proposals. Yes, Blake believes she's a notorious spy named Carlotta De Leon, but for six weeks until her twenty-first birthday, when she'll gain control of her fortune, hiding out in the titillating company of a mysterious captor is awfully convenient - and maybe just a little romantic, too.Blake Ravenscroft's mission is to bring \\"Carlotta\\" to justice, not to fall in love. His heart has been hardened by years of intrigue, but this little temptress proves oddly disarming and thoroughly kissable. And suddenly the unthinkable becomes possible - that this mismatched couple might be destined for love.*** Personal opinion ***This book kept me laughing nonstop. It was that good! Caroline's wit was just priceless. I love the way how she annoys and frustrates the hell out of Blake. At the very beginning, I was really looking forward to seeing more of Blake because he seemed to be a very interesting character, but once his friend, James appeared, I started favoring James' character over Blake. Although, there weren't that much scenes for James, but with all the parts that he showed up, it just kept the plot's laughter going.At some point of this book, I actually find some of the dialogues to be a bit too modern, like reading something from the 21st century, but other than that, this book is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This was a fun and charming read. I disagree with the other reviewers that believe that Blake wouldn't have fallen for Caroline. I believe he would have. James said that she had the same type of personality as Blake's ex fiancee and his ex would have died at around 22 or 23 years of age. And 5 years was a long enough mourning period for him to finally realize he could love another woman. I have to admit I did want to strangle both characters on several occasions for their constant bickering but I thought the epilogue was so sweet, we got to see how many children etc. they had through the diary entries. julia Quinn always adds such sweet touches like that."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Although Marabelle's essence was indeed a downer, I thought that Caroline's madcap antics and Blake's surly attitude made for a wonderful read! Caroline is funny, smart and spunky and breathes new life into Blake's life. The plot was a little too predictable, but that's ok. Blake, Caroline and James' escapades more than made up for it."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This is the first book I've read by Julia Quinn, and I can't wait to read another. The heroine is feisty and strong, the hero sufficiently tormented but redeemable."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I found this book after doing a search of Julia Quinn's novels on Amazon. I saw it received rave reviews, so I bought it. I literally saved it for a special day when I had time enjoy a good read; boy, was I disappointed.The two main characters were constantly bickering. Their encounters were supposed to be humorous, but they were goofy and ridiculous. The parts that were supposed to be laugh-out-loud funny were only slightly amusing. I did not feel like these two characters got well enough aquainted to fall in love, so the romance fell flat for me.This book was too cheesy to recommend. Instead read the Bridgerton Series ~ The Viscount Who Loved Me, When He Was Wicked, and It's In His Kiss were my favorites."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"TO CATCH AN HEIRESS is one of the earlier novels by one of the best Regency/Victorian era writers, Julia Quinn. It is the story of Caroline Trent and Blake Ravenscroft. Caroline is an heiress who has been shuffled from guardian to guardian since her father's death at the age of 10. Just six weeks to her 21st birthday, she is acosted by her distant counsin, Percy Prewitt, in an attempt by his father, Oliver, to retain her fortune. Caroline easliy subdued Percy, who's heart is not in the event, and escapes into the night, only to be abducted by Blake.Blake is sure that Caroline is the famed spy Carlotta DeLeon, and takes her into custody. Wanting to get information out of Carlotta, Blake ties her up to a bed in his home and plans to interrogate her in the morning. Caroline decides to take this opportunity to wait out her six weeks, and causes herself to become horse. It is the arrival of James, the Marquis of Riverdale, when Caroline's true idenity is made.Caroline and Blake set forth on their romance. Caroline must overcome a past love for Blake, who was killed tragically in the line of duty. Blake feels an overwhelming need to protect Caroline, no matter what. The result is an entertaining tale, full of fun and an interesting end to the &quot;mystery&quot; part of the tale.The dialogue that ensues between Blake and Caroline is just fast paced and very enjoyable. This is Julia Quinn's trademark. While not as good a read as some of her more recent work, this book is definitely worth the time and effort. Afterall, Quinn's worst is 10 times better than another author's best. If you read this, I highly recommend HOW TO MARRY A MARQUIS, Marquis Riverdale's tale."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Caroline Trent has 6 weeks until her 21st birthday and she receives her inheritance. She must escape her greedy guardian, who is trying to get her fortune by having his son compromise and marry her. As Caroline is trying to find a place to hide out, she is mistaken as a spy by the dashing Blake Ravenscroft. Blake is on his last mission as an agent of the war office. He is plagued by the memories of his fiancee(also a spy) who lost her life while taking his place on an assignment.Julia Quinn is an author who is known for weaving humor into her plots. While To Catch An Heiress does have some laugh out loud moments, they're not enough to carry the book. I have to agree with the previous reviews that the dead fiancee was definitely a downer. She was also hard to get around-she was made mention of throughout the book. I never believed that Blake deserved Caroline or that she would want him. This book should be passed by. Read How to Marry A Marquis instead."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Thankfully, Julia Quinn's plot &amp; character development have improved since this 1998 novel. If you're seeking an engaging, well-written story like &quot;The Duke And I,&quot; you'll be somewhat disappointed here -- the hero spends 90% of the book bickering with the heroine. Even his best friend becomes so annoyed with the endless sparring that he leaves the area...imagine how the reader feels. Granted, even this effort is more entertaining than many other romances on the market. Quinn has become a compelling, amusing, enjoyable writer since &quot;Heiress&quot; -- any of her stories about the Bridgerton siblings are more deserving of your time."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"While I wouldn't probably rank this as one of Quinn's best, it is certainly a book that I will keep on my bookshelf. I found it vastly amusing. I couldn't put the book down. The story caught my interest from the very first line. It was cute, funny, and sweet. The banter between the two characters (as well as James, the Marquis) was highly entertaining. This is what is meant by quick repartee (w/the occasional element of slapstick too, I guess). The book is mostly dialogue (in my opinion) and very humorous. I was especially struck by the amusing anecdotes regarding the servants. While it wasn't the most complicated of plots, I found it very original to have these characters together in each other's company throughout the entire book rather than the typical romance chapters in which the hero and heroine are separated and pining mournfully. This was a nice change of pace. In regards to the &quot;dead&quot; fiancee the other reviewers are mentioning, it was not THAT big a downer. It was necessary to understand Blake's character. While the book is certainly a &quot;fluff&quot; one, the death of Marabelle wasn't such a tragic element, but a necessary one. I'm keeping this book and when it's a rainy afternoon and I want to quickly AND enjoyably pass the afternoon, I shall read *Catch an Heiress* again."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I wasn't going to buy this book, due to the no so good reviews given. I ended up buying the book by mistake, then it took me 6 months to get around to reading it. I have to say I was pleasantly suprised. The comments about the hero's dead fiance had put me off, so I was waiting for all these comments. There aren't that many, and what is mentioned fits the hero's difficulty with loving again. It was no different from the explainations given for other brooding heros. I enjoyed the banter between the hero &amp; heroine &amp; their friend. And the servants where hilarious. I was laughing out loud in some spots.I normally don't add to reviews, but this time I wanted to because the other reviews had given an impression of the book that I personally found to be exagerated. Please don't think I'm putting anyone down. What works for some, doesn't work for others. I just wanted to add my point of view. So if you want a fun, light read, this is a very nice book."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"As a huge fan of Julia Quinn, I picked up this book out of sheer boredom and a desire for a light, entertaining read. Since this is one of her earlier works, I wasn't expecting the quality of the Bridgerton series. Overall, I wasn't extremely impressed or disappointed. The hero and heroine are sometimes funny and sometimes annoying and far lacking the depth of Colin and Penelope (of Romancing Mr. Bridgerton). Their personalities seem a little slapdash at times--Blake was about the least convincing spy I've ever seen. However, the plot moves fairly quickly and the secondary characters are, of course, delightful (JQ's specialty, I think). If you can pick up this book for a bargain and want a qucik diversion, go for it. Otherwise, wait for Francesca's story (JQ seems to be getting better with every novel)."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Miss Quinn has come up with a whimsical romance about Caroline Trent, a runaway who is mistaken for a notorious spy by Blake, a government agent. Sparks fly between them, and the story takes place mainly in Blake's country manor. The jokes come fast, mainly due to Caroline's over-enthusiastic attempts to impress Blake and a surprise visit from Blake's sister.Now, I enjoyed this book, but why didn't I give it 4 stars or more? Well, I have a few problems with this book:(a) The absence of &quot;movement&quot; of plot - the story never moves outside the country house and I feel &quot;trapped&quot; after a while,(b) Sometime the story loses steam as Caroline pours something or falls over Blake for what seems the millionth time, &lt;c&gt; A lack of chemistry between the two leads. By chemistry I mean heat and sexual tension. Here the sexual tension is at the minimum.Despite the faults, I still enjoyed this book. But I wouldn't consider it anything more than the light-heartedromp it is."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"From the day her father died when she was merely ten, Caroline Trent has been passed on from one guardian to the next. Barely six weeks shy from turning twenty one and be able to claim her inheritance, she finds herself at the mercy of her latest guardian's mercy when she foils an attempted rape. Knowing she must escape until she can claim her inheritance, she runs away only to be captured by an agent of the Crown when she is mistaken for a spy.Blake Ravenscroft thought he finally had the ruthless spy Carlotta de Leon in his hands--only to find out that he has the wrong woman. Upon learning his captive's predicament, the gentleman in him couldn't say no to her request to stay at his manor until her twenty first birthday. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he is attracted to her--even though she sorely tests his temper! But if he would just look deep inside, he would know that the tempting chit has wound her way into his heart...I have been a big fan of Julia Quinn since reading the Bridgerton series. Her writing is superb and her characters are always well-rounded. While TO CATCH AN HEIRESS is the least interesting book of hers that I have read, this was still an entertaining book and had its moments. Caroline is a clever and delightful heroine, full of life and passion. She is perfect for Blake who suffers the guilt over losing his fianc&eacute;e, who was also a government agent. The way she brought laughter to his otherwise jaded existence provided some sweet and amusing reading. I did have a good laugh over some of their verbal sparring, though I felt that the plot could have been better developed. This was still an entertaining read, with witty dialogues and fun secondary characters (watch out for the marquis and Blake's butler) though not quite on par with some of Quinn's other novels, notably the first three books in the Bridgerton series.I have the follow up book, HOW TO MARRY A MARQUIS, and hoping for a better story."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I loved her previous romances, especially Splendid and Brighter than the Sun, and appreciate her wonderful sense of humor.

Running away from the sixth guardian to view her fortune as something to better their personal future with. She figures she only has to suvive six weeks before she turns 21 and can legally spend her fortune and leave all guardians in the dust. However, she did not figure on being abducted in the middle of the night, by Blake Ravenscroft. Nor did she figure that he would mistake her for a Carlotta de Leon, a traitor to the Crown. But he did. And now she is tied to a bed post, coughing her brains out, as Blake (an agent in the War Office) interrogates her about the illegal doings of her guardian, Oliver Prewitt. What a muddle. To further complicate things, Blake and Caroline quickly develop feelings for each other. With nary a chaperone in sight.A light read with plenty of good humor. The plot is a forgone conclusion after the second chapter, but as I liked the characters so much, I didn't mind. And I was edified as I read the teaser line at the beginning of each chapter. (a good vocabulary builder ) A good book to pick up for a day at the beach."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I count myself a big Julia Quinn fan and have read almost all of her books. Some of my favorite romance novels are in her Bridgerton series so it was an absolute disappointment when I read To Catch an Heiress. Here I was, thinking how lucky I am to have let one of her books slip through so I could read it for the very first time.Big mistake.I was so fed up with this book and the main characters that I just had to stop reading it. And I never just abandon a book! But I couldn't take it anymore. Caroline was one of the most annoying characters I've ever read. As a heroine, there's not much redeemable about her! She's willful, stubborn, selfish, self-absorbed, self-involved... She always has to get her way, no matter if it hurts anyone else and she doesn't seem to have any tact or grace -- you would think that being around so many horrid foster parents that she would learn a little self-preservation but she seems to think convention and other people aren't worth her time -- not even Blake, the man she supposedly loves. I can't believe she hasn't managed to \\"grow up\\" yet despite her circumstances! Usually experiences like hers make people mature faster, not slower!And what's worse is that Blake indulges her! I remember quite distinctly how Blake calls her a \\"plague,\\" something that echoed what the son of her current foster father had said and because Caroline got upset at how it might be true (it so is), Blake takes it back! She should have gotten a clue then and it was almost like she did but JQ manages to yank it away to save her precious feelings.Seriously, what a disappointment. I wish I had never even tried reading this book because it taints my thoughts of what a writer JQ is. Stick to the Bridgerton series -- you'll be glad for it. For the most part, at least most of those books are good and at the very least, even the bad ones are decent enough to be read. I wish I could say the same about this book."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"To Catch an Heiress was a fast and fun read...I finished it within a day....The story was sweet and fast paced..and I enjoyed Caroline's word of the Day entries...My main complaint about this book was that the characters were somewhat 2 dimensional......While Blake and Caroline were endearing, I didn't really feel as if I knew them all that well....I did,however, enjoy it..and I would recommend it to anyone who was in search of a fluffy story to pass the time..To Catch an Heiress is definitely charming."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"To Catch An Heiress is a funny, lighthearted comedy of manners featuring the witty dialogue that Julia Quinn has become known for.Caroline Trent, orphan and soon-to-be heiress, is sick of her evil and greedy guardian's attempts to force her to marry his son, especially after an ill-conceived attempted rape! Fleeing her guardian's estate on horseback, she plans to hide out for six weeks (until her twenty-first birthday), at which time she will receive her inheritance. She doesn't plan to be kidnapped, but soon she's abducted by the handsome and honorable Blake Ravenscroft and whisked away to his estate.Blake is sick of his work spying for the crown but has agreed to do this one last job to unmask a dangerous local spy ring believed to be associated with Caroline's guardian. Having never met the notorious Spanish spy named Carlotta De Leon, he mistakes Caroline for her and dismisses Caroline's protestations to the contrary. He holds Caroline prisoner pending a confession and is furious with himself that he's so attracted to the enchanting beauty.By the time Blake's close friend James Sidwell (the hero of Quinn's subsequent novel How To Marry A Marquis) arrives and confirms that Caroline is not Carlotta, Blake and Caroline are in love but won't admit it to themselves or to each other. What follows is some great banter between Caroline, Blake and James as they plot together to bring the traitorous spy ring to justice while Caroline and Blake fall deeper in love. But all the joking about killing each other as well as the nonstop cursing gets to be too much. Still, Quinn creates a warm comraderie among the three and a fun character in Blake's sister Penelope.There are no surprises or deep, moving scenes in this novel (okay, maybe one: when Blake and Caroline first make love on the beach), but it is an overall pleasant and absorbing romp that features action, danger, passion and love."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":".....so this unmarried unchaperoned 20 something year old (England 1814) just got kidnapped by \\"the most frightening man she has ever seen\\" and she is busy playing games with him not in the least bit fearful for her life, or at least her reputation???Such is Ms Quinn's writing style...This book and its idea is very immature, asinine, undeveloped, humorless, witless and ridiculously interminable.Such is Ms Quinn's writing style.......Why do I even bother anymore???Once bitten, twice shy......."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I have just discovered Quinn. Fortunately, I have read some of her previous novels before reading this one. If I had started with this novel, I would not have continued reading her works. I was disappointed with this book. The zaniness (is that a word?) is still there. Her work is generally light hearted fun. But I didn't see a whole lot of warmth in the hero. He was just one lost tortured soul clinging to memories of his dead love. He just didn't deserve the heroine. However, I did like his friend. The plot was interesting in a convoluted manner but something I could forego in the future. This book was ok...but if you could find her other books, I would recommend those first. You could probably bypass this one and not be missing out on much. I am currently reading &quot;Minx&quot; which I am very much enjoying."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I special ordered this book and, was all excited to read it,Boy was I in for a let down. I didn't even finish it, it was sooo boring! The hero was always so angry at the heroine through most of the book, and the heroine was always joking it was like she didn't know how to be serious. now I love a humorous romance but when the time warrents seriousness The heroine just couldn't or wouldn't get serious.Then there was the hero's dead fiance that had died five years previous to the start of the book, and he felt so guilty over her death that, thats all you read about. GET OVER IT already! As for the passion and heat in this book there wasn't any. I like my romance books with a lot more passion and heat,I also like my romances were the hero and heroine are not at each others throats from page one till the end. I like when the hero and heroine get along through most of the book."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This is a good choice if you have nothing to do on the weekend. I loved Caroline's character and personality. I found myself actually laughing out loud during the first couple chapters. Blake was everything you would expect from a tough, handsom secret agent. All in all it wasn't blow my mind amazing but it was a great way spend my day off relaxing. I would only recommend this if you're looking for a fun light read. If you're looking for and intense, complex romance look elsewere. I finished the book three days ago and I'm already forgetting the plot & characters a little. So don't expect this to be a book you're telling your friends about weeks from now."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I loved this book! It was wonderful! I felt some parts lagged a bit and that the scene was longer than needed but it was still a great book. The characters were funny and believable and I loved them. Great read!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Caroline is within 6 weeks of her 21st birthday and subsequently, her freedom, when her guardian seeks to ruin her in an effort to keep her fortune in his family. Her only choice is to run away, putting her in the path of Blake Ravenscroft. In a case of mistaken identity, Blake believes Caroline to be a treasonous spy. He imprisons her in his home and summons his partner, James, to assist in the interrogation. Thus begins \\"To Catch an Heiress.\\" I don't think it's any great secret that Blake and Caroline find themselves inexplicably drawn to each other, despite the fact that he at first believes her to be a dangerous traitor. Although the plot is sometimes ridiculously simplistic and predictable, the laugh-out-loud funny antics, witty dialogue, and tender love scenes save the novel from an obscure fate. It is a rather pleasant and enjoyable read. Blake and Caroline are both wounded in different ways, and they both have to learn to trust each other. Don't expect it to be realistic, but more like a fairy tale, and you will be delighted. I really enjoy the other characters, especially the servants. I can't wait until James finds his happily-ever-after in the next book."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This story borders on the absurdly silly but it qualifies as a \\"to read\\" if one is desperate for an escape that requires no thinking.2.5/5.0"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I have been reading Ms. Quinn's book in order of publication and have enjoyed all of her books so far. Her characters either meet or interact in quirky or interesting circumstances and there are moments where they say things that are laugh out loud funny! I like how Caroline and Blake meet, the secondary characters James, Penelope, and Perriwick are delightful, and overall, the plot of the story leads to a satisfying conclusion. I'll continue to read all of Ms. Quinn's novels."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I love this book. I love how Caroline Trent gets Blake Ravenscraft to laugh feel love again. Both Caroline Trent & Blake Ravenscraft needed to find love be needed. I love the plot. The dialogue that ensues between Blake and Caroline is just fast paced and very enjoyable. It is this that makes this heart warming humorous tale so unique - you do laugh and are totally drawn to the love story of Blake and Caroline. A wonderful hero, an engaging and spunky heroine, a mystery to be solved, and a large heaping of danger and action. I positive devoured this book. :-)Also Read How to Marry A Marquis. Part two of this series. Another feel good book You get to see Caroline & Blake again."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This is the third book I have read by Julia Quinn. The first was the Duke and I (I loved it!) the second was An Offer from A Gentleman (Equally loved it!)- the third, To Catch an Heiress -- I haven't even finished it. I just can't get thru it. Caroline seems more like an 11 year old girl and Blake at times seems younger than that. I enjoy the romances where the hero and heroine spar off of each other - it keeps me interested, but this was just pure ridiculous. I haven't yet looked up the copyright to see if this was her very first book ever, but I do know that this is not going to sit up on my keeper shelf with the other two of her books I have read. I hope this is the only bad apple in her list of books, because I just bought all of them based on what I enjoyed with the Duke and I and Offer from a Gentleman. This is a library or book exchange book only - do not waste your money. Sorry."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I liked it. A lot.This was a story about Caroline Trent who became orphaned at a young age and was raised by numerous guardians, most of whom were rather nasty. Her current one ordered his son to RAPE Caroline in order to force her into a marriage where she would end up giving over control of her inheritance. So Caroline SHOT him. And ran away into the arms of Blake Ravenscroft, a secret agent for the War Office, who mistakes Caroline for an international spy who was in cahoots with her current guardian both involved in a smuggling ring. Blake kidnaps Caroline and confines her to a room in his home until he is informed that she is not the spy he was determined to apprehend. By then, Caroline has learned that Blake was after her guardian and vowed to help him and his crony, James Sidwell, Marquis of Riverdale, bring her guardian to justice. In turn, Blake has agreed to allow Caroline to remain secretly at his home for the following six weeks, until she turned twenty-one and would no long be required to have a guardian. In the meantime a budding romance develops between Caroline and Blake.The story is sweet, funny and exciting. I giggled and laughed out loud all through a section where Blake's older sister pays an unexpected visit. The talented Ms. Quinn really has a way with words making the banter between the characters very entertaining. I had a fun time reading this book.Now I'm off to read the sequel, HOW TO CATCH A MARQUIS. James Sidwell was a very likable character so I'm looking forward to his story."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"To Catch an Heiress is a fun, easy read, but it's no classic; what makes the book so easy to read is its light banter and thin plot. Most of Julia Quinn's novels follow the same structure - but who cares? As long as the girl down on her luck gets the dashing duke, it's all good! As a high school junior, it was a relief to take a break from studying physics to read this romance."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I have to add Julia Quinn to my list of favorite authors. I have loved all of her books. This one was very funny and smart. I also found it touching and warm. This is the story of Caroline, a heiress who has been shuffled to several guardians since her parents passed away. Each guardian seems to get worse. This last one is a fortune hunter intent on having her marry his son. Well she spoils that by running away, only to be caught by the handsome Blake who is on a mission for the War Dept. and mistakes her for a traitor. He takes to his home and locks her in a room with the intent of getting her to talk, well she has other ideas. How she avoids talking is truely inventive. When he finally does realize that she is not the traitor he is at a loss as what to with her. He is strongly attracted to her but has demons that he must overcome in order to come to love her. Together along with James Riverdale, the best friend of Blake, they must battle the evil that is threatening the government of England. Along the way they have some very amusing times and endear themselves to the reader. I look forward to reading James's story next. Definately get this book and every other Julia Quinn book you can, you'll really enjoy them."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I truly enjoyed this Julia Quinn story. Like most of her efforts, this book has subplots as well as the main one. There were many times when I had to chuckle at the incidents as they unfolded. Espionage, spys, traitors, rich orphans with abusive guardians, rich lords with troubles pasts, concerned friends and relatives and devoted servants all play a part in this richly developed story with a resolution of the conflict that was not what I expected. The author is a born story teller and you look forward to finding out what will happen on the next page."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I really enjoyed this book. the dialogue between Blake and Caroline was so entertaining, and the secondary characters such as the servants, James and Penelope just add to the fun. The scene at afternoon tea where everyone is starving for any kind of food had me in stitches.The love scenes were a little disappointing, but it is still one of the better books by Julia Quinn."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"An unlikely match makes the must entertaining romances. The story starts with a dark beginning, which leads to a confusion of identity and ends with a love match. Once again Quinn writes another spell binding story."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I love all her books. She's so funny and romantic this book and all her others are worth the read!!!!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I disagree with most of the reviewers on this site. This book was very amusing throughout the story. Although there were parts of the story that did get very serious, they were necessary to further develop the plot. I have read and re-read this book and it just keeps getting better as I rediscover plot twists and new characterization. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants just a break from reality and an escape to the world of romance."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"When Caroline Trent runs away from her guardian in order to avoid marriage to his idiot son, she never dreams of being kidnapped by Blake Ravenscoft. He thinks she's the tratiorous spy Carlotta De Leon, but when he finds out differently it becomes a tale of matched witts and stubborness that will make you laugh and cry. These two are lost souls destined to be together and in a humerous and romantic way they will be. I loved this book! I recommend that you also buy &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot; which follows this book, Caroline and Blake also play a role in that love story too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This is a truly enjoyable romance that I literally read in an afternoon. I couldn't put it down! The dialogue and characters are smart and funny. Made me want to read more of author Quinn's books. I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"this is a very good book and everyone should read it! =) this is my fifth book by her and I love her writings! SHe is the best! one of my favourite authors...."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I buy *EVERYTHING* Ms. Julia Quinn writes.

She is the best because she is simply the cleverest"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"While I did not find TO CATCH AN HEIRESS quite as enduring as Julia Quinn's other novels, this one still gets 5 stars. Caroline had lots of spunk and personality despite her being thrown from home to home her whole life. I personally found Blake's turmoil and heartache over his fiancee who passed away a very real and nice (not to mention neccessary) part of the novel.However if this is your first Julia Quinn novel I would suggest perhaps reading some of her other novels to get a better feel for Julia Quinn's writing talent. I would suggest reading EVERYTHING AND THE MOON & BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN (they can be read in any order, but do go together), or her Bridgerton novels (THE DUKE AND I is the first in this series that can be read in no particular order but do go together as well).But again, I still enjoyed this novel and would definately recommend reading it!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"What can I say? I am hooked on Julia Quinn's books. I first read &quot;The Duke and I&quot; and enjoyed it so much I picked up her other books. She is a talented writer and this book had me in stitches! But yet it was very romantic! I can't wait until her next book!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"In 1814, a desperate Caroline Trent knows that she only has to survive six more weeks. If she can remain single for the next month and a half, she will inherit a fortune on her twenty-first birthday. However, her greedy guardian Oliver Prewitt has already decided that Caroline is going to marry his son. Caroline decides to go into hiding until she comes of age.Blake Ravenscroft is trying to capture the French spy, Carlotta de Leon when he happens upon Caroline. He thinks he has finally caught the notorious Napoleonic espionage agent. She sees an opportunity to use him as a cover from her odious guardian and does not tell her captor the truth about who she really is. He quickly learns the truth, but is already in love with the obstinate lass, a feeling she reciprocates. If they survive Oliver and the spy, this adventurous pair has a lifetime of loving to share.TO CATCH AN HEIRESS is a jocular Regency romance due to the antics of Caroline, who constantly throws Blake off his stride. The story line is simply enjoyable entertainment that will be savored by fans of the sub-genre. Julia Quinn knows how to personalize her stories so that readers know they are getting some of the best works to be found in the historical romance world.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"To be sure comedies are not my usual taste in romance. And it would have to be by the pen of J. Quinn or I would not even find it palable. I much prefer lustier tales by Jordan or Laurens. However Julia Quinn is the master of good dialog - her Bridgerton series are some of the best in historical romance and while this is not quite that caliber it still rates high. Blake Ravenscraft certainly needed something in his life. He had been living gult ridden for years over the intimely death of his fiance Marabella. By chance of mistaken idenity he meets the very formible Caroline Trent and at first one is not sure if they are destented for love or hate?? The banter between them is ongoing and at times beyond hysterical in its humor. But what Blake needed was to be shaken from his stoney cold world and begin to laugh and feel again. It is this that makes this heart warming humorous tale so unique - you do laugh and are totallyh drawn to the love story of Blake and Caroline."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I love all of the Bridgerton Series, so when I had a chance to pick up another of Ms. Quinn's book, I jumped at the chance. I was not disappointed. I loved Blake and Caroline! Their conversations made me laugh out loud. (not so bad when you are home alone, but a bit embarassing at the doctor's office). Throw in James and the servants, and you can't miss. This wasn't just a damsel in distress, and the big handsome man that rescues her. I think that in the end, Caroline really rescued Blake!I messed up and read this story after &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot;, and now am thinking about re-reading that one just to read their interactions in that one.Great book! Well worth it!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I am fairly new to Julia Quinn's books, having started with The Viscount Who Loved Me (based on other ..reader recommendations - thank you!) Ms. Quinn has an amazing wit and puts it to good use in her historical romances. To Catch An Heiress reminded me more of a screwball comedy than anything else. Its 2 main characters, Caroline & Blake, make falling in love a laugh out loud experience. One reviewer stated that Julia Quinn is our generation's Jane Austen and I totally agree. Readers who enjoy romances and have a wicked sense of humor will enjoy her books tremendously. Ms. Quinn, keep 'em coming!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I enjoyed this book. I admit it isn't the greatest of Ms. Quinn's but I would not have wanted to miss reading this book. Blake kidnaps Caroline by mistake and is driving himself crazy thinking that he is attracted to a criminal, when in fact he has the wrong person. Once they figure out the truth Blake continues to protect Caroline from her greedy family members that are after her fortune. This book introduces James Sidwell, The Marquis of Riverdale. He is a favorite character of mine from Ms. Quinn's book &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot;. Blake and Caroline also make an appearance in this book as well. All in all it was a cute book."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This is my next to the least favorite of Julia Quinn's. Although she writes about interesting characters, I found the story too light, and too predictable. I suggest if you want this; to get a used copy of it. If you want to read something well worth the price, I would try Duke and I, The Viscount Who Loved Me, Dancing at Midnight, and Splendid. Now those are great books!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I generally enjoy Quinn's works, but I found that I did not like the main characters in the book. He had way too much emotional baggage. It seemed like he was brooding about his dead fiancee constantly throughout the book. The story line was dull and the characters never did seem to hit it off. I prefer reading about characters with less psychological problems. However, I did enjoy the subsequent book - How to Marry A Marquis."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"After reading &quot;The Duke and I&quot; - I went out and purchased this book- a huge mistake. Not only did these two characters have zilch chemistry, the plot lacked any sort of sense. And to top that off, the storyline had a love triangle that I absolutely hate to see in any book. The heroine loves the hero and the hero loves his dead fiance. I think this dead fiance must have had a supporting character role in the book because she really doesn't disappear until the last 2 or maybe 3 chapters. She was the primary cause for the lack of chemistry between the 2 main characters. I couldn't wait for the book to end because I wanted to start on another book. Save your money and pass on this book."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"this was the best book i have ever read. when miss trent escapes and runs into blake, it was fantastic. put together two strong people(the hero and the heroian) and add a great supporting actor like james you have got the best book of 1998. miss quinn has once again out did herself. it is a must read. read it in one night and then read it two more times."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This was my first julia quinn book, and, well.. lets just say it may be my last... A cliche of a heroine and hero, who was rather foolish! overly emotional, the \\"cold hearted\\" hero with a \\"dreadful\\" past who takes responsibilty for everyone he sees. *yawn*you're in for a 22 chapters of dull arguing.i couldnt appreciate quinns weak ...and failing...attempt at humorlets just say that i'd give the book a 0 if i could."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I bought this book after I read Minx. I bought several other books by Quinn too. I hope her other books are better than this one because I was very disappointed with this one.

I really would not recommend the book."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This is the first book I have read by Julia Quinn and will be my last. Perhaps, I should say &quot;started&quot;. The conversations between the main characters were asinine and I lost interest with only one-third of the book read. If you are looking for a strong-willed, and intelligent heroine, as well as humor, I suggest you read &quot;Hearts Aflame&quot; by Johanna Lindsey."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I haven't found a book yet that I don't like by JQ!

Boring and draggy.Ms Quinn has done much much better than this."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Not a terrible book, but not one of her best. Some humor but still very boring. The dead fiancee that keeps appearing is somewhat distracting and not at all romantic. I have read a couple of her other books so I will not give up on Quinn. Lets hope the next book is better than this one."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"TO CATCH AN HEIRESS is a delightful story that not to be missed! Follow up with How To Marry A Marquis!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Yet another wonderful Julia Quinn novel! I bought one of her books on a whim one afternoon and didn't expect to discover my new favorite author. Although I usually read about 3-5 books per week her real-life characters and attention to detail keep me intrigued. She's kicked Nora Roberts out of my favorite author spot and that says a lot. I would reccomend anything she's written - especially the Bridgerton collection."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I have to say that I agree with the previous comments made by reviewers. I hate to see a triangle with a heroine in love with a hero who is in love with a dead woman. It just kills any sort of romance in the relationship department. I have read all of Quinn's books and I must say this was the only book I truly disliked. I only read about halfway through the book and could not continue. The plot was dreadful and I didn't like to see the poor heroine suffering as she is trying to win the affections of a man who is still suffering over his lost love. Pass on this book, but buy any of her other books. My all time favorite is &quot;Everything and the Moon.&quot;"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"This the first book I've read from Julia Quinn and I was surprised by how easy it was to read and get into, and how incredibly funny it was. Reading romances, I don't expect much humor but with this book, I was laughing out loud, which garnered looks from my husband. But the banter between the characters were so outrageously hilarious! I laughed so much, my eyes teared. But as much as it is funny, this book is also very touching and sweet. The chemistry is good, and this book had a lot of intrigue and adventure to it and I loved each and every character. They were all hilarious!! The heroine is perfectly head-strong but vulnerable and the hero is perfectly sexy and miserable. The other Amazon reviewers didn't give it much, but I really think you should give this a try. It is so easy to fall into and enjoy!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Caroline Trent needed to get out of her living situation and fast!

When he realizes his mistake (with the help of his friend James Sidwell) he also comes to learn that Caroline has no intention of being returned to the care of her abusive uncle. The two soon unite, both for the good of their common cause and by falling in love! I loved the characters and their interaction. I also loved the roll that james Sidwell had in finally getting them together!Don't miss James' own novel &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot; which also has an appearence from Lady Danbury of the &quot;Bridgerton&quot; novels. I love that her books are all interconnected! She is a brilliant author!"},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"Miss Caroline Trent honestly didn't mean to shoot her cousin. But she did, and now he's covered in blood, which will be dueced hard to explain her her guardian and her victim's father. Now, she had a good reason, but still, she must run away and hide until her 21st birthday, when she will be able to receive her inheritance and live out her life in peace. Her plan probably would have worked out, too, had she not been taken as a spy and kidnapped by that idiot Ravenscroft. Still, he is sinfully handsome and just a little bit brooding...Finally, after months of work, Blake Ravenscroft has captured the half-Spanish spy Carlotta De Leon. With her capture, he will have enough evidence to put Olivier Prewitt away for smuggling and spying for Napoleon. Imagine his anger when he discovers that his captive is not Miss De Leon and his discomfort when he realizes how attracted he is to Miss Trent.Sparks fly and hilarity ensues as Blake's home, and emotions, are turned upside down by this annoying little chit who wrecks his roses, ruins his rugs, and lays waste to his library.This was the novel that got me hook on romances. It was the first I ever read, and I enjoyed it enough to encourage me to purchase another. However, the dead fiancee seemed a bit of a downer at times and made it difficult to completely focus on the blossoming relationship between Caroline and Blake. I especially enjoyed the scenes with Blake's sister Penelope and Miss 'Dent', a respectable member of country society who is most definitely NOT living unchaperoned with Mr. Blake Ravenscroft. However, having read other pieces of Ms. Quinn's work, I must say that I would not recommend this particular book if you are looking for a good introduction to her writing. I much preferred Minx over this one, but overall, not a bad romance."},{"Title":"To Catch an Heiress","review":"I started reading JQ with the Bridgertons and then read To Catch An Heiress. I have to say that this is my fav. so far!! I have NEVER laughed so hard while reading a book. I actually woke my husband up in the middle of the night from laughing so loud.

But it also goes further than this. The book looks at women on land whose husbands were at sea, women who worked in lighthouses and sailors who had many affairs with women. There is a wonderful section on Lady Emma Hamilton and Nelson, too.The book discusses these topics in general terms, but also goes deeper by discussing certain people and incidences in greater detail. It are these individual stories that really make the book come alive.Heroines and Harlots was a joy to read. It is written in simple language and does not get bogged down in too much detail (so that you don't need to be a historian to appreciate the book). It was a wonderful easy read that I found hard to put down."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I bought this classic book for my Grand Daughter, then started reading it myself as soon as I received it.

While it is often labeled a children's novel, it takes the understanding of an adult to grasp the richness of symbolism contained in each page. We get a front row seat as Alice journeys through a myriad of characters that range from the bizarre to the down right funny. Alice is the wiser for each encounter, but what makes the book so charming is that she manages to retain her child-like wonder.I must admit that this novel would not be complete without the illustrations from Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Tenniel gives the characters a richness and exaggerated life that is unmatched. The book is incomplete without those drawings.Lastly, there is little bit of Alice in all of us. Who among us has not wanted to walk in the forest, open a closed door, or peek behind a curtain. The thought of escaping and exploring the unknown without the fear of harm is almost intoxicating. If that is you, get the book and start down the rabbit hole."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Have you ever wanted to be in a world of your own?

The main plot of both books is quite simple; a girl named Alice stumbles upon another world filled with many different characters as she explores and meets many people and creatures alike.

Its filled with many different perspectives on many different things, some are very insightful while some are just silly. At some points, it will have you thinking while at others you'll find yourself laughing up a storm. This is what makes it great for kids and adults alike. The books are also very easy to relate to, not literally but in its theme: being thrown into something new and trying to fit in. Everyone's been there at some point in their life, just not to the extent of Wonderland and the Looking-Glass World. The book also teaches a good lesson of thinking before you speak. Often times Alice would say what's on her mind and offends her new friends, which isn't a good when your in a new world and don't know anyone.

Sure, her adventures--first in Wonderland, then in the world behind the Looking-Glass--will appeal to all children; the characters are whimsical and delightful, the dangers tantalizing (at least to young minds), and the endings ever-so-happy. Plus, there are kittens, butterflies, and talking goats...what child can resist talking goats, I ask you?But for those of us over the age of 8...we need something else. As for myself, I got lost in the brilliantly clever humor that was strewn throughout the tales; the wit is quick, and Carroll's enjoyment of wordplay is apparent on every page. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" contain some of the most memorable dialogue you will ever encounter. Buy this book for yourself, or for your child, or your friend, or whomever...anyone with a sense of humor and fantasy will delight in these two classic, unforgettable tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a very good book in my opinion. I feel that it is just like you are in a dream and the author does a very good job at writing the book so it seems like that. I think it is a good book because it really keeps you focused on what is happening because it is a complicated story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the book, especially in the beginning. I think that it is also a good book because the author, Lewis Carroll, includes things that you would never even think about until you read to book. I also like the book because it is very entertaining to understand how Alice (the main character) tries to deal with and interoperate all of the strange circumstances that happen in wonderland. All of the characters that are in the book are very strange and tell very bizarre stories. The stories have no point what so ever and it gets quite frustrating to Alice because she really wants to know what happens, but they just wont say it and go on and on. All of the events that happen in the book that need trial do not seem very savvy and are unjust and unfair which is quite interesting to read about because Alice gets accused of a lot of things and it is very gallant of her to stand up for herself. With all of the facts that I just stated, my conclusion is that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a very good book and I would recommend it to any readers that would like to know about a little girl and her bizarre and exciting adventures in wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in wonderland is a great story for all ages. it is full of adventure.

This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Oh, how I long for those days of innocence, when I could trust in all that I held dear and holy. When I thought a Transformers movie would be a great idea; when I truly believed that Buffy and Angel could be together someday; when I could rely on \\"Heroes\\" to be, oh, at least kinda interesting. And a big part of my naivet&eacute; had to do with the Disney Studio. See, as a youngster, they taught me that Snow White had an evil sorceress for a step-mother, that Cinderella had a fairy Godmother for a, uh, godmother, and that a young lady called Alice went to Wonderland in her dreams one day, and met there the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with whom she celebrated her un-birthday.Disney lied! About that last part, at any rate. Gasp!I can't quite understand why I never knew this, or why this never even occurred to me. I mean, I had read the fairy tale behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", so I knew that the whole Ariel-Prince Eric hook up was something of an artistic liberty. I'd read \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and a host of other stories about beauties whose princes someday came. And since they were all old, old tales, ripe for revision and, let's face it, not exactly offering endings to make you go \\"ahhh\\", it didn't occur to me to argue with the happy-ever-afters being assisted by singing mice and the occasional dancing cavalcade of cutlery.But for some reason, despite the voraciousness of my reading habits throughout what I like to pretend is a life, I didn't get around to reading the original, non-Golden Book version of Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" till I was well past the age where perhaps I should have. I've now read it several times, and all I can say is... cool.We all know the basic story (if not, as I have recently discovered, the entirety of it). Little blonde girl is dozing in a meadow with her cat Dinah when she sees a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit rush past exclaiming that he is late. She, naturally enough, follows the tardy bunny down a very, very deep whole, at the bottom of which she discovers a little door. Through that door is Wonderland, which she can only reach by shrinking herself with the assistance of convenient shrinking refreshments. And later, she gets larger again. Then there's this whole thing about a mystic caterpillar, a tea party, the Queen of Hearts, a croquet match using flamingos (animal rights activists, unite against Flamingo Croquet!) and a trial... and that's not even mentioning that enigmatic Cheshire Cat, who can materialize anywhere at will. What an elegantly contrived, wondrously chaotic, perfectly lovely story it is, too.The first thing I thought upon concluding it, however, was that I had accidentally bought the abridged version. So much Alice that I remembered seemed to be missing, and I knew my imagination wasn't good enough to have conjured up that stuff. But then I read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\", Alice's continued adventures, and it was all explained.Through the Looking-Glass finds our Alice being all other-worldly again, but instead of down a hole she goes through a mirror into a slightly askew locale in which the lion and the unicorn fight for the crown, Humpty Dumpty falls from his wall, and we hear of the Jabberwocky and the Walrus, cabbages and kings. There's also a giant, and inexplicable, chess game afoot. It's witty and suspenseful, surreal and yet actual, well-crafted melodrama blended perfectly with satire... so very entertaining.Ah! I exclaimed. I see! Those clever, sneaky fellows at Mouse Central had combined elements from the two books to create their little gem that they, regardless, called \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", even though Alice was clearly *through the looking-glass* when she, as for example, learned of un-birthdays.This got me to thinking. Does this mean that Disney has lied about other things, as well? Is there no Bambi, no Davy Crockett, no kids from Witch Mountain? What about Herbie, did he really go bananas, and did that guy turn into a shaggy dog, or were those shameless untruths as well? Sure, I knew they'd let the fact-checking go a little in their more recent endeavors, what with Pocahontas not having a talking willow in her circle of friends, Hercules not really being all that good of a guy, and there actually being a proper Princess in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" (who was emphatically not from New Orleans). But those cherished memories of my childhood I had held as sacred, and they are now tarnished forever.But that's okay. More than okay, really. It's a joy to discover that a story I had thought so familiar can be all shiny and new again. It was a revelation to dive into Carroll's simple, yet complex prose... even the academic-y footnotes are interesting here, as so many of Carroll's characters, metaphors and poems are parodies, references and allusions to persons living and dead. (Well, okay, mostly dead.) The in-jokes are more prevalent than in your average Supernatural episode. Dated it may be, but out-dated, never, and the fact that I can continue to discover the pleasures of this ostensibly child's tale at my advanced age actually makes me grateful for a childhood deprived of it.So, I guess, thanks for lying to me, Disney. I appreciate it. Really. Um... so... anything you want to tell me about \\"The Jungle Book\\"?[The review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine, Issue 2.]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I'm going to assume that we've all read and loved Alice's Adventures, and focus instead on reviewing this gorgeous edition. The design of this novel is exquisite. I ordered Alice as a test case - I desperately want to own the entire Coralie Bickford-Smith line for Penguin, but wanted to ensure the books are well made. From the outside, they're stunning. It feels good in my hands, the color is fantastic, and the graphics are so well-selected. My gripe is with the spine of the book, which is almost too tight - these aren't the most comfortable editions to read without cracking the spine.

The imagination used to create this story is genius, if you are going to see the movie than take the time to find out what made this classic story timeless."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a literary classic which has had a vast influence on many writers after Lewis Carroll's time. One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and its sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice's adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are unique escapes into one writer's dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll's creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel's classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice's adventures there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Of course the story is fun but I don't like the way the ebook is formatted and there's no Table of Contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a book that seems to stay with what Lewis Carroll wanted these books to be.

There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused.

Alice finds herself in world of cards, bottles or cakes of magical liquids that changes her size, and a vast array of dizzying characters. Alice plays a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts in her garden, all the while the Queen ordering her guards to chop off peoples heads. She also encounters a Mad Hatter at his teatime, which is all the time because he angered time once, so tea time is always for him! In Through the Looking Glass, Alice travels to a backwards world through her mirror in her living room, playing her way through the world in a chess game, meeting various characters in her quest to become a Queen. Here, is Lewis Carrols famous poem, Jabberwocky: \`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves' did gyre and gimble in the wabe:' All mimsy were the borogoves,' and the mome raths outgrabe.I found this book to be not what I expect. It was entertaining, exciting, but quite a bit confusing. Overall, I believe it would be better suited for free reading than a report for a class. A part I found especially confusing was in Alice in Wonderland when Alice visits the house of the Duchess and the Duchess sing to her baby, \\"Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he know it teases.\\" This part I found to be confusing, since beating of a baby is never allowed in any society, past or present.Many of the themes in Alice in Wonderland are told through poems or songs that the characters sing. Sometimes the message is hard to clearly express because of the way words are used and the long list of characters. I would recommend this book to adults more, because of the writing styles Carrol used, more because the book was written in 1872, but also some teenagers for a look at how developed the movie became for children but because some of the confusion is hard to determine, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am fonder of Through the Looking Glass than Alice in Wonderland, perhaps because of less exposure (e.g., Disney and other commercial venues). The drawings by Tenniel are brilliant and add the right flavor to the story. The book is well-written, surreal with bizarre, fascinating characters (whom a little girl has to figure out), unique situations, word play, puzzles and a mocking irreverent tone towards high society. Whenever as an adult I'd hit a snag and couldn't read, I would always pull out this one and it would put me back on track again. Another I will treasure for the memories of sharing it with my kid."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was an interest in my eyes. It took fantasy and brought it to life in my mind. Through my imagination, I was practically in the body of Alice, experiencing everything she did. Lewis Carroll is an excellent author, depicting excellent pictures, thoughts, and questions in the reader's mind. His style and technique of writing put amazing imagery and specific descriptions through my imagination. &quot;A found face, and large eyes like a frog, &quot; was an example of a piece of his work that depicts a good sense of imagery. The main idea of this story is for the main character, Alice, to find her way out of Wonderland. Some examples of some of the characters were: Queen of Hearts, Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Lewis Carroll uses descriptive words and phrases to describe the many different characters in this fiction book. In this book, Alice goes from being in the middle of the woods to a large hallway, into a big pool of water, to a house in which she grows larger, and finally she meets a weird looking caterpillar resting upon a mushroom. She adventured from place to place, seeking help from many different creatures. Lewis Carroll has a very unique way of describing different events and is also very creative while doing so. For example, when Alice was playing a relaxing game with the Queen of Hearts, the author describes the ball as a hedgehog, and the stick as a skinny, pink flamingo, which puts a very creative picture in the reader's mind. In the process of this story, Alice drinks and eats things, even though she doesn't know what she was ingesting, she did it anyway. Every event in which happened, went with the pattern of the events in the story. Every event was important and was needed to make sense out of the wild story. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll uses his imagination to create a story full of memorable and fantastic events, used to put a smile on the reader's face and a strong grip on the reader's hand. Overall, I would recommend this book to readers 13 and older. This book will put a sparkle in the reader's eye, and a mind full of memories for a lifetime to remember. So if you have a chance, pick up the book and start an adventurous fantasy through Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I just read this book for an Honors English class, and I got exactly what I expected. Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style;it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character was great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face,and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anyting that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes has sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesistate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventuruous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different.I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I read the book, \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" This is a very good book to read but it can also get very confusing if you don't read it thoroughly. The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up.

PEACE"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I first read of Alice and her adventures when most of us did -- too long ago to mention. And I have re-read it at least once a year since.I'm not interested in why it was written or what deep, dark psychological quirks of the author underlie its imagery. It's enough that, from the time I fall down that curious rabbit hole, swim through the sea of tears, dance the lobster quadrille (Can you walk a little faster?), I seem to be retracing every step of my life. Every one of Alice's adventures has its echo in the real world, and they aren't hard to match.So, my much-worn copy sits comfortably on the shelf nearest to hand, and my grandchildren-to-be can expect to find a copy of their own in their very first Christmas stockings. And, hopefully, we, too, will one day &quot;talk of many things -- of ships, and shoes, and sealing wax; of cabbages and kings,&quot; just as I did with their parents when I first recited for them the dire warning &quot;Beware the jabberwok, my son!&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Don't buy the Kindle edition hoping to see the wonderful illustrations described in the product information.

Well done. Illustrated. I would recommend this product to any fan of Alice in Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is arguably the greatest of all childrens' books, and one of the classics of world- literature. There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Do you want to get away from the hassles of reality, the stresses of everyday life? Then Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the book for you. After reading it, I found that it can be entertaining for a reader of any age. Children can enjoy an outrageous character in the story, such as the Cheshire Cat. Kids like the sly, disappearing cat with the everlasting smile because he's unusual. Adults can also enjoy the story by examining the meaning of the seemingly shallow plot, a girl lost in a dreamworld, a wonderland. I myself enjoyed the book because it gave me a break from reality. It made me feel like all that I needed was to enter into a wonderland of my own. Is this &quot;wonderland&quot; really safe for kids though? Some people question whether this story is appropriate for children because of the unusual characters, but what is the real meaning? Is the Mad Hatter, with his neverending tea party and his bumbling speech, a portrayal of the mentally unstable? Is the Catapillar sitting on top of a magical mushroom, blowing smoke through a hookah, an emblem for drugs? Children would not see these things in the story, or would they? I think children could enjoy the story for its simplicity, not for hidden meanings. How can the story be taken further though? Adults should be asking questions about the book. For example, when first read, the plot seems simple, a young girl falls asleep and in her dream she tumbles down a rabbit hole into a backwards world where she grows to her liking, watches cats disappear into thin air, and gets crazy advice from a catapillar on a magic mushroom. One second Alice is reading with her sister and the next second sne is floating down a rabbit hole. Adults can examine twists like this and wonder what it means for the entire storyline. Does it foreshadow events to come? Older people would be more likely to think about the storyline and can have more fun trying to find hidden meanings. So this story is very appropriate for adults. The reason why I enjoyed the story was the break from reality. Obviously the story of Alice and her adventures is fantasy, but when I read it, it makes me feel like I can take a break from the world. This is because the characters and plot are so unreal, that they make me feel unreal, too. So this story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be simple for children, complex for adults, and is a break from life for me. Overall, it is a very satisfying story. Are you willing to go tumbling down the rabbit hole?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Everyone has been rating this book as a children's book... It was written by an astute mathmatics doctorate Oxford professor. It is a fantastic book for adults to understand the mind of a child."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glassis a FAIR choice - 3 stars. This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland HTML Editionis a POOR CHOICE - 2 stars. 5 stars is for the original book. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I love Alice in Wonderland. I've been reading it since I was a small child, hence I can honestly say that whoever retyped this for the Kindle did a shoddy (my peers would say \\"half-assed\\") job. Oh, it's readable, don't get me wrong. But if we'd bought this as a paperback, there would be an outcry, so why not shout out one for the eBook crowd? Shame on you!There are tons of typos. The quotation marks are in that cheap ASCII nearly-sideways type that makes you blink more than once until your eyes adjust. Italicized words jumped between actual italics to underscores before italicized words (e.g., I will prosecute _you_). John Tenniel's illustrations are non-existent (oh, the horror!!). But my biggest complaint, though, is the presentation of the poetry. In fully-justified, unpunctuated paragraphs. Are you serious, Kindle publishers?!?I got my first taste of things to come with \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" (Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house...), usually written in a fun, swirly format with decreasing font size. (You can see the original at [...]). I realize this would have been difficult to redo in the Kindle format, especially when the user is given the option to make the font bigger or smaller at will. But at least put it in stanza format! I tried to reproduce the result of the attempt, but Amazon's comment box reformats everything, so I'll try to demonstrate:Fury (huge gap) said (huge gap) to a mouse That he(huge gap) met (huge gap) in the (huge gap)house Let us bothgo to (huge gap) law, I will (huge gap) prosecute you.It's the worst example of full-justification allowable - the humongous gaps between words, no punctuation, three or four words per line...and so forth. Making the text bigger or smaller made it worse.The rest of the poetry is in plain old paragraph format, with punctuation thrown in haphazardly or missing altogether. In \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" consider the presentation of \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\\"The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.\\"The time has come,\\" the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings--And why the sea is boiling hot--And whether pigs have wings.Readers might find this a little thing, but I'm sorry, this just bothered the hell out of me.I guess I should have expected it. I only paid 99 cents for this version, and you get what you pay for. And for God's sake, don't fall for the \\"free full versions\\" out there that were typed by \\"scholars\\" and available on the web for nothing - they're worse yet! So I give this 3 stars - a wonderful story brought low by lazy copy-editing.Honestly, publishers, if you're going to redo a classic for the Kindle: (1) Include the original artwork, (2) format it correctly so it resembles the original hard copy as much as possible, and (3) spell-check it, for crying out loud. Don't make Kindle owners wonder what other crap is in store that will make us sorry we bought the thing and just reach for our old paperbacks instead."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"After more than a century, young Alice's adventures in Wonderland are still fun. True, there are a good many dated notions and difficult puns. But, even so, my six year old and I had good fun with the tale. That said, I think our success with the book depends a good deal on the edition we choose. By luck we stumbled upon Peter Weevers' illustrated version (Alices Adventures In Wonderland). Sadly it's out of print. Such marvelous pictures! Mr. Weevers really brought Wonderland to life for us.By contrast, most editions contain JOHN TENNIEL's classic/original drawings. Frankly, I think they're a bit dated and dreary. Purists will certainly adhere to them, but other illustrators have done far better. My suggestion is that you search for Alice and find one with another illustrator! One option is the unique artwork of Alison Jay (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). Not to everyone's taste, but more alive and child-friendly than Tenniel. Another option is the Cooper Edens' edition (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition). A new edition that looks quite promising is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Alice Through the Looking-glass: Walker Illustrated Classics.In another episode, my first experience with Alice was a very bad one. I made the mistake of buying an annotated version. I'm not sure which one. Perhaps:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition. I got so completely tripped up, looking up 19th century references to English politics and what not. I'm sure that aficionados can appreciate Carroll's deeper humor, but for most of us this is just a kids' tale. Don't buy an annotated version unless you're already hooked on Alice.All things considered, here is my advice. DO buy the original Lewis Carroll text (unabridged, not rewritten). It's lively and fun. Especially if you are reading to a young one: DO NOT buy a Tenniel illustrated edition. Try to find a used copy of Weevers' version or take a chance on the an Oxenbury edition, such asAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. And lastly DO read Alice. Her travels through Wonderland are still lots of fun."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My son stayed at home \\"sick\\" and I said he couldn't watch TV or play computer but he could listen to this audio book.

The books are elegantly presented: Alice with a gold color cover and gold gilt edges on all three sides, Looking-Glass with a silver cover and silver gilt edges on all three sides, and the box being in gold color and looking almost identical to the Alice volume. The books are printed on fairly thin, very smooth, and somewhat off-white paper -- the color of which I personally find detracts a little from the books. The books are identical in layout, typeface and illustrations to the original 1865 &amp; 1872 Macmillan editions: the type has been reset and is thus perfectly crisp, the typeface (De Vinne) is a perfect match to the original typeface except the quote marks are a bit more spaced out than is usual. The text is otherwise a perfect match, with line breaks in identical places, etc. The speciality of these Books of Wonder editions is that the illustrations have been printed from the original woodblocks which had been sitting forgotten in a bank vault for many years. The books claim that &quot;details never seen before are now visible&quot;, but I haven't been able to see evidence of this myself: the illustrations _are_ considerably cleaner and crisper, but I've not seen any extra details. On the down side, a number of the woodblocks had editing done on them when they were made, and over time these edited portions have clearly shrunk or no longer fit perfectly into the surrounding wood, so that the editing is much more clearly visible than on facsimiles of editions from 100 years ago. A nice pair of books, but I personally find the Macmillan facsimile editions to be much nicer to handle."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Although the pictures are great I'm sure, I'd like to warn those searching for a copy with pictures not to get a paperback copy.

I bought this for my son after the electronic version we got skipped all the photo plates. This has them, just as you probably remember them - Humpty Dumpty, the Jabberwoky, the Queens and Kings, and of course Alice herself. The big pictures are big enough for a child to sit poring over for several minutes, and quite a few small pictures sprinkled about to keep interest high. I remember having my own quite similar book as a kid and bought this for my (at the time) five year old son.Contains both 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' in one volume.

The book allows the reader to enter into Alice's mind and travel along with her through the worderful and mysterious Wonderland. Alice is a curious and questioning little girl traversing a land where nonsense is the common-sense, where right is wrong and where wrong is not always right (but can be sometimes!). This causes a surprise in every page you turn. The characters Alice meets usually produce the most unexpected replies which always leave Alice and the reader in a troubled state-of-mind. However amazing it can be, we are sometimes a little puzzled by noticing there is some logic in the nonsense world of Wonderland and I personally think this is the true beauty of the book. Moreover, all this is presented by the most unusual characters in a rich text, often mixing prose and verse and sometimes toying with typography in a e. e. cummings-like nature, which makes the book quite unique."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice in wonderland starts when Alice finds a white rabbit. Alice follows the rabbit down a hole with millions of cupboards. Alice struggles with her size and finds her self talking to mice and birds.

When Alice wakes up from her nap she takes Dinahs kitten through the looking glass into Looking Glass World where everything is backwards.

I can't tell if the entertainment came from familiarity or not - so much of Alice is simply part of cultural memory that I knew it without ever having read the book. It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought. It may be that Through the Looking Glass was a better dream narrative (it certainly seemed a good example of the kind of play young children engage in), but I still had a hard time reading it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have an avid young reader in my family and it is not always easy to guess what kind of book she may enjoy.

Originally published under the titles Alice's Adventures Underground and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, these books were the work of an Oxford mathematician named Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, using the pen-name of Lewis Carroll. According to Charles H. Sylvester (editor of Journeys through Bookland): \\"One day . . . he took three of his little friends, Alice and Edith and Lorina Liddell, for a trip up the river, and on that afternoon he began telling them about Alice and her Wonderland, continuing the story on other occasions. He had no intention of making a book, but the story pleased little Alice and her sisters so well that they talked about it at home and among their grown-up friends, who finally persuaded the author to have it printed.\\" Note: Songs are composed by Field, although the opening poem \\"All in the Golden Afternoon\\" is missing from this recording.

This latest version is ok, and it's brand new but not what I was expecting, what I was expecting was there there would be the usual 19th drawings of Alice, the rabbit, and all the other characters would be there, but unfortunately there are no drawings. It's sadly missing a good part of the charm of the other editions I read and have owned. I currently have a lovely complete works of Lewis Carroll leather bound which includes Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking Glass, with the original drawings which I've had in every edition I've ever had including other paperback versions, but sadly not this one, if I'd realized that this one was missing such an essential ingredient as the drawings, I wouldn't have bought this particular edition. I bought it with the assumption that it had the usual charming Victorian drawings that every other edition hardback or paperback has it, but as my other copies of Alice have disappeared, and the leather bound edition is too frail to sit down and read, I'll make do with this one, but I'm not happy with it.I think may well send it back, and get another with the drawings."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I thought Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was what the Disney movie was based on, and Through the Looking Glass was another adventure she had. But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again. I am glad to have read them, though, as Alice's tale is a classic one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have been reading some chapter books with my preschooler and she has really enjoyed it. I thought I would try this one since she was interested after meeting Alice at Disney. She loves the pictures and the book is very nice, but it is a little hard for her to follow at this age. I think we will put it away and try it again in a few years, when she can get more of the humor in Alice's dialogue with herself and understand the characters a little better."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's adventures in wonderland. Alice was getting tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, when the White rabbit with pink eye's runs by saying \\"Oh Dear! Oh Dear! I shall be too late\\" and as most know Alice follows him down the rabbit hole and curious adventure ensues.The story was ok but obviously geared towards children. I have always heard about all the underlying and hidden things within the story but I guess I am a surface reader. Either that or all of the underlying things were topical and with the book being written in the late 1800's most of those things would have been lost on me.The Good: It was an easy read the characters were quite unusual and Carroll definitely had an imagination.The Bad: besides my thinking it was going to be better than it was not much. It was somewhat confusing at times.Overall it was an Ok read however with all the hype and rumored greatness surrounding the story I was slightly disappointed.Through the looking Glass. The less known second story about Alice is which she enters a looking glass (Mirror) world where you must move in the opposite direction to get where you desire to go. The world is divided into a grid like a checkers or chess board with the ultimate goal is to make it to opposite side of the board and to become a queen.The Good: Same as the first, lots of imagination and unique characters.The Bad: not too much, like the firs it was a little confusing at times.It was Similar to the first with regard of craziness and characters however slightly inferior to the first."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure. I also appreciated the linking of the cat at the beginning and end of the story.It does still feel like Carroll did way too many opium pipes in his time.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none. Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there. It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens. The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable. I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny. I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better. I'm sorry. I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it. I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained. It did make me appreciate the job Disney did in adapting it to a movie however. I believe he (Disney) captured the images perfectly."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"One of the best books in the world!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I had to read this book for a classic book report. My teacher said it would be a great one to read. If it wasn't so confusing, it would be a great book for younger children. I really didn't enjoy it though, because the lot seemed a little too young for me. Anyone over the age of twelve, might not be interested in it. Don't get me wrong, Because it did have some exciting parts in it though, like when Alice first entered the wonderland. Everything was like a fairy tale with talking rabbits and shrinking/growing juice. Alice would walk into a room, drink the juice, and if she was small, she'd grow into a giant, and if she was a giant, she'd shrink. It gets pretty confusing. On her adventure, she walks through a series of rooms and can't find her way out. Will she ever make it out? Read the boook to find out."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was required reading for one of my present classes, if this had not been the case, I'm certain I would not have finished it for the sake of enjoyment. I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read and in my opinion, the Disney movie does not do justice to it. The Mad Hatter and March Hare are a great duo, as always.

They were a wonderful way to explore where imagination could take you. I highly recommend these to anyone!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice's Advenures in Wonderland was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I could read it many more times because the author paints a vivid picture in your mind that places you in Wonderland along with all of the delightful characters including Alice. The description in the book starts out strong and ends up even stronger. The author's ability to describe both the characters and the setting is amazing.I could just imagine being at the tea party with Alice or pondering whether or not i should drink out of the little bottle labeled drink me. The book takes place with Alice being bored out of her mind which most kids can relate to. Then, her curiosity about a little white rabbit with a pocket watch gets her in trouble when she ends up in a whole other world of queens, kings, talking animals and insane people.All of the characters are interesting and humorous, but often make you frustrated along with Alice because of their crazy antics and utter annoyance. This book is a classic that everyone should read at one point in their life whether they are young or old. This is a story that will surely be remembered . It beats the Disney movie by far. (The movie leaves out alot of the best parts.)I suggest you pick up a copy. It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a classic that all young spirited people should read. It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here. I am mad, You are mad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"One gets very bored for something good to read. This book is certainly not just for children and better than the bible."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was a creative trip into the world of dreams. Lewis Carroll is most famous as an author, particularly for writing Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also a mathematician, Angelical deacon, and photographer. Carroll originally created the story for Alice Liddell, a child he befriended while he was a deacon at a local church. She loved the tale and asked him to write the story down on paper. At first he hesitated. Two years later, Carroll agreed, and the classic story was born. Carroll's main goal for writing the book was to get children interested in reading.Lewis Carroll was actually a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His work was mostly considered to be literary nonsense, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic example. Many people, ranging in all ages, have enjoyed Carroll's fantasy and word play writings. Carroll's way of writing has influenced many authors all over the world.Although Carroll's writings are very creative and imaginative, Carroll wrote a book with too many hidden meanings in it. For instance, the references to drug use are too prevalent. The first run-in Alice has with drugs is with the caterpillar. She stumbles across him sitting on a mushroom. He is smoking hookah and blowing rings of smoke toward Alice. Shortly after Alice leaves the caterpillar, she meets the Mad Hatter. He was a hatter, which means that he would inhale some of the mercury fumes that were used to cure felt in some of his hats. Mercury poisoning results in brain damage and confused speech. The last drug reference occurs when Alice eats and drinks the substances that make her grow or shrink. Alice did not know what she was consuming. She ate and drank it anyway and she ended up growing or shrinking. Carroll intended that children read the book. He might have sent the wrong messages. Children might think that Alice has fun eating and drinking mysterious substances and they would too. Also, Carroll actually wrote a very complicated book that most young children probably could not understand. He used a lot of literary techniques like reversals, puns, and mirror writings. These could easily be overlooked and misunderstood by children.Lewis Carroll tried to write the book from Alice Liddell's point of view to make reading enjoyable for children. He wanted to prove that children could have thoughts that were as complicated as or more complicated than adults. If the reader will not try to dissect the meaning of each word and wants to feel like a child again, then this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him. I always saw the movies but this was the first I actually read the book. I thought it quite better than any of the movies.

The characters created be Lewis Carroll are fantastic, you can see people of all shapes and sizes. You can see many people such as the King and Queen of Hearts and the Duchess, but mostly you see many creatures roaming around. There is the white rabbit who wears a waist coat, or the caterpillar who sits on a mushroom, or the beloved Cheshire Cat: a cat who causes mischief wherever he goes, he also has the talent of dissapearing and reapearing.

It can be read and enjoyed by all ages, but I think the subtleties can be best enjoyed by those who are a bit older e.g. the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, the croquet game featuring the Queen of Hearts etc. I was reminded of how much the tea party reminded me of a previous job that I had involving a variety of board members.I guess there is only only one word to describe this classic, 'timeless'."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"THIS IS A BOOK WICH ONE SHOULD ANALYSE FOR ONESELF!And NO, one cannot overanalyse this book, the symbols in it are like the branches of a tree.

The pastry or the liquids as clusters of thought wich will transform ones shape in nonphysical reality. Have you ever encountered someone who was very short or small in appearant reality yet he/she displayed a posture of magnificent greatness? Well, it is not a wild argument to state that he/she took a bite of the cookie or a zip of the magick potion....Another thing very important are the playing cards. The metaphor as life as a game, yourself batteling a whole armada of playing cards spades, hearts and diamonds alike!Then there is the eloquent buffoonery one engages upon in the teaparty of life (remember the rabbit and the hatsalesman?). This reminded me very much of the people one encounters in everyday life who seem to not be able to think clearly, to be out of syntax with the axioms of logic. These people will resort to various kinds of practices like palmistry or speaking with angels, they have postulated their delusions into actuallity.But of course, to transcend beyond this and to show you a way out one has to engage upon our magickal cat (but usually one will just bumb into him at the least expected moment).

Alice wanted to hear a story with lots of nonesense, and that's what Carroll did. If you still do not get it, I can't put it any more clearly.

When I was a child, I watched the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed it. I've watched it again recently and find it very strange. I came across the book, &quot;Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; in an old library at my Grandparent's house. This was an old English version, which may have made it more difficult to read and comprehend then if it was in common dialect. The first story, Alice in Wonderland, is the better of the two. It tells of a dreamland that a seven-year old Alice is visiting. This book jumps around a lot, and it is difficult to keep track of who's who by the end. The second story, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was worse then the first one. It is once again in a dreamland of a world seen backwards from Alice's own world in the reflection of a mirror. When Alice enters this world, there are about two chapters before they enter the difficult analagy of telling the story through a game of chess. This is extremely hard to follow, seeing as you have to visualize the chessboard in your mind. Each seperate story takes place on a different tile while Alice is a pawn waiting to be Queened. In the end of the story, she is Queened and has tea with the other two queens, that is, the white and red queens. The dissapointing conclusion was that Alice was really in her world the whole time and her kittens were the queens in the story.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth. The fairytale like mood in the story gives a sense of fantasy, adventure as she meets and encounters many creatures of the dreamland world. She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me.

I know it is considered a classic but I just do not see it, and if I did not have to read it for school I would not have bothered to finish it.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)Through the Looking GlassThough this book is not much better than Alice's Adventures, the chess motif and theme does make the book much more interesting. With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure. I also appreciated the linking of the cat at the beginning and end of the story.It does still feel like Carroll did way too many opium pipes in his time.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am sure this book must be beautiful but I never received it from this seller.

I've seen the cartoon as a kid and wanted to read the original book to see what made it so special. Now I know that its not special. Its a lot of nonsense, thats a little creative, but nothing that really takes you away from reality. A lot of the characters are unique, but only appear for a brief period and aren't fully developed (or even partialy).Usually I'm a bad critic because its easy for me to enjoy anything, but I've had a tough time getting through this one, I dont even think its a good childrens book, they'll say the same thing I do.

Maybe when she is finished she will let me read it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an extraordinary book that mixes the world of imagination and the world of reality. It is a perfect example of a story written a very popular theme. It explains that in the mind of a child things are not always as they seem. Alice (the main character) is a curious youngster who follows a white rabbit, in a waist-coat, down a rabbit hole. Alice finds herself in a strange new world where nothing is what it seems. Small cakes and unmarked bottles cause her to grow to be three stories tall and pieces of mushrooms make her shrink to the height of a playing card. As the story progresses, Alice encounters many interesting characters including a very demanding queen who sentences everyone to be beheaded before the end of a crazy croquet game. The author, Lewis Carroll, used poetry and rhythm to add to the already whimsical and mysterious atmosphere. He created individuals with exaggerated character traits, so the reader can easily picture them. For example the Cheshire cat with his giant grin and disappearing body. Carroll also included illustrations of the important scenes of the story, so the reader would be able to understand them better. This story perfectly explains the racing imagination of a child in a light-hearted and imaginative way."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The pink flamingos are adorable, which makes it all the more disappointing when they start rubbing off from the second you remove the price sticker."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews.Alice is an inquisitive, and very brave girl, who observes the world around her, and attempts to understand what is happening and how to handle it.

That said, I am a huge sci-fi and fantasy fan and certainly don't have a lack of imagination, even at 27. Just a couple of years ago I re-read all of the Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed them just as much as--if not more than--I enjoyed them as a child.All of that said, yes, Carroll did a wonderful job portraying the messiness, strangeness, and scenery switches of a dream. But as a whole...his works barely rate a 3 on a one to five scale. In fact...I'd probably go with a 2.5 at best. Although some of his Victorian satire was certainly amusing, I feel as if these books were mostly nonsense and simply didn't contain the literary merit to render it a classic with the likes of, for example, Hans Christian Anderson, J.M.

There's a reason why these stories are considered classics.

A smoking caterpillar and a disappearing cat may be absurd, but they're really imaginative. And I do believe that \\"Wonderland\\" and \\"Looking-Glass\\" are open to interpretation, since the word play and the riddles found here are too silly to be scientific.I don't mind Hugh Haughton's annotated texts, as long as just enjoy reading these two children's tales peacefully.A"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a complex book disguised as a childrens book.

It's not cleverness - its just randomness disquised as cleverness. It just tosses a bunch of nothing together, shakes it up, mixes in a curious and rude little girl who's rudeness pales next to the characters she encounters in Wonderland. Those thousand monkeys at typewriters would produce something along these lines before getting to Shakespeare. For some reason, I never read this when I was discovering Narnia or Oz. Ormondroyd's \\"David & the Phoenix\\" has the spirit I expected to encounter in Caroll's book. Instead - this book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And perhaps that is the nonsense that some find pleasing. For me it was simply distracting. The whole idea of the world's we create ourselves is a notion I have always been drawn to. Wonderland isn't even a world much less a persuasive daydream. Nothing there matters. And Alice just skips off at the end, leaving her sister to forecast a bit of standard drivel about the day when they will be grownups but always have their childhood inside.

Then I realized the movie makers had indeed 'Hollywoodized'-- that enchanting story -- making it violent and very Harry Potterish in its 'dragon chases' Of course the British actors were superb, as well as the American, but what a corruption of its dreamy innocence with such nightmareish malevolence!

The original book was an immediate classic success for people young and old to read.Carroll's sense of absurdity in his humour and his amazing gift for games of logic and language have made this book an enduring dream legacy of what is possible to happen in a persons mind. This is a story about Alice and growing up and what is lost for her in doing so. Alice dreams of a world where she doesn't belong to and where what is true in her real life isn't necessarily true anymore. The story begins when Alice follows the frantically delayed white rabbit down a black hole into the magical world of wonderland, where she meets a variety of some bizarre creatures some mythical creatures and some downright illogically wrong creatures. There is no linear path to life in wonderland where one event will lead seamlessly to another adding meaningful experience upon experience, instead life for her is made up of series of oftentimes unrelated events, by conversations you never fully understand while others you can't reason with at all in a completely upside down unpredictable world,that is always ever changing. Carroll's way with words has stood the test of time. His use of characters such as the mad hatter and the jabberwocky all have added to the simplistic colorful nature of his story in its a true grandeaur of a masterpiece that will live on for generations to come for readers reading it. Characters that keep you wondering for days on what they exactly are ? Do they belong in our world truly or are they a instead a collection of mixed creatures that are taken from mythological creatures of times a gone by who knows? If you haven't read this book yet then pick it up and read it no matter how young or old you are in age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"WOW!!! never read this book as a kid or even seen the movie, but as an adult i absolutely loved it. So much going on its hard to keep up, but it does a great job at keeping one's attention. Both stories were great, but i liked the original one a little better than the sequel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I first read theAlice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Signet Classics)books as a child, armed with my own library card. Throughout that experience, I was simply delighted by the wonderfully colorful illustrations and the fanciful tales. There was no issue of digging for deeper implications, puns, or wordplay. I still recall my fascination with the nonsensical creatures, as well as with Alice's adventurous dreamland.As an adult, one can choose to delight in the obvious fantasy adventures or search for hidden meanings. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise in which I foray into a reading challenge that will encompass these books and others that can be considered \\"retellings and sequels\\" or \\"literature with allusions and influences,\\" I am choosing to simply enjoy revisiting a childhood treasure.In any case, the most important aspects of these books are the creatively developed characters, especially the portrayal of Alice as a curious child who is obviously intelligent with layers of common-sense and creativity. Just following the characters in their upside-down or backwards adventures can be enough to intrigue the reader. All the reader must do is suspend disbelief for the purpose of the reading experience, which is not such a departure from many reading or movie-going encounters.I plan to reserve my searching for hidden meanings for the other books that I will be exploring in the upcoming weeks.This book is obviously a classic that has stood up to the test of time--it should be no surprise that I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is very much worth reading for anyone who would like to know the story before some ells changed it around.

My son tells me he listens in to the reading quite often so it is a hit all around."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Mervyn Peake (1911-1968) was one of the most original and wildly talented English artists of the last century. Known best both in his lifetime and even more afterwards for his three GORMENGHAST novels (TITUS GROAN, GORMENGHAST, and TITUS ALONE), he was equally adept as a poet and as an illustrator and painter. He illustrated many of his own works as well as those of contemporaries such as Quentin Crisp, and on occasion provided new illustrations for classics from the past, such as this wonderful edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, first published in a rare and obscure edition in 1946 but republished many times since and still readily available.My copy is the Shocken (USA) hardcover edition from 1979, and I can recommend it strongly to anyone interested in a decent copy of the work but not necessarily prepared to look for an earlier edition. The binding is nice, the paper acid-free, the illustrations well reproduced. Peake is closer in style at first glance to Tenniel than most other 20th century artists who have interpreted the work; his finely detailed pen-and-ink work and heavy crosshatching bear the hallmarks of the classically trained illustrator in line with the earlier Victorian draughstmen who set the stage for much children's book illustration in England for a century or more. But there is a weirdness and grotesquerie - a creepiness - to this artist's work that is much more unnerving than Tenniel's and that, in my opinion, does a better job of reflecting the genuinely disturbing elements in the text, the madness and terrors that lie on the edges of the story in such violent characters as the Queen of Hearts and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There are also pictures that edge close to a surrealism that Carroll was approaching, but that Tenniel I think didn't really understand.A magical interpretation then, and one that any collector of either artist or editions of the work (I am both) should make a top priority."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"In my retirement, I've taken up creative writing and enjoy it very much. In the last five years, I've written over 150 short stories. Had a few published and others read on our local PBS station. The teacher suggested we read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a good example of imaginative story writing. I don't remember reading it as a child, and it was fun delving into Lewis Carroll's mind as he dreamt this up for Alice, his young friend. The introduction to the book, about Carroll, did a good job of setting the story up as well as provide biographical information about the author."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Is it a children's story or a primer on logic or even a work of wit and wisdom?Maybe it's all three.Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass make up the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll. And in these books, Carroll paints a strange world in which logic has a strange way about it, mostly consisting of folk who interpret things quite literally.This, being a classic of children's literature, has been mimicked by many, and by many, unsuccessfully. Though, I will admit that many adaptations of this work have been made satisfactorily.The first book takes Alice down a rabbit hole and into wonderland. There, she meets all sorts of strange characters and discovers the queen of hearts, as well as other card-themed characters. The queen, it seems, is obsessed with displacing people's heads, and Alice must take every precaution to not upset her majesty.The second book takes Alice through a looking glass into a chess-themed world. Here the cruel magnate is the red queen. Alice learns many new poems and logical quirks before returning back through the looking glass.This book is sure to be enjoyed by bright children as well as adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have always loved the classic Disney movie of Alice in Wonderland.

The story is amazingly childish and crude and the worthwhile parts are very distinct and separate from the rest of the lackluster story. Still, the wordplay is ingenious and the book is an all around treat."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Believe it or not, there was a time when the world was seen as a place where imagination had no place. It was during the industrial age of the 1800s and the mechanic way of life was in. As such, art and fantasy were seen by a lot of people in England as ridiculous, nonsensical, and tolerable at best. But Lewis Carroll didn't think so. There are always a few people who won't give up common sense for the sake of public opinion. Writing for a little girl named Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll told of the adventures of another girl named Alice who, after a tumble down a very strange rabbit hole, found herself in a place where fantasy and nonsense reigned supreme. Countering the status quo of the era in England, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" bursts with eccentric characters and unsuspecting twists and turns. A good read if you're tired of the machinization of any age and need to have some good old fashion unpredicatable fun!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I must confess I had never read the account of Alice's adventures before. As an adult, though, I found the two books to be quite charming and fun to read. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is the much more enjoyable tale of the two, perhaps because so much of it was already familiar to me as a part of popular culture. Through the Looking Glass seemed to me to be much more contrived and less magical. I found myself trying to puzzle out hidden messages and motifs in the latter work, while I basically just read the Wonderland story for pure enjoyment. The latter tale also seemed to fall apart at the seams as it began to approach its conclusion. Without rereading the books, I have trouble seeing all of the complex and satirical things mentioned by academic types (such as a critique of Victorian society and contemporary educational methods), nor does the whole chess game motif make complete sense to me, although the workings of the game apparently pleased the mathematician in Carroll's alter-ego enough that he attempts to explain it at the start of Through the Looking Glass.It was a treat to see the original illustrations of John Tenniel interspersed throughout both stories, despite the fact that Alice appears a good bit more sullen than I envision her in my own mind. It was also good to be formally introduced to such well-known entities as the Cheshire Cat, although Humpty Dumpty certainly comes across as a rather taciturn figure. For those of you who love puns, Lewis Carroll offers you a gold mine of them, although I doubt that many children will actually understand very many of them until they reach an age in which they will probably reject a reading of Carroll as \\"baby stuff.\\" I'm no expert on children's literature (or on children, for that matter), but the story of Alice's adventures would seem to offer a free ticket to an enticing fantasy world for youngsters and a delightfully quaint vacation spot for adult readers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. I already have \\"Alice\\", and for free. This edition claims Looking Glass in its title, but only includes Alice. Do not be fooled.

Another reviewer noted this as well. I don't know why this edition has sold so well and garnered such positive reviews when there is an obvious error. I purchased it after reading that review and thinking he must be mistaken, but he is right, it is there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I don't think we will ever again see anything quite like the two Alice stories. They are both unalterable masterpieces.As beautiful as the Disney movie is, the two books have so much more. More off-the-wall characters, more extremely witty dialogue, and more imaginative scenarios to ponder, these books go above and beyond any creative work I have ever seen.Carroll's works have changed my life more than any self-help book ever could. Through them I can ponder about so much more than only the things I can see. I am able to look inside of my imagination, and be unafraid to push its limits.I was around 20 years old when I read the Alice books for the first time. They seem a bit complex for children's books. I believe Carroll intended the books to be for an 8 year old child, and to be honest, I'd be impressed if I saw someone that age reading this material. The vocabulary and sentence structure involved looks more suited to someone the age of 12 I believe, but perhaps children know more than I am aware of.Also, Pig and Pepper (one of my favorite chapters), has a scene that's quite disturbing. I don't know if a first time novelist in this day and age could get away with including such content in a children's title. It's nice to take a look at though, since the chapter contains the very first appearance of the Cheshire Cat. I personally like the sheep from the Wool and Water chapter of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a little bit better than the Cheshire Cat, so try looking into that chapter also if you can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This has to be two of my favorite books of all time. Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before. This is the sign of marvelous talent and proves that he is one of the best authors and story tellers ever."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book ''Alice in Wonderland Through The Looking Glass'' was an interesting book. I liked the book because it had neat words to learn and also the pictures were very well in illustration. My favorite part in the book was when she met the catipillar. That was my favorite part because he was so calm the way that the author wrote, and he also described the catipillar's actions very well. The ending was nice because it was just good to know she got what she wanted. This book is good and confusing but it is worth while."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I loved Alice in Wonderland growing up. It was one of my favorite books. Recently with Tim Burton's interpretation, my nine year old has become obsessed. We read this together and it really helped her to understand some things that went completely over her head in the movie and now she actually prefers the book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The product came to us in perfect condition. We received it sooner than expected. I would buy from this vendor again! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that. Rather this is a comment on the Kindle file. I was specifically looking for a version that included the illustrations, and as this version listed John Tenniel under author information I hoped these would be included... they aren't. It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book. It does not have a table of contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"There is one thing that all potential customers must keep in mind when buying any Alice book: Do not purchase one that does not include the illustrations of John Tenniel!

Tenniel's illustrations help add to the childish excitement of Carroll's stories and will be especially invaluable to teenagers and adults, having just by nature of growing up lost some of the imaginative innocence, that ability to stretch reality, that we all possessed as kids.Of course, the illustrations wouldn't mean jack if they didn't have a captivating story to work with. Carroll's amusing tale of nonsense is targeted as a kid's book, and that is always where many of our fondest memories of it will remain, but as a college student reading it I was amazed by its power to suspend reality and return me to a level of imagination that I had simply thought I lost somewhere along the way. The trip down the rabbit hole can be quite a different experience from a different point of view.This particular edition also includes a good introduction and very helpful explanatory notes organized chapter by chapter. The introduction and notes offer insights to Carroll's life and his relations with the real life Alice and her family that, from a student viewpoint, reveal an interesting and more personal side of the Alice tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This threadbare bargain-priced edition may seem like a deal, but consider before purchasing that it has no table of contents, no introduction, no forward, no illustrations, and no bibliography. Adding insult to injury, the layout of this edition is easily one the worst ever for a reprint, with all words that originally appeared in italics for emphasis printed here in big block caps, as if the typesetting was done by an abrasive kid trying to get attention in an on line chat...IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN.If you really want to explore and experience Lewis Carroll's classic, getThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition-- for the price on Amazon, it's the real bargain. I also highly recommendAlice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland. Both of these books are a must for serious Alice fans as well as those just getting into Carroll's classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I first read this book when I was eleven because I thought that I might be missing out on something if I didn't. I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland kind of boring but still good. Then I read Through the Looking Glass, and I loved it! I memorized all of the poems (jabberwocky being my favorite poem in the world), read it about a million times, and recomended it to people. Between Tweedledum and Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty and all the reat of them, I had a lot of pleasant laughs and thoughts and dreams. Unfortunately, I read that Alice is losing popularity because people aren't at the reading level to read it before they outgrow fairy tales. This is a shame. people should preserve their imaginations just to read an excellent book like this and dream about it for a while. Now I am 13, and I stll treaasure this book. The poem at the very end of the book was so sad in way. it really summed up about how I feel about the magic of childhood."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age.This particular edition (2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin) also contains several extra \\"goodies\\" in addition to the text of the two books. There is a brief biography of Lewis Carroll, a timeline of his life and career, a fascinating and insightful introduction (well worth the read!), information on various film adaptations, a short story by Carroll - \\"What the Tortoise said to Achilles,\\" commentary on the text by various individuals and publications, and a set of questions designed to aid the reader's thought and analysis of the text. The book also contains all of the original illustrations, which are indispenable to a full enjoyment of the story. Highly recommended to any reader."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When Charles Ludwig Dodgson first began to tell the story of Alice's adventures underground to the three Liddell sisters, he had no idea whatsoever the impact that his work would one day have in the cultural history of humanity. Is there a person alive in Western civilization that *doesn't* know of Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat? I seriously doubt it. Writing under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, Dodgson's quirky fairytale soon became a publishing sensation in Victorian England, quite an unusual feat for a dour mathematician who had no interest whatsoever in boys, women or most other human beings, and instead lavishing his attention on little girls - particularly one Alice Liddell, to whom he presented the original manuscript to. The story of Lewis Carroll is just as fascinating as his fictional Alice, so I would suggest following up the \\"Alice\\" books with a good Carroll biography.In a story that is so random (basically made up of one little girl wandering about in a dream) there is plenty of room for all sorts of crazy theories as to exactly what everything means. Does \\"Alice\\" have a deep subtext, filled with hidden meaning and messages? Is it Freudian? Elaborate satire? Does it reflect the deep internal frustrations, anxieties and wish-fulfillment of a slightly-disturbed mathematician obsessed with little girls? Or is it simply a series of weird and wonderful events dreamed up for the enjoyment of children? The fact that nobody is really sure *what* to make of this story is probably the reason why it's still published, read and discussed today.The other reason is its historical value. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was the first book designed for children that was entirely void of any sort of moral, and instead written solely for pure entertainment purposes. Before \\"Alice\\", children were stuck with stories that preached goodliness and virtue, something that Carroll himself pokes fun at during the course of the story, when he refers to \\"several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had told them.\\" His stories came like an unexpected breath of fresh air amongst Victorian society, and it was little wonder that adults as well as children helped to make \\"Alice\\" a bestseller during its day.Another crucial feature to the tale is Alice herself, often considered the first realistic representation of a child in literature. She's curious, but sometimes a little shy. She's polite, but manners often give way to frustration and temper tantrums. She's intelligent, but not as intelligent as she would like to think she is (relying heavily on an education that often fails her). She often holds her own against the contradictory natures of the people she meets, but more often than not is baffled and belittled by them. She possesses some degree of common sense, but often does some remarkably stupid things. She's likeable, but she's also a bit of a show-off and a snob. In other words, she's the first (and perhaps the best) example of a three-dimensional child character in literature geared toward either children *or* adults.\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" begins with the infamous sight of a white rabbit with a waistcoat and pocket-watch muttering to himself: \\"I'm late! I'm late!\\" Abandoning her sister and the dull book that she's reading, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and unexpectedly finds herself drifting deep down underground. What follows is a series of weird and wonderful meetings with the likes of the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, as poor Alice - the only sane person in the madhouse - struggles to make herself heard against this twisted parody of the adult world.Nearly every page contains a clever pun, nonsensical poem or mathematical puzzle, and there's plenty here to keep you fascinated, whether it be Alice's abrupt shrinking and growing (brought on by eating Wonderland food, and perhaps reflecting Carroll's desire to control the growth of his young protagonist), the beautiful garden that Alice cannot seem to reach (and when she does, she finds it not quite to her liking, perhaps suggesting a reverse-Eden, in which children desiring adulthood soon realize that it's not quite what they expected it to be) or Alice's internal crisis in which she debates whether the surreal circumstances she's found herself in have resulted in her loosing her own identity (I won't even try to open the jar on *that* one!) No wonder scholars can go mad trying to untangle this tale! Even the fact that the story succumbs to the ultimate clich&eacute; in fantasy-fiction, the ending that will reward you with an F if you use it in a creative-writing exercise at school (I am of course, referring to the fact that Alice wakes up at the conclusion of the story to find that it was just a dream), doesn't damage the power of Carroll's imaginative force.\\"Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" is a little more structured in terms of its storyline, perhaps because Carroll was not simply making most of it up on the spot, as he had done with its predecessor. This time, when Alice falls asleep, she crawls through the mirror on the top of the mantelpiece and into the room on the other side. There she finds a land organized into the shape of a giant chessboard, in which Alice herself is a little pawn that must journey to the end of the board if she wishes to become a Queen. On the way she meets several chess pieces, including the Red and White Queen, and the White Knight (widely believed to represent Carroll himself), as well as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, a garden of living flowers, and the Lion and the Unicorn, the latter of whom famously tells Alice: \\"If you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you.\\" My favourite chapter would have to be the one that involves the ludicrously pompous Humpty Dumpty (who is really the one who coined the term \\"un-birthday\\", not the Mad Hatter and the March Hare as the Disney version would have you believe), though equally memorable is the intriguing episode when Alice happens upon the sleeping Red King, and is told that he's dreaming of her. Is Alice in the Red King's dream, or is the Red King in Alice's dream? What should happen if one of them should wake up before the other? It's a disturbing metaphysical conundrum, and hints at the depths with which a scholar (or deep-thinking child) could delve into these stories.Of course, not every child will enjoy the \\"Alice\\" stories. What was once vividly imaginative and innovative for a stifled Victorian audience has long since become commonplace in children's fiction, and the randomness with which the adventures take place can often unsettle young listeners (as they certainly did me, as I always felt that Alice was caught inside a nightmare). However, others will delight in the madness that abounds throughout the story, and others still will learn to appreciate the work as they get older. There are hundreds of editions out there, most probably quite as good as the next, but I would encourage buyers to track down an edition with John Tenniel's famous illustrations - you simply cannot read the \\"Alice\\" books when they are not accompanied by Tenniel's portrayal of his demure little Alice, with her hooded eyes and large forehead. It would be like reading C. S. Lewis without Pauline Baynes, or Roald Dahl without Quentin Blake. Unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I had not read these books since I was probably seven or eight, and I am glad that I finally got around to reading them again. These are some of the most fun childrens books (or any books for that matter) ever written. A previous reviewer gave this book a poor rating because it was only a childrens book. I fail to understand how being a childrens book means that a book is bad. Many childrens book are among the best books that I have ever read. Just because a book is a childrens book does not mean that it is a book just for children. Lewis Carroll wrote this for children, but it is probably even more enjoyable for me to read now than it was when I was a child, for now I understand many of the double meanings and world plays that you would never understand as a child. Carroll is better with word plays than any other author that I can recall reading. He is a master of molding sentences that simply slide right off of your tongue because they flow so smoothly. This is definitely one of the best childrens books ever written.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, was a shy, eccentric bachelor who taught mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford. He had a great fondness of playing with mathematics, logic, words, for writing nonsense, and for the company of little girls, especially a little girl called Alice Liddell (rhymes with fiddle), the daughter of Christ Church's Dean. Dodgson's passions somehow fused into two great masterpieces of English literature, the Alice Books, immortal fantasies whose fame surpassed that of all of Carroll's collegues at Oxford put together. If the Alice books had any &quot;purpoise&quot; other than to entertain little girls, it is to send you, the reader, to the pleasures of logic and philosophy and, as Carroll says in the introduction to Learners (1897) &quot;to give a chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights.&quot; Carroll's special genius lies in his ability to disguise charmingly the seriousness of his concerns and to make the most playful quality of his work at the same time its didactic crux. In the case of Alice, we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, which explores the possibilities of the use and abuse of language and is actually based on a profound knowledge of the rules of clear thinging and logical thought. In fact, most of Carroll's apercus and all his jokes are inversions of the rules. Reason is here in service to the imagination, not vice versa. And oh my! Those interesting characters! I like to think that most of the characters that Alice meets are Oxford Dons that the real Alice knew. They sound like Dons with their fine mastery of Socratic logic, their crushing repartee, and the disconcerting and totally unself-conscious eccentricity of their conduct. The wealth of material which Carroll presents for the illumination of his subjects is almost without end. The more I read it, the more I think about it, the more I find. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that AAW is in actual fact a story so deep as to yield results in exegesis almost beyond belief. Also consider purchasing The Annotated Alice by Gardiner. It will help increase your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"People tend to lump \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass (and What Alice Found There)\\" into one collection which has taken on the new title of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". This is probably a product of the movies, which took bits and pieces from each and made a composite adventure. This was possible, because Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) managed to make the stories so even in quality that they can be put together seamlessly. He also managed to keep the stories enough different, that one can still enjoy reading both of them one after the other, without the feeling that the second is just a retelling of the first.To be sure, there are several ways in which the stories are similar, but not to the point where it detracts from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are only three characters which appear in both books, one of which is Alice. The other notable characters (the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, etc.) are well distributed between the two books. Thus there is a looking-glass between the two, just as the looking-glass plays such a key role in the second book.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\\" includes both books including the illustrations by John Tenniel. It also includes the original \\"Alice's Adventures under Ground\\" which includes Lewis Carroll's artwork. For additional features, it includes \`\\"Alice\\" on the Stage' an article which Lewis Carroll wrote after seeing a production of the stage version, and it includes preface's to the books which Lewis Carroll wrote in 1896 for the 1897 editions. There are wonderful notes for both books, and a very informative introduction by Hugh Haughton. There is other supporting material as well. To sum up, this edition has pretty much anything one could want, other than a complete collection of Carroll's work.A last comment on the introduction, it covers the biographical information for Reverend Dodgson, and the information on how the stories came about. Some of this information may detract from one's enjoyment of the story, but one can certainly understand the decision to include it for those who are interested in Reverend Dodgson and his life. All in all, this edition is packed with everything and will suit those who just want to read the stories as well as those who want to delve deep into their origins."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

But the book is 100% better than any movie.As a writer myself, I can only hope to write a book half as imaginative and charming as this one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is my favorite book, and it has the sequel Through the Looking glass. This book is fantasy with a lot of humor in it. When I was little someone who came to our house gave the book to me. I never started reading it until I was in the 5th grade. But still I thought the book was too long so I never finished it in 5th grade. But in 6th grade I read the whole book and loved it, and I read it again this year. I think I could read this book 1 million times and still want to read it 1million times again!In the first story, Alice in Wonderland, It is about a girl named Alice. Alice is in this wonderful, magical place where creatures she never thought of come to life. It all starts with a white rabbit holding a pocket watch saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late.\\" Alice is very curious (who wouldn't be!) so she follows him and ends up falling through a hole, and it is a long, long fall. She comes to a room where strange things happen to Alice. She has a tea party with mad, crazy people, she meets the queen and finds out that the queen isn't decent at all!In the second story, Through the Looking glass, Alice meets a bunch of weird creatures. Alice steps into looking glass house where she is in a giant chess game and on her way to becoming queen Alice. And a lot of exciting and weird things happen along the way.I highly recommend this book to anyone in the 6th grade up. It is the kind of book that you can't stop reading. You get attached to the characters, and books that do that to me, I love, because you know you are enjoying the book. So if you like fantasy and like to have a few laughs, this is the book you have to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book. It gets your imagination going. It all starts when Alice is sitting on a bank with her sister and falls asleep. From there it is all imagination and from there your imagination never stops. Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black, well after following the white rabbit. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Personally, I would have followed a talking rabbit also. After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain and she moves it. That's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is to large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked &quot;Drink Me&quot; and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table which now she is to small to get. Then she finds cookies that says &quot;Eat Me&quot; so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar who gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. Alice was confused about why the cat was smiling so she asked the Duchess. The Duchess said that he was a Cheshire cat and that it was supposed to smile. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The cat told her that she would love them because they were mad. Alice did as the cat told her and visited them where she sit down and had tea with them. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts won is an evil person. The Queens tarts get stolen and she thinks Alice stole them. Alice has to go to court over this. The Queen loved to scream &quot;Off with her head!&quot; Alice is woke from her wonderful dream by her sister. Alice then starts to think about how her sister will be when she grows older. At the beginning when she first falls asleep it is hard to tell if she is dreaming so that is kind of confusing but otherwise this book is wonderful and very easy to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I was hoping to find a Kindle edition of both Alice books in one file with the original John Tenniel illustrations. This seemed to fit the bill and seemed to be worth the money. Overall, from my initial reading, I am mostly pleased with the formatting.

One complaint is that the title very clearly says \\"with active table of contents.\\" There is no table of contents. I was disappointed in this. Also, on my K1 anyway, some of the poetry lines broke in the middle of words. This made the poetry awkward to read at some places. There also are some stray punctuation marks here and there, but this didn't really detract from the reading experience.Edit 3/19/10 - I finished reading the entire two books and found the table of contents at the back of the book.

The author's use of language is extremely appealing to the younger readers. These young readers are attracted to this book because of the author's use of many songs. For instance the lullaby sung by the duchess to her child. The Mock Turtle also sang to Alice and the Gryphon a song about the Lobster Quadrille. The author also uses poems that are entertaining and fun to listen to. &quot;You are Old Father William&quot; is one of the many poems. Not only does the author use poems but she also uses commonly known poems and changes the words to fit the character saying them. For instance the Mad-Hatter sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in different words saying &quot;Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.&quot; If this isn't a unique way of writing I dont know what is. Another style of her writingthat is appealing is when she creates a picture, using words in a poem, about the poem. Yhis is used on page 37. The words in the book are nbot hard so the book can be enjoyable when it is being read, not stressful. The author brings animals to life which is an interesting style of writing. This is Lewis Carroll's style of writing. The main character in this book is a little girl with blonde hair named Alice. This child is full of fantasies and dreams, which is what the book is about. Alice is very curious and likes to know every little detail. She thinks she is very smart. For example, when Alice is listening to the Dormouse's story she asks questions like &quot;What did they live on,&quot; and makes smart comments such as &quot;They could'nt have done that you know, they'd have been ill.&quot; She is also a little bit bratty, especially to the Dormouse when she says: &quot;Nobody asked your opinion.&quot; These characteristics pull together to make an interesting main character and to create a fabulous story. The theme of the story is sometimes you need to take a break out of every day life and dream of fantasize. This makes your life more interesting even if you dream about things that will never come true. Alice does this when she dreams about changing sizes and listening to talking animals. Dreaming doesn't hurt anyone except the people who don't do it. If nobody ever had dreams life would be extremely stressful and boring. The plot of the story is all about Alice trying to find the white rabbit, which of course is in her dream. Following the white rabbit takes ALice to interesting places, such as the Courtroom filled with animals, and the Duchess' house, along with meeting interestingpeople such as the Cheshire-Cat and the Queen. This amazing cat hes the ability to disappear whenever it wants to and it always smiles. In the end Alice finds the white rabbit and then wakes up from her dream. This is the plot of the story. The story is effective to the reader. This is so because after listening to such acreative dream and fantasy, it inspires people to take a little time out of the day and be creative and dream once in a while. All the parts of this five star story; the writer's style, the main character, the theme, and the plot; come together to create the overall effectiveness of the story. This is why I rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you've ever wondered what this story was like, I encourage you to read it for your self.

The order came in time and was brand new as I expected it to be.If you havent read it, you should do so."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll's Alice stories are two of my favorite stories of all time. I love that they are about imagination - it reminds us that everyone should exercise their imagination from time to time, even adults. After all, if no one used their imaginations there would never be any inventions (the White Knight in Through the Looking Glass is a grand inventor) or progress in the world, although you do have to watch out for the people who use their imaginations for evil. These books are also wonderful because in today's non-stop world we all need a break from reality in a place that is ridiculously nonsensical.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are stories of a young girl named Alice who, as we find out at the end of each story, has fallen asleep and dreamed up fabulous lands, creatures, and exceptional nonsense. Although often printed together since the main character is the same little girl, they are actually two separate books written several years apart. They are set in two very different, yet equally ridiculous, places - Wonderland and a place simply called \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" These books are classics because they have not only stood the test of time, but also because they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Young people can enjoy them because they are so fantastically silly, and adults can appreciate Carroll's mastery of wordplay.I can't remember if I was in junior high or high school when I first read them, but as is the case with most classics that I read back then, I did not fully understand or appreciate them the way I do now. In going back and rereading them, I found them to be much more humorous than I did the first time around. They illustrate beautifully the reason why English is one of the most difficult languages to master. Part of the charm of the Alice stories is that the characters constantly miscommunicate with each other by using different meanings of words (the Cheshire Cat telling Alice about characters who are \\"mad\\" and meaning that they are crazy while she thinks he means that they are angry), different spellings of words (the mouse saying his \\"tale\\" is long and sad and Alice thinking his \\"tail\\" is long, but she can't understand why it is sad), or by the characters taking comments literally instead of figuratively (Alice complains to a frog that no one is answering the door and he wants to know what question the door asked).Unfortunately, like many classics the language that has made the Alice stories so funny is the same language that will keep many modern readers from enjoying them. Most classics were written in different ages and people talked differently back then. Words and phrases have come to mean different things, we use different slang, and our very patterns of using language have changed. There have also been huge changes in society that affect the way we read and understand. In the 19th century when the Alice books were written, people (especially those in the higher classes) were much more \\"proper\\" than we are today. They had strict rules of conduct which we see Alice struggling with throughout the books, especially since the people and animals she encounters in her imaginary worlds don't seem to be playing by the same rules that she is used to. This again is part of what makes the Alice stories so funny, but only if you \\"get\\" the joke.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are truly timeless classics that should be read and reread throughout a person's lifetime. Each time I read them, I find something that I overlooked before, keeping them both comfortingly familiar and surprisingly fresh. Alice is definitely a heroine that little girls can love, but boys might be hesitant to read these stories since they are about a little girl. They should, however, find the kings, knights, creatures, and fight scenes (you know, all the \\"boy stuff\\") appealing. Children will need a pared down, edited version that they can understand, and given the differences in language, junior high and high school students may need a \\"translated\\" version as well. At any age, the Alice stories are best enjoyed when read in the spirit that they were written - with the wonder and pleasure of childish imagination. After all, \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"From the first to the last page, Lewis Carroll displayed his unique exposition of characters in order to convey his ideas of the world he wished to create for his readers. The main characters of this wonderful tale include: Alice, the White Queen and King, the Red Queen and King, the Gnat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion, the Unicorn, and the White Knight. Alice, the protagonist, displays a sense of determination to be liked by the people in the Looking-Glass throughout the story despite the fact that the people hardly care for her. A character that ultimately disregards Alice's every word is the Red Queen, which is a strong, organized woman that is sure she is correct over everyone else. Quite the opposite, the White Queen is an unkempt, tentative woman, but helps Alice along her journey. Alice meets the Gnat on a train ride while he is whispering ideas of jokes in her ear to say to the other riders, yet his tepid disposition betrayed his sadness. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are just an odd pair of brothers that fight over meaningless things. Humpty Dumpty is an egg- shaped man that is simply rude to Alice and changes that meaning of all the words she asks him to define. A sweet, awkward, uncoordinated man, the White Knight, leads Alice to the end of her journey. A main conflict that Alice is forced to endure is her struggle to be accepted by the other creatures and people in the Looking-Glass. Another conflict is that Alice must travel through the land alone in order to achieve the rank of Queen. One plot action that helped lead up to the climax is when the Red Queen actually describes the path Alice must follow if she wishes to become Queen alongside herself and the White Queen. She told Alice that she was a Pawn on a chess board and she was to travel through eight squares, and also explained to her who or what is in each one; for example, she told her that she will meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the Fourth Square and in the Sixth Square she was to meet Humpty Dumpty. Another action that gradually leads to the climax of this tale is when the White Knight rescues Alice from the Red Knight and leads her to the Eight Square. Enthusiastically, the White Knight gibbers on about the new inventions he has created, and Alice is somewhat listening but is subconsciously waiting to arrive at her desired destination to finally experience her future, whatever or wherever it takes her.\\"Through the Looking- Glass\\" has the capacity to push your imagination to the level it was when you were a child, and that's what I loved the most about it. One of my favorite chapters in the book was \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\", for the distinct personalities Carroll portrays for each flower was quite entertaining to read and it grasped my attention as did many of the other chapters. I also admired the idea of everything being backwards in the Looking-Glass world, and this was finely displayed in this chapter. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was another chapter that I enjoyed because I had a slight twist from the regular story I usually heard as a child. I was able to see the alternative view of a classic tale, and that was a pleasant change of perspective. Throughout the entire story, I also appreciated the diversity of the characters because their odd personalities come together to create a pleasurable read. With the Red Queen being rude and strong and the White Queen being benevolent and hesitant, Humpty Dumpty's character is uncaring but the White Knight's character is sweet and awkward , and Alice's determined personality is different from all else, this causes the readers to get hooked and interested in learning more. I would recommend this book to all children, teenagers, adults, and seniors because imagination has no age limit."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the first book I can remember that truly thrilled me. I was very young when I picked it off a bookshelf at my grandparents' house almost at random. I was immediately drawn in: electrified, enthralled, amazed. I wanted more and more. This most recent trip through Wonderland was perhaps the second re-reading since then, and while I cannot ever again read it with the wonder of a small boy, I can still see why it captivated me. The wordplay; the games with logic; the agreeably disagreeable characters; Alice's mixture of confusion, curiosity, and determination--it was an irresistible combination. Some might think it is silly for a grown man to read a book like this, but it is certainly no sillier than for a grown man (and an Oxford don at that) to write one. And while Carroll's obsession with little girls, including photographing them naked or near-naked, is downright creepy now to an adult (something I didn't know about when I read his stories as a child) from a literary perspective it is easy to see how this fascination was channeled into giving his young friend Alice Liddell (his boss's daughter) a story to captivate her imagination by making her the primary character. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the more engaging story, but the chess-themed Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has some of the passages I remember most. There is the Red Queen running so fast with Alice that their running is more like flying, and pointing out to Alice that \\"it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.\\" Then there is the White Queen in discussion with Alice about impossible things, informing her that \\"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\\" There are the appearances by Humpty Dumpty and by Tweedledum and Tweedledee (characters Carroll did not invent, but who play more than cameo roles in the story and provide occasions for some of the author's trademark logic and word games). And of course, \\"Jabberwocky,\\" a poem I can still recite from heart, comes from the looking-glass world. While they are perhaps not so magical to me as they once were, it was very pleasant to read these two stories again. They are nice for a diversion, a few linguistic gymnastics, and a return visit to a land that has set more than one person on a lifetime course of reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"A string of incredible adventures written as a love letter to a child.."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Personally, I was disappointed with these books.

The characters are mostly animals with different personalities and can talk, so the characters were okay, but to me they could have been improved on. By this I mean they could have come to life more. Some animals were the white rabbit and the cat like in the disney movie. The overall theme of the book is for Alice(the main character)to get out of Wonderland. On her way home, she meets very strange characters and gets into trouble. One event I found interesting is when she meets the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Their first encounter was interesting but it was when they met again that I thought was good. Another event is near the end with the Queen of Hearts. To find out what actually occurred pick up the book and read it. Alice is a young girl who wishes there were more things in life and one day when she was out side with her sister she spots this white rabbit with a coat on and a pocket watch. She starts to follow it. She followed it through a rabbit hole and as she hit a soft spot on the ground Alice falls into a hole.

Alice has quite an imagination, infact it's her imagination that creates the mad world of Wonderland. It is completely weird, funny, and entertaining. Alice meets with many classic &quot;mad&quot; characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, and the mad hatter. this isn't only for children, it is for anybody. it has such a strange story and strange characters it makes Star trek look like Full House(just kidding). This is kind of freaky at some poinys seriously.This also comes with through the Looking Glass(the reason why I took out a star). That was really Dodgsons cry ofr money.

And perhaps it's folly to even try.I grew up with a hard backed copy of Alice in Wonderland and remember going through the pages countless times, gazing at the magnificent pictures--especially the Jabberwock--and giggling at the poetry. \\"Father William\\" and \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" still occupy parts of my brain as snatches and shards that want to pop out at awkward moments.That battle worn, orange backed book, handed down I'm pretty sure from my Dad, and read by him with equal enthusiasm when he was a kid, is long gone, and now that I'm armed with a Kindle I downloaded a copy to enjoy a fine book from my youth. If it's true that you can't go home again, it's even more true that some books will never let you back in. This is one of them.I'm not sure if the fantastic lives of fantasy and fiction that play out daily as hard news have diluted our ability to plunge unrestrained into a book like Alice in Wonderland, or if the book refuses to give up its virtues a second time for a plainer reason: despite its monolithic stature in the pantheon of classics, it was originally written, and still remains, a children's story. Pick it up and expect something more, and you may be disappointed.The prose still snaps and crackles like a bowl of fresh cereal, and the imaginary images still effortlessly dance across your mind's eye, but something's missing, whether in the book or the reader you'll have to judge for yourself. As an eco-friendly Kindle purchase, however, I strongly recommend it, and if you've never read it before, well, what are waiting for?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"So glad to have this book for my library - not sure if I ever read it as a child, but I'm looking forward to reading it this summer at the beach!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a nice clear clean edition of Lewis Carroll's two novels.

Also, because they are junior editions they don't have introductions, give author backgrounds, etc. - although I don't believe any of the IJL editions are abridged except for The Three Musketeers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Another favourite book from childhood is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (or Alice in Wonderland as it's sometimes called) by Lewis Carroll.The novel was written in 1865 and tells the story of Alice, a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole and into a fantasy world called Wonderland. Once there she comes across a myriad of different characters, all of them anthropomorphic creatures.The tale plays with logic and for this reason has been considered an adult book just as much as a child's book. It's considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre (literature that uses sensical and nonsensical elements to defy language conventions or logical reasoning). Pink Floyd (one of my favourite bands) also famously uses literary nonsense in their song lyrics. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Words are left for interpretation and there are usually little messages and meanings hidden and buried within cryptic sentences and paragraphs.For these reasons, the novel has been enormously influential in the creation of the fantasy genre which is known for its use of literary nonsense in the narrative course and structure of those books.The novel is broken up into 12 chapters and each focuses on a different adventure that Alice stumbles upon. Among them is the actual falling down into the rabbit hole and coming across various objects such as a bottle with the words \`drink me' written on it.Alice goes through many body transformations - she shrinks, she grows tall, and she shrinks again. She meets a white rabbit (the one she was chasing to end up in the hole), a lizard, a caterpillar and a frog (all with reminiscent human traits). She also meets a grinning Cheshire Cat before becoming a guest at a mad tea party where she becomes insulted by the Hatter who keeps throwing rhymes and riddles at her that she can't interpret or understand. This causes her to leave in a huff exclaiming that it's the stupidest tea party she had ever been to.After leaving the tea party she comes across a garden where she finds three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the Queen of Hearts hates white roses. Alice meets the King and Queen (with the Queen screeching \\"Off with your head!\\") to Alice's amusement and is ordered to play a game of croquet with them. The game quickly descends into chaos and Alice meets the Cheshire Cat once again. The Queen wants the cat beheaded but because his whole body basically is his head, this proves impossible.The cat's owner is a duchess and at Alice's request she is brought to the garden party. After this, Alice attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals and throughout the proceedings Alice starts to grow larger. The Queen orders that she must leave and Alice starts to dispute with her causing a commotion which has all the cards tumbling in and around her face.The novel ends with Alice's sister waking her up on the riverbank for tea and brushing leaves from her face (instead of cards). Alice jumps up and wanders off leaving her sister sitting there to imagine all the things that had happened.The novel is famous for its many character allusions. Alice is based on a real girl called Alice Liddell whom Lewis met during a summer when he was rowing in a boat with his friend and his three young daughters. He told them a story that featured a girl called Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The members of the boating party show up in Chapter 3 where the Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie. These are meant to be the Liddell sisters and it's interesting to note that Lacie is actually an anagram of Alice...The relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll has caused much sinister controversy over the years. Many biographers have thought that perhaps Lewis was romantically or sexually attracted to the young girl. There has never been any direct proof though and many have also just put it down to a mere fondness for the child. So fond were Carroll's affections for the girl that he even gave Alice the original handwritten manuscript of the story with the inscription \\"A Christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer's day\\".Some say he may have even bordered on obsession with her, particularly with his excessive references to her in his later story Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There where there were several direct links between the two girls. There is also an acrostic poem at the end of the novel which spells out Liddell's full name when reading downwards. Although a little strange, it is hard to judge what Carroll's thinking was at the time and without reading between the lines, it truly is a beautiful poem. I'll record it in a separate post after I complete this one.As well as a paradox take on words, Carroll was also a genius with numbers and many mathematical references and concepts were portrayed within the story. In various chapters Alice uses multiplication and subtraction to try to analyse her situations and make sense of her surroundings. It is suggested that in logic and mathematics there is an inverse relationship, and this is something for which Carroll had an in depth knowledge of.Reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for what it is makes for great reading. But it's only when you start delving deeper and recognising the hidden clues and mysteries that the story contains that the meaning of the novel will take on a whole new form and lead you to explore the story's deeper context.Read more of my book reviews at Storybook Love Affair - [...]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book.

I've since finished the book and found that I really enjoyed reading it. I find that the book makes way more sense than the movie, considering that alice's adventures and wonderland itself don't walk in a straight line, but that's what imagination is all about, there is no set direction. I believe Carroll described the childs imagination perfectly.Although I will admit I was alittle lost and confused sometimes.

It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown.

It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time.

What's interesting about this book is that there are several smaller stories strewn throughout. The Mock Turle's Story and The Walrus and The Carpenter are two examples. But, behind this book, there are also elements from Carroll's personal life. It has recently become known about this man that he did indeed dabble with opium from time to time, and that he did fancy the company of young girls, which all conveniently fit into this masterpiece of his. I'm not attacking Lewis Carroll's credibility as an author, I'm merely pointing out how an author's personal life can have a strong influence on his/her work. These factors have not hindered Carroll's work, but in a striking way have perhaps helped to make his work that much more realistic. He incorporated elements of which he was very familiar, and it made this book all the better. On a different subject, the illustrations by Tenniel are simply astounding! His use of light and shadow seem to make these characters come to life!

She cried then, but for the first time since his death, she cried tears of joy. It was a special moment in my life, and I have Carroll to thank for that.It's a story that should be read to or by everyone at some point. With the film adaptations that are coming out recently, it's sad to think that most people who see them have only seen other film or cartoon adaptations. Always go back to the source. This version is wonderful for the young or the old, as it's LARGE PRINT. I really can't say enough good things about this book. (On an interesting side note, there's a camp of thought about it actually being written by Queen Victoria...)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It appears that many of the reviewers of this particular edition of the book are not actually reviewing the product. Being that as it is, I will attempt to do this work justice. Lewis Carroll wrote this book for young adults, though it is familiar to young children because of the Disney movie. In actuality, the book may be too scary or difficult to understand for small children.This particular edition contains Alice's \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" and its sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". These stranges worlds reveal a somewhat spoiled young girl in her explorations of a strange world. Yet Alice might not appear so strange if the characters of these worlds were not so strange. Wonderland being the better of the two stories shows slightly more direction. But like any dream, the story often digresses into the bizarre. As Alice meets each new character, many having no apparent relation to the previous, readers can be frustrated by the lack of cohesiveness. Nothing really ties either story together aside from the return to reality in both stories.Carroll referred to this as a \\"book of nonsense\\". By his own admission, he seems to imply that there is nothing profound about this book. It is merely the musings of a sleeping child. Taking this perpective, readers will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This Book Brings out the best of both words. It has two stories in one. One is the origional story by Lewis Caroll,\\"through the looking glass.\\" The other is the more modern version of the story, \\"Adventures in Wonderland.\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The book arrived as promised. I was surprised how short the stories were, having chosen to read this book after reading the Twilight series. I haven't read the added features, just the Advenures and Looking-Glass stories, so I cannot comment on their content. The illustrations were very nice. My only complaint was that the printed text was poorly spaced on the page, the inner edges being close to the center of the book, making it somewhat uncomfortable to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book is really cool because it has a lot of kid's stories characters like the white rabbit, humpty dumpty, and Alice of course. it would be a good story for like fourth gaders who are barely starting to read chapter books. It's about a girl who found a little doorway, went in and can't find her way back."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is very creative, it has talking rabbits and every animal is talking and talking objects to like flowers and checkerboard pieces. Alice thinks this a dream but it is actually happening. She sees a talking white rabbit and follows it because it looked like it was in a hurry, was wearing clothes and was holding a watch. The white rabbit falls in a whole which takes them into wonderland where everything is alive and talking. Alice is amazed of what she sees and is still following the white rabbit. The white rabbit takes her in an adventure and she meets strange things and at the end realizes she misses her home.What I liked about the book was that I watched the movie and the book and they are very similar to each other. What really interested me the most is that how Lewis Carroll came up with all of this. I liked how everything talks and that wonderland is very colorful and living. I also liked how much detail it gave to really make you imagine how it looked it kind of made me feel like if I was really there. There was really nothing that I did not like about it.Through the looking glass is book two that explains how Alice goes into another universe by walking into a mirror and is her second time in wonderland but she thinks it's all a dream. But in Through the Looking-Glass she fins out that this is real and that she is not dreaming. In this part of the book she is playing a game of chess and is trying to get to the eighth square. Through the Looking-Glass was my favorite part of the book because it has so many details. I also like that they included little children's stories like Humpty Dumpty. What I did not like was that when Alice was talking to the White and Red Queen about adding and subtracting. I really got lost in that chapter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"All in all the recording was good and entertaining, but, the end of both stories were cut off and this was very disapointing. A great product until the end."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's adventures in Wonderland, the classic, thrilling fiction book, by Lewis Carroll, is a story that has intrigued and captivated readers for more than a hundred years. In this book, Carroll writes about a seven year old English girl named, Alice, Who has stumbled into this insane and curious world. In her confusion to find reasonable explanations for this precarious adventure, Alice comes across quite a few unusual characters, including a White Rabbit, whom Alive had followed down the rabbit hole in her curiosity and a shy mouse whom she almost drowned with her tears. As Alice struggles with her internal conflicts of who she is and what has become of her, she came across a blue caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom, languidly puffing on a hookah and after an infuriatingly absurd conversation, Alice continued her journey onward. At last, Alice parades strait into the presence of the demanding Red King and Queen, and finds herself in very unique situations.In, Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I occasionally found it hard to follow the sequence of events in which the story is laid out on account of my confusion at weather Alice was speaking dialogue or internal monologue. Although, Lewis Carroll includes in his stories, fictional characters from children books, which gives it a sense of adolescence; he also includes an Extensive, complex and chaotic game of chess, giving the book a more sophisticated feel. In Lewis Carroll's stories, I admire his creativity and originality with using fictional characters, but dislike the stories' structure and format. Considering everything, I would recommend this book to anybody because it meets the expectations of a classic, a fantasy fiction, and a children's novel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Charles Dodgson and the British Imperial ImaginationLewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a clergyman and mathematician. His delightful Alice In Wonderland is a feat of mythic imagination and fantasy that conjures an absurd vision of an alternate possible world, while also providing a biting satire of British culture, in the tradition of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole is the trigger for an imaginative flight of fancy about the structure of the world. Alice fears that she may fall through the middle of the planet to Australia, where people walk on their heads. This spatial referencing for Wonderland is important as a link to the colonial and imperial imagination of Victorian England. The pace of change and development of empire is such that traditional verities are thrown into radical doubt, and the possibility can be entertained of a journey through the looking glass to a land of wonder down under (like the journey from Kansas to Oz).Each of the characters in Alice in Wonderland can be assessed as social satire. Old Father William references the imaginary Australian spatial framework by standing on his head to guarantee his health. The impotent bullying by the Queen, the languid dream of the caterpillar, the madness of the hatter and hare, the card soldiers, and Alice as a quizzical rational person who takes all at face value, each is amusing because it touches a cultural nerve.The British Empire in its age of confidence almost thought that all things might be possible through science and industry and military might. Dodgson takes this cultural pride to an absurd logical conclusion, where chemical potions can rapidly change the size of objects and where the treasures of nature, such as flamingos and hedgehogs, are instruments for pleasure in an absurd game of croquet, like indulgent ancient Romans collecting rarities from the far corners of the earth.Humpty Dumpty is perhaps the most imperial satirical fool of all. His assertion that words mean what he wants them to mean is rather like the colonial settler, seeking to construct a new world in ignorance and defiance of established reality. Dodgson uses this parable as the occasion for wry logical observations about the absurdity of popular psychology.The popularity of Alice in Wonderland reflects the power of the vivid imaginative fantasy world of whimsy that Dodgson created, as an alternate myth to the orthodox imperial pride in British accomplishment. There is a self-deprecation, deflating the imperial orthodoxy with its surface blindness to the stupidity and confusion of Britain's growth. Looking back to Swift, and forward to the Goons and Monty Python, Dodgson voices a British self-doubt which was actually rather prophetic, in that the house of cards of empire eventually proved highly vulnerable."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from. Which for me makes the movies better. I like both books Alice's adventures in wonderland as well as Through the looking glass, the only thing I wondered is why, if all the movies are based on through the looking glass, does Alice always fall down the rabbit hole?

Gorgeous books, in exactly the condition described. Wow!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The story of Alice in Wonderland 1 and 2 is a well thought story that brings you to a place of \\"nonsense\\". The way Lewis Carrol wrote it has to do a lot about politics and the way of reality. Alice always thinks what's the point of a book that shows nothing interesting whatsoever? Well later on she discovers that there are a few reasons why s some things are not nonsense. These are some of the nonesense things; Drinks make you shrink, cakes make you grow, cats can dissapear, and flowers can sing. Some of the things Alice does can be thought as lessons, the sentence \\"Curiosity killed that cat\\" is used in other ways in the story, starting with chasing a rabbit down a tunnle. This is a fascinating story that I would recommend to anyone, even people that don't like to read; I'm one of those people.

In fact, I once tried to read a copy from the 1980's but I couldn't go on with it because the pictures were bothering me. Luckily, there's really only one freaky illustration in the original version, and that's the picture where Alice's neck is very long. It's a bit disturbing.But the book is well written and a good adventure story, too.I love the characters. They're very interesting.\\"'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\\"- \\"The Chesire Cat\\", Alice In Wonderland, by Lewis CarrollCome to think of it, the Chesire cat illustration is actually quite creepy as well. But it's not a big deal or anything.The whole book's just weird fun. Where in the world did Mr. Carroll think of all this? The Mad Hatter? The Queen of Hearts? The Duchess and her pig baby?Alice herself is a considerably strange character.All in all, aside from a couple of creepy illustrations, the book is wonderful. Everyone should read it once in their lifetime---it's worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some ways, then dipped down so suddenly that Alice had no time to think what's was going on before she had founden herself falling down a very deep hole (Pg 2). Have you ever imagined crawling through a rabbit hole, falling down a well, and ending up in, well... Wonderland. You portably haven't, but now you are. If you now want to know, then you should read Alice in wonderland by Louise Carroll.Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black hole. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three-legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain, that's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is too large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked \\"Drink Me\\" and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table, which now she is too small to get. Then she finds cookies that says, \\"Eat Me\\" so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry, which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Then she is able to go into the small door, which then starts the whole adventure.Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar that gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts.

At times, the children requested another chapter because the previous one was a bit of a &quot;cliffhanger.&quot; This book makes for a wonderful read-aloud for the 6-10 year old set, and would be enjoyable for a proficient reader to read alone, as well.

George MacDonald later published some children's books of his own including &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and many others which are fantastic and every child should read them.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here.

Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style; it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character were great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face, and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anything that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesitate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventurous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different. I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It's amazing that many people have never read this book. After all, it's virtually impossible to find an American unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and the instantly recognizable illustrations. Yet, in truth, plenty of adults have never plowed through the brilliant but dated prose contained within the pages of Alice In Wonderland. And most of those never will because it is perceived as a children's tale and a book that they needn't bother with since they already know the basic story. This is a mistake.Alice In Wonderland is a unique and clever book. The fact that interest in it has survived so long is testament to its quality. The bizarre characters, which visually and playfully appeal to children, converse in clever riddles and political subtext that go over their heads and talk directly to more intellectual adults. This is a ground-breaking work, so completely off-the-wall that it's hard to imagine it having been published so many decades ago.Through The Looking Glass is Carroll's return to Wonderland, a special treat for readers disappointed by Alice In Wonderland's premature ending. The fun and mystery continue and improve in this second volume with the classic and irony-filled chess game.Chess-playing cards, hookah-smoking mushroom dwellers, shape-changing elixirs, and disappearing cats. This is an adult fable. Carroll invites us into his dream, and we share his fantastic experience through the clarity of a writer's genius.

Byatt, and just enough notes and commentary to provide some additional historical and cultural context.Lewis Carroll was an imaginitive genius and has created some of the most unforgettable and timeless characters with this work - the Mad Hatter, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the hookah-smoking Caterpiller, the perpetually late White Rabbit - and the absurd situations Alice finds herself in are poignant and amusing at the same time.However, one thing I did not realize coming back to these stories for the first time as an adult was just how largely character and situation-driven these stories are. Carroll moves rather disjointedly from one nonsensical scenario to the next, paying very little attention to a cohesive narrative thread. Indeed the world of Alice is best experienced as a whole, when the menagerie of characters can come to life, but these stories could just as easily be read out of order or taken out piece by piece. The creative work doesn't suffer a bit because of this, but readers should not come to these books expecting a novelistic experience.These are creatures to love, lines to savor, and the most curious things to consider."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I couldn't put it down, man. I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.Yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"My mom first read this book to me when I was seven years old. Because I was only in first or second grade, Alice in Wonderland scared the heck out of me. I remember parts were pretty horrific and confusing. I kind of hated it. It was like Stephen King for a first grader- which, if you ever go to a website on Lewis Carroll, shouldn't surprise anyone because Carroll had loads of problems and was pretty much tripped out while writing this (I think).Now that I'm older, I decided to re-read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. While reading it, it's hard to decide whether this is just a load of imaginative creativity, or a metaphor of something deeper that is true in society today, or true in the 1800's. Well, I guess you can read it either way- but there is definitely some deep stuff in here. Many poems will stop and make you think, and as the story progresses you can't help but feel like you are Alice (which is pretty amazing, because this isn't like Lord of the Rings or anything, it's basically a fairy tale on drugs).Definitely, definitely, definitely do not hesitate to pick this book up and read. Another review said it was disturbing- well, in some ways it really is. But the characters and the plot line (or lack of!) keep you interested and keeps you reading.

Overall, the book is very cheap and thrown together. Get a nicer version that also has the original illustrations by John Tenniel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Unfortunately, this Kindle version is missing almost all of the illustrations, which are an integral part of the book. And the poetry is not formatted correctly and is in red on my iPad Kindle.Through the Looking Glass [Kindle Edition] by BLTC is the one you want."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"One think that frustrates me is when Amazon reviews ignore the medium that the stories are presented in. My review is about this specific Hallmark Edition book.It's difficult to find a nice hardcover version of both stories complete with the original illustrations. the illustrations are either poor quality, or are reduced in number. This book doesn't use them at all, so if that's important to you, look elsewhere. Instead it includes beautiful photographs of the scenes from the NBC TV movie. In my opinion this is better than the original, but it lacks the historical signifigance.In my opinion, get this book. It has the stories you want and the photos are very pleasing to look at. This book is bound nicely and will make a great addition to any library or collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are probably some of the most famous children's books in the English anguage. There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting them.On the one end, the books are seen as wonderful and innocent entertainment mainly for kids but also suitable for adults. It is innovative and chaotic and performs puns and wordplay on the English language as well as concepts. They are accompanied by great quality illustrations and have a sense of fun and adventure about them.On the other end, the books are seen as elaborate allegories. Everything is symbolic. The tales are reminiscent of an LSD induced fantasy. Everything is Freudian and academic and open to postmodern interpretation and of course there's the disturbing question of Carrol's supposed obsession with little girls.Having read - and loved - the books, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, they seem to be oriented primarily for children but that doesn't mean adults can't get anything more than nostalgia out of them. Yes they are rich in some symbolism but it is unwise to overanalyse and read too much extraneous ideas into them.Highly recommended to be read as what they are - the product of an amazing mind, which saw the world of children as the ground in which to sow ideas both fun and profound. All the semi-philosophical talks, nonsense poems, fantastical creatures combine to make an unforgettable work."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I am a teenager, but I live in France and am not completely fluent in English yet. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was one of the first English novels I read, and I loved it. I went on to read Through the Looking Glass and loved it just as much. I think that it is a perfect book to read to children. The language was clear enough for me to understand, and I am not a native English speaker, so it would be easy for a child to understand. But even as a young adult, I loved the funny story and the funny people who were in the books. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This review is not about the book itself, but about the $0.99 Kindle edition.

Carroll puts them all to shame. Both books are filled with puns, absurd comedy, and rhymes and riddles. The first book is more constantly interesting than the second, which slows down at parts (such as during Alice's long conversation with the White Knight).In Alice in Wonderland, I loved the exposition of logical relationships during the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Her exchange with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle is also fun. Although I didn't enjoy Through the Looking Glass quite as much, Alice's interaction with Tweedledum and Tweedledee and then later with Humpty Dumpty are great. (Humpty Dumpty illuminates the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" by providing his own definitions of all the nonsense words.)I listened to an unabridged audio version performed by Donada Peters (published by Books on Tape, Inc.): Peters was Excellent.

Alice goes through many adventures and meets many interinteresting people and things. To find out who and what she meets, I guess that you will just have to read the book for yourself."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Possibly. Chalkful of vivid images, philosophy, language, and satire, Carroll makes one want to give up hopes of writing anything that might be labeled &quot;literature.&quot; Highly recommended. The pictures are pretty as well :)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"&quot;Be who you are,&quot; said the Duchess to Alice. &quot;Or, if you would like it put more simply, never try to be what you might have been or could have been, other than what you should have been.&quot;Recently, I was in the blues, and was lightened to see this phrase hanging in front of a science professor's room. Though it is a shortened phrase from the original, I was intrigued at the message that this book gives to a grownup. There are some books that was clever satires of their times, which has been 'downgraded' to the level of children's books like &quot;Gulliver's Travel' or 'The Little Prince.&quot; Clearly, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; also has some of it. Although Lewis Carroll may not have thought of it, what he told the three girls on that fateful day is for also all past-children who are now grownups. Actually, it seems that it was an interpretation of the grown-ups world for the children through the eyes of this little girl, Alice, who also happens to be the person who insisted that this Oxford-Mathematician publish the story that he told her. If you sometimes feel that things are not going your way, you might want to pick this book up. It may work, just like for me and that professor."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"These books work on so many different levels. My youngest child says she likes them because they are the only books that really give a feeling of how life is to children. Even though they are 150 years old they still seem relevant. (I think maybe that means that Lewis Carroll did not fancy little girls, instead he IDENTIFIED with them). I could keep reading these books through my childhood and teenage and adult years and always find something new. I learned the poetry off by heart and so did my partner (before we met each other) (Lewis Carroll also wrote many more poems and the funny ones are just as good as the ones in these books) The puzzles and contradictions in Alice are fun. And there is a magical feeling of &quot;anything could happen&quot;. To me that never got scary because Alice always coped fine. I too prefer Through the Looking Glss(like another reviewer did) not just for the poems but the whole idea of everything being back to front. These are tremendous books! If you like formal logic then L. Carroll's &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; is crazy and amusing but also interesting and so are his Tangled Tales about maths. These are not so well known."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Its hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this brilliant book. Whether you're a young child or an experienced reader, you can't help but marvel at the charm that Lewis Carrol creates. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (The Alice books as they are often collectively referred to as) are two of the most enduring children's stories of all time. However, at the same time, they both are considered to be literary achievements in the adult crowd, due to the many societal critiques hidden withing the text.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with the classic scene of young Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Soon she finds herself lost in an insane world. Drinking things make her grow into a giant or shrink to the size of a mouse. Best of all, are Alice's conversations with the many eclectic characters that inhabit Wonderland. Unfortunately, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland comes to an end within the one hundred page mark (it is a children's story, after all). Fortunately, this collection holds the book's sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. In this Alice stumbles through a looking glass and finds herself in Wonderland again. This time around she becomes a pawn in a giant game of chess. The reader follows her adventures as he tries to become a queen by making it to the eighth square. This chessboard element proves a very intersting way of advancing the storyline.What truly gives this book its lasting charm is its characters. Whether its the Mad Hatter telling Alice about his friend Time, or the disappearing Cheshire Cat, every character is impossible to forget. Many such as the White Rabbit, remain popular icons today, well over a century later. Conversations held with these characters often prove laugh out loud funny, as Alice tries to make sense of and explain herself to these characters. From beginning to end, the reader will have a goofy grin plastered across his or her face.Behind all these fun adventures, Carroll manages to slip in a large amount of social commentary. Some characters represent types of people, such as the overzealous monarch, to display in an exaggerated sense the foolishness of such extremes. His many poems throughout the book often have larger meanings as well: The Walrus and the Carpenter are clearly a condemnation of modern religion. Even the wild effects of drinking and eating can be interpreted as a moral on temperence. As the Duchess in the Wonderland said \\"Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\\" Likewise, Alice is rife with various morals.So what makes this book a classic? Reading through other people's comments, its hard to find a single person that didn't give it five stars, much less didn't like it. However, it was hard to find a definite consensus on what made it so good. Some stated its entertainment value, other enjoyed the commentary. Perhaps what makes this book so brilliant is that it has whatever you're looking for. If you want escape and adventure, it has it. If you want to laugh, there's humor. If you want intellectual thought and prose thats there too. What will the reader take away from reading is whatever they are looking for. Definitely a book that deserves its recognition as a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was great for children and adults alike!

Lewis Carroll is a magnificant author and the story he writes is wonderful. Alice is a little girl who journeys to a magical land where everything is full of non-sense. She incounters many people and creatures along the way. She is told many stories and riddles while she travels through wonderland. My favorite thing throughout the story, was when Alice kept saying that she would have to write a book about this place when she got home. Even though it was a dream, Alice still loves her world of non-sense."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll provides us with a twisted view of our worldthat provokes hours upon hours of thought. This novel may seem like anovel for children, however, it is filled with more literary devices than a truck-load of Hawthorne! Beautiful imagery, puns, malapropisms, possible drug innuendoes and grammatical devices make this a masterpiece to be reckoned with. Be prepared for deep thought upon a close examination of this seeming children's novel, because it is certainly a work for the more experienced reader. By far my favorite book!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I bought this edition because I was so horribly disappointed with the free version, which had no poetry.

It's funny, ridiculous, weird, confusing, and VERY much on drugs. I'm sorry... Did you just ask me to eat a mushroom? The many drug references, however, are extremely amusing, and add to the story very much.Alice is asleep and dreaming up a crazy world. The characters she meets are all eccentric, strange, and frightfully funny. Whether we're thinking of the Mad Hatter, the rabbit, or the Queen of Hearts herself, this book is truly a child's happy adventures through a completely ridiculous fictional land (unless you are firm in your belief that this book is completely about drugs, but even then it's still funny and ridiculous).Even though this book is known as a children's book, it is hilarious to all who read it. Enjoy! I just hope you remember to breathe while gasping with laughter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This book was so enjoyable! I think that anyone, young or older child, teen, or adult would love every page of it. I felt that it went by fast most of the time, but some parts were repeatable. I almost wish it were a little shorter, like each story only 100 pages so it would go by faster, but it was still very enjoyable. I actually have to say I like 'Through the Looking Glass' the best. I had always thought these were just short childrens books, I was surprised when I found out how big they were! I didn't really like the end of 'Through the Looking Glass' since it was about the same as the end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland'. The end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland' was better because: 1. I read it first, and 2. It was just better and I was very surprised by it (guess I haven't seen the movie \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" in a while!). However, they are both very good stories that anyone would love and I will recomend it for everybody. PLEASE rate if this review was helpful to you. THANK YOU!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is the ultimate children's book. From the beginning when Alice falls down the Rabbit hole and leaves Dinah, it captivates the reader and enchants the reader. Carroll was a master of outlandish and imaginative fiction and this statement is proven when you read this book.Dont listen to any of the 'nonsense' that Alice in Wonderland is based on LSD trips etc. This is nothing but people trying to take away Carroll's genius from him.Great Book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"'Alice in Wonderland', by Lewis Carroll, is an excellent book for both adults and children. It details a little girl's wild adventure through a make believe world. The writing was clever. And so were the characters and situations created by Carroll. Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician). Of course these concepts are skewed in Wonderland.If you've never read this book before, put it on your \\"must read\\" list. It's a short book and a fast read. If you you're read it already, why not read it again?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Nice presentation of the two books with the classic illustrations.

I didn't really like it. It didn't make any sense, I told my mother. It's not serious enough for me.But years later, at age twenty, I acted on a whim and read it a second time. And I was captivated. No other book matches Alice in humor, oddness, or bizarre characters. All the imitators (and there have been many) have failed because they couldn't manage to hold together their story's oddness with such a strong, flowing narrative or protaganist as lovable as Alice. Lewis Carroll's plot drifts effortlessly from one bizarre situation to another with sublime grace. His genius was that he went into the bizarre without going too far; his creativity never turned cheap.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an adult's children book. I doubt that children will, or even can, enjoy it to the extent that adults will. When I read it at age nine I wanted it to have some kind of meaning, some raison d'etre--how ironic that now I'm an adult and its dreamlike feel is just the kind of break from reality I could use. Of course children can love these stories too, and I don't want to give anyone the idea that Alice and Looking Glass are stories only for adults. Your kids probably don't read anything other than the Harry Potter books, over and over, so why not give them something else?Some other things about Alice in Wonderland make it such a classic. It was unique in its time (and still so) for its complete lack of moralizing. It doesn't tell you how good boys and girls should act, or turn into a good-vs-evil tale. Its protaganist, Alice, has to be one of the greatest characters, female or otherwise, in all literature. Her cleverness and logic are Wonderful.So buy the book. The edition to get is one with the original illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"'The Annotated Alice' with annotations done by Math and Games writer, Martin Gardiner may be the first, and is certainly the best known annotated edition of a popular classic, followed by annotations of other major popular classics such as the complete Sherlock Holmes and 'The Hobbit'.It is especially interesting to compare the Alice stories with Tolkien's novels, as both series of works are enhanced by their authors' love and professional involvement with language studies. The difference is that while Tolkien was a philologist, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a logician, so their slant on words and wordplay are a lot different. Tolkien is the poet of names and Carroll is the weaver of paradoxes and nonsense. Both, however, benefit from exegesis for those of us who are neither philologists nor logicians.Carroll's works also need heavy annotation for his references to people and events of his day as they are masked by metaphorical references in the Alice books.Reading these stories with Gardiner's annotations is virtually the only way to fully appreciate these works. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you long to be carried away to a world of nonsense and magic, talking beasts and flowers then Alice is the best tour guide you can employ. This is a book that will find a place close to the heart of a reader of any age that has a place inside reserved for whimsy and childlike wonder. As Alice travels through Wonderland and meets many unexpected characters your imagination will soar. Run a race with a dodo bird. Have tea with the doremouse and his friends the mad hatter and the march hare. Thrill at the &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. Alice proves to be a very level headed young lady indeed as she encounters things that become &quot;curiouser and curiouser!&quot; The story meanders through forests and chessboards that are life size never ceasing to amaze the reader with charm and wit. Lewis Carroll completed a masterpiece of fantasy and social comentary in this classic tale. The book is truly a gift to any one who hopes to hold onto childhoods magic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I should have looked at the size of this book in making the selection. Although this book is beautiful, lovely dust jacket, interesting illustrations, it is almost too big to casually read and is more of a coffee table book. It was bought as a companion to a collectable given as a Christmas present. The entire gift was precious though and the book really made it special."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I have grown up watching Disney's Alice in Wonderland, and knowing what liberties Disney is known to take in their movies, I wanted to read the original story for myself.And I'm glad I did. Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.This was two stories in one. The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with. The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book. Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen. As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When I was assigned Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to read for my Victorian Literature class, I was excited. Even though I had heard Alice's Adventures in Wonderland referred to countless times throughout my youth, I had never read the story or seen the movie. I had never heard of Through the Looking Glass, but while reading, I realized that many people who think they are talking about AAIW are actually referring to TTLG. The two texts seem to be conflated in a way that makes them indistinguishable from each other. It is for this reason that I enjoyed reading this edition of the texts. There is only a page separating the two stories, which allows the reader to easily make the transition between them. This small separation also allows the reader to recognize the undeniable connection between the texts and to understand why many people combine them in their minds.AAIW is about a young girl named Alice whose boring day with her sister is interrupted when a white rabbit runs by her saying, \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" Alice's curiosity is aroused, but surprisingly not to a great degree. This is the first hint to the reader that Alice is not an average child, as she seems to believe that a talking rabbit is quite normal. She does become intrigued, though, when the rabbit produces a clock from his pocket, so she follows it down its hole and enters a world of wonder. I loved the story from this point on. It is filled with such unbelievable creatures and situations, but Carroll's writing style made me want to believe in a world that could be filled with so much magic and splendor. There was never a dull moment in the story, and each page was filled with more excitement. I will offer a warning, though. This story is not for those who like a neatly packaged plotline. It is written in a somewhat discontinuous nature and seems to follow some sort of dream logic where there are no rules. However, I enjoyed the nonsensical pattern. Without it, a dimension of the story would be lost. It offers some insight into the mind of a young, adventurous, fearless girl, and Carroll seems to be challenging his readers to be more like Alice.The second text in this book, TTLG, is again a story about Alice. In this adventure, Alice travels through a wondrous world on the other side of her looking glass. As in AAIW, Alice again encounters absurd creatures, such as live chess pieces and talking flowers. The land she travels through is an oversized chessboard, which gives this story a more structured plot than AAIW. The chess theme provides Alice with sense of what she must accomplish in the looking- glass world, and it provides the reader with a sense of direction throughout the story. Alice's goal is to become a chess queen, so the reader knows that when she becomes queen, the story will be over. However, just because the story has some structure does not mean that it is not just as wild and marvelous as its predecessor. I enjoyed all of the characters. They seem to have an endless supply of advice that people in the 21st century can still learn from. My favorite example is when the Red Queen says, \\"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" Maybe what Carroll is suggesting is that if we read more nonsensical, unbelievable stories like his, we won't be so afraid to be adventurous and fearless like Alice; so that the next time a white rabbit runs by us, we might just see where it leads us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- these two Alice books are charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat that is actually more charming than eerie, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.And I love the drawing given by John Tenniel, and some text's visual presentation are supercool.Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"How is a raven like a writing desk?

That is an example of the witty offbeat humor in \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".Alice is sitting bored when her attention is captured by a talking white rabbit. She follows it down a rabbit hole into a world full of strange creatures, curious happenings, and mysterious pastries. At first she marvels at all the oddities, but soon she wants to get home, only to discover that she doesn't know how.By far my favorite parts of this book are when Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat. He is very witty, and adds something special to the story. Also his grin is phenomonal.I think the theme of this book is really about using your imagination and letting your creative side get the best of you once in a while, not letting other things like television and the media do the imagining for you. That's also why the movie is totally hypocritical.The whole point of the book is using your imagination, and the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie did the opposite of that. Despite it being created by the godfather of the animated film industry (Disney) it really sucked. They took out too much of the story just to squeeze it into 1 and a half hours and a G-rating. \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\" wasn't made for the big screen, considering its length and semi-annoying characters that if animated and given the life of Disney turn them into monsters that are enough to make even the most devout Catholic contemplate suicide. And the songs! Don't even get me started on those. Disney has to pump every movie it pushes out full of annoying constant 5-minute \\"songs\\" that give you ear worms for a month! They ruin everything they get their greasy little fingers on. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland used to be original and interesting and Disney went ahead, squeezed out all the creativity, shoved some songs into it, stamped their trademark on it, and shipped it out. They are sick, sick little people.Most of this book is quite entertaining, though there are a few parts that just seem stuck in there and were quite dull. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a very original and interesting story, and if you've never read the book, do so. It is entirely worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, stay far, far away. For those of you who have, good luck with the nightmares. And those monstrous ear worms.-carli"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Find some children anywhere you can and read this book to them! I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say \\"reading?\\" I should have said \\"performing,\\" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"When I was younger, I watched the Disney version of this book and was left absolutely horrified by what I had seen. I was about four years old and the constant visions of strange and horrid looking creatures flashing on the screen made me want to leave the room. Because of this, I was not so sure how much I wanted to read this story. Actually, even now, I'm not all together convinced that I really like this story. I feel that it is somewhat sacrilegious to say so but I just don't enjoy this story all that much. As read through the first few pages I could still see the strange and haunting images from the twisted children's movie. Maybe that's what has ruined this tale for me, but I do sincerely feel that it is more than that. When I am reading, I begin to feel hopeless, lost and somewhat confused. I don't really feel happy about saying this since I'm a high school boy, but I feel that you should know how strange the concepts are in this book. Honestly, I must say that reading this book made me feel as though I were on a drug trip. This book has the strangest and most disturbing elements such as drinks that reduce your size and cakes that re-enlarge you. Not to mention that creepy, talking cat in the tree, the Cheshire Cat.From a thematic point of view, I suppose you could say that one theme from this story is the frustrations that come with the loss of one's childhood. What I mean by this is that when a person gets older, they encounter physical changes that radically change they way that a child views the world and may even frustrate them. Across the entirety of Alice's adventures, she runs into a series of absolutely ridiculous changes. While these changes are much more absurd than real changes we incur growing up, they cause Alice to become traumatized, frustrated, and even change her perspective of the world. Although she is forced to go through these changes, she continues to struggle to maintain a comfortable physical size. In chapter one, she tries to follow a rabbit into a garden and is unable to fit through the entrance because she is too large. She takes a drink that shrinks her to the appropriate size but then realizes that she left the key to the entrance on the above table. She then eats a cake that grows her to the size at which she can retrieve the key but is then once again too large to enter the garden, which is very frustrating to her. Again in chapter five, she looses control over her physical build and gets an irregularly long neck.As for the characters in this book, I find all of them one hundred percent unbelievable and terrifying. The characters are all introduced abruptly and are completely beyond reason. For example, the Mad Hatter and his fellow creatures are constantly making insane remarks about class and the state of things. There is also a strange creature named the Cheshire Cat who is unaffected by all that goes on in Wonderland and merely observes all that goes on, somewhat like a stocker.This story is told through the perspective of a narrative view through Alice's eyes and conclusions of the new world she has entered. This view gives a good perspective of how crazy the world can be. I mean, Wonderland may seem like and absolutely mashed land of turmoil but through the eyes of Wonderland, Alice is absolutely mad. I suppose this could be compared with the difference in views in today's society and other countries.Again, I must say that I don't really like this book personally simply because it disturbs me so much, but I would still recommend it to others as they may not feel the same way. It really is a well written story, even if I don't like the general plot. I give this book a three out of five star rating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"This is about the font size, NOT the content.

Well if you haven't, &quot;Don't&quot;. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book, but it was extremely confusing. In my opinion this book could have been written a lot better. For example, it could have been alot less confusing and more realistic. The main reason I didn't exactly enjoy Alice in Wonderland was because it needed to be more happy,then unhappy. Here are some more reasons why you should not read this boring book. Alice in Wonderland could have been written a lot better. The author's language usage was a bit hard to comprehend,like when the caterpillar was talking to Alice about a crocodile and when the cat was giving Alice directions. Also, the scenes were short and they jumped right into each other too quickly. Most of the animals were rude and mean to Alice. The flowers shooed her away, the queen tried to cut off her head and the cat was always making her angry by lying. Another part that didn't make any sense was the tea party,there's no such thing aa a &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;. Also the Mad Hatter and the Hare wouldn't listen to Alice when she was trying to tell her story. All the creatures and animals kept Alice from what she was trying to do which was to follow the white rabbit. Alice met many,many creatures such as Tweedle Dee,Tweedle Dum,Do Do,Bill, Rabbit,Cat,Queen of Hearts,Caterpillar,Playing cards,Mad Hatter,Hare,Flowers,Pig and the Door Knob. This book made me just as frustrated and upset as it made Alice.I felt like I was in the book and I could feel all the confusion and nonsense going on. If I had to give my overall opinion of how good the book was I would give it 2 stars.So, in conclusion I would like to let everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was not worth reading, so don't waste your time! Go get yourself an interesting book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an extremely ridiculous and confusing book. The characters were mis leading and Alice was very annoying (from the little details I read throughout the book). This book would be a good for fantasy lovers, but to me it was unrealistic and childish. Some of the things the characters said and did in the story were confusing and somewhat complicated. I don't know if I would recommend this book to younger children because of its wording, but it was a child-like book and would attract young readers in a way. The writer writes in a unusual, seemingly &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. You could tell the book wasn't written recently by the language usage. Alice is a young girl who is very bright and adventurous. On her way down to Wonderland, she meets alot of new characters. Some are decieving like the treaser cat but all of the very intresting and USUAL, such as the Mad Hater, The Queen of Hearts, etc. The way the author worded things in the book, made me get confused and unintrested. I had no desire in reading it after the first few pages. I thought the book was far fetched, and seriously i wouldn't recommend this book to teens or children."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The first thing that must be said for anyone who's seen Disney's Alice in Wonderland and wants to read the book because they loved it so much is beware. The book and the movie, while following the same story line, are nothing alike, and if you expect them to be you'll most likely end up as disappointed as I was.Perhaps it's because I grew up with the fluidly poetic Dr Zeus, or perhaps I just expected something that the book simply was not, but I found Carroll's tale bland and void of the essential, natural art to story-telling that all \\"absurd\\" imaginative pieces need to be enjoyable.Though I must give credit to Carroll for what I feel he deserves- in his time, this was a wildly fantastic book with a plethora of crazy characters, riddles, poetry and inspired plot twists that carry the reader around Wonderland with the famous protagonist.The Characters however, were truly brought to life by Disney to a degree unrealizable within the written format. I don't fault Carroll for this, but when you've seen the movie first...I also found the transitions between scenery and scenes to be lacking in impact because there is little distinction made between one place and the next. I realize that Carroll was describing a dream (which is vague by nature), but I feel that his writing could have accentuated the transitions to give the reader more involvement in the fading between one land and the next- what we have instead is something close to \\"Alice was walking in a forest and now she's crossing a river.\\" Call me picky, but such a lackluster transition is bound to bore.Most agitating were Penguin Classic's annotations that literally littered the text with information completely irrelevant to the story. Boasting on the back that my copy is \\"the most comprehensively annotated edition available\\", they weren't lying. To get this title though, they stuck an annotation into every nook and cranny manageable. By the end of the fifth chapter I almost threw the book out of the bus window because I had read more about Lewis Carroll's diary entries and queer habit of wearing gloves everywhere than of Alice herself. At that point I more or less stopped regarding the annotations at all- content instead to deny their existence rather than try my patience at reading them. I was upset at this because there were several places where an explanation, allusion or elaboration was truly helpful, but they were one in stack of fifty and the remaining forty-nine were just too painfully superfluous to sift throughThrough The Looking Glass also failed to leave an impression on me. It was a very simple extension of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but in the same exact format, with the same trite transitions and utterly lackluster performances.I thought it was a painful struggle to finish Through The Looking Glass, and then found myself face to face with Carroll's original short story Alice's Adventures Underground- the original short story that he had written for the young daughter of a close friend which his friends had urged him to elaborate upon. Following that, I found an essay written by Carroll, Alice On Stage, about his thoughts on the cinematic production of his tale. I'm sorry; I just couldn't bring myself to bother. That was enough of Lewis Carroll for me.As I implied at the start, stick to Disney's movie. I love to read, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a story meant to be seen and heard, not read about."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I truly feel sorry for any child forced to read this book in school.

It's quite clever to design a deck based on the classic &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Would have rated this deck higher except that it does NOT comes with an instruction book, but rather a quick-and-to-the-point pamphlet that truly simplifies the meanings of the cards. If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing. Due to the whimsical nature of the card, you might want to use it for more whimsical readings.

Lewis Carroll creates a wonderful fantasy world for young children but the appeal was not there for me. The separate worlds of both stories are chaotic but they pave a way of mystery and suspense. The characters Carroll creates are great and each one is different from the next and you are never sure what or whom Alice will meet next. The downfall for me in these two stories was that neither one had a well thought out plot. For I could tell Alice was wondering to two different worlds not knowing where she was going or why she was there. Some people may find this type of writing great but I find it almost pointless. There is a good twist to the ending of Through the Looking Glass that leaves the reader somewhat puzzled. Although this book had little point to me, I could read it without getting bored, for something strange or absurd happened every other page.

As a kid, I was actually pretty terrified of the idea of falling through a rabbit hole, and getting lost all by myself, in a strange land. Add in the scary character of the Queen of Hearts, and I swore to myself, never to wander off around alone, as a strange rabbit might appear and force me to follow him! I had a pretty wild imagination when I was a child. It's bad, because this often is the cause of my nightmares.I decided to lay off the whole \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" scene, and promised never to read the book. I didn't break this promise for years! Until now. In fact, I have only read Lewis Carroll's until just about a month ago. I know, it's a bit disappointing in my part that I have never read this, but what can I say.. a promise is a promise, right?Review: First of all, I have to say, this is still one of those stories that have the most unforgettable characters ever made. Lewis Carroll created such whimsical characters such as the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, the talking flowers, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and so many more. It's kind of amazing to say the least that all these unique characters all come from one story!The best part though, in my opinion, coming from an adult reader, is the symbolism of this story. Almost all the characters play a part of something in real life -- a metaphor, in a way. The wordplay as well, are witty and clever. Both are done in an extremely subtle way, that most would overlook them. That is probably one of the reasons why this is a classic, and has been around for so long. I feel as though children, as this book was intended for, would see this as a fun book with fun characters. Adults, on the other hand, while they will still appreciate it for the same reasons, would also love this as it will challenge them, and teach them subtle messages, while bringing them back to their childhood all at once.I highly recommend this novel to any reader, no matter how old or young they are.

Of the many many illustrators who have tackled these two volumes, Anne Bachelier must be one of the most delightful.

I reread this with some trepidation as I remembered reading and enjoying it several times as a child, but was pleasantly surprised to find it just as magical as I did then.I won't bore anyone with the details of the story as I'm sure that most who are reading this review are familiar with it. Suffice it to say that Alice's journey into Wonderland is still rather wonderful.Alice still comes off as a bratty know-it-all, but I thought that when I was younger, so it did not change my feelings towards the book. The humor is well thought out, reading through it as an adult, I caught many more of the clever puns than I did before, so that made for some refreshing new discoveries.I would reccommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it or at least hasn't read it since their childhood. It is a quick, enjoyable read that takes ones mind into a magical land of wonder.Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found ThereThrough the Looking Glass continues Alice's adventures. This time, as Alice is playing with Dyna's new kittens, she takes to wondering what is beyond the room that she sees on the other side of the looking glass. Before she knows it, Alice has pushed her way through the looking glass and is in the backwards world on the other side!The faniciful creatures that Alice runs into here are as colorful, and in some cases even more so, as the characters from Wonderland. There's the talking flower garden, a run-in with the Tweedles, a host of chess pieces of varying ranks, a unicorn, a lion and many, many more. Along with the Tweedles, my personal favorite is a white knight who can barely stay mounted upon his steed.The magic and wonder from the first of Alice's adventures is still very present and, although the book sometimes gets confusing because things come and go so rapidly, I believe that I actually found it to be more enjoyable than the first. I highly reccommend it to children of ALL ages. If you feel like some simple fun and joy, settle back in a comfy chair with a nice cup of cocoa and let your mind journey Through the Looking Glass with Alice and discover all of the wonders that she finds there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is one of those books you can still enjoy as an adult even though it was written for children. The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing \\"Beautiful Soup,\\" most beautifully I must add. He also recited \\"Jabberwocky\\" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:\\"The time has come,' the Walrus said,\\"To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.\\"Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:\\"Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!\\" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. \\"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"Those who pick up ALICE IN WONDERLAND seeking to read a book mirroring the Disney movie version will be sorely disappointed. Those who wish to read a delightful children's story that will enchant and entertain readers young and old need look no further.ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS have very little in the way of plot - little Alice is thrown into a strange world where nothing seems quite right. She changes in size, is confronted by the imperious Queen of Hearts, has tea with a number of quirky characters; each new situation she encounters is \\"curiouser and curiouser\\" than the next. What the stories lack in plot, they make up for twentyfold in character. Carroll created a whimsical world for his young readers, and its charm spills over to entertain even the old. One cannot help but be charmed by his extraordinary imagination and fast-paced yet fun-filled writing style.ALICE AND WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS do not disappoint - they are cherished treasures among children and the young at heart - anyone who still has yet to discover their own \\"Wonderland.\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"The White Rabbit.

Alice is on a journey of discovery--who she is and what the world consists of. Her journey intersects with mine--rereading this book feels like coming home. It is familiar, warm, and comforting.If you know Alice only through Disney, you are denying yourself a great joy.

It was thrilling and adventreous. It felt like I was right there with Alice going through the adventure with her every step of the way. I would recomend this book to people of all ages not only because of it is adventures but because it had a wide varity of caracters that were funny and some that you can relate to. Some of the characters are, the white rabbit the queen of hearts, the white queen, and my favorite Alice. Alice is very curious and likes to explore wonderland. Alice's adventure in wonderland and through the looking glass is a wonderful book and is full of adventure and wondering."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I feel that this was a really good book. Like most people, I'd seen various versions of the movie Alice in Wonderland and was curious about the books, particularly Through the Looking Glass, which is never mentioned anywhere. The movies are based on a combination of elements from both books, includnig quirky poems with imaginary words.There were a lot of concepts that aren't in any movies I've seen, such as the talking chess pieces. Instead of one queen, there are two queens and two kings, just as in chess. This isn't just a children's book. I feel it's interesting for all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"A prophetic tome which foretold the gathering storm of the 20th century: moral relativism, social disintegration, lethal authoritarianism, the absurd.

Sam Vaknin, author of Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"A traditional child'book but it was a lot of fun and a change of pace to read as a grown-up. I just LOVED the characters that Alice encounters on her adventures and I also loved the story's word-play and witticism.Out of the two stories, Through the Looking Glass, although less famous, is the more linear and I think entertaining but both are amazingly creative and bizarre stories and are both short enough so that they should be read together."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I really like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel because it is so whimsical. The way Dodgson made fun of Alice so much makes one laugh until tears come pouring down. He based the character Alice, on his friend; a real life Alice. Throughout the book, he constantly makes references to her, or something related to her. For example, when a character asks her the exact day Alice replies May 4th. May 4th is the real life Alice's birthday. Alice walks through Wonderland, and she sees many strange things, but thinks otherwise. If you like poems, you will certainly like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel, for both books contain numerous poems. However, in the book Carroll takes the original poems and creates a parody out of them. Something interesting to know is that all the poems relate to the chapters. These are all minor details, but something to muse over. On the surface, Alice in Wonderland is a book where she meets weird creatures and walks away from them always feeling humiliated, as she thinks she is smarter than she really is. That is most of Alice in Wonderland.Alice through the Looking Glass is similar to the prequel, yet glaringly different. The whole book revolves around a chess game, and so the character's actions correspond to moves on the chessboard. Alice joins in the game, starts out as a white pawn, and proceeds to move until she becomes a queen. At each square, she meets a new character, but in one chapter, characters from the previous book are in this one too. An important thing to know in this famous classic is that everything is backwards. It makes sense since Alice is on the other side of a mirror, yet she encounters difficulty sometimes in understanding this. But in the end, she manages to become a queen and to checkmate the red king. Both books are very enjoyable, and I strongly advocate both children and adults to read it. Enjoy!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the &quot;why?&quot; question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot; &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;. You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time. Don't be satisfied with a movie edition or simplified version of Alice - nothing is as enjoyable as the original! Truly a classic for the child in all of us!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"I would argue that this text offers more than WONDERLAND.

Unfortunately I bought this book solely with the intent to photocopy and enlarge the images for a Alice themed party so it makes the purchase moot, but the story is nice..."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","review":"As a child I pretty much hated ALICE and all the other works of Lewis Carroll. To begin with, I hated the illustrations. They were ugly and gave me the creeps. Although my language was English it was very different from the English that Carroll wrote. I didn't understand half the words. I didn't know what a hedgehog or a dormouse was. Nor was I familiar with mock turtle soup. But its major crime was that it was static. Nothing really happened. She just met a lot of unpleasant individuals and finally woke up. Fast forward sixty years and I have just read it for a class and found it quite enjoyable! First of all, I love the Tenniel illustrations. Yes, they are ugly, but that's what makes them unforgettable. Carroll is not Disney. His little animals are not cuddly and don't whistle happy tunes and are rarely, if ever, helpful. Tenniel makes that clear. Second, I had no idea as a child that it was funny. I did not get any of the jokes or understand any of the riddles. This time I laughed out loud several times. The poems that I could not abide as a child I now find fascinating and rather beautiful, especially the White Knight's verse. Alice STILL has no plot, however, which is why it's not very compelling reading. However, both these books are mercifully brief.Whether one actually likes these books or not, they are important to English literature and are referred to and referenced constantly in other works. So ALICE is essential reading if one wants to be considered an educated English speaker. It's open to many interpretations and many people find it a profound work. The Signet paperback contains all the Tenniel illustrations."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"Rosabeth Moss Kanter is one of our finest thinkers about organizational change. In Evolve!, she has taken on a very large challenge. She attempts to help the young and the old, the e-hip and the offline, the techies and the nontechies, and those in new economy and old economy companies understand one another better so they can cooperate for greater results through using the Internet as an enabling medium. She also takes a look at beneficial cultures separately from the perspectives of pure dot com companies, dotcom-enablers (like Sun Microsystems), and wannadots (already-established companies seeking to add the Internet to their businesses). In the process, she provides lots of helpful examples of what NOT TO DO, as well as what TO DO both in terms of what kind of organization to create and how to get there. I found that the book added a great deal to my storehouse of case histories about what has been working and what has not as companies have sought to develop and improve Internet-based business models. Unlike most books about the Internet, this one was primarily based on lots of research with people at companies rather than lots of experience in using cool Web sites.The book is divided into three parts. The first section looks at how the Internet affects every business and person, the role of young people to date in advancing the changes, and why companies have to do more than just open a web site to be effective. Basically, the Internet means a fundamental change in at least part of every company's business model. For some companies, this is a complete change. For others, it is a partial, but significant change. Cisco Systems provides a good example. You can be a major provider of high technology products while having very little manufacturing youself. Dell Computer is another helpful example. You can have negative receivables and no inventory while manufacturing products to order in minutes. Anyone would like to be able to move profitably in these directions.The second section identifies the qualities that allow a company's culture to work well in e-commerce. Professor Kanter focuses here on the need to create generations of rapid change each of which is well received by the beneficiaries, how to create truly supportive and effective networks of partners, reconfiguring the business and organizational structure to improve the business model, and attracting and retaining the top talent needed to make these improvements.The third section looks at initiating and enabling the change process towards the model of e-effectiveness. The roles of leaders, organizations, and of individuals are identified . . . as well as the sources of friction and resistance.I thought that the book was exceptionally well done. It's weaknesses come from having taken on such a large topic and challenge. But Professor Kanter succeeds in most areas quite well.Those who work in dot com companies that are facing bankruptcy will not find enough here to help them sort through their issues. Those who want to establish a new dot com from scratch also will find this book to be useful, but not a complete resource for that purpose (as Professor Kanter warns in the book). The book was primarily researched while the dot com companies were flush with cash and valuations on the stock market were still quite high. So, although there are references to stocks falling after March 2000, the book reflects in many ways a world that doesn't exactly exist right now for dot com companies.For dotcom-enablers, they will get a few ideas about how to satisfy the need to keep revitalizing their business model. But most of this will not seem new to them, if they have been at all successful.For wannadots, this book will help lift the veil of how to get from here to there. The main benefit will be to help avoid problems that others have experienced. You can save tens of millions of dollars and start delivering benefits to your customers much sooner if you follow the change lessons here. The senior executives in these companies should be the prime beneficiaries of this book . . . the Harvard B-School grads of a few years ago, or more.Metaphors are very helpful for understanding new subjects. The metaphors here, although apt, are ones that many readers will not find to be very much within their experience. For that reason, the points will be a bit lost. For example, the idea of continuing innovating and creating rapid improvements is linked to what improvisational actors do. I have had some improvisational training, so this made sense to me (see Robert Lowe's book, Improvisation, Inc.). I do not know many corporate executives in large companies however who do have this experience. I suspect this metaphor will be lost on them. Some of the other metaphors also lack an experience base for most readers, as well.A potential weakness of this book for some readers is that they will not get enough information for how to identify ways to create more profitable and sustainable business models. To date, most Internet innovations have led to lower profits . . . not higher ones -- whether they came from dot coms, dotcom-enablers, or dotcome wannabes. If more skill is not applied in this important area of conceptualizing what the new structure of the business should become, you may evolve . . . but not into any place where you want to be.Reading this book today, you'd have to say that if you are not going to be a dotcom enabler, you'd better watch out."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"I found Evolve! by Rosabeth Moss Kanter to be a fascinating look at how the Internet has changed the business world. As someone in his mid-20's working at a company that is stumbling into the Internet age, I know that Kanter's insights are right on target.The best part of the book is its case studies. Kanter's extensive research enables her to give the reader behind-the-scenes stories of businesses struggling to succeed (as well as businesses struggling with success). These stories are fun and easy to digest -- I seriously couldn't put it down once I started reading it. The stories are woven together seamlessly, and each one is just as fascinating as the last. They uncover the inner-workings of business, which makes an understanding of familiar companies like E-Bay, IBM, BarnesandNoble.com, and Sun Microsystems much richer.This book is also particularly good because it reveals the benefits and drawbacks of the &quot;dot-com style.&quot; We have all been attracted to this type of work environment (no dress code, cool office spaces) and Kanter understands this -- but she has a fresh perspective on the extent to which this style can enhance or cramp an organization. She also explains the demands that the Internet has placed on businesses to be quick to move, network, improvise, and take chances.As an employee myself, I found one of the best lessons to be that there are ways of making your job more meaningful, and there are ways of making your company feel more like a community. Some of it involves peppering the &quot;dot-com style&quot; around the company, but that is just a tool -- it has more to do with communication and teamwork.Overall, this book is a great source of insights all told in Kanter's enthusiastic, animated narrative. I have recommended it to my friends and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in understanding the real story behind how e-business has impacted and will continue to impact all types of businesses, from the inside-out."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"As a long-time strategy consultant who has worked with hundreds of companies and now as an entrepreneur establishing a new company in Asia, utilizing the Internet, I find Evolve! to be packed with extremely useful ideas and powerful lessons. I recently spoke at a forum on the major challenges facing businesses in Greater China over the next ten years. Having just read Evolve!, I centered my talk around the new environment, new culture and new rules affecting businesses throughout the world, as a result of the Internet. These changes and their implications are certainly revolutionary, but they are also evolutionary. The attendees unanimously agreed that mastering this topic is a key success factor for their businesses.Evolve! provides excellent perspectives on how the web acts both as a stimulus for new organizational culture and as a facilitator for change -- allowing this culture to change in an orderly and timely manner.The extensive research done for this book provides fascinating case studies, anecdotes and insights for those readers who already have considerable experience with the Internet world. For readers who have less firsthand exposure to the key elements of the Internet and all that it implies the book provides, in an easy to relate to manner, excellent insights into understanding how the workplace of today needs to evolve in the future."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"Moss Kanter's book is over-hyped from the cover onward. Three problems: 1) the book starts with the obligatory writing of 2 sections filled with gross generalizations with little data to support many of the statements (despite professing to have major data to support her conclusions), 2) The book was clearly started back during the Internet Hype days before the bubble burst. I will admit that there do appear a few last minute editorial insertions referencing the March 2000 start of the meltdown but her praise of companies without substantive business models betrays the age of the text. 3) I know it is bad to spoil the endings of books but I have got to, Moss Kanter finally, in the last third of the book, gets to the point of outlining how dumb organizations can evolve in this way cool internet era. However, if you look at her recipe endnote you will see that she is digging up a basic organizational change model that she introduced in the early 1990's and has simply churned it through Internet start-up war stories. E-volving? Hardly. New and invigorating? Doubtful. Relevant? Only if you have been asleep for the last 4 years. Having been hard on the book, I do think it has a 3-star place on my bookshelf but clearly it won't be equal to my often referenced, dog-eared copy of &quot;Competing for the Future&quot; or &quot;The Knowledge-Creating Company.&quot;"},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"In college I studied Greek Philosophy.

Her insight, deduced from extensive research, into the Digital Culture of today is extremely helpful to those of us who wish to learn,live and thrive in this new economy.Congratulations and thank you Dr. Kanter"},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"In the genre of e-commerce handbooks Evolve! does not give all the answers. There is no blueprint step by step process to Internet success that is outlined in her writings. Rather, the book presents a view of the correct culture, and outlook of a successful e-business. Social interactions are modified, and conflict is encouraged. In the end the focus is then shifter to the individual who is reading the book. Attention is given to the qualities of an effective leader in a fast changing internet environment where one must be a salesman and visionary while keeping track of concrete deadlines. Evolve! also has a large collection of research to back its claims. The Author, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, is a Harvard professor with a multitude of graduate students at her disposal. This gives her book a large amount of data and research into the various companies that have shaped the Internet and the world of e-business. It divides the players into the categories of Dotcoms, Dotcom Enablers, and Wannadots. It also shows the mistakes, and changes that occurred when the market leaders were first developing their focuses and strategies. To me the greatest aspect of the book is the in-depth historical perspective on the last four years in Silicon Valley. Big players, and company insiders give valuable information on their struggles to become the market leaders. The information is current, the background information is informative, and its message is useful."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"While this book offers great insights and anecdotes from the business world, social sector leaders ought to sit up and take notice -- our world has changed too. EVOLVE! offers important lessons for nonprofit managers and government executives charged with organizational strategy and everyday management.One other fact worth mentioning -- Rosabeth Moss Kanter is a great writer -- easy to follow, witty, interesting, and smart. While this is a big volume backed by lots of research, it is a quick read and one that will leave you excited to apply what she's taught."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"I have recently held several positions working in e-business units at some major companies in the New York city area. I am a 20-something &quot;computer guy,&quot; but have a strong interest in business management. At my last couple of jobs, I have witnessed so many senior managers make major blunders as they have tried to move away from their antiquated, old-school business management formulas into e-business. It seems like only a few companies have found the right mix of on- and off-line strategies. These concepts all came together for me while reading Kanter's &quot;Evolve.&quot; She makes more sense of everything that has gone on since the rise of the Internet than anything else I have read. Her research is extensive, thorough, and interesting -- and her writing is really quite good. Her enthusiasm makes this book a page-turner, as corny as that may sound. But I recommend it fully, because it helped me think through all of the things I have been witnessing. If the managers I worked for had read Evolve and taken some of Kanter's lessons to heart, I might still be working there. There is a lot for everyone to learn in this book -- for managers, staff, and just people interested in what happened to the dot-coms."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"Evolve by Professor Moss Kanter at Harvard Business School has transformed my way of thinking about the dot-com revolution. I worked on changing my unit of a traditional bricks-and-mortar business into an e-business. Moss Kanter had incredible foresight. Her ability to grasp the big picture, and translate a variety of business changes into easy-to-understand lessons is truly remarkable. Not only does she explain the roots of the dotcom revolution and its enduring lessons for the future, but she predicts the dot-com bubble bursting. This should be required reading for business managers in any industry."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"This book combines an outstanding read with a serious wake-up call. It lays out clearly how established companies must address the revolutionary changes the internet has brought. It is one of the few texts on the new economy which is based on extensive research. The wisdom is rooted in fact and not fancy. If you are in an old-economy company (not a dotcommer) it makes for frightening reading. The internet provides a new imperative for change - to Evolve. However, compared with the re-engineering change programs of the 80's and early 90's this new imperative is insidious - the need for change is not so obvious - not driven by some foreign enemy or some financial downturn. The internet changes the basis for competing - but many companies cannot see the danger.In this book, Rosabeth Kanter clearly lays out the need for change. However, she goes much further, providing working examples of what has worked and what has not. She explains the good news - that the fundamentals of business, and in particular change management remain the same. However, she also articulates the dangers for those who do not embrace this new revolution with as much drive and energy as the crises which drove large change programs in the past. As a manager in an old-economy company, this book both frightened and excited me. Fear that we will not embrace the new dawn and excitement at the prospects if we do. It should be compulsory reading for managers at all levels throughout the established economy."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"Evolve!: Succeeding in the digital culture of tomorrowBy Rosabeth Moss Kantor, Arbuckle Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School(Harvard Business School Press 2001)E-culture collaboration is \\"good\\" but superficiality is not.Reviewer: Vigdor Schreibman\\"Evolve!\\" convincingly discloses the truth of the e-culture guided by the law of the internet, which advances collaboration. This confirms my own conclusion (on less formidable evidence) at the start of the year in an article on CyberspaceCapital. However, Ms. Kantor also suggests this \\"E-culture is superficial--in good ways.\\" That finding is a serious error!Ms. Kantor reasons that that \\"Internet time requires fast, cryptic, communications among strangers who cannot take the time to interpret subtleties or build a deep relationship based on intimate knowledge.\\" Of course, some communications will always be of the superficial kind in a business and social environment but broad limitation of communications to superficiality is not a good derived from any inherent need or desire of mass users of Internet communications. Preclusive limitations of the possibilities of Internet technology have trapped mass users into the ethic of superficiality. A dominant mode of communications trapped in superficiality is a disaster thriving on chaos instead of advancing the possibilities of democratic coherence. That communications style is exactly the opposite of what is needed in a world of increasing complexity and murderous desperation of many.Ironically, the observation that \\"E-culture is superficial--in good ways,\\" betrays the wisdom of a true advocate of democracy, as Ms Kantor passionately described, for example, in her preface to Mary Parker Follett, Prophet of Management, which was published as a Harvard Business School Press Classic, in 1996, but is now \\"out of print\\"! In her book \\"The New State\\" (1918), Follett anticipated development of a \\"technique of democracy\\" to realize those democratic ideals. This long anticipated breakthrough, evidencing a revolutionary shift in the process of dialogue, has actually been achieved during the past several decades by design science but the benefits of meaningful dialogue have been artificially limited to elite users, as I disclose in an article on the \\"Civilizations of opportunism\\" published by CyberspaceCapital.These developments are part of the increasing gap that exists between the information rich and the information poor, which Ms. Kantor now exacerbates by suggesting that the \\"E-culture is superficial--in good ways.\\" This is wrong, and the reasoning offered should be rejected. Wise information technology specialists and business administration educators must support betterment of the e-culture, including equal access where this is possible, rather than offering tenuous support for another structure benefitting the privileged elite."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"How should individuals and businesses be changing in order to succeed in a digital world?

The depth of the story is phenomenal. The emotions and the scenery that Burnard describes are incredible, it is written beautifully. When i started to read 'A Good House' I could picture where the story took place, the scenery, the family setting and the house where a lot of the story takes place. By the end of the story I had went through someone's family and observed watching the characters grown and the changing of communication between them. 'A Good House' will keep the readers attention and keep them wondering what will happen next. The book is definitely a reader. A good House takes place in Ontario. Burnard writes about the Chanber family who goes through hardships and throughout the book she documents the characters growing and changing lifestyles that occur through the years. There are many hardships that the family endures overtime- a mother dies, divorces, affairs, out of wedlock children and other encounter's that life brings. Burnard documents over six decades of the Canadian family. As Burnard writes she does so with such feeling and compassion that makes the reader feel for what the family is going through. A Good House is a well-written book that grabs the reader's attention from the beginning and the reader can easily visualize what is taking place. It is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"I was delighted to discover someone was combining the concepts of improvisational theatre and business culture. I have been performing improvisationally and teaching improvisation for years. A few years ago I was struck by the link between the speed of change in the corporate world and the mechanics of the disciplin of improvisation. So I started taking this message to the corporate world and discovered that, although it was a hard sell at first, as anything more than a day of fun, once they experienced the principles of improv at work the link was very clear to most of them.I think Ms. Kanter has struck at the heart of how speed and e-culture have changed business paradigms. Pointing out how the relationships between people and not with technology is the real challenge. You can no longer develop, institute and manage long-term business paradigms. Things are just changing to fast. The ability to really improvise allows you work with diferent groups to be on top of each change and use the speed to create momentum. As Ms.Kanter outlines perfectly, you need a culture of improvisation.I think the examples in evolve!, of corporations that have grasped the notion of improvisation while not always characterizing it strictly as that, are dead on.I hope everyone in a position of power in the corporate world reads evolve! and sees the light. It is a constant evolution; the speed has just increased dramatically. It is not about inside or outside the &quot;box&quot;...it is about building a new &quot;box&quot; every day!

Case studies in this book are very useful source, and are helpful to readers to understand what are the changes and challenges that E-volution brings to organizations and how to manage it effectively and efficiently. It talks about new culture- the E-culture, a different way of thinking, working and succeeding. If you doubt, whether it is necessary for an organization to adapt Internet to maintain its ongoing success, this is book for you. You will be able to decide whether Internet is a choice or a must. This book is not a set of long running essays, or well defined set of steps and rules that teaches how to leap in to internet age, but is a set of case studies and analysis of different organizations that have thrived to mange this change. This gives us understanding about challenges of change, knowledge about the essence of E-fictiveness, and information about how to lead the change and cultivate the human skills required for an Internet-enabled world. In short, I would say that this book has done a pretty good job in analyzing different organizational efforts, to evolve to Internet age, and many ventures and start-ups that created Internet success.

But when you see a book of around 350 pages expounding on this topic, you might be concerned about how much value you will derive from reading. \\"Evolve\\" is engaging and contains the ideas Kanter has written about elsewhere (as in her HBR article \\"The Ten Deadly Mistakes of Wanna-Dots\\"), such as the differences between dot.coms, dot.com enablers, and \\"wanna-dots\\". This book addresses issues of profound importance for organizations attempting to transform their culture, processes, and architecture to take advantage of the Internet. Skimming this book will reveal some useful ideas, but much of the real content can be found in the HBR article. The book is filled with interesting examples and detailed cases of around 25 companies including: e-Bay, Drugstore.com, CNBC.com, and e-commerce venture at Williams-Sonoma and Cisco. Many busy executives, however, may be frustrated looking for the meat amidst the stories.Kanter excels at presenting ideas that may not be particularly new in ways that are innovative and picturesque. For example, the third chapter \\"Lipstick on a Bulldog: Why Cosmetic Change Doesn't Work\\" will make you turn to that page, but you will find mostly company anecdotes. (The best part of the chapter, her \\"anti-rules\\" for success, already appeared in the HBR article.) Readers may enjoy her presentation of business strategy for Web-dependent companies as being like improvisational theater, but will probably agree that the biggest obstacles to change are not technological but grounded in management and employee attitudes. Though the book was published in 2001, it already sounds dated in some respects. Kanter's sharp distinct between dot.coms and wanna-dots no longer sounds convincing. Neither do her observations that unprofitable Internet businesses get high stock market valuations. Kanter's prescriptions for encouraging change may not be as actionable as in some other books and shorter writings."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"Choosing the right metaphor is one of the best ways to assure your ideas (if you have any) will endure. Rosabeth Moss Kanter (or her editors) have failed by confusing evolution and learning.A species evolves by having the old individuals that make up the species die or divide. Individuals don't evolve. Individuals can only learn.I am always concerned when someone misuses a metaphor, particularly when it figures prominently in their work. If they can't get THAT right, what else have they gotten wrong?The ideas in the book seem tired to me as well, but I would like to leave you with the above thought as an example of critical evaluation of a books \\"cover\\" or title. It is a particularly useful skill for readers who are considering investing time and money on a book before there are reviews."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"Throughout human history, most revolutions share a common cause, a shared commitment, courage, passion, sacrifice, determination, and varying degrees of impact. Darwinists believe that all organisms participate in a process of natural selection. In the 21st century, organizations (like organisms) must therefore initiate or respond effectively to revolutions inorder to survive. That is, they must recognize major developments (what Kuhn calls \\"paradigm shifts,\\" what Grove calls \\"inflection points,\\" and what Gladwell calls \\"tipping points\\"), preferably before they begin. Meanwhile, prudence dictates that these organizations carefully select their terms of engagement with their competition, allocating their resources with great care.I recently re-read e*Volve, curious to learn how relevant it remains in light of what has (and has not) happened since it was first published early last year. My conclusion is that it is even more relevant now than it was then. The material is based on more than 300 interviews, a survey of more than 700 companies, and various case studies developed at the Harvard Business School. Kanter and her research associates analyzed a combination of traditional companies (e,g, Arrow, Barnes & Noble, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Sun Microsystems) and what are generally referred to as \\"dot coms\\" (e.g. Amazon, EarthWeb, eBay, and Razorfish) to determine how these companies attempted to achieve success in \\"the digital culture of tomorrow.\\"It would be a disservice to Kanter as well as to those who read this review to summarize the tentative conclusions which Kanter shares. (Read the book and you'll understand why such conclusions are necessarily tentative.) For me, the greater value of this book (and of all others she has written, notably When Giants Learn to Dance and Innovation) is derived from the questions she asks rather than from the answers she offers. No one else asks more probing questions than does Kanter. Why do some \\"revolutions\\" in business succeed and others fail? Which organizations (non-profits as well as for-profits) have either launched and then sustained successful \\"revolutions\\" or responded effectively to them? How and why? Within any organization, what must be allowed to \\"evolve,\\" especially in today's competitive marketplace?If you are a decision-maker now struggling to answer questions such as these, I highly recommend this book. With Kanter's expert assistance, you can determine which are the most important questions your own organization must ask. She will also assist the immensely difficult process of obtaining answers to those questions. That said, I presume to offer one final word of caution, one with which I hope Kanter agrees: At all times keep in mind that both questions and answers are transient. Whether circumstances e*volve or re*volve, they change and often do so at the most inconvenient time."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"I admit, I was suspicious: a business book with a hip-hop song-summary?

The book begins with by challenging the new economy with having had a \\"lobotomy\\" about basic business fundamentals. Then, using examples from both private and public sector companies, Kanter shows how digital innovation can be achieved within a company. As usual, she skewers the cliches and uses them to expose the shallow thinking that has led to disaster.Taking on the vast opportunity of the net to create an instant, interactive community, she offers a dozen or more cases of both/and companies that have conducted business in traditional media, and utilized the internet. She gets beyond the technical whiz bang, to look at the human possibilities of a global community.Kanter is a sociologist, and she is able to look at best practices, and present them so that they become clear and usable. For example, her take on strategy, which is a mix of opportunism and solid intention, is that it is a form of improvisational theatre. Her perspective keeps a clear focus on both the people who make the company work, and the broader purposes and outcomes that a company can achieve using new technology. Unlike almost any other management book, her examples always include socially responsible and public sector examples.And this is absolutely the only management book that begins with a rap song!"},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"This book is about changes and challenges in the Internet age.

It is very well written. It does not contain the Internet-craze style or a sale pitch but rather put the issues into proper perspective. The book not only covers the most current day-to-day e-Commerce issues, but also emphasis the changes in corporations or, in a broader sense, the mankind required for survival or to catch the Internet wave to success. The book shows all the hows to: deal with organizations, deal with people, and deal with unknowns. Overall, I would recommend this book to all the people who are not satisfied with the status quo and would like to make a difference.This book is organized in three parts. The first part describes the challenges of change and shows how the Internet affects corporations and individuals. There are plenty of examples. The author discusses a wide spectrum of challenges faced by young and seasoned organizations. Basically, the author states that the Internet has redefined the business world and as a result, these changes, along with competitions from new dimensions, make corporations feel vulnerable and forced them to make changes. Many times corporations with a longer history feel that they have the disadvantages against younger companies because of their size, structure and legacy. The author then gave examples of different stages (blame, denial, cosmetic changes and finally fundamental) that BarnsandNoble.com has gone through when facing the challenges of the uprising competitor Amazon.com.In the second part of the book the author presents a road map that corporations must have in order to achieve e-effectiveness. Because of the lightening speed and boundless of the Internet, corporations have to change their operation from more planning to more improvising. Does it mean chaos? You can count on it. Does it mean no defense and open for conquer? The author suggests not. The technology is there and the people are there ready to contribute. Another point the author makes is that in order to be an active player, strategy development and network of partners formation must be implemented both on and offline. Also, fundamental changes of the organization and using creative ways to retain talents are a must to stay ahead of this game of the century.The third part of the book gives a practical guide about changes that I found most helpful. The author repeatedly emphasizes getting out of our comfort zone and roll up our sleeves to make the changes. She describes changes as a way of life, which is something we are already practicing. The higher objective of changes is to motivate others. The author suggests that changes we made must mean something to others, which put us back to the proper perspective. We need to take ownership of shared vision and openly communicate with others. Obviously, there will be barriers and there will be worries but it is up to us whether we allow them to be stumbling blocks. The author states that successful change makers are system thinkers, excellent communicators and innovators. I could not agree more. I actually have read another book called \\"Leading Change\\" by John P. Kotter, also a Harvard professor. While Professor Kotter presents his ideas of how to lead changes systematically, Professor Kanter takes a more human and social approach to show how changes are made. Overall, this book covers so much and it would be a must read for people who have any interest in e-Commerce."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"I am an MBA student at San Jose State University, taking an E-commerce class as part of my required curriculum. Evolve is the first book I have read on the subject, and I found it a very informative, insightful book into the e-commerce world. Rosabeth Moss Kanter gives some very relevant examples that I believe can be applied to the e-business world, as well as providing some general information that would be helpful to anyone starting a business, let alone an e-business.Living in Silicon Valley exposes one to many personal experiences with the internet culture, as well as the culture of many technology companies. This book, however, allows a unique perspective of offering a comparison between many of the dotcoms. Utilizing extensive research, Ms. Kanter provides not only a non-biased perspective, but also a baseline for comparison. This is done by showing examples of how different companies attempt to break into new or established markets, and the results of some of these key ventures.This book starts out by explaining some of the basic principles behind e-culture, and who defines it. There are many aspects of this new culture when compared with the traditional bricks-and-mortar companies. You have a very technologically driven group of people, typically much younger than old-economy companies. At the same time, there are many bricks-and-mortar companies that attempt to enter into the internet realm, and they often must relinquish control to a younger, more technologically minded group of people.The challenge of many e-businesses is to incorporate necessary business tactics, while keeping the mindset that the internet is a whole new way of reaching out to people, and this must be cultivated, not stifled. In addition, there are many young people, new to the business world, trying to build the internet into a tool to sell products or services in ways that traditional companies would have never dreamed possible. So you end up with entrepreneurs inside of established companies, fighting to create e-commerce sites that must enhance, and sometimes compete with, the established companies' business. At the same time, there is often animosity among the people trying to build the traditional business of the people who do not fit in with the company culture.This is a very interesting book, which is quite easy to read. Being an MBA student, and a person with interest in technology, I found this book an excellent foray into the world of e-business. I believe this book would be helpful to anyone thinking of starting an e-commerce business from scratch, or one building an e-commerce site to enhance an existing business. Logically, one of the reasons that most companies fail is because they either do not have a viable product or service, or because they made too many irrecoverable mistakes. This book will give some insight into some of the original internet pioneers, and will show where some of them went wrong. I would say that the only aspect where this book doesn't quite live up to its potential is that the specific examples are not clearly identified to results of those actions. This makes it somewhat difficult to interpret exactly where a company might have failed. Rather, it is the culture and interpersonal aspects of the examples that might indicate the cause of success or failure, but not any specific instances or decisions that can be identified."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"I'd gotten this book thinking it was the latest and greatest of business books.

For those who want anything of substance, this bit of fluff will be a throw-away book. I wouldn't even lend it to others, it's so bad.Get Customers.Com by Seybold instead."},{"Title":"Evolve! : Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow","review":"After reading Rosabeth's book, I took one immediate step.

Written back in 2001 -- the book still deserves to be on the shelf of every business exec or entrepreneur in this continually evolving new economy (and at the bargain price it's available on Amazon.com -- add it to your collection now). Kanter talks about talent, change (not just cosmetic) and social evolution...community takes a big role. Perhaps the one element she could have covered better is content-- since so much of what we see today is user generated content and content that is 2-way interactive.

It is written in the dot-com era. And there is indeed a lot of hype on the young start-ups' heroic characteristics such as speed, flexibility, and courage that traditional large companies couldn't compete with in the short run. Today, we all know that these characteristics didn't stand the test of time in a ruthless competitive landscape.But I'll still recommend this book for a special target audience: People, who are working on an e-business project for a traditional corporation will still get much inspiration from Moss-Kanter's book. Also in retrospect, I find that her best sections in the book were those on describing the tough change management processes that she found in successful \\"old economy\\" firms like Williams-Sonoma, Honeywell, and Reuters. In all these companies, a strong conventional company culture made it extremely difficult for the e-business team to navigate towards success. In 2005, many companies have still not made much of their business model online.This is also a very important book for me personally. I read this book on a vacation to Cyprus in May 2001 just before taking on a long 3-year assignment as an e-business manager for a large industrial firm in Denmark. I experienced most of the difficulties that Moss-Kanter describes in her book.I find the merit of this book in the very colourful case stories of traditional organizations' struggle with e-business initiatives. The author conducted more than 300 interviews of both traditional companies and dotcoms, successes and failures alike, in a research project before writing this book.As you may know, Harvard professor Moss-Kanter is a leading expert on change management.

Maximus is the emperor's most trusted General and the emperor has him in mind to be the next man to rule the Roman Empire. Commodus, the emperor's jealous heir, is outraged by his father's decision and murders his father, emperor Marcus Aurelius, to gain control of the throne. Commodus's first order of business as emperor is to make it so that general Maximus Meridas can never deceive him, so he has Maximus's wife and son slautered and then sends Maximus into exile. Devastated and Deeply wounded by the murdering of his family, Maximus finds a new way of life that makes him even stronger, emotionally as well as physically, than he was before. Maximus begins the hard and enduring life of being a gladiator. Maximus makes new friends and pays close attention to what his heart and his soul tell him while he is a gladiator. As Maximus rises to the top of the gladiator world, he plans a heroic and defiant way to gain his revenge. I really enjoyed this book. It was a gory, cut-them-up book as well as a movie. However, there was a lot more to the story than just the fighting and death. The author, Dewey Gran, did a really good job of introducing the readers to the main character, Maximus. As you read about his family getting killed, you get a big lump in your throat. It makes you feel the outrage that the main character is going through as it happens. The one thing that I didn't like about the book is that it was written to follow the movie, and I had already seen the movie when I read the book. My recommendation is to read the book, then go see the movie. There were no surprises to what was going to happen. It is a great book for anybody who doesn't mind some gory details."},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"Gram did a good job, with a merit: the book is fast-paced, well written, very joyful to read.

The writer of this, Dewey Gram, has a wonderful mind. Digging back into the past to Ancient Rome was just absoulutely incredible idea. When I saw this movie, I wanted to do it for a project at my school. My Independent Reading Program (IRP)I chose this book, then I did it for another major project which is Personal Project and I did Roman Gladiators and Colosseum and I think that the book is exceptionaly recomended for people with and interest in Ancient Rome and that have somewhat to an extensive vocabulary."},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"Dewey Grahm does the impossible and successfully give us the story of Maximus.

Have we read the cover where it says 'Based on the screenplay by David Franzoni' ect.? It does however, contrary to popular belief, define some terminolgy that I myself did not understand in the movie. The ranking officers names in a straight-forward, understandable way. This book is no classic, but it does deserve a good review becuase it is not a classic. Classics are often hard to understand and impossible to comprehend for me (Shakespear, much of Dickens) so this book is a welcome change. Four out of Five."},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"i never did like movie tie-in novels aka novelizations, they took away the essence of the movie, it usually borrows the info directly off the screenplay which i highly recommend reading rather than the novelization, in this case, the novel Gladiator doesn't do much credit to fully accentuate the marvelous plots and visualry of the movie, Ridley Scott made a stunning thought provoking historical drama that is very hard to condense into a paperbook..the language is off and it tries too hard to be more informative about the movie..honestly, dont read this before watching the movie, the only benefit of this book is that it may enchance some parts of the movie..a really good novelization is Randall Wallace's memoir of his ancestry in Braveheart...yeah Maximus! definitely stick the movie! OSCAR here we come!"},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"Anyone who's seen the movie knows that Gladiator has a strong story and script behind it. But, when it comes to novelizations I like to see a little extra background, perhaps more character development than you can have in the film. And that's where this book is a bit of a let down. This is a straight retelling of the screenplay with a couple of scenes that didn't make the movie, which where kind of nice to see. I remember when Commodus finds that Maximus is still alive and he was lied to when he thought he was dead, his sister tells him that the legion should know that lies should not be tolerated. In the movie, nothing really comes of that, but in the book it then later goes to a good scene where Commodus oversees the execution of those who told him Maximus was dead. It's just little touches like that.When I read a book, I want to feel like I'm experiencing something a little different than the movie. I felt that way when reading Terry Brooks novelization of The Phantom Menace or even Raymond Benson's novelization of Tomorrow Never Dies. I really didn't get that feeling with this one.So, in short, if you go into the book expecting the movie to be expanded on, prepare to be disappointed.

It really is a great movie and this is a great companion piece to the book. My favorite novilizations of films are those where the author interprets what is on screen. Not something that is not there, leaving the reader wondering whether or not the author and the reader saw the same thing. But Gram stays 100% faithful to what is up there on screen. He gets every nuance and every characterization perfect. I probably could not have written it better myself.

I saw the movie Gladiator 3 times before I read the book, and each time I had seen the movie, I saw something new. After I read the book Gladiator, I saw the movie 2 more times. In My Opinion, the book Gladiator is a great read if you want to learn alittle more about the characters. It also gave me a better view of what each of the characters were thinking in each scene. Some of the parts of this book filled some of the gaps, that the movie didn't show. Also, the dialogue in the book was very helpful for me when I saw the movie again, because there were some words and sentences I had missed while watching the movie. This book is just as powerful as the movie, because it explains every scene with the same details, if not more. It gives me alittle more aspect of Maximus as a Warrior, General, Husband, Father and Friend, which is one of the reasons that I really enjoyed reading this book and seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"This book, although well-written, was based solely on the screenplay. Therefore, if you are looking for further insight into the minds of the characters, you may feel disappointed. However, because the movie moves at such a lightning pace, this book succeeded in clarifying things I missed or that were unclear (i.e., Roman Empire history, what SPQR stands for, etc.). I recommend it as a nice addition to seeing the movie but it would have been better if the character development went deeper than it did."},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"Dewey Gram has produced a readable novelization of Ridley Scott's brilliant new film &quot;Gladiator.&quot; There are some minor dialogue differences from the film and a few extra scenes, and he doesn't go into the character's motivations as much he might, but he at least does slip in some historical details and the book is a nice substitute for the film until the VHS and DVD versions are available! It would have been useful, incidentally, to include an afterword pointing out the differences between the film's version of history and what really happened.

It's worth every single cent!"},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"Let's start with this novelization's strong points. First, it is utterly faithful to events in the film, which I've seen several times. You can almost hear the Zimmer/Gerrard soundtrack as you read it.The book preserves a great deal of the film's energy, intensity, pace, and hits all the high points. Some of the characterization is handled with remarkable economy.The book provides some information on Roman tactics and geography that a reader, or a viewer unfamiliar with Rome, can benefit from. It's compulsively readable, a page-turner from start to finish.But....(you knew I was going to say that...)It could have and should have been more, even given the constraints of novelizing a film such as approval by Dreamworks, confidentiality, and the speed with which these books must be written.Some of the Latin -- starting with the gladiators' battleground itself -- is inaccurate, and I'd probably quibble with some of the ways that Mr. Gram has described tactics. I've already gotten into one argument about the size of an Aurelian as opposed to a Caesarean legion, but I was pleased he got the Syrian archers.I was fascinated by the way he handled the pyrotechnics in the first battle scene, even though I'm not sure the Romans used pitch in such a way. I know they used boiling oil. I know they used naphtha, although probably not in Germania. Okay, these are quibbles that make the experience of reading the book and watching it and arguing with friends enjoyable, and if you're not interested in details of military history, strategy, and tactics, they shouldn't get in your way.What got in my way of truly enjoying this book was some of the language. As an earlier reviewer remarked, the book offers little in the way of additional sightlines or psychological insight into the main characters, and these are things I look for in a novelization.And I kept &quot;falling out of the story&quot; because of the language. In a couple of places, Mr. Gram used metaphors that were really inappropriate for the time and place. Commodus is described as a &quot;vampire.&quot; Okay, the Romans had such things -- striges and lamiae -- but modern usage is such that I was jarred for a moment. In another place, he compares something in Rome to something from the middle ages, abruptly throwing readers forward in time.And he put more weight on adverbs than they are really intended to bear in trying to create an atmosphere of power or splendor: that's telling, not showing and, frankly, I put it down to the problems of writing novelizations.Still, the author has succeeded in what has to be his greatest purpose: an accurate representation of an exciting film. (And the photos really are great.)"},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"This book is best read (if at all)after having seen the movie, as it has nothing to offer the reader in the way of deeper knowledge concerning the story or it's characters. I believe that the author, who shows scattered signs of elegant prose at times, could have done considerably better with this screen-play adaption. The main problems are:Character background is limited, only the briefest of descriptions are utilized to provide scenery, adjectives are poorly selected and often used reiteratively, there are chapter breaks every 1 to 6 pages and there is virtually no inner-monologue. If you have ever read any decent fantasy / science fiction literature then you'll be quickly bored with this work which has been seemingly aimed at about an eighth grade drop-out level. I can only guess that the author had his hands tied by the film company when he wrote this as it could easily have been 300+ pages of quality material(which, despite the comments made above, such quality prose does occassionally surface when the author has been given his head in describing situations in the movie which occurred at a rapid pace on film)."},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","review":"I really wanted this book to be great. The fact that a movie like this one, with such scope and depth and beauty and struggle, was novelized in less than 250 pages, should have been a serious clue to me that I was wanting too much. This book is little more than a transcript; it is exactly, scene-for-scene, the movie (including the deleted scenes). Yet the writer fails to keep the reader in second-century Rome because 21st-century American phraseology continually creeps into his descriptions: \\"whipped to a frenzy,\\" \\"cheering his head off,\\" etc. Even some of the dialog has been \\"updated\\" for today's audience, including some of the most memorable movie lines: \\"The Emperor has been slain\\" becomes \\"The Emperor was murdered,\\" and \\"Is this not why you are here?\\" is reduced to \\"Is this not why you came?\\" Converting \\"we shall\\" to \\"we'll\\" is simply insulting to the reader who loves this movie's sense of setting. Besides (and more importantly than) this, Mr. Gram writes with a choppy style that remains in third person objective for most of the story, rarely peeking into characters' minds and, therefore, never finding their hearts. The characters of this movie deserve a book that is rich both in historical detail and in emotional depth, but instead they got this, an ultra-quick read that reveals absolutely nothing new. The second star I gave it is for Maximus, because even when reduced to this level of shallowness, I still love him. The third star is for the first several chapters, which give sufficient detail of the opening battle sequence and even seem to promise a bit of character depth.

Any animal whose skin is exposed to the sun too long will experience \\"sunburn.\\" The other thing that I did not like about the book is that one third of the book is on sports trivia.

(pbk.)The civilizational achievements of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians of Mesopotamia only started to become known over the course of the last century or so. For our new understanding of the past we have to thank archaeology, in particular for its discovery of many tens of thousands of baked clay tablets which have miraculously preserved the complex cuneiform writing system, languages, and literatures of the ancient Mesopotamians, and for the patient decipherment of these tablets and other cuneiform-bearing artefacts by a small and dedicated group of international scholars.The literature on this subject today is vast, and much of it is accessible only to specialists. Of the studies that are generally available - such as those of A. Leo Oppenheim, Samuel Noah Kramer, and Thorkild Jacobsen - most tend to be aimed at a more scholarly type of audience, the kind of people who like detailed footnotes, precise references to sources, bibliographies, etc.,Oppenheim's valuable study, which weighs in at a hefty 433 pages, contains all of these plus fifteen plates, three maps, a Chronology, a Glossary of Names and Terms, and an Index. As a distinguished scholar and linguist who spent more than thirty years studying the cuneiform tablets, he offers us a personal picture of the Mesopotamians of three thousand years ago which sums up all that the tablets have to tell us about the ancient civilizations of Babylon and Assyria.His book is organized as follows - Chapter I : The Background; The Setting; The Actors; The World Around; II : The Social Texture; Economic Facts; \\"The Great Organizations\\"; The City; Urbanism; III - Historical Sources or Literature?; An Essay on Babylonian History; An Essay on Assyrian History; IV - Why a \\"Mesopotamian Religion\\" Should Not Be Written; The Care and Feeding of the Gods; Mesopotamian \\"Psychology\\"; The Arts of the Diviner; V - The Meaning of Writing; The Scribes; The Creative Effort; Patterns in Non-Literary Texts; Part VI - Medicine and Physicians; Mathematics and Astronomy; Craftsmen and Artists.Of particular interest are Oppenheim's views on \\"religion\\" as set forth in Chapter IV. He tells us, for example, that : \\"The Immense ruins of the temple towers [i.e., ziggurats] of the large cities ... made Babylonia famous .... Yet even today we do not know the purpose of these edifices.... We do not know what they were for\\" (page 172).This is a startling admission, since it calls into question pretty well everything that has been written about ancient Mesopotamia. If the \\"temples\\" shouldn't really be called \\"temples\\" since we don't know what purpose they served, what about the \\"gods\\" and the \\"myths\\" of the Mesopotamians? Do these also represent a distortion or misreading of the facts? Were the gods really gods? Were the myths merely fabrications? Was their literature literature, or was it history?So far as I know, Oppenheim is one of the very few scholars who have had the courage to suggest that the conventional view of Mesopotamian history may be fundamentally in error."},{"Title":"Ancient Mesopotamia : Portrait of a Dead Civilization","review":"&quot;Ancient Mesopotamia: Portrait of a Dead Civilisation&quot; is a classic among Mesopotamian Literature. The book deals with every passionate detail of the civisation between the rivers. Oppenheim covers enviromental factors in the creation of civilisation in Mesopotamia, urban life, interesting issues in there religion, and also the beginning of written literature in the Mesopotamian region. Oppenheim's book is more for the advanced reader of Mesopotamian culture, so it is not suggested for the beginner in the study of Mesopotamian history. However, I do recommend it for the library of anyone who is a avid enthusiast into Mesopotamian literature, history, and achaeology."},{"Title":"Ancient Mesopotamia : Portrait of a Dead Civilization","review":"Georges Roux's outstanding book on ancient Iraq - which opens my eyes - seems amateurish compared to this one - probably the single best introduction to ancient Mesopotamia written in the English language.Iraq's civilization is interesting for two reasons. From a purely archaeological/anthropological point of view, ancient Mesopotamia is by far the oldest civilization on this planet - even older than Egypt. The reasons why there's much less attention to it than to Egypt are the fact that there are so few monumental structures remaining there and the fact that Egypt is closer to the Graeoco-Roman civilization.The other reason why Iraq's civilization is interesting is its potential importance IN THE FUTURE. With the war's outcome almost certain (truly it's like an Iron Age army crushing a Stone Age one), Iraq's long term prospects are quite good. Sitting on the second largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, Iraq has the potential to wield much influence, like Saudi Arabia.Useful (but rather short) bibilography and glossary.Oppenheim regrets not being able to make this book \\"twice the size of the present one.\\" (p.334) I only regret that this book ISN'T three times as long. If this book isn't flying off the shelves, it should be. Get it before it's too late.(Warning: This book does not include the Sumerian civilization, as the author makes explicit. For this subject you must turn to Sam N. Kramer.)"},{"Title":"Ancient Mesopotamia : Portrait of a Dead Civilization","review":"Without any doubt, this book is one of the most comprehensive works on ancient Near Eastern cultures with its distinguished structure and unique style. Mr Oppenheim, a well-known Assyrologist of the sixties, provides us a brief but deep and highly detailed portrait of Ancient Mesopotamia, as the subtitle of the book suggests (\\"Portrait Of A Dead Civilization\\".) First, I have to inform the enthusiastic reader that this is not a book for \\"beginners\\" - it requires a background on ancient history and an acquaintance with Mesopotamian civilizations. But you don't have to be a specialist or a scholar to enjoy the unique taste of the book.While Samuel Noah Kramer's works feed us with the Sumerian part of Mesopotamian culture, Oppenheim focuses the main axis on Babylonia and Assyria. The book is not a plain history textbook in a chronological order. Oppenheim presents the \\"portrait\\" under well-designed chapters with essential concepts: The first chapter of the book is an overview on Mesopotamia. Then in the second chapter, Oppenheim leads us to the depths of urbanism, social texture and economical facts of the region in ancient times. Chapter 3 deals with the difference of \\"historical sources\\" and \\"literature\\" in Mesopotamia, and presents two essays on Assyrian and Babylonian history. The next chapter is, about ancient Mesopotamians' relations with their &quot;gods&quot;: Oppenheim discusses why a \\"Mesopotamian Religion\\" should not be written. (According to my opinion, this is one of the most important parts of the book which underlines the \\"revolutionary\\" nature of the work.) The last two chapters deal with \\"the writing\\" and \\"science\\" in Mesopotamia, respectively. J. A. Brinkman's \\"Mesopotamian Chronology of the Historical Period\\" is presented as an appendix at the end of the book.Leo Oppenheim's \\"Ancient Mesopotamia\\" is definitely one of the most important sources for intellectuals interested with the subject. Note that it is not just a \\"reference work\\" but a \\"book with a soul\\"."},{"Title":"Ancient Mesopotamia : Portrait of a Dead Civilization","review":"\\"Ancient Mesopotamia\\" struck me as being a wake-up call to Assyriologists to get their act together regarding the study of Mesopotamia. In his preface and introduction, Oppenheim bewails the Western bias of Assyriology and its imminent fossilization if things didn't change. It seemed to me that the crux of Oppenheim's argument was that the field's emphasis on the humanities put undue focus on the surviving literary texts, which as he pointed out, make up only a tiny fraction of the cuneiform tablets that the ancients deemed worthy of collecting in their libraries. As a result, in our attempts to understand Mesopotamian culture, too much importance may have been placed on texts that were not even part of the \\"mainstream of tradition\\". Even if we ignore this difficulty, Oppenheim argued that using literary techniques to study these texts ignores the possibility that the tablets had an altogether different meaning for the ancient Mesopotamians than just \\"great literature\\".Rather, Oppenheim suggested that Assyriologists should decipher tablets that would shed light on various cultural aspects such as the economy, trade, technology, and medicine. Doing this would lead to a more accurate impression of Mesopotamia in a way that the ancients themselves may have seen it. And this would also avoid the danger of Assyriology becoming a self-justifying field with only limited relevance to its namesake culture.Although my review has focused on the author's views of his own field, most of the book itself deals with a broad survey of the culture and history of the Semitic-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia. After giving us his ideas at the beginning of the book on what the paradigm of Assyriology should be, Oppenheim proceeded to do a remarkable job of putting these ideas into practice in the rest of the book. Limited use is made of direct quotations from texts, since as the author put it, \\"Translated texts tend to speak more of the translator than their original message\\". Additionally, some of the author's thoughts on the Mesopotamians are different from others in the field. For example, in describing the Code of Hammurabi and other publicly displayed law codes, Oppenheim speculated that they were meant to serve as the king's acknowledgement of social injustice and his vision of how things should be. In other words, the law codes were meant to be statements of the king, not necessarily a collection of laws to be enforced.I felt that \\"Ancient Mesopotamia\\" provides an excellent narrative of the history, culture, and religion of this civilization, and would be well-regarded by those who have an interest in this time and place. I am not an Assyriologist and I have only limited knowledge of the impact that Oppenheim may have had on the field, but I would also suggest that this book does a good job of marking the evolutionary development of Assyriology as it occurred up to the 1960's."},{"Title":"Ancient Mesopotamia : Portrait of a Dead Civilization","review":"A. Leo Oppenheim's &quot;Ancient Mesopotamia:Portrait of a Dead Civilization&quot; is one lively read. It is not a chronologically arranged history, (you'll have to go to Georges Roux's &quot;Ancient Iraq&quot; for that), but it is an unusually comprehensive series of essays on aspects of ancient Mesopotamian civilization. After introducing Assyriology as a discipline, Oppenheim situates Mesopotamia geographically and culturally within the ancient world, and discusses its relations with and influence on its neighbors. From there he goes on to analyze the root forms of almost everything we know of as civilization: urbanism, political and social organization, religion, writing, literature, and scientific thought. Particularly interesting are the discussions on the care and feeding of the gods, ancient psychology, and the scribal subculture. Throughout the book, Oppenheim refers to historical and literary data of every sort in an even-handed way. A helpful chronology, glossary, notes, and index fill the final 100+ pages of the book. Illustrations and maps could be a little better, but that's small change in a book of this scope.

And that is the problem. I have seldom encountered a book that was so hard to read. It is dry beyond all description. It was, no doubt, intended as a scholarly work and not as a popular history, and it no doubt is a scholarly work, but it is so difficult to follow that it is amazing. Here is the first sentence of the first chapter \\"Early in the fourth millennium BC there occurred in the southwest Asia a phenomenon of lasting importance for the history of man: the appearance in quick secession of a group of culture foci.\\" Ok, so we all know what it says, but the wording isn't something that just jumps to mind.The book is also badly out of date. It was written in 1964 and a revised edition was published in 1977 from notes completed before the author's death by Erica Reiner. Still, even 1977 was a long time ago (it is now 2011) so 30 plus years is bound to bring new facts to the fore and new ideas about the ancient past into the discussion.The best thing about the book is the fact that Oppenheim stresses the lack of information we actually have about the ancient past. This lack of information leads to a lot of guesswork, and he is up front about this problem. Few others are. In fact many authors guess about the meaning of the past off of known facts. They go far into the realm of speculation in talking about the past. I have read books discussing the cave paintings of 30,000 years ago and the authors told us that the paintings were religious paintings with tribal significance; however, they can't know that. Oppenheim avoids this type of error and openly discusses how little we actually know about the past, even when we have written text to work off of.Unfortunately the book could not hold my attention. It is just too hard to read.AD2"},{"Title":"Ancient Mesopotamia : Portrait of a Dead Civilization","review":"This is just another sad attempt to put Euro-asia ahead of Africa. The reason why there are not a lot of artifacts which would show that mesopotamia is older than Eypt is the same reason why a few racist moronic (pretend) scholars would go out of their way to make up false claims. For the record, migration started from Africa to Euro-Asia and before then, Africa had already produced its pyramids in its mother country of Nubia, or Sudanic territory (black negroids), and its agriculture through out the continent. Come on ppl lets get beyond ones short comings, besides, there is more validation for hinduism coming from the iranian aryans. Who in turn receive their influences from the contact of African so called animist, which in fact is the belief that everything is the supreme source in a loop sequence of vibrating which is believe to be the only way the sun gods, rock gods, animal gods, human gods(neteru), etc., can exist. It was the greeks,iranian aryans who took this knowledge out of context, as they were the ones who were truly polytheistic in their beginning, as they treated there different gods as seperate beings who existed independant of one another. Hindu, and greek mythology went through a change once the invading Europeans were reeducated by the Egyptians, and Dravidians influences which in the beginning they were accused of being inferior civilizations with lame gods, but more likely it was just the ignorant outside view, as proved. Mesopotamians were a combination of African negroids (Sudanic-Nubians), Mediterranean Indo-Euro's, and pre-nomadic Arabs(the offspring of different ethnic groups). The teachings were concentrated around the African stories of civilization from beings of a different world which can be dated earlier in African stories throughout South Africa spreading up to the later north, east, and central migrations. The Ancient Africans claim to have gotten their knowledge about space-time, geometrics of objects, and consciousness being absolute, from these beings, inwhich the universe was said to exist psycho-physically, from a supreme being that was absolute conscious reality. Not all Africans societies receive the exact same knowledge so this is why it varies, other reasons were do to fueds domestically and abroad. There is no evidence that Mesopotamians invaded South Africa and brought there knowledge and stories with them of e.t visitors, but the migration from Africa to Euro-Asia supports the latter. The sad truth is the more that white racist try to seperate themselves from their source they will only reveal it more."},{"Title":"Spanish Islam: A history of the Moslems in Spain","review":"There once lived in Islam a lady.

From its origins in the Dirac delta \`function', distribution theory continues to influence many research areas from quantum mechanics to partial differential equations, but has also grown into an important field in its own right. For anyone interested in learning about the field, this is clearly the first port of call. It presents a balanced introduction to the subject on a level suitable for anyone with a basic grounding in analysis (no knowledge of functional analysis is required).The book begins by defining the two building blocks of the theory---test functions and distributions. It then quickly expands, filling in the important details of differentiation, multiplication, tensor products and convolution. All of this is written with sufficient mathematical rigor, but never too much that it interferes with the basic understanding of the subject, and is supported throughout by useful exercises. The book then builds up the theory of Fourier and Laplace transforms of distributions, which has important applications in the study of linear partial differential equations. The second edition contains an indispensable new chapter on the calculus of wavefront sets, which, among its uses, allows the propagation of singularities of solutions to partial differential equations to be properly treated. All in all, while the book is not for the common man, and does require a certain level of mathematical maturity, it does present an excellent introduction to an important, and often poorly understood, area of mathematics."},{"Title":"Abschied Von Sidonie (German Edition)","review":"This is the German text edition of \\"Farewell Sidonia\\", the tragic, but true, story of little Sidonia Adlersburg who, in 1933, as an infant, was abandoned by her Gypsy mother in the small town of Steyr, Austria. She was eventually taken in by a working class couple with leftist-socialist sentiments, Hans and Josepha Breirather. They became her foster parents, nurturing and caring for the sickly child, until she blossomed under their ministrations.Unfortunately for Sidonia, the Nazis came to power and with it came the Aryan ideal. When Austria fell to the German juggernaut, fear and suspicion abounded. Anything and everything different stood out, and with her dark, Gypsy looks, Sidonia found herself eventually caught in the eye of a storm. Despite having lived in the town for ten years as the beloved child of her foster parents, who were well-liked by the towns people, forces conspired to end Sidonia's happiness as the Nazis rose to power, becoming a force with which to be reckoned.In 1943, Sidonia's happiness came to an abrupt end at the age of ten, when she was ordered, against the vehement wishes of her foster parents, to be returned to her Gypsy mother, whom Sidonia never knew. Although the towns people themselves could have assisted in stopping this travesty, as their input was, in fact, sought by the powers that be, they did little to ensure that Sidonia would remain among their midst. Her teachers, social worker, and others gave the powers that be little reason for letting the child that they had known for her entire life stay with the only parents that she had ever known.Considering that the Gypsies who used to annually pass through their town were no longer to be seen, and the Nazis' opinion of the Gypsies was all too clear, the towns people whose input was sought had to have been cognizant of the fate that was to eventually await little Sidonia were she to be removed from her foster parents' protection. They knew, and they did not care. This was to be the legacy of this town.While this is a compelling story, I must confess that I did not find the author's writing style to be especially so. Having read the English translation of this work, perhaps it is the translation that hampers my appreciation of this acclaimed Austrian author who has been touted as \\"one of the great hopes of German-language literature\\". While this is the second book by this author that I have read, it will probably be the last."},{"Title":"Principles of Principled Life Insurance Selling","review":"I buy numerous sales techniques books, way too many as a matter of fact.

I've never read, however, Quintus' complete account of the Trojan combat from the funeral for Hector to the sacking of Troy and the maritime destruction of much of the returning Greek fleet.We don't know quite who Quintus was but suspect he lived in the Fifth Century AD, 1,000 years after 'Homer smote his blooming' lyre [to misquote Kipling]. Whoever Quintus was he seems to have made an effort to consolidate known 'facts' of the period between the end of the Iliad and the beginning of the Odyssey. He also seems to have made a deliberate effort to mimic the style of the ancient Greek master [Homer?]. His account is one of divine mythos intertwined with some of the most graphic combat ever penned by anyone, with the exception of Homer himself. Thousands of Greeks and Trojans are slaughtered. Dying men, heads pierced by spears, bite down on cold bronze. Barbed lances and arrows draw out their guts. Heads are severed, throats are slashed and the battlefield is slippery with blood. Men die slow deaths, rapid deaths...but...always painful deaths.Almost like the present when liberal social workers and jurists discount personal responsibility, the ancient combatants aren't responsible for much. It's all in the inevitable hands of the fates. Both the killer and killed are exonerated by fate. Troy falls, thousands die, women are raped and enslaved and it's all because of grim fate. In a later time, the protagonists would have blamed 'Old Nick', Satan, Lucifer, the Devil.How much of the story is true? Probably more than we'd like to believe. Something very bad happened at Troy just as it happened to thousands of cities and towns before and since. Troy got glorious publicity and, in its own way, stands as a symbol for genocide and piteous atrocity. The ancient world is replete with ruined, razed cities in which the inhabitants were slaughtered and enslaved. Unfortunately, they didn't have their Homer or Quintus to tell us their agonizing tales. In more modern times, we have plenty of known examples but, even here, the vast majority of personal tales are completely washed away by blood. Caesar kills 1,000,000 Gauls; the Visigoths kill thousands of Romans; Genghis Khan slaughters hundreds of thousands and Hitler, Lenin and Mao Tse Tung kill over 100 million souls. Homer and Quintus give us a hint--just a hint--of how terrible it has been and will be."},{"Title":"Medea","review":"Ever since James Frazer and Joseph Campbell, but moreso Robert Graves, I've been waiting for the 'real' story of mythological characters like Hera, say, or the Medusa; Crista Wolf's &quot;Cassandra&quot; and now &quot;Medea&quot; take me happily in that direction. I know Ms Wolf has a personal and political agenda. Admittedly, I had trouble getting started, largely because of similarities of voice in the early chapters, but once the plot begins I had no trouble following it and Medea herself down it's dark labyrinths. And I felt thoroughly gratified with her and at her sentiments at the end. Who hasn't reached that point, where the only gesture meaningful and appropriate is a raised middle digit--figuaratively speaking, of course? And who more than Medea has better cause? Except maybe the Medusa. What about it Ms Wolf?"},{"Title":"Medea","review":"How can anyone call this novel flat, I cannot understand. In less than 200 pages, Wolf has brilliantly captured the utter depravity than mankind can sink to through its own bigotry, hypocrisy, lying, selfishness and sense of self-preservation. Wolf has taken Darwin's survival of the fittest theory to its immoral extreme and has exploited the Lacanian objet art to its most devastating use. A society so enveloped in its own sense of emptiness and vileness, leading them to sacrifice a woman as an expiation of its evil, can only be beautifully and tragically rendered by a mistress story teller as Wolf. Atwood's introduction tells no lies, and I highly recommend this reading to anyone who is into the classics, contemporary culture, social studies and philosophy. This is Wolf's first novel that I have read and it most definitely will not be the last."},{"Title":"Medea","review":"As a devout fan of the Medea story, I was a little doubtful as I opened the book. At first, the heightened language struck me as being counterproductive to the humanity that Wolfe seemed to strive for in the protagonist, but, as the story progressed, I found myself lured in by the characters, the basic approach, and the added details. I thought the chapter by Princess Glauce, a character often avoided or even mistreated in many versions, was particularly insightful. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves this tale or interpretive approaches to traditional mythology."},{"Title":"Medea","review":"Are you kidding? This is a fabulous retelling of the Medea story. I thought about it for days after. It might have been a little tricky getting into it, but it was well worth it.

An admirable piece of work!"},{"Title":"Medea","review":"This book is one of the best if not the best Christa Wolf has ever written. It tells the story of Medea in a new uncommon way. It is not only Medea who appears in a different light then known from the myth. What makes me love this book is the way it is told. Nearly every chapter is told by a new person and gives a new point of view. Nevertheless, the story goes on, very smooth. I don't think that the language is difficult you just have to take your time to enjoy it. Of course is it possible to read this novel in one evening but then you would probably miss the atmosphere Christa Wolf created."},{"Title":"Medea","review":"Margaret Atwood's brief introduction to this novel leads one to expect a feminist revision of the Medea story. Unfortunately, Wolf does not really do anything with the story except resurrect the characters. The story is supposed to be presented from the different perspectives of several of the characters. Chapter titles indicate who is speaking. If we were not told that the fictional narrator had changed, however, we would not know from anything presented in the story. They all have the same petulant, nagging tone. A writer must do something radical with such a story to justify a modern retelling, such as Joyce did with Ulysses. So often, modern writers assume that it is enough to diminish the characters and have them speak in an informal idiom. Wolf presents Jason as simply stupid, and Medea as a carping divorc&eacute;e. The only twist Wolf gives to the story is to make Medea the innocent victim of false accusations. I guess that is supposed to be the feminist slant! ! . Yawn. Medea is so wonderfully horrific; we do not need this whining, watered-down contemporary version."},{"Title":"Deadfall (National Forest Mystery)","review":"It took a long time to get a copy of this book, since it went out of print with the original publisher.

The lectures were recorded and transcribed by Morinigo and Wagner. A very readable introduction on quantum gravity was added by the editor, Brian Hatfield (whose book on quantum field theory and strings, I also recommend.) This is the only book I've seen which develops GR from a quantum field theory point of view. Feynman's lectures show that the GR field equations result from the requirement of gauge invariance under Lorentz transformations for a massless spin-2 field (i.e graviton). This is a more fundamental approach than the usual differential geometric framework and shows what the equivalence principle really means in terms of fundamental symmetries. Highly recommended for a modern field theory viewpoint of GR."},{"Title":"Feynman Lectures on Gravitation","review":"This is a wonderful book which shows how a classical field theory like General Relativity can be derived from a quantum field theory. It also points out the extreme difficulty of accomplishing this in the case of gravity and ending up with a consistent, anomaly free theory.Readers of this book will benefit from familiarity with both quantum field theory and relativity as well as a certain amount of mathematical sophistication. Don't be fooled by the similarity of title to other &quot;Feynman Lectures on...&quot; because this book is based on an upper level graduate physics course and assumes the background of a typical PhD student in physics.Deep, complex and difficult going but well worth the effort to see the elegance of the connection between General Relativity and QFT."},{"Title":"Feynman Lectures on Gravitation","review":"The original Feynman's point of view about world is always matter of greatest interest.

Where better to find one, he thinks, than at the Brides of Virtue convent? Unfortunately, the abbess won't promise him a wife, rather, she sends along with him an ambitious but bungling novitiate, Eloise of Argent, to test the young earl and decide whether Peril is worthy to be a husband of one of her maidens.From this initial fun premise, the book spins into constant adventure. The path to true love between these two very sympathetic protagonists is anything but smooth as, together, they battle treachery from all sides. Peril must work through his deep guilt at desiring a &quot;nun,&quot; and Eloise must grow to care for Peril enough to consider abandoning her previous plans to become an abbess.In spite of the often slapstick humor of Eloise's many well-intentioned plans-gone-awry, she is a strong, direct, intelligent heroine. For fans of tortured heroes, Peril will amply fill the bill. A powerful warrior forged in the fire of harsh experience, he discovers with Eloise a wealth of tenderness inside him he never knew he had. The emotional intensity and the sexual sparks between these two are incendiary. And as always, Ms. Krahn, a master at portrayal of the medieval era, makes it come so alive on the page, you will feel you are actually there."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"Eloise of Argent, novice and aspiring abbess at the Convent of the Brides of Virtue, is well intentioned and a little too eager to please which causes all kinds of trouble. The abbess is at the end of her tether when Eloise nearly burns down the kitchen. Salvation comes in the form of Peril, Earl of Whitmore, who is looking for a woman, er...a bride, someone of great virtue who can break the &quot;curse&quot; on his land -- of course, there is never any mention of the curse to the abbess. Eloise is shocked, dismayed, then pleased when the Reverend Mother chooses her to judge Peril's fitness to marry. This will be the chance she needs to prove herself worthy of her vocation.Peril is far from happy to hear that he won't be walking away from the convent with his bride, but must first prove himself as reliable husband material. Fostered at the age of three, Peril earned his spurs at an early age and is a warrior, not a landowner. Since inheriting his late father's lands two years ago, he almost believes the villagers' fears that the curse placed upon the estate by the late Whitmore's mistress must be real. How can he hope to live up to &quot;Sister&quot; Eloise and the abbess's standards when he's unable to control his own estate?Betina Krahn creates endearing and strong characters in this tender, yet dramatic tale of past love gone wrong and the people who try to make amends in the future. Filled with self-loathing at his overwhelming attraction to the novice, Peril is confused and tormented. When Eloise sees the softer side of Peril, she is determined to make him succeed in bringing himself, his lands and people up to par in order to fulfill his bride quest. Here are two very lost people, uncertain of their true lots in life, who eventually find solace in one another, but with the knowledge that it will never, can never, culminate in a love match.Fast paced and rich in historical detail, THE HUSBAND TEST is a delightful, conflict-filled read with many twists, turns, and surprises. Ms. Krahn paints vivid word pictures of medieval times, peoples' superstitions and the power of love to conquer evil and betrayal.I highly recommend THE HUSBAND TEST as classic writing from Ms. Krahn -- an historical romance not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"What a delight! It has all the elements we look for in a romance but so much more.Most importantly there is humor&#65533;delightful humor&#65533;sudden surprises that caused me to laugh out loud before I realized it. Not seltzer-in-the-pants humor but the kind that sneaks up on you and takes you unawares&#65533;you know&#65533;the kind that comes in real life!And the story line is not one I have read before. It really was different, without being absurd (what a relief! I get so tired of the foolish ones!). While I am not a great student of history, and cannot tell just how authentic much of the background is, it was plausible enough for the average chick.It didn&#65533;t beat a dead horse. By this I mean, there was no torturous dragging out of misunderstandings, no endless agonizing over imagined slights, no feeling that the author was counting words to figure out her royalties (do they still pay by the word? I don&#65533;t know, but many books that should end after 20 pages go on for another 200 for some reason other than story development!). There were conflicts, concerns, and attacks of conscience but they all were covered, handled, dealt with and still the story MOVED ON!There were several &#65533;lessons&#65533; inserted in a gentle, non-preaching fashion. One never felt &#65533;beaten over the head\\" actually, slightly warmed by them.Yes, the romance was there. One could feel tingly and tantalized without all the gruesome details (I never like feeling that I have been caught reading porn), the imagination is still the best source of titillation. How cleverly the physical and emotional needs were brought to bear. Even the nuns were decidedly enthusiastic for all aspects of this relationship!Oh, and it had the good grace not to have a cover featuring the ever present (it seems) sweaty chests (his) and heaving breasts (hers) so popular in the &#65533;romance&#65533; circles.

Eloise, whose ambitious attempts at finding a better way for tried and true methods have most often ended up into disasters that have tried the patience of the long suffering abbess.When Peril, Lord of Whitmore shows up at the gate of the convent in search of a \`virtuous bride' who could rid his home and lands of a curse, the abbess created a new position, that of \`husband judge' and sends Eloise, the \`thorn in her side', the ambitious little novitiate, to assess whether this frustratingly haughty Lord is worthy of one of the highly desirable virtuous young ladies coveted as brides and trained at the convent. Peril, was a warrior and he really didn't want a bride but would do anything to try to save his village and lands from the disasters and curses that continued to rain down on his domain.Right from the start \`Sister' Eloise and Peril seemed to bring out the worst in each other as the entertaining filled beginning turned into an action adventure once they started for his home. Once there, Eloise was given her greatest test, that of separating her growing \`non-nun like' feelings for the man she was to judge worthy for a bride. For Peril, his greatest test was to dismiss the \`carnal' thoughts he was having for the \`nun' that was to judge his suitability for a virtuous bride. Not only would the sexual attractions between the two protagonists cause problems but more importantly they would have to band together to discover what treachery there was behind the \`curse' at Whitmore.From the totally entertaining beginning the reader will open their hearts to this thoroughly likeable and darling heroine and the very tender love story that brings a tear to your eye as Peril comes to realize, almost too late that the small \`stirring' in his heart is really love and not \`pain'.. The author knows how to keep the reader interested and certainly caught my attention as from the very first page of this book I found it VERY difficult to put down. For pure joy and entertainment, you can't miss with this one! --- Marilyn Rondeau, Official Reviewer for www.historicalromancewriters.com ---"},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"This was the first one of Betina Krahn's books that I have ever read. I thought the premise was interesting enough to warrant trying out a new author, and I'm very glad I did so! On to the basics...The story starts out with Eloise, a novice in a convent. She's a bit of a thorn in the abbess's side, mostly because she is constantly trying to help out, and in the process making a bigger mess of things. Peril (don't let the name put you off) is the Earl of Whitmore, who has come to this particular convent for a novice nun to take as a bride. Just about any bride will do, as long as she's virtuous. See, he needs a virtuous bride to break the curse on his lands. Only in the process, he gets saddled with Eloise instead, who has been bidden to give him a 'Husband Test' to find out if he is worthy. They spark, Eloise starts running his castle (and driving him crazy) and Peril passes the husband test -- and you can guess who becomes his bride!The characters in this book are extremely likeable. While Peril doesn't have the depth to him that some leading men do, he's likeably gruff enough to pass any standards. Eloise shines in this book, as the story is told primarily through her eyes. The tale has enough twists and turns to keep your interest until the very last page, and I found myself disappointed when the story was finished, but only because it was over so fast! This book is definitely staying on my shelf as a 'keeper'."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"This is a fun book with a few twists, ghosts, curses, etc...I enjoyed the read.By the way--The first editorial review is for a Madeline Hunter book. Maybe ...(the website) should fix that."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"The Husband Test by Betina Krahn is a medieval about a novice in a convent who desires to be the abbess, but constantly finds herself in trouble for trying to improve everything. The abbess makes her the &quot;husband judge&quot; to test the merit of an earl whose castle has fallen to ruin because of an old family curse. The earl needs a bride of virtue in order to release his lands and his people from the devastation of the curse, but of course, this young &quot;nun&quot; sets out to improve him and his castle. The story was a pleasure to read from beginning to end--amusing, as well as tenderly emotional and full of swash-buckling excitment. It's on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"The Reverend Mother is a sly fox, and she sets up both Peril and Sister Eloise to perfection. Sister Eloise is a delight: bossy, always in trouble, but she means well. It takes her some time to realize that she's really not cut out to be a nun. Peril is a man with too much weight on his shoulders, and he needs someone just like Eloise. And in the process of these two discovering love in the midst of a marriage neither one expected, Peril's (and his village's) past is laid to rest and Eloise's future shines brightly.Much of the humor comes from Eloise's misadventures and mistakes and from Peril's misfortunes, as well as the way they seem to bring out the worst in each other initially and until they recognize their feelings for love and let go of their fears. Nice secondary characters.Charming, witty, original. Occasional instances of anachronisms and very minor plot snags, but all in a all a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"If you like misdirection and hidden agendas in your romances, then you'll enjoy this book.The story concerns Peril, Earl of Whitmore, who travels to France to obtain a bride from the Convent of the Brides of Virtue, a convent that provides a home for dowerless, respectable maidens. Peril had a secret reason for needing a virtuous wife, and the abbess suspects his motives. The abbess also has another problem - a troublesome novice named Eloise who's lived at the convent since age twelve and considers herself an abbess-in-training, much to the current abbess' annoyance. Two birds are killed with one stone when the abbess sends novice Eloise disguised as a nun with Peril back to estate, with the charge that she act as a husband judge to determine his suitability as husband for one of the convent's maidens. To Eloise, this is finally confirmation that the abbess and the convent value her, and she sets out to do the most consciencious job possible.The story follows the familiar path of an intelligent, energetic woman arriving at an estate that has fallen to ruin. Of course she begins to take charge and reform both the estate and the earl. Of course he both resents and is attracted to her. Of course he thinks that she is a nun and tries to overcome his attraction. Of course she is attracted to him and has to decide what life path to follow. So all the basic and familiar romance elements are here, yet Ms Krahn manages to mix them in such a fashion that they seem fresh and interesting. I liked the fact that both Eloise's and Peril's viewpoints are told. The story is well-paced and interesting, the humor wry.I enjoyed the main characters in this story, and the story itself. The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I felt that the secondary plots and characters could have been more fully developed. But that is only a minor quibble. This book was an amusing and enjoyable way to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"Peril, earl of Whitmore, needed a pure and virtuous wife to help rid his lands of a curse. His people were starving, the taxes were due, his wicked neighbor taunted him, and children were disappearing! He went t the Convent of the Brides of Virtue in hope that the abbess would have such a woman somewhere within her charges. The shrewd abbess decided to send one of the sisters to the Earl's estate. The chosen sister would give Peril a husband test. The results sent back to the convent would help the abbess in deciding if a bride would be given to Peril, and if so, who.Sister Eloise was one of the convent's novices. She was to give the husband test to the earl. Once completed, Eloise could return to the convent and take her final vows. While studying the earl, Eloise helped the people living on the estate. Everywhere she looked Eloise saw disaster! Change was needed for almost everything ... AND FAST!Eloise began to see the wonderful man Peril was inside, as well as, the great warrior he was on the outside. How would she manage to give the earl to another woman after she had already become so attached to him and his people?***** Oh, Readers, this one is a story you should not miss! Eloise has so many wonderful ideas, but some of them just backfire! That type of humor is only one of many ways Betina Krahn kept me reading! The characters each have their own unique personality and the story has a few sub-plots to keep events moving along. Highly recommended reading within these pages! *****"},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"This has got to be one of the WORST romances I've ever tried to read. I didn't feel anything for the heroine and there is no romance between the two.Eloise is trying to prove she has what it takes to become a nun, but when she finds out she is supposed to merry Peril, she STILL acts like a nun!! The praying, and then pretending she can still be a nun after getting married just didn't do it for me. I found her snivling and very weak of character. Even the passages that I think were supposed to be funny I found myself saying \\"How can you be so stupid?\\"!!I really feel that as a wife, she had more ability to help people than as a nun, and yet she didn't becuase she was so wrapped up in herself and loosing her goal of being a nun.Ironically, Peril didn't bother me as much. As far as wanting your character to learn and grow, he only could become a better person. He was the worst...a vile disgusting man that totally became worthy of having a wife. However, I don't think he deserved Eloise. I actually thought the head nun played a horrible joke on him by sticking him with her...but then again, maybe they deserve each other.Betina Krahn writes well, however I found the story sadly just horrid. I thought this would be a fun book, but Eloise really needed some sense knocked into her! I honestly can't believe I finished this book but I think I was really hoping the story would start to develop rather than being the redundant mess it was.I don't think I'll ever try reading anything by Ms Krahn again."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"This is not one of Betina Krahn's best works. The hero is unpleasant and the plot fails to make sense or capture one's imagination."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"Great Historical romance read; Betina Krahn is one of the best.

If you enjoy historical romances, this one is great."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"I picked up this book the night before a last-minute, overnight International business trip so I would have something to read on the long flights. It was a good choice. I was thoroughly entertained by Eloise who has talents that were not particularly appreciated in her initial convent setting. They were much better applied during \\"The Husband Test\\" she was ordered to administer for most of the novel. Getting her out of the convent gave her room to grow rapidly as she followed a new path.Peril, the target of the husband test, played well against Eloise's determined nature. The supporting characters added depth and interest to the story, as well. Krahn's writing style flowed well for my tastes and I appreciated the entertainment this novel offered."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"The character development is wonderful...great story with endearing characters and laugh out loud moments."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"What a terrific introduction to an author I'd never even heard of. I will definitely be checking out other stories by Ms Krahn.Eloise is a novice with aspirations of one day becoming an abbess. But at the moment she is an annoying thorn in her abbess's side! She can't seem to mind her own business or stop trying to improve things, master new skills and generally challenging the status quo. When Peril, Earl of Whitmore comes seeking a bride, the abbess immediately realizes that there is more to him than he is letting on. He is obviously short of funds and seems less than enthusiastic about becoming a husband. She eavesdrops on him and discovers that he needs a bride to break a \\"curse\\" that has brought devastation to his lands. And so, rather than turn over one of her maidens to him, she sends him home with a \\"husband judge\\" to determine his suitability for marriage - her nemesis Eloise.The trip is dreadful and does little to recommend Peril - everything goes wrong. And things go from bad to worse once they arrive at his home - it's filthy and neglected. Of course, this spurs Eloise into action and she is soon sticking her nose into all areas of his estate. Poor Peril is embarassed by the state of his hall and his lack of knowledge of running an estate. He'd been a soldier without a home until his father died two years ago and he returned home to claim the decrepit hall. He is in over his head but can't/won't admit it. He is humiliated that this little \\"nun\\" knows more about running his estate than he does, but he must submit to her authority if he wants a bride. Soon the place is starting to come together and the sparks that fly between Eloise and Peril turn into something warmer. Eloise decides that underneath all his bluster is a good and brave man who needs a wife to help him run his home and so she sends her recommendation to the abbess that he is indeed worthy of a wife. But she is shocked when she finds out who that wife will be! Whitmore is in for some fireworks!I couldn't give this book 5 stars because I couldn't get over what a jerk Peril became once he got married, making rash and stupid decisions rather than taking advice from his wife. But I guess it's tough for a man to realize that his wife is smarter than he is! His character was a bit one-dimensional, but he really was gruffly sweet deep down and Eloise's determined dedication to save him and his estate proved that she had finally found the place where she belonged."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"I really enjoyed reading this story, it also reminded me of the movie (The Sound Of Music, The Captain and The Nun),which is BTWone of my favorite movies. Eloise And Peril's story was warm &amp; funny and touching, I actually LOL in the first chapter. I gave this book 4 stars and not 5 stars because I felt there could havebeen alittle more Love scenes (wink,wink, you know what I mean.)"},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting and funny and the plot was a good one. One of the author's best books."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"Honesty I did not think I was going to like this book but I decided to give it a try. I absolutely loved it. The plot was fresh and moved along at a perfect pace. The humor was a bonus and highlighted the hero and heroine's thoughts and motivations along with their building chemistry. I finished this book in one day which should tell you something about what a smooth and interesting read it was. I like Krahn's style (this was the first book of hers that I read) and intend to read more of them. If I had one little pet peeve it would be the extraordinary amount of detail included about things that didn't add to the story for me. Still, it shows the author did her research and I respect and appreciate that when reading a historical. The end of the book is satisfying and romantic."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"Twelve years ago Eloise of Argent was brought to the Convent of the Brides of Virtue in France by her uncle after both her parents and her foster family died, and her families lands were repossessed by the Duke of Norfolk. The convent is well known for educating girls of noble families with little or no dowries to be good wives. At 21 she's a novice hoping to take her vows and has learnt a bit about most areas of how estates are run in her determination to show the Abbess she's a good candidate for the convent with potential as a future Abbess. Unfortunately Eloise also feels she can see better ways of doing things and in the process causes mayhem with her improvements.Peril, Earl of Whitmore is a battle hardened soldier who returned to his families lands when he inherited two years ago. His father married for money, abandoning the pregnant mistress that he loved who in a moment of rage cursed the land to be barren until a bride of the highest virtue and little money was in charge. As a result Perils people have insisted that he marry in order to rid the land of the curse and he uses his last resources to go to the convent to get one.The Abbess decides that the answer to her problem of what the real deal is with Peril and how to get Eloise out of her hair is to invent a husband test with the help of her trusty offsider Sister Archibald. Eloise, dressed as a full nun, and her old friend Sister Mary Clematis as companion will be sent back to England with Peril to check out the situation as the official husband tester and report with the promise that she won't be a novice much longer once she's finished.The story is set in the reign of Edward I and my main criticism is the author's treatment of Eloise. In the first half of the book she comes across the page as feeling like she has a true religious vocation, despite her desire for Peril, and in these times if a girl felt that strongly about joining the church she would not have been turned away. The passion between the couple was also lacking for me so it felt like the author dropped the ball a little in the second half but overall it's a fun book and well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"The ending could be better but otherwise I thoroughly enjoy reading. It's a good way to relax after a hectic day a work."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"Eloise of Argent is a novice nun who seems to cause continuous havoc in the convent where she has lived since the age of 12. Her inquisitive nature and desire to help aren't always appropriate for the convent and she gets in to trouble on a regular basis. Then one day a knight and his retinue ride in to the convent to request a bride of great virtue (the convent teaches young women with no dowries to be good wives). The Abbess decides to send him back to his lands with Eloise so that she can judge whether he will be a suitable husband for one of the young ladies.Their journey doesn't start in an auspicious manner and she finds Peril of Whitmore an unfriendly man. When they arrive at his manor she discovers it's run down with the land producing poor goods and the buildings dirty and ill-kept. However Eloise is one for meddling and soon starts to set things up on a better footing. However the estate is operating under a curse and the villagers see evidence of this curse all the time. Can Eloise and Peril get to the bottom of the problems on his land. And can Eloise make a good judgement of Peril as a potential husband for a young lady when she finds herself drawn to him?This story is gently written with some good characters (although not too much depth to the characters) and all the loose ends are nicely tied up at the end. It's lightweight and easy reading, set in an interesting time in English history. There's a rather simplistic view of landowning (it seems the problems of twenty years of neglect at Whitmore are almost solved after three months of Eloise's ministrations) and some very useful plot devices which are a bit unlikely (lots of marvellous furniture stored in the cellars that's suddenly discovered just at the right moment) but if you ignore that and just go along with the ride it's a pleasant read.There's little doubt in this story who is the 'baddie' - in a rather simplistic manner the baddie is someone who doesn't do his work very well and who isn't liked by the people on the manor. It's never adequately explained why Peril raises Hadric to the position of Steward when he's obviously not good at his job and not trusted - apart from the fact that it's helpful to the plot.I couldn't quite understand why all her meddling which caused no end of disasters in the convent (such as burning food in the kitchens etc) suddenly all came right at Whitmore so that the place was cleaned up very quickly. Perhaps it was because she found her place but more probably it was because it worked better for the plot. There weren't any surprises in reading this story, it's a love story like many others - overbearing man tamed by the love of a good woman."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"I can't think of anything else to say, except that it was just a ton of fun to read this book. A perfect weekend getaway."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"This was my first romance by this author and I will definitely be reading her other books! This was a great, romantic (not an overly anatomically erotic romance novel), and funny book. I love how Eloise made a difference as a medieval version of Martha Stewart! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"I seen all the good reviews on this book and so I bought it. I had to drag myself through the first hundred pages and even then I had to force myself to continue. It did get better towards the end. I just didn't feel any connection to either Peril or Eloise. On just about every page Eloise is down on her knees praying and I just couldn't see that as romantic. Basically this is a story of a man down on his luck, needs a bride to make things better for his people, buys a bride from a convent and then at the very end of the story we get some romance. Of course when he brings Eloise home from the convent where she is trying to be a nun, she is still walking around in a habit and praying and blessing everything. This just wasn't my type of book especially if your looking for sizzling scenes which this book has none."},{"Title":"The Husband Test","review":"I work long, hard hours, and during my off time, I sometimes read lightweight books that don't take much effort to get through. This book fulfilled that requirement. For some reason, I actually wanted to finish it to see how everything turned out, but then when I did, I felt like I'd wasted the time and effort. I felt that it was poorly written and researched, hmmmm, not at all.I don't think that the author has the first idea about life in medieval (I guess?) England. I read a lot of history and historical novels, and when I read something that is this poorly researched, it just annoys me. The sex scenes I mostly skipped over - not because of any prudery on my part, they were just that bad. I have a quick lunch in my car almost every day, and I like to keep a book there so that I'll have something to read while I eat. I like to choose something that I can read \\"at\\" while I'm stuffing my face and answering incessant calls on my cell.

It opens with the nominal point-of-view of Elizabeth, who tells us she is lonely, tells us she is withdrawn, and tells us she pretends interest to the things she used to care deeply about.I wish I could say that the stilted recital was meant to artistically mirror Elizabeth's frozen state after an unexpected break-up, but things simply don't get any better. For the full half of the book I endured the flat narrative, Elizabeth related all the things we needed to know to understand every situtation she confronted, ruining all sense of mystery for the reader.

I just couldn't connect with Elizabeth."},{"Title":"First Light","review":"Baxter begins this book with a glimpse into the life of a family in a state of static malaise. Rather than take the story forward he begins drifting backward in time, layering in incidents and moments that start to explain how the family got that way.

With each chapter our questions are answered and our understanding grows."},{"Title":"First Light","review":"Although Charles Baxter is best known as a master of the short story (BELIEVERS etc.), this novel is his finest piece of work. It is the story of the complicated relationship between a brother and sister, told backwards, from end to beginning.

A magnificent study of the bonds of love and friendship."},{"Title":"First Light","review":"Charles Baxter is better known as a short story writer, but his novels are little-known gems. First Light takes an &quot;ordinary&quot; relationship--that of a brother and sister--and shows how complex it really is. The book travels backwards in time: each chapter takes place at an earlier age in the characters' lives than the previous one. What could be a constricting or gimmicky literary device becomes magical in Charles Baxter's hands. The ending is beautiful. The characters sometimes exasperate but then, doesn't your brother or sister sometimes exasperate you?"},{"Title":"First Light","review":"I read First Light when it first came out.

But I quickly forgot that, and was engrossed in the vivid details and non-sentimental portrayal of the characters."},{"Title":"First Light","review":"I just reread First Light, and it's even better on the second reading, in part because the reverse chronology takes on a whole new dimension when you have some recollection of what has happened earlier. It's a sensitive story of a brother-sister relationship, with all the resentment, competition and love that such relationships entail, and it's told by a man with an eye for detail and a prose style just about unmatched in contemporary American fiction. Enjoyed A Feast of Love too, but I think First Light is always going to be my favorite Baxter novel."},{"Title":"First Light","review":"I feel that the praise for this novel, particularly on this site, has been somewhat extravagant. Though it is a decent first novel, it pales in comparison to Baxter's later work, which I read before reading this. I'm a huge fan of Baxter, however, I found the book anticlimactic and consequently unsatisfying. Using an unconventional narrative form, Baxter takes us backwards in time though the characters' lives. However, nothing happens. Yes, we get a great deal of insight into the lives of these characters, but they are, for lack of a better word, quite passive and frankly unentertaining. Where I can point out nothing wrong with Baxter's style or subject matter, I simply found that the book fell short of where I expected Baxter to take me. Still, if you're a fan of Baxter its worth the read, if only to get a taste of how his work has changed over the years.

Those facts are irrelevant -- I would have loved this book in any event.Charles Baxter created the people in his book so exquisitely that I always feel I am there, traveling along in the story with them whenever I read it. I've never had such a close personal experiences with written characters.He defines and develops his people as they alternately live in their present, and in their receding pasts; his creativity results in characterizations that are very strong.I find myself unexpectedly writing this review after wanting to check if the book is still available; I'm not surprised to find that it is.

I admit that I'm partial to Baxter's writing, but you'll have to forgive me because he's a really good writer. He turns ordinary people into interesting specimens, looking at their lives through a literary microscope, making the reader want to look ever closer.This is exactly what happens in \\"First Light.\\" Baxter starts at a certain point in his main characters' lives, then proceeds backwards to the moment on one of their births. At each new intersection, we learn something about their lives, getting an understanding of how their experiences and views of the world are shaped. As the reader goes through the novel, he/she really understands why they are acting the way they do. As a literary device and metaphor, light figures prominently, and at the end of the novel we really do see the first light of morning, literally and figuratively, and wish to tell the characters how their lives will unfold. But alas, we can't, but we can analyze our own lives and wonder how we got to where we are.This is one of Baxter's better works, and the four stars are to be taken as a comparison to his other writings."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"One of Eudora Welty's most celebrated stories, The Optimist Daughter won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.This story is about a sweet old Judge and his family.

All in all, I liked it and I'm glad I read but it didn't make me want to rush out and read everything by Eudora Welty.It's a very short book, yet it meanders slowly through a basic story. Welty does an excellent job of describing the atmosphere of the south. People in the Mississippi town where most of the novel is set have known each other for years. Most have stayed in the town with a notable exception being Laurel who is the Optimist's Daughter who has returned to care for her ailing father who eventually dies.Laurel is the center of the novel as she comes to terms with loss. This is not just about the loss of her father but is also about the previous losses of her mother and husband. She endures so many levels of stress from past and present events.One of Laurel's sources of stress is her father's silly, selfish, young second wife, Fay. She cannot understand how her father, \\"The Optimist\\" and significant presence in the town could have married such a horrible creature.I found Laurel's journey and the multiple layers of grief to be very well described and interesting. I also enjoyed the feeling and atmosphere of the South.I found the character of the second wife, Fay to be overpowering and inapprpriately extreme. She became hard to take after awhile and I would have preferred her influence to have been more muted.I liked The Optimist's Daughter and give it a middling recommendation."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"It is my first book by Eudora Welty and I am so glad I came across it. It is a story of a middle aged woman Laurel who upon learning that her father is ill comes to visit him and help him during his stay in hospital. Although his recovery seems to be going well, Laurel's 71 year old father dies within weeks. Laurel is stranded with her stepmother who is almost the same age as Laurel. The two are complete opposites in their manners, education and social background.As Laurel prepares for her father's funeral, she reflects on her parents' marriage, her childhood and the times when her mother was dying. Laurel cannot help but think about her own short lived marriage. A year after Laurel was married to a handsome Navy officer, he was killed in action and Laurel remains a widow.Ms. Welty writes such beautiful prose that almost sings in its southern way of speaking and people interactions. Her depictions of enourmous social differences between Laurel's own family and friends and her stepmother Fey's family is stunning. Fey and Laurel are complete opposites in every way. In the end, all that is left is memories that belong to Laurel and no one else. Not even Fey in her selfishness and crudeness can destroy that."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I believe Eudora Welty chose the story she tells in &quot;The Optimist's Daughter&quot; to present her own point of view (attitude) regarding the inevitable results of the confluence of culture she was witnessing in society. Through Laurel, on the train ride from Chicago to Mount Salus, Welty describes what occurs,looking down from a great distance, when the Missippi and Ohio rivers come together. What she sees is the confluence, the blurring of boundaries, the turbulent wiping out of what has been with the indefinable presence of what is. Reaction to what is in the human heart and consciousness varies. Welty indicates some choose pessimism, some choose optimism, and some choose to accept life as it is &quot;on the true.&quot; Once again, through Laurel, Welty reveals her decision regarding how she chooses to react."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Welty's, The Optimist's Daughter, is a gorgeously written novella! In compact, stunningly written prose, Welty tells the story of the passing of a small town Southern judge, and the ensuing conflict between his patrician, well-bred daughter and his tacky, hard-scrabble second wife. Welty does not sound one wrong note in this dead-on depiction of Southern life during this era. Welty's writing itself, as well as its insights into the pinnacles and the depths of the human condition, is stupendous. She absolutely deserved the Pulitzer for this work! My absolutely favorite book, ever!"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Laurel is a quiet character; though she is the center of the book, she rarely speaks. Welty captures Laurel's greif at the death of her father with all of the accompanying conflicting emotions.Laurel's character was developed largely from the tangible details about the way she conducted herself with her father, mother, Fay, and the people from her town, as well as descriptions of her memories. She was a complete character through her interactions with the other characters and her memories which were brought on through her interaction with her surroundings. And though Fay seemed a little bit one-dimensional, she was by no means evil--there are stupid people in the world :)Contrary to some of the other reviewers I felt like the simplicity and grace of Welty's prose deserved the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"For starters, Eudora Welty is a huge name in Southern literature. Born in Mississippi, she was a contemporary of famous literary figures like Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers. The Optimist's Daughter is the first novel I've read by her. She is more well-known for her short stories than her novels. And indeed, this book is extremely short; it actually first appeared in The New Yorker in 1969.The Optimist's Daughter is centered around one person dying, his funeral, and the aftermath (reminiscent of A Death in the Family). Judge McKelva is an old man in need of eye surgery, which he undergoes despite the dangers involved in the recovery. His daughter, Laurel, sits loyally by his side in the Louisiana hospital while he is recovering. Laurel is a widow whose husband died in the war, and her mother died when she was a girl. Her only companion is the judge's wife, Fay, who is younger than him and constantly says, \\"I can't believe this is happening to me\\" (Needless to say, the two women don't have much in common). Welty was considered a \\"regionalist\\" by some people and I think that comes across loud and clear in The Optimist's Daughter: The Texas native is the evil, heartless step mother (Fay) imposing herself on the sweet, saint-like Mississippi orphan (Laurel).An embarrassingly hysterical scene unfolds at the Judge's funeral, and Welty's Southern Gothic influence comes to the surface in her macabre humor. Fay feels increasingly sorry for herself and acts out in selfish angst. Laurel just absorbs it all without open judgement like a saint. Both Fay and Laurel are infinitely boring characters, because they are so static. However, Welty's craft and her imagination mesh with astonishing harmony in the last scene, and the end of the novel culminates in an unexpected, almost violent denouement."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The style of writing is certainly light and easy to read. I whipped through but something was amiss. I suppose the usurping the old man's money made me cringe. Still I loved the characters.

The past, as captured in stories and memories, defines the people of the South and its heritage. One from the South can argue that too much time is spent dwelling on the past.The book revolves around a daughter whose father married a much younger woman. The problem, and story line, is the new woman isn't from the South and has no interest in the past (memories) of the individuals of the family into which she married or the community in which she has been living with her husband. Dad is dead. The new, young wife is vicious and is unaware of the feelings of her former husband's daughter or the Southern community.This is a book where every scene counts. I'm used to scanning parts of books that don't appeal to me. As I found out, you can not scan a 180-page, tightly written masterpiece.This book lingers. You can roar through it 100 miles an hour. Go ahead. Then read the last 10 pages or so one more time. Put it down. You'll go back to those 10 pages again."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I read this book in a couple hours and was sorely dissappointed. I found myself identifying more with Fay (mother in law of the main character) by wanting her in the story much more than she was because of me feeling she had every right to react and feel as she did. In most of the book, she was just pretty much around in a negative way, and her grief didn't help any. Just didn't get much from a typical story in that we all have relatives (in laws) who can be as unnerving (even in death) as those in the story. The ending was pretty much an \\"I'm running out of storyline so I need pack it in with a typical see the world\\" type ending."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I've always wanted to read a Welty book and I picked this one. Unfortunately, because now, I don't think I'll try another.Why must praise be heaped upon books that make you dig into them to uncover meanings that are obvious human truths? What Laurel(the title character) comes to realize at the end was plain to see at the beginning. Human beings are complex and may have motives that are different from what you assume or what yours would be in similar situations. Laurel knew her parents all her life and only after their deaths does she &quot;get&quot; this."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I thought this book was well written but missing some elements. When the book first started out it was very confusing. I wasn't sure what was going on or who the characters were. The book got more interesting in the middle.

The Judge, an optimist, felt Dr. Courtland, a former neighbor in Mount Salus, Mississippi, could do the operation. Dr. Courtland had had something to do with the care of Laurel's mother, who had died.Afterwards the Judge showed unnatural patience, reticence, and silence while he had to keep his head still after the operation. Reading NICHOLAS NICKLEBY seemed endless to Laurel. In wordless communication, Laurel came to understand that her task was not to read the book aloud to her father, but to pass the time at his bedside by reading it to herself.The Judge's new wife was probably younger than his daughter. Fay was from Texas and claimed that her family was deceased. She tried to rouse Judge McKelva and she was stopped from doing so by the private duty nurse. McKelva collapsed and died. Dr. Courtland said that the eye had been healing. The Judge had helped the doctor financially while he was in medical school he told Laurel.Laurel's bride's maids met her at the train and filled the house with food. The old Garden Club members were present, too. Adele Courtland, the doctor's sister, helped. It was a surprise to Laurel that Fay's relatives appeared at the Judge's funeral. The Judge had had no use for theatrics. Laurel was confused. The mourners were saying her father was a crusader, an angel.It came to Laurel that her father had liked Gibbon, not Dickens. Mount Salus Presbyterian Church had been built by the McKelvas. Fay decided to return to Texas with her family for a visit. Family members spoke her language. Laurel faced her father's library. Everything important was in there. (Fay was getting the house.)Laurel had married Philip Hand, an Ohio country boy.

Thank goodness I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy my own copy!"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Thankfully, this was a novella or I would have never finished it. The story is pointless. The protagonist is a weak, spineless woman who allows herself to be abused by her father's second wife without much resistance. I was annoyed from the moment I started reading this by every character in it. If that was Welty's goal then I give this 5 stars instead of 2. Maybe one has to be a southerner to understand this book. The pulitzer board refused to give Pynchon the prize in '74 but they give it to this terrible book. I have read a few Pulitzer prize winning novels and this is the only one that I did not enjoy at all. I give an author one chance and Welty used hers up. May I suggest Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Hersey's A Bell for Adano, Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea or Momaday's House Made of Dawn (just to name a few)if you want to read deserving pulitzer winners. This book is a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I was just glad I was able to finish this novel in about an hour - while it isn't the worst I've ever read, it was overall dull and sort of pointless to my liking. I never really cared for enough of the characters to really connect to the book, and whenever there was a glimmer of amusement or cleverness, it passed as quickly as it had begun. I never mind literary vagueness, but most of the points in the story were just a tad *too* vague. That having been said, I will comment that the ending of the book did please me - I won't give it away for future readers, but what Laurel does with her life is an enormous relief; had she done otherwise I would probably have dashed the book against a wall!"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I picked up The Optimist's Daughter on advice of several recommendations. It is supposedly Welty's best work. Ha! This was certainly among the worst novels I have ever read. The language is poorly structured and she seems to go out of her way to dribble meaningless streams of words. I read it to the bitter end only in the hope that it somehow would get better....it didn't. If you want a great Southern writer I suggest Truman Capote in Other Voices, Other Rooms."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"What a bore!

The characters were undeveloped, the story disjointed, and the story silly.

It just didn't work and am rushing out to find out what the pulitzer finalists were that lost to this book."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Like love, grief is ultimately something that we must all go through alone. There can be people who help, but our emotional journeys are ours alone.And that is the heart of \\"The Optimist's Daughter,\\" a dark, quiet little novel set in the mid-20th century South. Eudora Welty explores a difficult, emotionally wringing topic -- one woman losing the last loved one she had, and the struggle to come to terms with the many people she's lost.Elderly but healthy Judge McKelva goes in for an eye operation, but seems strangely lethargic afterwards. His daughter Laurel -- who has been away for several years -- is concerned as her father continues to decline, especially since his flaky second wife Fay is treating him badly, and even has to be physically restrained by a nurse. Then the judge dies.And Laurel finds herself in her old family home, trying to deal with Fay, her weird family, and the many well-meaning-but-dense friends that McKelva had over the years. But when the house is empty and she is alone, Laurel looks back on her life -- her all-too-brief marriage to a loving man, her mother's horrible death, and her father's remarriage -- and learns how to feel again.Few books that I've read really handle the subject of grief -- usually people hug, cry, and get over it except for a few pages every now and then, when there is a mention of the Dearly Departed.But not many authors can really get to the wrenching, lonely core of grief and loss, and how it can set us free, or lock our emotions and throw away the key. And that is basically what \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is all about -- McKelva's illness and death are a prelude to Laurel's soul-searching, and the exploration of how she handles her grief.Welty wraps the slow, gradual storyline (which takes only a few days) in warm, colourful prose (\\"Sienna-bright leaves and thorns like spurts of matchflame had pierced through...\\"). She does have a tendency to let the dialogue from various people ramble, but often that rambling makes some very sharp points about loss, such as how the well-meaning often tell white lies about the dead, or ignore their dying wishes.Laurel is kind of a nonentity for the first half of the book -- she's all locked up in herself, and we don't know much about her. But then Welty paints the devastating pain and guilt that she's been feeling, and shows how you have to let go of the past in order to live the future. Quite a contrast to the childish, putrescent Fay, whose rallying cry is always \\"What about ME?\\" and who accuses her dying husband of ruining her birthday.\\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is only optimistic as it ends -- up until then, it's a beautifully painful look at love, loss, and grief. A magnificent story, if a rather uncomfortable one."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I lost my mom last year following a lengthly illness--my husband and I were her primary caregivers during the last terrible, torturous months of her life. Since her death, I've had much trouble dealing with the ordeal and with her loss.Over the past year, I've read a lot about chronic illness, terminal illness, and death--trying to find some sense and understanding of my mother's tragedy. This book helped me where dozens of others couldn't.Part of my distress has been a lingering sense of guilt that I could have done more, done things better. Objectively, I know I gave everything I had. However, this book helped me examine those emotions, put them in perspective, and hopefully begin to heal. The following horrible quote describes exactly the shortcomings I saw within myself:&quot;You could have saved your mother's life. But you stood by and wouldn't intervene. I despair for you.&quot;I'm at a loss to explain why this made me feel better--but it did. This is a glorious novella which has helped me more than I can say--I recommend it highly. I apologize for the very personal nature of this review."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I tend to agree with most of the glowing reviews and I can understand some of the frustration with the few negative reviews.The complaint that \\"not much happens\\" after the funeral is valid to a point. Today's readers want to see evil and ignorance vanquished, whether it's a genuine villian or just some hillbilly white trash grabbing up an old man's estate with both hands.But this is an evil and ignorant world, and Welty does a wonderful job of telling a story that feels not so much like a story but real life itself.To me, I was impressed with Welty's incredible economy to tell this story. Anyone assigned to read this for a class or trying it out on their own should keep that in mind while reading it.It will make for a more rewarding reading experience."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I picked up this book on a remainder table. I had heard of Eudora Welty, only because of this book, which won her the Pulitzer Prize.I was not dissapointed for the following reasons:1. The book is concise. Sometimes it is nice to get through a book in 3 hours rather than 3 weeks, or like some that really drag, 3 months.2. The prose is wonderful, the descriptions colorful. The storyline is simple, I could summarize the storyline in 3 sentences or less, but what was remarkable was the beauty of the writing and the short, descriptive paragraphs which made me go back and reread a few which I thought were particularly poignant.3. The storyline, although simple, is interesting. I could relate to Laurel; I could see the old house and recognize all the neighbors as they came to her father's wake. I am surprised it has not been made into a movie. (or has it?)4. The storyline and writing style reminded me of 'A Summons to Memphis\\" by Peter Taylor, another Southern writer.If you are looking for action packed, this book isn't it. Should you want to appreciate some of the finest American Literature of the 20th century, this is a good pick."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"If you have long wondered what the fuss about Eudora Welty is all about, read THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER, the 1973 Pulitzer Prize-winner for fiction. This is no peripheral achievement but the heart of the Welty experience. As you begin reading it, you would describe it as a spare, quiet character study. By the time you finish it--the prose is sleek and straightforward, you glide through it--you are flipping back, realizing the profundities it has kicked up all the way through, hoping you did not miss anything. It is the story of Laurel McKelva Hand, fortysomething widow, who has flown back to the south from her career life in Chicago to be at her father's side as he copes with a medical emergency. It is obvious that she has come because the trophy wife/stepmother, Fay, is not considered up to the task by anyone else's standards. The first part of the novel ends with the judge's death; the second part moves back into the Mississippi house where Laurel grew up for her father's funeral. Here Welty introduces the town folk who hold her father and late mother in high esteem, who regard Fay as a white trash outsider nuisance. Fay reminds everyone that she gets all the property, everything they all view as belonging to the deceased parents and the grown daughter. The first two parts could easily translate to the screen or stage; the last two would be more difficult because Welty turns inward, helping Laurel sort out memory, loss, and what it spells for her future. The power of the book lies in how it twists and turns through the four characters--Laurel, her parents, and Fay--moving around the tensions between them until a full sense of the truth is located. What you first know about Laurel and Fay will be challenged. Neither is simple, nor is the story."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Having just finished the complete stories of Eudora Welty, I decided to read this novella, and I was not disappointed. I agree that there are challenges here: a plodding story, a rich subtext, a foggy past as seen through the eyes of the grieving daughter, Laurel, the foil to Fay, the one-dimensional, fatuous mother-in-law, and a work that requires immense concentration by the reader as the author slowly reveals the haunting mysteries of a family's past. In reading Welty's short stories, I was struck by how many of them succeed solely because of the psychological tension between the characters. \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is no different; it is a psychological drama that plays out in Laurel's mind as she attempts to explain and understand the complex mysteries of her parents and her past. In the end, Laurel seems to make peace with herself and her parents, but we are certain that she never fully understands the riddles of her or their history. I believe that this is precisely what Welty intended: that are no simple or certain explanations in life, only the inexplicable presence of memory and history."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I was expecting more from this Pulitzer Prize-winning book.It tells the story of Laurel, who spends her father's last days at his bedside, together with his second wife, Fay. After his death, she and Fay go back to his home, each to react to the past and future in their own way.Some reviewers say this book is character rather than plot driven. And that's correct. But I never got a full sense of the characters. For example, I couldn't see either Laurel or Fay. I could only hear their voices and imagine their actions.This book is a great example of showing rather than telling. Readers induce the characters from their dialogue and reactions. But I found the dialogue to become long and tedious, the secondary characters confusing, and I longed for more description of the places and characters. I finished the book unsatisfied, longing for something more."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"When Eudora Welty (1909 -- 2001) began work on the story that became \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" she had difficulty settling upon a title. At diffent times she considered \\"Poor Eyes\\", \\"An Only Child\\", \\"Baltimore\\" and even \\"The Flickering Light of Vision\\" as possible titles. Welty's editor at the \\"New Yorker\\" and close friend, William Maxwell urged her to keep her original title. In a letter to Welty of January 29, 1968, Maxwell wrote: \\"I am still partial to 'The Optimist's Daughter\\", because, by its ironic tone, it suggests a certain distance between the writer and the woman in the story, and because it also, again by its irony, suggests, matches, somehow, the full horror of the subject matter\\". Welty followed Maxwell's suggestion and retained her original title. \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" first was published as a story in the \\"New Yorker\\" in 1969 and then, in an expanded version, as a novel in 1972. In 1973, Welty received the Pulitzer Prize for the book.Maxwell was correct about the irony in the title, as between the primary character, Laurel McKelva, and her father, Judge Clint McKelva. But Welty's difficulty in deciding upon a title suggests the multi-faceted character of this dense, closely-written short work. Unusually for Welty, \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" has strong autobiographical elements. She interrupted her work on a longer project in 1966 to write the story following the death of her mother. The character of Becky McKelva, the mother of Laurel who was raised in West Virginia and became Judge McKelva's first wife, seems to have been modeled closely on Welty's mother. And a major theme of \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is coming to terms with grief and moving on with life.The story is set primarily in New Orleans and in the small town of Mount Salus, Mississippi in the early 1960's. Short but important scenes take place in West Virginia and Baltimore. When the book begins, Judge McKelva is in New Orleans to consult with his friend, a distinguished opthamologist, about an eye problem. With the Judge is his second wife, Fay, 40, to whom he has been married for about two years and his widowed daughter, Laurel, in her mid-40s. Laurel works as an artistic designer in Chicago and has returned to be with her father when she learns of his illness. After a serious operation on his eye, Judge McKelva ultimately collapses and dies. Fay and Laurel return to Mount Salus for the funeral.The book moves slowly and deliberately in both the New Orleans and the Mount Salus sections of the story. Laurel is thoughtful and reserved and grieves deeply for her father and for her own life and tragedy. She became a widow when her husband was killed in WW II. Fay, is egotistical, earthy, insensitive, crude, and dishonest. Although she tells Laurel that she has no remaining family, except for a grandfather, her mother and kin from Texas arrive in Mount Salus for the funeral. Welty makes a great deal of the contrast between the brash, vulgar Texas family of Fay, and the reserved ladies of Mount Salus, lifelong friends of the Judge and of Laurel. Welty spends a good deal of space in the description of the events leading up to and including the funeral with much character discussion of Fay and her family, and the Mississippians. The relationship between Fay and the McKelva's reminded me of the relationship between the established and wealthy Ponder family and the trashy Peacock family, also connected by marriage, in an earlier Welty short novel called \\"The Ponder Heart\\".The Ponder Heart\\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is a highly internalized work. There is little in the way of overt action. The climax of the work occurs when Laurel spends three days largely alone in the old family home following her father's funeral. Surrounded with evidence of her youth, Laurel reflects on her father's life and death, and on the death of her mother, Becky, who had grown up in West Virginia. Becky died after a long, painful, and delirious illness. Laurel also reflects on the brief period of happiness she had enjoyed with her husband, Phil.The writing is terse, precise, and evocative throughout and uses a great deal of nature symbolism. Welty comes to focus on how Laurel comes to understand her life and her relationship to Fay. Welty does not utterly reject Fay, in spite of all her crudity, but comes to show her with a degree of sympathy. And Laurel comes to an understanding of herself. She is able to move forward with the remainder of her life with a sense of meaning and hope for the future.\\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" explores themes of differences among people, past and present, loss and moving on with a high degree of wisdom and subtelty. The book consists of only a small number of scenes but they are developed extensively with great artistry. This is an excellent novel that bears close reading by an important American author. I was inspired to read this book by reading a recent collection of correspondence between Welty and William Maxwell, edited by Suzanne Marrs.What There Is to Say We Have Said: The Correspondence of Eudora Welty and William MaxwellMaxwell's letter to Welty about the title of the book, discussed early in this review, is drawn from Marrs' edition of the letters.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I'm not a big fan of Southern fiction in general, but this short novel is definitely a brilliant achievement. With admirable subtlety, Welty creates a portrait of the good and bad in all of us, as personified by demure Laurel and her wonderfully nasty stepmother, Fay.If most of the actual events come and go in the first 25 pages or so, the heart of the novel belongs to the more reflective remainder. Bereaved of her father but also free - for the moment - from the nagging of Fay and her relatives, Laurel experiences an emotional journey instantly recognizable to all of us who have ever stumbled into our families' past. From the thrill of reading your grandparents' childhood letters to the pungent smell of their clothes after years of smoking to the dimly lit bedroom nobody else had entered for 30 years...Welty's prose may be a bit purple, but all those sensations you love and hate at the same time are here.Character development is strong across the board as well. You won't like most of Fay's relatives and some of her friends, but then, you're not supposed to. (Isn't that what funerals are usually like in real life?) And they do blend in well with the vividly illustrated surroundings. You may not want the book to end as quickly as it does, but chances are you'll be happy for Laurel that it's over. You'll also come away with an interesting perspective on an uncomfortable event that most of us have to endure several times in our lives."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"On its face, this is a \\"little book,\\" not only because it is short in length, but because its written in simple prose, straightforward language, and tells a bittersweet, simple story. But don't be fooled; beneath the surface lies a swirling tale of frustration and betrayal. Blink, and you will miss it. I did. On my second slower reading, I found layers in the layers, resentments and disappointments, flashes of anger and bitterness-even among friends, families and lovers.Through the telling of this simple tale, the author pursues various themes, using character study, plot development, symbols (birds, flowers, and other household objects). Very few insights are given in a straightforward, declarative manner, but are unfolded slowly, in independent presentations, to which the reader gives weight by finding connections.For example, one of the larger themes the author pursues is the way love and interdependence intertwine. In that regard, the author writes:\\"But Laurel had kept the pigeons under eye in their pigeon house and had already seen a pair of them sticking their beaks down each other's throats, gagging each other, eating out of each other's craws, swallowing down all over again what had been swallowed before...They convinced her that they could not escape each other and could not themselves be escaped from.\\"Later in the novel, she revisits this theme describing how Laurel's mother, on her death bed, angrily confronted her husband's inability to \\"see\\" her pain and frustration (which the mother refers to as \\"her betrayal\\") by calling him a coward--but simultaneously and steadfastly clinging to his hands, and refusing to let go.Among other themes, as the title suggests, the author explores the notion of optimism, with the converse for the author, not being pessimism, but being realistic--the strength to face life and go on, even with its pains and difficulties. In that regard, the author writes, \\"But he was not an optimist--she knew that. Phil had learned everything he could manage to learn, and done as much as he had time for, to design houses to stand, to last, to be lived in; but he had known they could equally well, with the same devotion and tireless effort, be built of cards.\\"In conclusion, even after two readings, I feel that I have only scratched the surface of this book's depth. My suggestion for one considering a read, to achieve the maximum value this book has to offer, be prepared to do the work. If you are not (which is of course fine), its probably not the best choice."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"In the book \`The Optimist's Daughter' by Eudora Welty there is a scene where the protagonist (Laurel McKelva) who is the daughter of the deceased Judge McKelva, finds a bird in her Father's (and now her mother-in-law Fay's) house. I believe that this bird represents all Laurels life throughout the book. It is my opinion that Eudora Welty decided to simplify Laurels life into this situation with the bird showing us all the events that had happened to Laurel in the book.When Laurel first arrives home, she sees the bird, which \`shot out of the dining room and now went arrowing up the stairwell in front of her eyes' (pg 129). This first action of the bird sounds quite like Laurel after her mother died. The bird left the relative safety of the dining room, which it had been accustomed to at that point because of a sudden change (Laurels arrival) and it darted off quickly somewhere else that it had never been to before.Laurels life changed drastically when her mother died suddenly. Given the change in her life, she quickly darted of to another city, a place she did not know just like the bird did.Then, Laurel goes into the master bedroom of the house, and turns on a light, which the bird is immediately attracted to and it comes towards it, where Laurel slams the door shut on it to keep it out. Just like how, when Judge McKelva called Laurel, she came rushing out to see if he was ok and he died, just as surprisingly as the door slamming, and then he leaves everything he owns to Fay almost like a slap to the face.The bird is then restless, constantly \`touching, taping, brushing itself against the walls and closed doors, never resting' (pg 130). The bird is uncomfortable, and is restless, but no matter how much it struggles, it does not get anywhere. This is very much like Laurel once she is back in Mount Salus. She doesn't like the fact that people are telling lies about Judge McKelva, she doesn't like the fact that he isn't going to be buried with the rest of his family, she doesn't like the fact that the casket is going to be kept open and she certainly doesn't like the fact that Fay made such a scene at the funeral. However, as much as she might try to raise an objection, or tell people that that is not the way it was, she is trying to no avail.Then later, Mr. Check the carpenter is trying to help get the bird out of Laurel's room. Unfortunately all he does is make the situation worse and he simply shrugs it off when he does. This is very much alike to Laurel and her \`bridesmaids' whom thought that they were helping her and being supportive but really weren't doing anything to help.Finally, with the help of Missouri, Laurel manages to free the bird from the house and it flies away. This I believe, is the biggest section of symbolism. The house, I think, represents Laurels pass, the bird itself, representing Laurel. Laurel is trapped in the past, just like the bird is trapped in the house. Eventually however, the bird flies away back out into the unknown, free from the house, just like Laurel, will, leave Mount Salus and be free from her past and go back out to the world free from all that has happened."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a very tightly written story (almost a novella) about a daughter's coping with the death of her father. The plot involves an obnoxious second wife. There is plenty of good dialog and evocative writing about the South."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I would recommend Optimists Daughter to anyone. This book is great! It is filled with realism. It shows the meaning of true friendship and how dealing with death can be painful, but at the same time able to get something from it by finding out some things about the past.Also, the book explains the importance of life and how one minute things can be fine but the next, things may fall apart. Although there is saddness in this book, the main character shows a true quality of being strong for herself and others. Optimists Daughter shows how short life may be and how we need to live it to the fullest. It also shows the importance of every person that fills our life whether they be friends, family, or even neighbors."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This story is basically about a woman named Laurel who makes some realizations about her family and herself. Her father has recently died after undergoing a relatively minor surgery. Laurel and her crass stepmother Fay, both travel back to Laurels' hometown to bury him. After the funeral, Laurel who is now alone in the house comes to an understanding of her parents while having some revelations about her past, herself and who she is. This is a very good story that will hold your attention, despite the fact little action takes place. The most action there is occurs when Fay returns to the house and has words with Laurel; even then it's a very sedate confrontation. Overall, this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"It is hard for one to let go of past memories and to accept a new face, especially one who is tremendously different from the family's own identity.

She must try to forget and try to realize as well, what her father has seen in the past few years of his life.

It deals with a judge's daughter and the way she dealt with his death. This book shows the importance of living life to the fullest and the how every person in your life is important in some way whether thay be friends, family, or even neighbors. This is filled with realism by dealing with the death of a loved one to many. Although this book is sad it shows that life is short and we need to live every minute of it to the fullest. The Optimists Daughter shows us that things we deal with every day may be painful but, it is easier if we have friends and other family to support us in times of need."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This was a charming book that gave a sense of life in the small town South. However, I was surprised it had won a Pulitzer Prize as one of the main characters -- Fay -- was very one dimensional, and the story was slight."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I wanted to read this book because the writing style of one of my favorite authors (Fred Chappell) was compared to that of Eudora Welty. My expectations, therefore, were high and I felt disappointed and wholly unsatisfied when I finished reading it. Perhaps this is due to some failing or intellectual lacking of my own (after all, the book DID win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction) but I found her characters to be rather flat and her attempts at abstract descriptions difficult to follow. If I had reread certain passages a few times, I might have been able to follow her train of thought but I read fiction for pleasure, not to practice my study skills. Throughout the entire book, I got the feeling that she was simply trying too hard to be poetic. While her writing must appeal to others, I, most likely, will not pick up another one of her books in the future."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Laurel's developement throughout the novel makes her a wonderfully three demensional person, but all the other characters are steeped in stereotyes. Stereotyping in this novel, however, is used as a tool.While the Judge's first wife was utterly selfless (due to an obsession with the past) his second wife, Fay, is selfish to a rediculous degree. Fay is perfectly despisable, and I commend Welty for her perfect personification of that vice. The funniest lines in this novel come from Fay's childish, ego-centric perception of the world.Laurel's realization about her father's &quot;optimism&quot; for a new life with Fay is a significant one. When you read this take note of Laurel's growth, because it is in her developement that this book becomes psychologically and philosophically interesting.This book will not be for everyone because of the simple, slow plot. Welty's talent resides not giving us a riveting plot, but in creating the atmosphere and tone of the south."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This book cannot be read without, to quote Peter Medawar, &quot;a desperate gasping and flailing around for sense.&quot; Although it starts off promisingly enough, this book quickly degenerates into semi-philosophical musings and one-dimensional characters. To make things worse, the reader is expected to keep track of a multitude of minor characters who crawl over and mess up everything, like ants at a picnic. Save your money and read the white pages instead."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"My only regret about this story is that it ended too soon. I think it is a remarkable piece of writing, with an elaborate selection of characters that brings out thoughts on family relationships and a wide range of emotions, from love to grief and loss."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"read this for my Classics book club - read it in one afternoon but 2 days later could barely remember what it was about - had to look it over again - ok story -"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Almost lyrical story of a woman losing her beloved father following routine eye surgery. Staying in her childhood home with his very young self-involved second wife, re-living memories of her mother and the loss of her own husband many years before, brings on powerful awarenesses and relevations about life and relationships."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The action in The Optimist's Daughter is minimal and limited, but also fairly inconsequential. The novel's path is through Laurel's journey within herself, one that involves soul searching and coming to terms with death and grief. Laurel returns to New Orleans to care for her ailing father, but, upon returning, she has to deal with past childhood memories, former acquaintances, the grief of past and present losses, and one very antagonistic woman, Fay, her father's new wife. Searching her soul to the understanding of what memories serve, Laurel puts perspective on painful events and those who are close to her.One significant character battle is simply the battle of wills between Fay, the brash widow of the Judge, and Laurel, the Judge's daughter. Ultimately, the difference between Laurel and Fay is that Laurel can see the value and significance in people and the memories they bring; Fay, on the other hand, only sees the wall in front of her face. Laurel is quiet and reflective; Faye, brash and irrational. They both care about the Judge, but clearly have different ways of expressing it.Eudora Welty's The Optimist's Daughter is a quiet, somber, short read, but carries with it a message about how all of us deal with the difficulties and trials we experience in life--death, isolation, loneliness. Welty has a way of crafting such vivid prose in thought-provoking ways. There is so much going on under the surface level of this novel, and it becomes sort of a cathartic experience."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The book builds the characters layer by layer. We can feel their pain and their joys. The contrast of the daughter and the new younger wife if stunning. The author compares and contrast the two while comparing and contrasting the people of the town and the new wife's family. I read this with my bookclub and I think we were all struck by the love shown when the daughter remembers her father and mother (the first wife) reading to each other in bed at night while she listens through the walls. Great book for anyone who enjoys southern novels and anyone who knows sharing books with others holds its own magic."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I have to admit that I did not enjoy the book and read it very quickly. I can't stop thinking about it though and that makes me think I need to re-read it. I didn't see Fay in the negative way that most reviewers did. When Fay \\"abused\\" the judge I agreed with her. Keeping him immobile in that bed was killing him and he was losing the will to live. She was right to try to wake him up. Laurel and the townspeple irritated me far more than Fay. Does anyone else agree that Fay was not as one dimensional as she seemed and had an honesty and realism about her?"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The Optimist's Daughter was a subtle read. Yet, Welty expertly conveys the colorful nuances of New Orleans and Mississippi culture, especially Mardi Gras, the assorted southern mansions, a clownishly outfitted cat, the neighborhood as well as their compassionate yet busybody endless curiosity of their meddling behavior. That was just a small component of the novel. She really captures the essence of small town Mayberry life. It's sweet but also rather suffocating without diminishing the characters in the novel. It's like you'd want to stay there for five or ten minutes and then leave.What I found to be really true, however, was the leaving of small town life with all the attachments that belong to it and then suddenly coming back to it, and that was the case of Laurel Hand, a quiet yet strong-willed woman who returns home from Chicago. She has come back to care for her ailing father-Judge Clint McKelva, who is highly revered for his sound judicial wisdom and the help he has given to his neighbors. Upon coming back to Mount Salus, Mississippi, Laurel-modern and dignified-must deal with her annoying and shrewish stepmother who weaseled herself into the judge's life. Money is always a motive. Laurel composes herself, meets with the community and waits the bitter wait of her beloved father's demise. Does it immediately happen? Do things go sour for the money hungry Fay McKelva, who nobody in the community likes? You'll just have to read.When it is time for Fay and Laurel and all the neighbors to retreat back to normal life, because all seems well, supposedly, there is no love lost, especially with Fay. Let's just say that her annoying character rhythms with the word itch. In the end, when good or bad happens, people must always retreat back to the normal routines of day-to-day living, and that is no different for Laurel; she is a designer of some sort and has her own life. Yet, all the old biddies of the neighborhood want her to stay on, for she would be a fantastic asset to the community. However, that can't be, and she makes it quite clear. Just because she is leaving Mount Salus, she is not leaving its essence, the memories. Just as when a human passes on, so too is it the same with our old childhood homes and friends. More often-than-not, we carry those wonderful memories with us when we are far away. Those memories take us back to the epicenter of what we most long for.The optimist's daughter was a really decent read with a simple yet potent message. It was a short and sad book yet strangely affirming-and only 180 pages-but it was worthy of its 1972 Pulitzer Prize win. I think readers will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I spent this last year of school (senior year) analyzing and constructing an essay on this novel. When choosing my book, I naively put the one Welty book that was on the list as my first choice solely because Rory Gilmore Mentioned Welty in her graduation speech (in Gilmore Girls) ...and it was short, at 187 pages. I read the description and it sounded pretty good so i was all set.I had no idea what was in store for me. This small novel is a treasure of mine that i will recommend to all my friends, especially the girls. The book is separated into 4 parts-each part with 4 chapters i believe, so it makes it incredibly easy to read. As many others have said, the plot is not the concern of the story, it is the characters, especially the main character middle aged widow Laurel McKelva Hand and her emotional maturity. I especially enjoyed reading this book because there was an uncanny resemblance of Laurels life to my own-which freaked me out, but made it even more meaningful.Basic story plot is this: After Laurel's father's death she and her snooty immature step mother must go back to her little hometown in Mississippi for the funeral. During her stay at her childhood home surrounded by the people she once called friends, Laurel fights a mental battle with herself concerning the truth of the relationship between her dead parents and what her memories mean. It is an ultimately uplifting novel seeing that Laurel finally finds peace within herself and can finally 'let go' of the things that had been holding her back from true happiness for so long and be free.The complexity comes through the internal examination of the past, memories, and the distinct difference between the two. And this is what Laurel must learn in order to come to terms with her past and her relationships so that she can return to Chicago 'whole and healed' so to speak.Bottom line: If you are looking for an easy read that will move you in ways unexpected, and a story centered on careful character development rather than a fast paced plot- READ THIS BOOK Eudora Welty is an incredible author and this should be considered her best work."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a beautiful book about relationships, the past, and the present. Welty's language is moving while the story she builds is so wonderfully simple that it allows a reader to focus on the subtleties of character and language."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a wonderful novel, exactly what I would expect from Eudory Welty. She catches the absurdity, silliness and nobility of the human spirit, all those qualities that make us human and are mixed up in all of us.The story focuses on Laurel McKelva who takes care of her dying father, Judge McKelva. Her father's second wife, Fay, is younger than Laurel and Laurel must deal with Fay's impulsivity and seeming dispassion and immaturity. How Laurel deals with her father's death, memories of her family and her return home while at the same time reuniting with old friends and forced to tolerate Fay and her family from the boonies is the surface story. Underneath, we watch Laurel examine just what love is. \\"For her life, any life, she had to believe, was nothing but the continuity of its love.\\"Lauel slowly learns to understand Fay by understanding her roots and feeling a tenderness towards Fay's young nephew Wendell, whose present environment likely mirrors Fay's childhood.Gradually, her annoyance and disdain for Fay turns to pity and then tolerance. For Fay, in her dispassion can never find true solace. Laurel realizes that:\\"the past is no more open to help or hurt her than was her father in his coffin. The past is like him impervious, and can never be awakened. It is memory that is the somnambulist\\".Thus Laurel comes to terms with her past, her family and with Fay. This is a profound and wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"At the time of her death, Eudora Welty of Mississippi was generally considered America's greatest living author. Although Welty made her reputation with and is best remembered for her remarkable short stories, she also wrote a number of novels, including THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER, for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.As seen in reviews posted here, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER provokes a very divided response in readers. This largely due to the nature of the work, which is character rather than plot driven, and which although quite short requires a slow reading in order to develop clearly in mind. Perhaps more so than in any other work, Welty writes \\"below the surface\\" here: the story itself, which concerns a daughter who returns to her tiny Mississippi home town when her respected father dies, is quite slight--but Welty endows it with a surprising depth of meaning, transforming what would otherwise be pure character study into a sharply focused and deeply moving statement on the nature of love, loss, life, and the passage of time we must all endure.Although written in a deceptively simple style, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER is the mature work of a master. Given the nature of the piece, I do not think it can be much appreciated by young adults; one requires the perspective of at least middle age to fully grasp both its delicacy and beauty. But once that perspective is acquired, THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER should move immediately to the top of every serious reader's list. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The sentence from this book that best describes it is: &quot;Memory lived not in initial possession but in the freed hands, pardoned and freed, and in the heart that can empty but fill again, in the patterns restored by dreams.&quot; What a beautiful piece of writing! I am so thankful for growing older and maturing. Having done so, this book can truly be enjoyed. It is about maturing, deepening, remembering, and honoring. It is about relationship with the persons in one's life, with the past and with the future. Obtrusively thrust in the middle of all this is Fay and the Chisom family, representing all the possible ugliness, crassness, uncaring and unfeeling meanness of today's world.I could write that there is little that happens in this book...on the surface, but as in all truly rich experiences, one has to go deeper and reflect to see the richness. After slowly enjoying the first 160 pages or so, the last 10 pages explode in complexity and interaction and meaning. Those pages comprise one of the finest endings to a novel that I have read."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1973, this moving study of memory and the progression of generations is still vibrant and relevant thirty years later. Not only does it show us the ripple effect that one person's passing has on loved ones, it also shows us the changes to society which occur as older generations pass away and new generations take their place.Welty's concern here is with values--those traditional values learned by Laurel, the daughter of a Mississippi judge, from her parents; those learned by her parents from their parents; those imparted by the town she grew up in and the people who lived there; and those which Laurel has absorbed from her life as an artist in Chicago. In her values she is in direct contrast with Fay, the judge's young second wife, a crass and selfish woman from Texas with a large, boisterous, and uneducated family--a woman whose only desire is to come out a winner. When the judge dies, Laurel returns temporarily to her old room in the family home, which, Fay takes great pains to remind her, now belongs to Fay. There, surrounded by family belongings, she is assailed by memories of her childhood, her mother, her mother's final illness, and her relationship with her father. Her pre-occupation with the past is in direct contrast with Fay's concern with the present and her future--these women clearly belong to different worlds, and only Laurel is capable of change or adaptation.Welty's ear for dialogue is unerring. She reveals character, class, and education in her syntax and choice of vocabulary and creates conflicts from the smallest of details--a misunderstood word, an imagined slight, a presumption. The conflict is leavened by humor in many places, some of it dark, especially when Fay's \\"no 'count\\" family arrives at the funeral. The characters themselves lack subtlety, however, and the symbolism is obvious--birds and flowers are constant motifs, and in the final scene, a handmade breadboard assumes meanings for Laurel well beyond what one would expect for such a simple item. For those of us who have lived through the death of parents and the disposal of a family home, this novel has a resonance rare in modern fiction, one which transcends the period in which it was written and the southern location in which it is set. Wonderful! Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"It is no great surprise that Eudora Welty received the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for the novel The Optimist's Daughter. Welty masterfully creates a journey through the heart of a daughter who loosens her grasp on the past while embracing the future after the death of her father, a beloved judge. The author uses motifs to reflect the past versus present theme, and symbols, and metaphors to add drama to the overall plot through insights into the characters. Eudora Welty uses the \\"judge and jury\\" metaphor through out the novel to keep the theme of the novel progressing. The metaphor describes Fay's judgement of Laurel's visit during her father's hospital stay, and like wise Laurel's judgement of Fay \`s resentment towards Becky. The metaphor is once again used after the funeral when the garden club, Becky's friends, sentence Fay to be the outcast of the town. This metaphor is the core of the novel's struggle for the truth. Welty uses numerous symbols to aid her writing. The author uses birds to signify death, every time a bird enters a reference to or an actual death occurs. Black also symbolizes death and demons, whether they are people or inner thoughts. The black clothes at the funeral symbolize the morning that accompanies death. Welty also uses a breadboard in the last chapter that symbolizes Laurel's love for her husband and her past. The motif of the mountains is the most apparent in the novel. Laurel's mother Becky never felt more alive than when she was in the mountains. The mountains are where Becky McKleva drew her strength, hence why she wanted to return to her beloved West Virginia Mountains when she was on her death bed. The mountains are also the key to unlocking parts of Laurels past which aid her in her quest for happiness in the future. Eudora Welty masterfully created an insight into America's growing trend of the second wife syndrome in this novel. Her motifs, metaphors, and symbols made her flashbacks into the past easier to understand, and aided in the understanding of the characters. Through the judgements of Laurel and the town Fay's character is revealed, and in the end the past is resolved and the future is just beginning."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Hearing this story in the author's own soft, cultivated and yet mischievous Mississippi voice is the greatest treat. I liked the story itself because it was one of those things that you just got drawn into, like family gossip. You don't maybe want to take the time at first, it's hardly blood and thunder, but you just get to wondering why people are where they are in life. How did we get to this pass? All of sudden you find yourself in some little town because your father is in need of an operation , and then you are forced to be among people not your own class because your dad gave into his sexual desires at an advanced age, and the woman he's married stomps all over the family memories and does the bedroom in hooker style. Later, the younger wife's kin will arrive and collectively freak. And you (finally) take it all like a good, believing Christian, but only because you have the gift of irony and humor. And because any other response does violence to the memory of your parents. Classical virtues act like a giant levee against the red mud tide of blind pig-squealing relatives. Is it self-control at a price? Sure. God, I love this woman. May flights of angels send her to her rest."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"I enjoyed taking the time to read this short novel. Welty has crafted incredibly believable characters that carry their frustrations and inanities safely in a clip-shut purse to rest on their laps. I particularly enjoyed discovering Fay; she stands for the selfish, nasty, and brutish in all of us; she is all around us, we all know someone like her.Best of all, however, is Welty's supple gift with language. She constructs the narration with a maturity of style that is difficult to describe. She delves into the lives of the characters, their pasts, their silent struggles, and reveals it with respect. It's as if she were handling a rare vase newly unearthed from a dig, turning it in the light, pointing out the scratches and cracks and always admiring the thing.This is a character novel. The plot is secondary to the lives of the characters. Inside the story, the gossamer trace of humanity in the characters left me with a tickle--a flutter--and it made me think about things in my life in comparison."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This book is the conclusion of Welty's thematic trilogy of Southern family life: while \\"Delta Wedding\\" concerns a family gathering for a marriage ceremony and \\"Losing Battles\\" relates the events surrounding a family reunion celebrating a matriarch's 90th birthday, \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is about a funeral. Like her previous works, this last of Welty's novels deals primarily with emotions rather than actions, with character rather than plot. Unlike any of her previous novels, however, this short work has both feet planted firmly in the last half of the twentieth century.Laurel, a widow not entirely recovered from the loss of her husband many years earlier, returns home and finds herself completely without family. Her father dies, leaving in his wake the appropriately named Fay, a vulgar second wife who represents everything Laurel isn't and her mother wasn't. The rest of the novel describes the various attempts by Fay and by the friends of her father to reshape their recollections of his life to their own needs; a particular humorous scene describes four elderly neighborhood women criticizing both Fay and the deceased--more to affirm their own sense of superiority than to comfort Laurel, who endures every word of their conversation. After Fay leaves town for a few days with her trailer-trash relatives (who cause quite a stir when they show up for the funeral), Laurel is left alone to wander through her childhood home and wonder about her family's past. By the end of the novel, Laurel realizes that neither Fay nor her father's neighbors can take away the only things left in her life: her memories of her parents and her future.Because of its leisurely pacing, this book isn't for everyone. To say that nothing happens is not entirely accurate: although it's a short book, it's difficult to summarize in even a few paragraphs. It is beautifully written, it's easy to read, and the novel has richly drawn characters--but some readers may feel the novel itself lacks character. Once I finished the book, I was not sure whether or not I liked it, and I don't feel it's her best. At times the book almost collapses under the weight of its own heavy-handed symbols: the birds, the mountains, the thunderstorm, the breadboard. The novel repays a few hours of reflection and rereading, however: passages that are seemingly unrelated to the main narrative eventually make sense. What saves \\"The Optimist's Daughter,\\" in the end, is both its ability to haunt the reader and Welty's sure-handed understanding of humanity."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Welty's Pulitzer winning novel, set in the South of 30 years ago, examines the physical mechanics of the funeral process, while placing the human heart under the microscope of social and filial stress. Laurel--a war widow deprived of the experiences and joys of normal married life, rushes back to Missisippi from her Chicago job and lifestyle. This devoted only child insists on her place at her father's bedside, as he undergoes eye surgery--a convenient medical smokescreen for the unmentionable killer: Cancer. How can a confirmed Optimist handle this grim reality?The storyline develops in the aftermath of his inevitable death, but the battle lines are drawn even before he quietly expires: between Laurel--the daughter of beloved Judge Clint McKelva and his adored wife, Becky--and Fay, the utterly selfish and emotionally crude second wife/young step-mother. Is it seemly to be disputing arrangements before the man is even enterred?What had the judge been thinking--to desecrate his wife's memory by bringing that crass Texas woman into the big house where Miss Becky was enshrined in neighborhood memory? Laurel suffers deep emotional trials as she tries to maintain her dignity at the Viewing--held in the Judge's study--then during funeral and graveside solemnities. But conditions deteriorate, as bruised egos and grieving hearts are bared in a shocking public display. The interlopers have no sense of decency or compassion for the sincere mourners who rally around their native daughter.There is brief respite for Laurel when Fay suddenly departs with her hick kin; yet being alone with kind neighbors and loving bridesmaids does not really help her penetrate the veneer of faith in her childhood memories. How can Laurel rewrite the Past so as to validate her own bleak future? Like the bird trapped inside the house, will she be able to break out on her own, to accept her parent's foibles along with their love, while honoring their role in her life? This is more of a psychological piece, with admittedly little plot, but quiet insight into the tapestry of myths and lies which we accept as our heritage."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"In Eudora Welty's book, The Optimist's Daughter, Laurel Hand, the main character, notices her father's clock has stopped. Her father has, of course, just died, and for Laurel this means that time has become an elastic proposition. If any 20th century author can be said to have the power to split a moment, it is Eudora Welty.The Optimist's Daughter is a study in grief and in love that carefully avoids clich&eacute;. Arriving from Chicago, Laurel watches her father let go of life after a seemingly successful operation. Meanwhile, his second wife, a younger woman named Fay who lacks the capacity for any kind of introspection, stages a display of raw anger. When they return for the funeral, Laurel watches again as the eccentric town, and Fay's even more eccentric family, converge upon the coffin of Mount Salus's first citizen.Welty, who spent most of her life in Mississippi, has an ear for small town vernacular, and dialogue plays an important part in the book. Yet she never permits the narrative to travel along familiar lines, and often the characters speak out into thin air, as if to themselves. Laurel's distinctive silence marks the minutes before she is able to confront the past, which she does once she is alone, examining the contents of the house.A storm, a trapped bird, and the fading correspondence of her parents' bring about the catharsis that she requires. She begins to understand the fallibility, the depth, and the complex nature of their love. \`\\"Why did I marry a coward?\\"' her mother asks while dying, and Welty, as Laurel, continues - \`then had taken his hand to help him bear it.'Of all the writer's precepts, perhaps the most difficult is simplicity, of knowing when to shut up. Welty walks a fine line between boredom and profundity at times, but as Laurel goes about erasing the traces of Fay's influence (the nail polish on the desk) and her own past (she burns her mother's letters and confronts her personal losses), we sense in her a woman of uncommon maturity. There are no literary flourishes in The Optimist's Daughter, which means that every word on the page is carefully used. Take your time with this book - it bears re-reading."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"\\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" bears two of the great hallmarks of Eudora Welty's writing: meticulously recorded conversation and an emphasis on how \\"stories\\" shape our lives. Laurel, a young woman who left the South many years ago to pursue a life in Chicago, returns when her father is suddenly taken ill and requires an operation in New Orleans. There she waits out her father's long attempt at recovery in the company of her stepmother, a self-absorbed woman younger than herself with whom she has nothing in common. After her father dies, the two women accompany the body of her father, the Judge, back to her childhood home in a small town in Mississippi. Prior to the funeral a visitation takes place, and here we hear the authentic voices of all the townspeople as well as those of the Texas clan of the stepmother Fay who has claimed that all her relatives are dead. As each of these visitors pays condolences to Laurel the entire town becomes fleshed out in the words that each uses to describe his or her relationship with the Judge. Whole characters come fully to life in a single line of dialog. On the day after the funeral, some of the neighborwomen get together with Laurel to review the funeral (and discuss the stepmother). Everyone feels dissatisfied with how the funeral came off--all feel slightly uncomfortable with their own performance and those of the other mourners--demonstrating the awkwardness and stress of all funerals and the inadequacy of most people to express their true feelings of loss in these circumstances.Throughout the book, we see the importance of the \\"stories\\" that we tell about ourselves. Already at the funeral the townspeople begin to tell stories about the Judge, exaggerating his courage and turning him into a community hero. Laurel objects to the town rewriting her father's history, but is powerless to stop them, as her father ceases to be an individual and becomes a story. Fay has worked hard to convince herself and the rest of the world that she comes from better origins than is the actual case. She is a difficult character to care about with her selfishness, distance, anger, and envy, but, as we see and hear the stories of the members of the family she has tried to distance herself from, we begin at least to understand better why she is the way she is. On her last night in her childhood home, Laurel looks through the letters and papers of her long-dead mother, who was beloved by the town, her husband, and her daughter. Through these stories (based on Welty's own memories of her mother's childhood home in West Virginia and on her mother's stories of growing up there) Laurel comes to a deeper understanding of both of her parents, their marriage, and herself.The final theme in this simple, but profound book is the deep isolation of individuals, even when surrounding by family and friends. Laurel's father appears to have been deeply isolated emotionally despite his marriages to two women to whom he was devoted, and he draws into himself again as death approaches. Laurel's mother became increasingly isolated as blindness and mental disintegration drew her into her own world of pain and anger. Fay is loved neither by her family or the town to which her husband has brought her. Her only connection was to her husband and her anger at his death, which she sees as his desertion of her, becomes understandable. Laurel, long a widow after a brief marriage, has chosen to continue living alone in the city to which her husband took her, isolated from the community of love in which she grew up. Ultimately, however, Laurel discovers that memories can bind us to the past and prevent our moving forward. Before leaving her childhood home forever, Laurel burns all of her mother's papers. Having thus broken the hold of the past, she is now free to create a life of her own. Home will now be wherever she is."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Welty's story opens in a New Orleans hospital waiting room where Clinton McKelva awaits with his middle-aged daughter, Laurel, and his second wife, Fay, to meet with their physician to discuss some needed eye surgery. After undergoing the surgery, \\"Judge\\" McKelva's recovery goes poorly, resulting in his passing. Events surrounding his funeral reveal the wide and varied menagerie of relatives, neighbors and friends that have been part of his long life. \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is a portrait of family relationships, a reflection upon a family's past, and the story derives much of its poignancy and insight through the passage the title character faces as she looses her father and faces the future alone without parents, husband, or children.Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1973, \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is like a quiet symphony that, eventually, rises to its unexpected, long-awaited dramatic finale. The \\"pedestrian\\" chatter of various characters that seems to eclipse the presence of the title character, Lauren, suggests in the back of one's mind that her near absence in the novel's first two-thirds will lead to her prominence at its end. This is the case, and the reader's long wait for its arrival is well-rewarded."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a very straightforward book. When Laurel's father dies, she must deal not only with her own grief but that of her friends and neighbors (her father was a well-loved judge in their small town). On top of that, she also has to deal with the histrionics of her stepmother, a woman younger than herself, who does not react in a way that Laurel finds seemly.The night after the funeral, Laurel finds herself alone in her childhood home. Going through things from her past, she reminisces about her parents, and is able to come to terms with aspects of their relationship and her mother's final illness.Welty writes her scenes sparingly, allowing characters to speak for themselves. The disparity between the actions of Laurel's stepmother's family and those of the locals is told through dialogue, rather than description, to great effect. One can't help but cringe on Laurel's behalf for what she has to go through before she is free to mourn her father."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"wonderfully, really southern. Oh, how I love the classic southern writers. Rereading Eudora makes me realize the difference between mediocre and great writing, she doing the latter (and obviously I doing the former, ha ha)."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"While Eudora Welty is clearly a gifted writer -- she is able to create lines that are rich with imagery and meaning -- she struggles to write at a pace that engages the reader, at least in my opinion. While I was pulled in for the first 50 pages or so, I quickly lost interest. This is a novel that is light on plot, heavy in meaning, which is great; I do not have a problem with that. Unfortunately, I think this book is too short and does not give enough information about the characters to make the deeper context very significant. I found myself reading that last few pages thinking, \\"Okay, I'm supposed to care here. I'm supposed to feel that this character has changed, has realized how his/her life has evolved to this point...\\" I just didn't care enough. I feel that this book probably works for Southern readers who might connect with the geography, the people, the culture of the Gulf Coast. As a Californian, perhaps, these things are just lost on me. Perhaps my faster-paced, doing-three-things-at-once sort of lifestyle prevents me from feeling the patience to get through this type of book."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"The father lived loud and proud, but died with a whimper not a bang, that is pretty sad. The daughter was a wimp, but she became assertive. Redemption is always a rewarding end to a story. The (2nd wife/ step-mother) was the only consistent character throughout; loud and abrasive from beginning to end. The kind you love to hate. I liked this short story turned novel, I would recommend reading it. Especially after reading a big thick book. This one is short and sweet and cleans your reading palette just perfectly."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"If I had not known who wrote this book I would have guessed it was an early Anne Tyler novel. The similiarities in style and content are striking. The main character is interesting and quite well developed, but there are too many rather banal conversations involving minor characters. Welty has a fine eye for detail and a good sense of time and place but the plot is not strong enough to sustain even a short novel. I'm sure I missed half the point of this book, but I could not be bothered to read it again to find out exactly what I'd missed."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Welty's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is largely told in the third person through the observations of its heroine, Laurel McKelva Hand, the daughter of a prominent and wealthy smalltown Mississippi judge who comes to New Orleans to help her father who must see a doctor for an eye affliction. On hand is the judge's second wife, the silly and vulgar Fay, whom Laurel and the doctor basically ignore. When the father unexpectedly dies, Laurel (who is older than Fay) must return to the smalltown with her stepmother for his funeral.The reasons for Welty's popularity with THE NEW YORKER editorial board are much in evidence: the story is told subtly and in small pieces, and accrues a remarkable level of hospital and genteel smalltown detail as it proceeds. Its measured rhythms are the best thing this novel has going for it. Unfortunately, it seems to proceed too much along the lines of a contest between discreet Southern gentility and refinement (embodied in the quiet and grieiving Laurel) and no-'count Southern lower-class vulgarity (championed by Fay and her obnoxious Texas relatives). Although Laurel comes to realize why her father's late-life optimism explains why he married Fay, Welty doesn't really allow Fay any sort of appeal to the reader at all, and so you finish the novel thinking how much *nicer* everything would have been had the judge never married her. (At least Tennessee Williams allowed Stanley Kowalski animal magnetism.) The novel seems too much on the side of delicacy , especially given that Welty's own fine feelings are so manifest in her method of telling of the story--though paradoxically some overobvious symbols (a carved boat, a breadboard, the judge's degenerating eye) weigh things down a bit much. The work is most interesting at the end, when Laurel must confront some truths about her real mother's final illness which complicate the overly schematic family alignments in some welcome ways."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"Eudora Welty's Pulitzer prize winning novel, &quot;The Optimist's Daughter&quot;, underwhelmed me. That's my honest reaction to this quietly restrained tale of remembrance, whose floodgates were opened by the unexpected death of Judge McKelva and the ensuing funeral gathering of neighbours, in-laws and family. Welty's heroine, Laurel, through whose eyes the tale is told, is so unnaturally quiet - she barely speaks or responds to conversation - she's a Cordelia-like character from &quot;King Lear&quot;. She must also be the most underwritten protagonist ever in a novel. The reader has almost to construct her character from the dots left by the author. Wanda Fay is, on the other hand, a caricature - a southern bimbo. The story (thankfully short) moves at such a slow pace you have to pinch yourself to stay awake. The dialogue is awkward and hard to make out. Maybe that's how southerners speak or sound to foreigners. It's only in the last chapter that sparks start to fly and Laurel shows she has blood flowing through her veins. It took a trapped bird in the house to bring that out. Maybe I didn't get it, but &quot;The Optimist's Daughter&quot; must be the most disappointing prize winning book I have read in a long time. Not a priority read. For me anyway."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"This is a book by Eudora Welty.Ms. Welty was what you would call a great \\"Southern\\" writer. Even though I am a southerner myself, such authors are not often favorites of mine - often too slow, wordy and tragic for me.Anyway, I thought this book by Ms. Welty was OK. It had some interesting subplots, characters and settings, but it seemed to end rather abruptly and not say as much as it seemed to have the capacity to say. I gather she liked the short story, so maybe this was just her way - this was a very short novel. I think that the title may be a bit ironic too.In addition to some great handling of local color, the book offers a view of the South in a transitional time of recent years, but it concentrates on issues other than race. That might make it of interest especially to people from outside the region; the South is about more than just racial issues (among the magnolias).For some reason, people hate this review. Well, to each his/her own."},{"Title":"The Optimist's Daughter","review":"It is a mystery why this received a Pulitzer Prize. It was awful.

I always feel that a children's picture book should be something of beauty that is timeless...something that we can all treasure but something that is especially written in the straightforward language that a child understands. This is certainly not one of those mediocre, trashily illustrated, dime-a-dozen children's book. It is the uplifting story of Jessie, a girl who comes to America to begin a new life. The language is simple but beautiful, and Jessie is someone who we can all love. And the illustrations...oh!!! They are so gorgeously realistic; especially the cover with its beautifully done painting of immigrants watching the Statue of Liberty as they arrive in America. Beautiful story, beautiful pictures...what more could you want? \\"When Jessie Came Accross the Sea\\" is the kind of book that every child should have."},{"Title":"When Jessie Came Across the Sea","review":"This beautifully illustrated picture book tells the coming-of age story of a young Jewish girl in an eloquent historically-based fashion. Jessie, a poor Jewish girl in a land far away, lives with her grandmother in a small village. A letter is sent to the Rabbi of the village asking that he come to America. Feeling that he must stay with his people, the Rabbi sends Jessie as his representative. Young Jessie journeys to America and, over the next three years, writes her grandmother who still lives in the village to tell her of her many adventures.The illustrations in this book, done in watercolor and guache, are so very realistic that even the most minute details ae brought to life. The text and the pictures form a cohesive partnership, even down to the placement of the text on the page and the font chosen as Jessie writes to her grandmother. While the beginning maintains the natural flow of a hallmark picture book, the text can, at times, jump from one setting to the next in one page turn with only a statement like \\"weeks pass\\" and \\"three years later\\". This leaves the readers to account in their own minds for the missing time when the timeline of the pictures and story is so crucial to the plot line. However, the undeniably impressive spirit of the illustrations definitely makes up for the somewhat jaunty feel of the text.This book may be used with primary and intermediate grades in American History units involving discussions of emigration to the United States. Considering that this book holds and endorsement from the Jewish Museum of New York City for its historical authenticity, it may also be used in units that discuss the cultural diversity of the United States."},{"Title":"When Jessie Came Across the Sea","review":"&quot;When Jessie Came Across the Sea&quot; is one of those books that stays with you long after you've read it.

Her teachers were struck by the sentimental text and both admitted to crying when they read it aloud to their classes. My daughter recently received a request from her first grade teacher regarding the possibility of her bringing it back to school this year so she can share it with her '98-'99 class!

(1997). When Jessie came across the sea. Cambridge, MA: Candlewick Press.Synopsis: Young Jessie lives with her beloved grandmother in Russia during the World War I time period. Her grandmother has Jessie educated with boys to ensure Jessie's ability to read and write. Jessie attempts to teach her grandmother to read and write. Meanwhile, Grandmother teaches Jessie how to sew lace. When Jessie is chosen to go to America by the rabbi, Jessie is fearful of leaving her grandmother, who is her only family, to go to a strange new place called New York. Jessie makes the lengthy trip to America all alone. However, she makes the acquaintance of many other immigrants who are as frightened as Jessie. Jessie's favorite friend is a boy her age named Lou. After making the long daunting trip to America, Jessie finds that it is going to be hard work to save enough money to bring Grandmother to America. Jessie works hard and attends schools with the support of the rabbi's cousin. Several years later, Jessie meets Lou again in Central Park. After some time courting, Lou asks Jessie to marry him. Jessie replies not yet. She is waiting for the perfect time for their wedding. Readers cannot help the heart-felt connections that are found within this story.Evaluation: Readers are incredibly drawn into this story of a young immigrant girl. Ann Hest presents the text on a stark white background surrounded by P. J. Lynch's exquisite watercolor and gouache illustrations. Many of Lynch's illustrations expand across a double page spread which leaves readers feeling the warmth of the sunset across the Atlantic, the wind blowing through Jessie's glorious red locks, or the mist blowing through the harbor early in the morning. Readers are instantly compassionate for the immigrants who left their homes and families behind in their native countries to come to America for a better life. Hest shows some of the struggles felt by young immigrant children. For example, Jessie, even though aged 12, had to begin school in the first grade. Starting immigrant children in the primary grades no matter their chronological age was a customary practice of educators during the early 20th century. Teachers will likely use this text while studying Immigration with students. Children ages 8-12 will love this story and be captivated by its illustrations.

The text offers all of this material by prefacing its discussion of the sacraments and sacramental grace with theological anthropology, along with an examination of the Trinity and the two natures of Christ.Relying on a Thomistic analysis of personhood, the text describes natural man as a composite of body and substantial form, or soul. The soul, in turn, is portrayed as being capable of developing the human \\"spirit,\\" which is essentially the grace-filled soul. Development of the spirit is presented as an essential prerequisite to salvation or the beatific vision, which is a sharing in the life of God.God is then examined and analyzed in terms of the three divine persons, with special emphasis on the second person of the Godhead. The second divine person and his incarnation in Christ Jesus is closely studied, given that the union of God's Son and man is at the heart of the sacraments. The union of humanity and Divine Sonship is explained to be the only basis on which individuals can be saved, or share in the life of the Trinity.That shared life is equated with the redemption and the sanctification of individuals who sacramentally unite their lives to the humanity of Christ and, thereby, become God's adopted children. Unity with the humanity of Christ, along with his suffering, death, and resurrection, is thus revealed to be the principal objective of the sacraments, which impart the sanctifying and actual graces that constitute the life of Christ lived through Christians. The sacraments are also shown to unite their recipients into the mystical body of the \\"complete\\" Christ that is the Catholic Church. This entire demonstration is developed in the text across separate discussions of each of the seven sacraments.In sum, when combined with a reading of F.J. Sheed's classic \\"Theology and Sanity,\\" Mork's book can offer readers a solid and comprehensive understanding of Catholicism's most fundamental dogmas."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: A Reading of the Revelation of John","review":"Anyone who has ever read a commentary by Charles Talbert knows that a hallmark of his writing style is \\"lucid brevity\\" and this commentary follows in that suit. Written in a very clear manner, Talbert focuses upon the text in its historical setting, that of a late first century AD Jewish Christian document. To be blunt, this commentary does not follow what I call \\"pop-eschatology\\", or what is espoused by the likes of Tim LaHaye and others. Rather, Talbert seeks to situate the book of Revelation within its literary and cultural setting. He advises in his introduction that the best thing to do to prepare oneself for studying Revelation is to read the Jewish and Christian Apocalyptic literature (this is what Professor Talbert made the class do when I took his course on Revelation).In regards to another reviewer's comments that he is overly-reliant upon extra-biblical sources, I must say that this is an unwarranted critique. Every good Biblical scholar will rely heavily upon extra-biblical sources when making interpretive judgments about the individual books themselves. The reason is because these sources informed the worldview of the author's. Some may think that this is a hallmark of \\"liberal scholarship\\" but even some of the more conservative (and best!) scholars like Ben Witherington or Darrell Bock do the same.The only drawback to this commentary is that it is so brief. For someone seeking an in-depth treatment of Revelation, they should get G.K. Beale's commentary or David Aune's commentary."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: A Reading of the Revelation of John","review":"Professor Talbert aims &quot;to offer aid to those who are scarred by harmful readings of Revelation and to encourage mainstream Christians to deal with Apocalypse in ways other than ignoring it.&quot; In my opinion, he succesfully delivers what he promised. This book is concise and easy to read but is not just &quot;preaching to the choir.&quot; It is an erudite, well written essay, adjusted to modern biblical exegesis yet accesible to a broad audience."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: A Reading of the Revelation of John","review":"Revelation is a neglected book within the church. Even Calvin never preached from it. Talbert attempts to make the book more readable and accessible to Christians today. What is troubling is his reliance on extra-biblical apocalyptic literature, especially when it suits his purpose. For example, as to the authorship of the book, Talbert claims that all we can say is that it was written by someone named John (not necessarily the Apostle). He assumes this despite some strong historic evidence pointing to the Apostle. However, he appeals to these sources when defending the cannonicity of the book. By way of another example, when the question of the millennial reign of Christ is addressed, Talbert admits it not based solely upon the text, but because other, extra-biblical, apocalyptic literature. Despite these difficulties, no call them slight discomforts, with the book, Talbert handles the text fairly well. This book would best be used with a solid, orthodox, Reformed commentary."},{"Title":"Hands-on Morphological Image Processing (SPIE Tutorial Texts in Optical Engineering Vol. TT59)","review":"I've read a number of texts on Morphological Image Processing and they have all been quite excellent and very helpful for my work. However, for me, if I could only have one text, this would be it. The reason is the intuitive approach used to explain the nature of the various morphological image transforms for both binary and grey scale imaging combined with a thorough mathmatical foundation. The two combined enabled me to understand what these transforms are all about and how to apply them to my real world problems. By reading and studying the various definitions of the morphological operators, I was able to find at least one perspective for each operator that made sense to me, and, therefore, opened the door to increased understanding and appreciation for the other perspectives. Combine this with the practical Phython-based morphological processing toolkit that supports this book and I think I've found a nearly perfect exposition of this subject. I'd highly recommend this text as the first approach to the subject, to be followed and supplemented downstream by others as needed."},{"Title":"Hands-on Morphological Image Processing (SPIE Tutorial Texts in Optical Engineering Vol. TT59)","review":"The morphological approach to signal and image processing is interesting because it combines the riguor of mathematics with the intuition of the morphological description of the data.The first books describing the subjects, written by J. Serra were diffcult to read because they were written in a very formal language.Recently, Pierre Soille wrote a very precise and still understandable book entitled \\"Morphological Image Analysis\\" which describes the state of the art methods used in mathematical Morphology. This book illustrates the theoretical algorithms with many industrial applications.The book \\"Hands-on Morphological Image Processing\\" adds another brick to the mathematical morphology wall by providing the first, to my knowledge, powerful learning tool in the field. I recommend this book for two reasons :First, it precisely describes the basic morphological image processing methods such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing and Hit or Miss transform. The advanced concepts of generalized dynamics, connected filtering as well as segmentation by watershed and hierarchcical segmentation are also covered. It is interseting to note that all these concepts can be applied to 1D, 2D or nD data such as signal image and volume, like MRI scans. The concepts of bounded operators and infinite domainare also covered. A good intuition is provided about the class of connected filters for binary and numeric images, based on reconstruction algorithms. Finally, I particularly appreciated the section devoted to binary and numeric granulometry. This section leads to the interseting and complex field of tecture segmentation.Second it offers for free to the student a complete toolbox where all the described methods are implemented. This toolbox, called pymorph, is written in Python and can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymorph. Furthermore, this book is illustarted by many pedagogical figures that describe the application of the concepts to practical cases. The documentation, in html format is complete and easy to use. The data as well as the algorithms are available inhttp://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~lotufo/handson.To conclude, I consider this book and the python project which goes with it as a very valuable pedagogical tool for anybody interested in the field of Mathematical Morphology. I think that that the possibility of computing the figures enclosed in the book by issuing some python or matlab commands help the student to notably increase the depth of his knowledge.Dr. Michel KocherProfessor of Image ProcessingGeneva Technical University"},{"Title":"Hands-on Morphological Image Processing (SPIE Tutorial Texts in Optical Engineering Vol. TT59)","review":"Great combination of theoretic underpinnings, pithy practical insights, and worked examples with pictures. I can't think of a better introduction to this material (this is the kind of subject that can easily be presented in such a way as to be simultaneously mathematically rigorous and expository and yet not impart any practical feel for the material)The accompanying downloadable Matlab toolbox is excellent but the library functions don't include source code (for the functions) and it expires in just 30 days unless you buy it (and it's not cheap if you're not a student). Matlab source code is a great way to learn and verify what you've learned. Perhaps 90 days would've been better. The toolbox is more comprehensive and its watershed algorithm seems to be better than what's in the morphological component of Matlab's Image Processing Toolbox.I would like to see more on the gray scale morphological techniques for some of the latter topics and some more on pattern recognition/machine vision topics but I guess that isn't central to the topic. There does appear to be a few errors/typos but nothing significant."},{"Title":"Hands-on Morphological Image Processing (SPIE Tutorial Texts in Optical Engineering Vol. TT59)","review":"Gives you lots of different examples when explaning making sure that you understand from at least one angle."},{"Title":"Hands-on Morphological Image Processing (SPIE Tutorial Texts in Optical Engineering Vol. TT59)","review":"A good book but a little dense. Best used after a bit of online research--e.g., the Pymorph documentation: [...]. The book is good about decoupling the content from any specific implementation, but the examples do refer to functions from the SDC Morphology Toolbox, which is expensive software. Pymorph has some of the same functionality and similar function names, but it's now slow and buggy. So don't be surprised if you have trouble finding a cheap, easy way to do some of the exercises in this book."},{"Title":"The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire","review":"Without sentiment or any sense of loss, David Pryce-Jones chronicles the fall of European communism through a journalist's eye and the eyewitness accounts of the rulers, dissidents and apparatchiks who were there.This is a powerful book, for it harbors no illusions that the Soviet Union was any kind of &quot;workers' state&quot; or that communism, as an ideal or a practicality, had any legitimacy as a form of government.In Pryce-Jones' analysis, if anything caused communism's downfall, it was the misplaced reasoning that a regime built on fear, terror and corruption could stand up to glasnost and perestroika. By their own admission in the book, most of the nomenklatura in Russia and its Eastern European satellites understood this. Mikhail Gorbachev, in an attempt to reform the system, exposed its basic illegitimacy and brought it crashing down.With the former Communist bloc now open to greater investigation into its history, Pryce-Jones' book provides a great deal of illumination into Kremlin and Warsaw Pact politics during the late 1980s. For instance, while Gorbachev was being courted by the West, he was being reviled as a traitor by his own cabinet and allies. One of the more tantalizing questions Pryce-Jones leaves unresolved is whether Gorbachev indeed knew the consequences of perestroika would be the break-up of the USSR and the end of its occupation of Eastern Europe. The author interviews participants in the failed August 1991 coup, which essentially ended Communist Party rule in Russia, who openly wonder if Gorbachev instigated it as a calculated risk to flush out any remaining hard-line opposition.Parts of the book read like a political thriller. As the gradual revolution in Eastern Europe and the Baltics takes hold, Pryce-Jones' sources take us into Round Table meetings and back room conferences where, quite literally, the fates of nations were being decided. The author compares the way popular resistance grew in the wake of Gorbachev's reforms and-in telling detail-shows! that Gorbachev essentially disallowed the use of Soviet forces to sustain control in any of the satellites. Only in Romania did the tanks roll, and that proved disasterous in the end as Ceaucescu became the only Communist ruler to be executed.More pointedly, we get the inside stories of how leaders aging leaders like Poland's General Jaruzelski and East Germany's Honecker. in the end, lacked the will to enforce their rule through armed repression. Some of the most exciting material concerns the last days before the Berlin Wall fell, where we see Honecker fuming over Gorbachev's refusal to order Hungary to close its border-through which thousands of East Germans were escaping, and the growing tension over the Leipzig &quot;prayer meetings,&quot; which had become weekly mass demonstrations against the government.Throughout his reporting, Pryce-Jones is not afraid to make judgments. One of his sharpest is against the American and Western European Intellectual Left, which he views as doing much to perpetuate the belief that Communism was as legitimate a political system as democracy and that the Cold War was little more than a face-off between two superpowers that, at the bottom line, were essentially the same. His heroes, on the other hand, are Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, the dissidents in Russia, the Baltics and all of Eastern Europe, and the long line of West German chancellors who resisted domestic and international pressure to withdraw from NATO, a long-term strategic objective of the Kremlin.It is too bad that right now, &quot;The Strange Death of the Soviet Union&quot; is out of print. One would hope that it is still available from the U.K. It is an invaluable contribution to history and deserves reading by anyone interested in learning the kitchen details about how communism fell."},{"Title":"The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire","review":"The commonly accepted theory for the disintegration of the USSR is that Ronald Reagan brilliantly increased American military spending, knowing that the Soviets would match the American effort, and drive themselves into bankruptcy. This book decisively rebuts that claim.The author interviewed former members of the Politburos and Central Committees of most of the Soviet Socialist Republics, to learn what happened at the top levels in the last weeks and hours of communist rule. In virtually every case, the top man asked the Red Army to put down a local, anti-communist uprising, and Gorbachev refused. While many of the SSRs were \\"third world\\" countries, and economically weak, economics had nothing to do with the downfall of even one of them."},{"Title":"The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire","review":"Price-Jones seems less interested in telling the history of the demise of the USSR than he is in attacking the left. He spends the first chunk of the book talking about how evil communism was, which is not debatable. However, Price-Jones' target is not the Soviets; it's Western liberals who did not share his views on confrontation with them. The author attacks those who tried to promote coexistence as unwitting stooges or active collaborators with the Soviet regime. That's not the kind of book I expected from the title. I kept reading, waiting for the history to start, but I gave up after more than 80 pages of Price-Jones' ranting."},{"Title":"Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History","review":"Jackson Spielvogel has provided an excellent overview of the Nazi period of German history. His scope is comprehensive, considering Germany before Hitler, the dictator himself, the Nazi path to power, and the system that Hitler and his followers established once they came to power. He goes on to consider the two logical outgrowths of the philosophy of Nazism, World War II, aptly called &quot;Hitler's War,&quot; and the Holocaust.Throughout, Spielvogel succeeds in making the contemporary reader understand how the Nazis could come to power in &quot;the land of Bach and Beethoven.&quot; This is a crucial question, not only for historians, but for every citizen of the world. As recent events in the Balkans and Africa have demonstrated, it is all too easy for the veneer of civilization to crack and expose the barbarism beneath.I would recommend this volume to anyone with an interest in World War II, modern Europe and Germany, or the desire to be a better and more responsible human being."},{"Title":"Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History","review":"This is a comprehensive introduction to Hitler and Nazi Germany; it is not by any means a brief history of WW II. While the war is mentioned within the context of looking at Nazi history, the book focuses on Hitler, the rise of the Social Democrats, and how the Nazi party affected the people, economy, social, political and artistic life within Germany.There is also focus on the \\"Final Solution\\" - Hitler's maniacal obsession with anti-semitism. But that is just one facet of this complete study.The book is perhaps most valuable for the bibliography at the end of each chapter which extensive readings for further study. Recommended for students starting serious study of the period, or others just wanting to know how such evil could so easily infect one of the most cultured, civilized countries in Europe. Or perhaps, how the victors of World War One could have so blindly imposed penalties and reparations that created the desperation within Germany that allowed Hitler to easily fill the void."},{"Title":"Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History","review":"I can only wholeheartedly agree with the review by \\"zdravstvui\\" from Colorado Springs.Spielvogel's outstanding book is very accessible for the general reader, yet at the same time rich in insightful detail that contributes toward a sound understanding of exactly HOW the horror of Nazi Germany was able to arise amongst a great and cultured people, and not all that long ago, 70 years being a fairly short span of time when seen against the broad sweep of man's history.\\"Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History\\" was recommended to me by someone last year, so I bought a copy, perused it quickly, and unfortunately let it sit for too long on my bookshelf unread. But having recently viewed PBS's sobering TV series \\"Auschwitz: Inside The Nazi State\\" I was prompted to visit this book again for a more thorough understanding of Nazi Germany, and am glad I did.It's hard for Babyboomer's like myself born after World War II to comprehend the widespread scope of this terrible conflict, and the epicenter which began it all: the ideology passionately held by Adolph Hitler and the Nazi party. We can all too easily arrive at the foolish conclusion that such a tragedy could simply never happen again. But the genocide of the Cambodian people by Pol Pot in the late 1970's, the more recent mass slaughter in Rwanda during the mid 1990's, as well as the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" campaigns in areas of the former Soviet Union, remind us all too well that the shocking conflagration of mass genocide can ignite and spread on the world scene very quickly.Read this book to see not only how it actually DID happen on a massive scale in Nazi Germany and it's occupied territories, but especially the underlying ideological and social conditions that lead up to it, and how it could happen again, perhaps, God-forbid, on an even larger scale."},{"Title":"Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History","review":"Amazing book on Hitler and the Nzai state that he created.

It examines the evolving relationships ... between America's religious culture and its consumer culture, between holidays and the market. In a word, it is a history of that old bugbear, commercialization. The book focuses on St. Valentine's day, Christmas, Easter, and Mother's Day ... but also roams more widely across the American calendar, pausing to scrutinze other events such as New Year's, the Fourth of July, and Father's Day. It explores the widening influence of the commercial culture on the way Americans celebrate, on the gifts they exchange, on the holiday rituals and liturgies they enact.\\"Here are some other quotations from the book:\\"Only in 1970 would major department stores such as Macy's begin to integrate their crew of Santa Clauses.\\" (Pg. 134)\\"The movement to 'put Christ back in Christmas' ultimately underscored how deeply the modern Christmas was enmeshed in the commercial culture and how easily criticism of the consumer-oriented holiday was translated into a merchandising idiom.\\" (Pg. 189)\\"The African American festival Kwanzaa is increasingly exhibiting this same predicament of resistance and co-optation.\\" (Pg. 300)"},{"Title":"Consumer Rites: The Buying & Selling of American Holidays","review":"I read this in 1997, but am just now realizing I never reviewed it.It is beyond my imagination that anyone would not be riveted by this book.

That story, and its sequels, quickly became one of my favorites, and I still treasure the old paperbacks that I collected nearly forty years ago.Borrowers are a race of tiny people who live under the floorboards and behind the walls of old houses deep in the English countryside. They borrow bits of food and other things from the \\"human beans\\" who live in the house, and try to make their homes as comfortable as possible without being discovered. In The Borrowers, Mary Norton introduces us to the Clock family, Pod, Homily, and their daughter Arrietty. Arrietty is thirteen and bursting to find out what life is like beyond the walls of her tiny home. Eventually this curiosity leads to new knowledge and understanding for both the borrowers and one of the human beans, and also to the borrowers being forced to flee for their lives. In other words, Arrietty begins to grow up, and as she does her life and those of everyone around her change irrevocably.Mary Norton wrote The Borrowers in the early 1950s. She was a superb writer who was able to describe the lives of the borrowers and the human beans so convincingly that the reader accepts the entire fantasy as possible or even probable. How else to explain the mysterious disappearances of buttons, safety pins, spools of thread, and sundry other mysteries we all encounter every day?"},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"The Borrowers is a Truly Terrific Story, well-plotted, gripping, and fun. A family of little people live on the \\"lost\\" items of the family in the big house. They are discovered by a boy, assisted, and finally evacuated, with the suggestion of a happy ending. Remarkable story.This is a great read-aloud for all ages, but be aware that your kids are going to be unfamiliar with a LOT of the materials the Borrowers are borrowing. Blotting Paper. Hat pins. Tureens. Cider-press cogwheels.Kid gloves. Scullery items. Tom Thumb miniature Victorian volumes. Settles. Linen-Presses. Crumpets. Parquet flooring. All these unfamiliar terms can paint a wonderful word picture, but they can also lead to a lot of interruptions in the story.I would recommend reading Frances Hodgson Burnett's Secret Garden and Little Princess before you read these books aloud -- they can help your kids imagine the world in this story a little better.A word of caution -- The adult human beings drink Madeira (from decanters or from bottles) and then imagine that their glimpses of the borrowers are alcohol-induced hallucinations. This isn't very family-friendly, nor even particularly funny, but it does form a basis of the plot and so you can't skip these references. It is not as in-your-face as the movie Annie, for example, but it's certainly there. If your parenting style is particular about alcohol consumption, you may want to pre-read the story to see if this meets your standards."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"The book I read was the\\" The Borrowers\\" by Mary Norton.

The idea of a family of tiny people, living in my own house and taking, for the most practical of purposes, things we'd thought we'd lost was quite enjoyable. The best part of the books, for me, were the descriptions of what they did with the buttons and baubles they risked their lives to 'borrow' - (imagine bumping into our family cat late one night while you're trying to lug a teacup back home).Because I was a young girl who thought girls could do anything, I didn't really appreciate Arrietty's spunkiness. As the only child of the last Borrowers in this household, she's allowed to do many things her own mother hadn't done as a child. And perhaps because she can do some things her mother couldn't, she moves a step further and does whatever any boy could do.I thought I could read these books to my 8 year old, who loves the Harry Potter series and The Wrinkle in Time books, but these books are too difficult for little kids (even those reading at an advanced level).The language is very British and there are side explanations that are much too lengthy. Evidently I missed, as a pre-teen reader, the notion that the Borrowers might have been fabricated by the boy who was narrating the stories. (It is rather absurd to think that they were made up - I've lost too many socks and earrings in my lifetime, so I know Borrowers exist.)Before the John Goodman version of the movie, we watched British video of The Borrowers and The Return of the Borrowers (great for younger kids). It was excellent, even though the special effects aren't where they were in the American version, the British version was excellent.For those 11 and up (to 111) this is a great series to read."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"I first read this book 10 years ago when I was still in Primary School and I instantly became a fan.

I feel that anyone and everyone can enjoy this book, not only the kids.The Borrowers are actually a race of little people. They believed that the human 'beans' lived to provide for them. The Borrowers loved houses that were very organised. The residents of the house must always follow a pattern of behavior so that the Borrowers could 'borrow' things from the house without being 'seen'.&quot;The Borrowers&quot; tells the story of a Borrower family - the Clocks. They were Pod and Homily Clock and their 13 years old daughter, Arrietty. Why were they called the Clocks? The reason was simple enough. It's because this particular Borrower family lived under the kitchen floor but the entrance to their home was behind the old grandfather clock. So the last name of a Borrower could be anything, depending on where they lived. There were the Overmantels, the Rain-Barrels, the Bell-Pulls, the John Studdingtons (they lived behind the picture of John Studdington), the Boot-Racks and so on... The Borrowers loved to live a long way off from the entrance to their home.Arrietty was a curious girl who had dreamed of going out to see the world other than the world under the kitchen. One day, her father agreed to let her go 'borrowing' with him. One that day, she was 'seen' by a boy (a human 'bean' boy) who had gone to lived in that house because he was unwell and needed time to recover. The boy has assisted the Clocks with their 'borrowings' later on. But good things are always not meant to be forever... Things started to happen, creating chaos in the lives of the Clocks.When I read this book last time, I was sad that the boy didn't see the Borrowers again and I wanted to know what happened after this book. I didn't know that there were sequels to this book then. A couple of days ago, I found the sequels to &quot;The Borrowers&quot; and I can't wait to read them.

Shame."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"The Borrowers is a book for losers. Not the modern kind of loser, but people like me who are always losing stamps and pins and pens. The book tells the story of Arrietty Clock and her parents, tiny people who live beneath the floor of an old house and \`borrow' the things they need from the humans who live in the house above. A postage stamp becomes a painting for their wall, pins become knitting needles. Even Arrietty's parents' names - Pod and Homily - are borrowed.Life has never been easy for the borrowers, but now times are changing for the worse. The Sink family in the scullery, the Broom Cupboards, the Rain-Pipes and even Uncle Hendreary and his family have emigrated. Only the Clock family remain, living in fear of Mrs Driver, the housekeeper upstairs. When Pod comes home and says that a boy is living upstairs and that the boy has \`seen' him, Pod's wife, Homily, is thrown into panic.Arrietty, however, is intrigued. While her parents cling to the dubious safety of the life they know, Arrietty wonders about the world outside and dreams of adventure. She persuades her reluctant parents to let her accompany her father on his borrowing expeditions. On her first venture out, she meets the boy upstairs. A dangerous friendship develops. Meanwhile, Mrs Driver stalks the borrowers, full of the sort of cruelty Roald Dahl would have been proud to create. It is only with the boy's help that Arrietty and her parents narrowly escape Mrs Driver's attempts to destroy them. At the end of the book, Arrietty faces the dangerous adventure of emigration.Like all great books for the young, The Borrowers can be read as an enthralling story of adventure, but also contains many layers of meaning. Mary Norton's creation of the tiny race of borrowers is an imaginative achievement in itself, but she does not stop there. She gives poignance to her tale by telling it through the voice of the boy's sister, now an old lady, who tells us at the start that her brother has long since grown up and died a \`hero's de!ath' on the North-West frontier. The old lady seems to believe her brother's tale of the borrowers, and yet at the end of the book she provides evidence to suggest that the borrowers may have been nothing but a product of her brother's imagination. The reader is left wondering about reality and truth. On another level, in the relationship between the borrowers and the human world, parallels with the misunderstandings and confusions which occur between different cultures can be discerned. The uncertainties the borrowers face and their final exile mirror the plight of our world's increasing number of displaced people. Long after the book is finished, the characters and the questions their story raises reverberate around the mind. The Borrowers is a book which will fascinate, intrigue and entertain."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"This is a great tale of a tiny family living under the floor in a house. It shows how the father goes up into the house when everyone is asleep and &quot;borrows&quot; things his family needs or wants. He must only borrow things that will NOT be missed. They are not to be seen by the &quot;big&quot; people. Some of their relatives were seen and had to move from their home to stay safe. Once seen the &quot;big&quot; people will bring in exterminators and try to catch the tiny people (they think they're rats). In this story, the Borrower's daughter befriends the young boy of the house. He does NOT try to harm the family. Mater of fact, he befriends them and brings them things they need. Unfortunately, the Borrower then feels useless and their house gets cramped. It's a great book for young children (and even adults to read). It's easy to get lost in the story, even when you know people like this cannot exist. I won't tell you the ending, you need to read it for yourself. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"I first read this classic when I was in grade school and haverevisited it every five or so years -- I rare thing that I reread abook or short story at all!

This is the type of book that takes you to that place where anything is possible, even to the point of belief in &quot;little people&quot; living under the floors in your house.

While her parents seem happy, Arrietty longs to see the world outside. Her mother finally persuades Pod to take her borrowing and her first time out, she meets the boy upstairs. The boy is as curious about Arrietty as she is about him, and they become friends, with the boy bringing the family all kinds of gifts, furniture, food, jewelry, etc. Unfortunately, the boy takes too much and the housekeeper notices things are missing. Soon the Clocks are forced to flee.This is a terrific book on many levels. It is a book about friendship, different cultures, greediness and fear.

Why is the living room always so cold? And where do all those second socks and extra paperclips go? Well, this book may not explain the first two phenomena (although it might), but the last will certainly be solved!The Borrowers are a race of tiny people who live in various places around the house. They might live under the sink, behind the cupboard, above the mantle, or in any number of other places. They live off of humans (or &quot;beings&quot;), much in the way mice do. Except that Borrowers don't take food and the staples of an affluent life - they borrow them! No, this does not mean that you'll get them back - but doesn't it sound better than stealing?The Borrowers is about a family of these little people, the Clocks by name, who are the only remaining Borrowers in a great house. The borrowings are getting slimmer, and life is getting duller. Poor 13 year old Arrietty is bored to tears. Her parents are overprotective and will not let her out of their &quot;house&quot;. So Arrietty sets off to make her own fun - and ends up endangering the family's very exsistence.While nominally a children's book, The Borrowers holds great appeal for just about everyone. Its fascinating premise draws us in, and makes us aware that we may very well share our home with such creatures as Borrowers - and that maybe all of those lost socks are being put to a good use."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"Tiny people live in human houses, unnoticed by the occupants, building their lives by 'borrowing' food, clothes and even language. The Borrowers deserves its classic status because, rather than talking down to children, it sees the world from their point of view. The central dilemma for the borrowers, whether to continue to be dependent or whether to strike out into the unknown world beyond the home, speaks directly and powerfully to the predicament of kids."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"The Clocks are a family of little people that live under a grandfather clock. The Clock family is made of Homily (mother), Pod (father), and Arrietty (daughter). Every thing they have is borrowed from the house in which the grandfather clock stands. They must live and borrow without being seen by the people in the house. One day Homily tells Pod to take Arrietty borrowing with him. They go outside, and Arrietty meets the nice boy who stays in the big house. Just as Homily gets into bed one night, the boy takes off their roof and puts down doll furniture for the Clocks. After he left, Homily knew that they had been discovered. They quickly move in with the Overmantles, another family of Borrowers. The boy who discovered the Borrowers tells his sister about the little family. They grow up and the story of the Borrowers is passed on.

Do you wonder why small quantities of your father's tobacco and Madeira seem to smoke themselves or evaporate? Did your wooden knight ever ride off the chessboard never to be seen again?You don't even know what I'm talking about, do you? OK, so have you ever lost your iPod Nano? Maybe the Borrowers needed a stereo for their home entertainment system. The same thing happened to your Nintendo Gameboy.Mary Norton's \\"The Borrowers\\" published in 1952 is about a race of little people living beside a rain pipe, over the mantel, behind the harpsichord and in all the nooks and crannies of the house. These little people \\"borrow\\" from us, the big people. They use blotting paper for their carpets, a single onion ring for their cooking and postage stamps for wall portraits.In the book, Pod, Homily and Arriety are the last Borrowers left in Aunt Sophy's house. They lived in the floorboards under the kitchen ad entered and exited their home from a hole behind the grandfather clock. They weren't rich but they had everything they needed - potatoes for their supper, a gas pipe leak for their cooking, a foie gras dish for their bath. Pod, the father, ventures into the house every now and then for supplies.This is the story of how Arriety, after being allowed to go borrowing with her father, befriended a nine-year old boy who was a visitor in the house. Then their lives change forever: They discover news about their Borrower relatives, gain new riches and then lose everything they own.This is a good story to read in a big house on a rainy afternoon. Perhaps you can explore the house for little corners where a Borrower may be living. Or you can guess which of the little things lying around the house are useful for them.Even if you live in an apartment in the big city with the most modern furniture and high tech gadgets, it would still be fun to imagine what a Borrower family would be using these days. What would a Borrower your age be playing with? What would they use for furniture? Where would they be living?I bought a package of IKEA tealight candles once and some of them have disappeared.

I have enjoyed reading it to each of my 4 children at various times and it has also been fun for them to re-read when they became fluent readers. The reader enters into a fantasy world that becomes almost believable as the story continues. One identifies with the &quot;little people&quot;, Pod, Homily and Arrietty, especially Arrietty, who is not content to just hide, but wants to explore and finds adventure in the form of a &quot;human bean&quot; (a regular sized boy) with whom she develops a friendship. This is a big no-no in the world of the Borrowers, and children identify with a little child-person who is doing what she shouldn't. I highly recommend this as a bed-time story, for most ages, as soon as they are old enough to cuddle up and listen."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"I am 24 years old, and I cannot count the number of times I have read this book (and the sequels).

They take what they need from the natural world, simbiants with their human caretakers. Pod and Homily raise their daughter to believe nothing exists but the floorboards of Firbank Hall. She is bound under by gates and hazards, much the same way the modern human is restrained by the &quot;gates&quot; of society. Borrowers, some say, were once small human beings, who grew smaller more afraid as their lives became more secretive and hidden. Arriety is faced with a classic existential dilemma--she is curious about the life beyond, the universal, that is forbidden to her by physical and moral limitations. In the end, she is forced to commit the ultimate crime. She steps outside her niche as a Borrower, defies her own security, and talks to a human being. The outside world comes like a tidal wave into the lives of the Borrowers, and though their intentions are pure, it leads to their destruction. As for Arrietty's human friend, he too is misunderstood and falls to tragedy. In trying to exceed their own boundaries, Arrietty and the young boy are both severely punished by the intolerance of their respective worlds. Mary Norton has made a bold statement about relative truth in what seems to be, on the surface, a mere children's story."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"The Borrowers is pretty boring at the beginning but gets better but in general, I lost interest in The Borrowers. This book is reasonable, but still pretty boring. The main people are Homily Clock, Arrietty Clock and Pod Clock.

Being \\"Seen\\" borrowing stuff from the BIG house is a big deal, and Arrietty's father has been seen once already. They live in the floorboards, in the kitchen. Arrietty's room is made out of a match box, and their quilts are hand-knitted. Here are some of the words in the book from chapter 1: \\"It was Mrs. May that first told me about them. No, not me. How could it have been me-a wild, untidy, self-willed little girl who stared with angry eyes and was said to crunch her teeth? Kate, she should have been called. Yes, that was it-Kate.

When I found this book, I found my passion, my imagination soared and I fell head over heals in love with reading. I was about 8 and a very active child, running and playing and loving the outdoors. But this book stopped me in my tracks. For days I ran to my bedroom and tucked myself up with it while my family watched TV. When I got older and was planning for my children I began looking for the book and couldn't find it. I am thrilled to be able to place it in my digital library. Reading has taken a back-seat to video. I've learned from experience that this is not good for our young people. Creative thinking is developed through use of the imagination. Our children need to be able to think creatively if they are to develop the skills to lead us in the future.

Mary Norton's children's classic remains as delightfully fresh and entrancing today as it did when it first appeared in 1953. Recounted by an insightful, elderly Mrs. May to a little girl, the story takes place in a country house in turn-of-the-century England. The author introduces her readers to a hidden race of little people called Borrowers--well, They don't consider it Stealing! Even their last names are borrowed--depending on where in the house they take up secret residence: Avoiding detection by the \\"human beans\\" on whom they relyis of utmost importance, for Being Seen can result in the worst of fates: Emigration!The Clock family, consisting of father Pod, mother Homily, and their 14-year old daughter, Arrietty, have long enjoyed a peaceful coexistence in Great Aunt Sophy's 200 year old house. Alas, their quiet lifestyle is suddenly threatened when Arrietty--finally introduced to the harsh reality of Borrowers' existence--is Seen! Of course Sophie has long delighted in private conversations with Pod, whom she thinks is a result of her hitting up the bedside decanter. But Arrietty puts the entire family at risk by conversing with and confiding in a BOY.The stage is set for dramatic conflict when the grim and spiteful housekeeper decides to play sleuth and set a trap for the thief because of so many missing hosuehold objects. Where will the Clock family go if they are discovered and routed out? Can a mere lad of 9, sickly at that, help them despite his good intentions?Ruthless adults connive with Mrs. Driver to rid the house of pests who might be rodents or various varmints. Arrietty comes of age as she learns about the real world, while her mother must face her worst fears. First serialized in a woman's magazine in the USA this gentle story of parallel survival will capture the imagination and win the literary loyalty of kids of all ages."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"I cannot think of any children's book more delightful to read to one's children than this book. Actually, the whole series is wonderful. When my son was small, probably 7 or 8 years old, (he is 35 now, in fact had his 35th birthday today!) I read the whole series to him, and it took several weeks, reading to him at bedtime each night, to read all of them, but it was a wonderful &quot;bonding time&quot; for us, though that term had not been invented then, but I knew that it helped forge a special bond between my son and myself. It conveyed my love of books and of reading to him, a past time that he enjoys to the present. We could not wait for bedtime each night to see what new adventure Pod and Arrietty would undertake, with poor Homily waiting nervously at home for them. In a later edition Spiller appears, then it really gets interesting, as Spiller is definitely a free spirit, and a perfect friend for Arrietty. Their adventures are really &quot;edge of the seat&quot; suspense! This may seem tame next to Star Wars or Harry Potter, but believe me, you get so engrossed in the every day struggles of these tiny people just trying to survive, and who are so much like the human &quot;beans&quot; they are so in fear and awe of, it is not tame or boring at all. I would give it a &quot;10&quot; in great adventure stories! I am a great grand mother now, but I still love &quot;The Borrowers&quot; and all the sequels.&quot;The Borrowers Afield&quot; is the second in the series, and even better than the first! &quot;The Borrowers Afloat&quot; comes next, and it is just as wonderful and gets the tiny family into even more shenanigans out of doors, this time floating down the river in Spiller's &quot;boat.&quot; These books are for everyone, child and adult alike. There are a couple of more in the series, the fourth is &quot;Borrowers Aloft,&quot; so called because they are held prisoner in an attic and have no one but themselves to rely on to escape, so have to be very inventive and clever to devise a means of escape. The solution they come up with will boggle your mind and amaze you at the ingenuity of the human spirit and what it can accomplish when it has to, because these &quot;little people&quot; embody the pioneer spirit of our ancestors. It may be the best of all the books, but they are each so unique and so wonderful, it is hard to say one is better than another. Each one has it's own charm, and each adventure is different. Mary Norton had a very magical way of looking at things and a unique imagination evidently, to write these wonderful stories. A must for all children, and best if read with a parent, as all books are when you are young. It was a special time for my son and I, and the memory will be with him all his life, long after I am no longer with him.

The style the book is written in is sort of old-fashioned for today's readers, but if a person can read it, then I definitely recommend it.It's about a type of people, Borrowers, that are very tiny. They live in houses and 'borrow' things, like food, paper, and basically anything that they can get their hands on. They picture people as giants that are put on this earth to make things for them to 'borrow'... They live under floor-boards, behind pictures, over mantles; basically anywhere. That's how Arrietty's mother and father tell it.But, in all reality, there is only herself, her mother, and her father left in that one particular house. Every other Borrower family had emigrated to somewhere else... and Arrietty accepts that until one day she is seen by a boy that puts the thought into her head that maybe her family is the last of the Borrowers.And that's really how it all starts. Arrietty and the Boy form a sort of friendship, where the boy takes a letter to the place where Arrietty's Uncle is supposed to live, and Arrietty reads to him. (The Boy says that he's bilingual, and that's the reason that he can't read well.) And taking the mail isn't the only thing that the Boy does- he also brings the Clocks furniture, food, and other things.Things which are discovered missing later.And that brings in the cat and the rat-catchers...One of my favorite childrens' books; I think the reason I like it so much is that it doesn't take for granted that kids wouldn't be able to understand a longer book... I think that's also what I love about the Harry Potter books, as well.Anyway, read this. Very sweet, very family friendly. Altogether enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"The book I chose to read is called The Borrowers, written by Mary Norton.

Throughout this journey they help one another and become good friends who rely on each other very much.This book was exciting to read because this was a story about little people. When I mean little, I mean about the size of a mouse, maybe even smaller. Distances for a regular person were about a thousand times farther for the borrowers. I also like this book because it reminded me of another story I read. They are similar because both main characters are on a journey to find their family.I like the way the author wrote because she wrote in a way that was interesting to me. She made the story sound like the characters were right there talking to you. An example of this would be when the boy in this story said to Arrintrey that he would bring her letter to her family, Arrintrey shouted \\"Would you really do that for me?\\".On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this book about an 8. I think this book was better than other books I have read because it kept my interest throughout the whole book. If you like adventure and things not always normal, you will love this book.The Borrowers is a good book to read. Sometimes it can really make you think about what is going on in the story many times it made the book more exciting. I don't want to give the whole thing away but, this one time Arrintrey had to go borrowing for the first time with her dad. She ended up talking with a boy the whole time.

It was definately a story I shared with my own kids, even telling them that if they looked closely they might find little people living under the mushrooms we found in the yard! :-) I guess this book is probably what also brought on my interest in collecting fairy figurines too.

In a lot of respects, it's pretty predictable: secret group of people, one of the members longs for the outside world, meets an outsider, the outsider messes things up. See? That basic plot has been played out many times in many books. There's nothing wrong with that but I just had hoped for a bit more of an interesting story.What I really liked was the world building. I love these secret worlds that exist in our world. I love seeing how the people use things in a different way. The author describes things fairly well and the illustrations give you a nice mental image of how things look. My mental picture of the house was okay but actually seeing it (in a movie perhaps) would have been even better.While I liked the characters well enough, there wasn't anything fantastic about them. They were pretty standard and a bit forgettable. There's nothing about them that really sticks out in my mind.The bottom line? I liked it fine.

Beats the heck out of \\"the dryer ate it\\"!"},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"In 1953, English writer Mary Norton introduced to the world the concept of The Borrowers: little people who lived in our old, over filled homes under floor boards or behind mantels and they sustained themselves on the waste that \\"human beans\\" discarded or forgot about. Within this book we learn of the family of the Clocks, P:od, Homily and Arriety, the entrance to their home being beneath the ancient grandfather clock in the front hall. The story takes place in the rural areas of England around the turn of the 19th century.The test of a really good childrens book is how enjoyable it is to an adult. This book is a classic (and the four that follow itas sequels) because it is so well written. It's in a catoagory with \\"A WRinkle in TIme\\", \\"Mrs. Frisby and The Rats of Nimh\\", \\"Things Not seden\\" and \\"The Currious Incident of the dog after Moidnight.\\" Mrs. Norton wrote beautifully and is best known for her book, \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" though this book-and the subsequent books- have you fall in love with thesedtiny creatures, so human like, to the point where one almost wishes that they shared a house with you; that somewhere beneath the floor board or in your pantry is a small house set up with your blotting paper or left over wall paper, furnished with old scicorrs and doll house firniture and fed by the food that is carelesslhy left pout. These creatures \\"Borrow\\" items-things that aren't likely to be missed, The adventure in this tale is when a small boy, recovering at his great aunts summer home from scarlett fever, discovers and befirneds the Clocks.Read this to your children so that some day they will read it to their own.

There are some things in this book that, while they didn't cause any uproar in 1952, will bother some parents today. I think the book is very worth reading, but if any of the following freaks you out, perhaps you'll disagree with me. The very premise of the Borrowers, that they survive by taking from the human beans of the house, might be seen as stealing, rather than borrowing. This is even brought up in the book; it's possible to see the ending of the story as evidence that \\"borrowing\\" isn't the best way to live, anyway. Several human beans get drunk on a routine basis - the word \\"drunk\\" is never used, but it is what they do, and it's used as an explanation for certain sightings of Borrowers. If those are things you simply can't get past, don't read this book. If you're able, however, to look past those things, read on!The Borrowers, a race of small people, live in the floorboards and walls of old, quiet country houses. While Kate and Mrs May work on a quilt, Mrs May tells the story, as told to her by her brother, of the Borrowers who'd once lived in the house of Great-Aunt Sophy. Pod and Homily and their teenage daughter Arrietty are the last of their kind in this house, all the others having emigrated after one of them was seen by a human bean. Sent there to recover from rheumatic fever, Mrs May's brother befriends Arrietty. Her parents consider this a danger but when he gives them gifts from the dollhouse, they accept him and the new life of ease that he brings. No longer will Pod need to venture out to support his family! Unfortunately, the boy's borrowing has come to the attention of Mrs Driver and the secret of the Borrowers is revealed. The fears of Arrietty's parents are all about to come true!There's so much to this book! It's a fun fantasy title that offers an entertaining explanation for all those things that go missing in every house. If that was all there was to this, I'd say it was a nice book for kids, but there's actually some good messages (mixed in with the drinking, lol). You might expect the Borrowers to be afraid of humans, but it turns out that the humans are also afraid of the Borrowers. This fear and intolerance is a good opening for discussion. Borrowers fear, but need, humans; humans don't need Borrowers and set out get rid of them. The Borrowers are chased out of their home and will, in many ways, cease to be borrowers and become more independent. The glimpse of their life after they leave the house sounds pleasant, possibly better than before. Will independence make them happier than a life of ease?Author Mary Norton creates a realistic, tiny world and a surprisingly exciting tale. The Borrowers live on inThe Borrowers Afield,The Borrowers Afloat,The Borrowers Aloft,The Borrowers AvengedandPoor Stainless: A Story About the Borrowers. The illustrations, by Beth and Joe Krush, are interesting. For the most part, they're not attractive drawings. The Borrowers and the boy are drawn well, while the other humans resemble apes more than humans. This must be intentional, but I just don't find these images a pleasant addition to the book. Still, they somewhat satisfy the curiosity to see how the Borrowers live and how they use the items they borrow and to highlight the smallness of them against the size of the human world. For younger readers, 8 and up, this is probably best read to them (the British tone may be off-putting for them alone). Readers 11 and up will be fine on their own with this one - and adults will enjoy it too!- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The Borrowers","review":"Whoosh!

The Clocks thought &quot;human beans&quot; were not very important; they just had the things that the Clocks needed. It was interesting to see how they used ordinary items in their homes. For example, they used a matchbox for a bed, a postage stamp for a picture, a pocketwatch for a clock, and a doll's teaset for their dishes.

Joll doesn't come at you from any particular political perspective and grants you access to all the arguments for the conflict. Nationalism, politics, military expansion, big business interests, imperialism along with conditions in each of the beligerents are examined in a free flowing easy style.Joll does a very nice job in demolishing the Marxist line that WW1 was the result of imperialism and big business interests. By the end you are left convinced that, while the German naval expansions of 1912 were ultimately to blame for the process that led to war, each country got involved for entirely different reasons. There are good maps which give are easy to understand.I do have some criticisms though. Each chapter is self contained but doesn't have any sub-headings or breaks. The editors could have spent a little time breaking up the text in each chapter to make the text a bit more readable. There isn't a great deal of attention to longer term history - such as the lingering impact left by the Crimean war and its peace treaty. But these are relatively minor quibbles about history writing that almost ranks as a work of art. Joll was a highly gifted historian."},{"Title":"Chippewa Treaty harvest of natural resources, Wisconsin, 1983-1990","review":"The Origins of the First World War by James Joll was a concise but informative study of the major causes of the catastrophe that engulfed Europe and much of the world from 1914-1918. Joll began the book with a summary of the July Crisis of 1914 which was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. The rest of the chapters examined the major problems in Europe that made war inevitable. This review will examine each chapter and its importance in making World War I inevitable.There were two major alliance systems in Europe in 1914: the Triple Alliance of Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy and the Triple Entente which consisted of France, Great Britain, and Russia. The lesser powers in Europe sided with one alliance or another, and their loyalties changed when it suited them. Joll explained how those alliances were formed. It was surprising how weak they were, as Austria-Hungary was frequently at odds with both Germany and especially with Italy. Great Britain also had problems with both France and Russia in the colonial sphere. If it was not for these alliances, then the July Crisis would have either never resulted in a war or the war would have remained localized in the Balkan Penninsula.I found the next chapter on armaments and strategy to be especially useful. While many nations were spending vast amounts of money preparing for war and conscripting their young men, other states such as Austria-Hungary were spending a relatively low percentage of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defense. I was surprised that France was investing far more of its resources preparing for the next war than Germany (the French had a three year conscription program).There were several aspects of strategy that I found especially interesting. General Conrad von Hotzendorf of Austria-Hungary desperately wanted a war as soon as possible to unite the multi-ethnic nation and prevent Serbia from being able to incite the Slavic population. It was also interesting that both Austria-Hungary and Russia were both expanding into the Balkans, making a collision course inevitable. Finally, Germany and Austria-Hungary wanted a war in 1914 because Russia was in the midst of a vast building program (with French money) and they would be virtually unstoppable if the war was delayed until 1916 or 1917.The chapter on domestic politics demonstrated that many of these nations viewed the war that arose from the July Crisis as a potential diversion from problems at home. The situation in Austria-Hungary has already been mentioned. The Russians believed that they could not back down from the conflict because they had failed to support the Slavic peoples in the Balkans twice before in 1878 and 1911; they would lose virtually all credibility if they backed down a third time in 1914. The Russians also hoped that a victorious war would enable them to achieve their dream of capturing Constantinople. According to Joll, the issue of Irish home rule was tearing the British apart, and they looked forward to a distraction on the Continent.While France still coveted the lost provinces of Alsace-Lorraine, they did not expect to liberate them anytime soon. Joll believed that the French would have preferred to delay the war until her Russian ally had completed her militarization program.Imperial rivalries proved to be a minor cause of the war. The author wrote about both the Fashoda conflict and the Moroccan crises in detail. These crises proved how weak the two alliance systems were, as England and France nearly went to war over the former and Italy failed to support Germany in the latter. Nonetheless, nobody was willing to go to war over colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The most important consequence of imperialism to the outbreak of World War I was that Russia was forced to turn west to the Balkans as an avenue for expansion after they were defeated by Japan in 1904-1905.Joll's overall opinion of the mood of the Europeans towards war was ambiguous. While there were some ultra-nationalist groups in all countries, they were balanced out by Socialists who opposed war. The Socialists hoped that a general strike might prevent Europe from mobilizing for war in the summer of 1914. According to Joll, there were some strikes (especially in France), but this movement was essentially killed when a French nationalist assassinated Jean Jaures ended any possibility that the Socialists could prevent the war; in reality, nationalism proved more powerful that Socialism in 1914.I was impressed by The Origins of the First World War. This book was clear and concise. It analyzed the major issues in enough detail to give the reader a clear idea as to why war was declared. Not only did one learn about the July Crisis that officially began the war but also the underlying causes that led to this crisis."},{"Title":"Chippewa Treaty harvest of natural resources, Wisconsin, 1983-1990","review":"This is a concise and well written introduction to the history and historiography of the 1st World War. Joll does an excellent job of reviewing the opening of the war and the background of the European diplomatic system. He then presents a series of critical chapters reviewing the some of the proposed causes of the war including imperial rivalries, capitalist competition, and domestic political needs. Joll is judicious and evenhanded in his analysis and leaves readers with the conclusion that there was not one or even a few causes of the war. Instead, readers gain a clear picture of the complexities and instability of European society prior to the war."},{"Title":"Chippewa Treaty harvest of natural resources, Wisconsin, 1983-1990","review":"I have read, and enjoyed this book, three times. As an amateur historian, and as someone who has studied the history of the period leading up to 1914, I am a little surprised at the lack of greater critical enthusiasm for Joll's book. To me, he does an outstanding job in describing all of the factors that could have, and ultimately did, lead to this most important of all modern wars (I consider WWII an extension and continuation of WWI). Since this conflict remains so seminal, and so difficult to comprehend, only a multi-faceted conceptual overview really does justice to the subject. However, it may make sense to complement this book with those of John Keegan, A.J.P. Taylor or Hew Strachan, all of whom take a narrative approach to understanding the war. Let's keep in mind that with the exception of Ivan Bloch, and very few others, NO ONE thought that WWI would become the conflagration that it did, and/or last for four years.

Also as bit of humor TJ lent me this book as a pass through from one of his friends who studied it for a class. I mused at what he took note of versus what I marked as noteworthy. We had to have taken away two different verdicts. This is the third in my series of books where I am purposefully looking for answers to the cause of war. The first two, Rise and fall Of the Third Reich and Paris 1919, only threw clues and inferences. Also know I have a library of read material related to the subject but such material was not necessarily read to answer this single question. I was hoping, from the author's credentials as college professor and historian, to get something more absolute from this one. While I gained a lot of insight and can now start to draw my own conclusions I hate to say it but I am leaning towards the view of the French, which is always to be fearful of the German propensity for dominion. I am leaning with reservation because the French have yet to reach a level of national conscience that demonstrates peace for the right reason. This review will brush over the top of James Joll's work and I will make an attempt to connect dots and draw conclusions. Keep in mind I am on to reading on Bismarck and then the Crimean War, so I reserve the liberty to modify conclusions written herin.This book addresses seven different overarching factors starting with the July crisis in 1914 that may have attributed to the cause of WWI. Of the seven factors the mood of 1914 strikes me as the most intriguing. The mood involves the dynamics between the people and their leaders. The most essential aspect of the relationship is the timing of an action, which may be the result of decisions made long before the action. Power politics versus humanity with a civilized world order looming in the balance. While all the countries involved in WWI experienced these dynamics, Germany, albeit with a considerable peace movement in its midst, appears to have demonstrated the most tangible aptitude towards war.To see my complete review please use keword cigarroomofbooks"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Weight Training Illustrated, 3rd Edition","review":"We bought \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Weight Training\\" shortly after getting aMarcy Classic Standard Bench with Arm CurlandBest Fitness BFMG20 Sportsmans Gymto make sure my son and I knew how to do the exercises properly. This is great starting point and will likely save newcomers to the \\"sport\\" from a lot of wasted effort or dangerous practices.

For example, it says that contrary to popular belief, multiple scientific studies have shown that just doing one set of an exercise is just as effective as wasting hours at the gym doing 5 or 10 sets like some guys do.

So the fact that recruiting sites like monster.com aren't even mentioned can be blamed on the cruelties of time.But the rest of this books (many) limitations are harder to forgive. The entire back half of the book consists of descriptions of a number of foreign markets that are on the level of a 5th grade research project: lots of data, most of which is irrelevant, and a few tiny cultural references.The front half of the book is very pedestrian- I didn't see anything that isn't in any basic 'how-to' of recruiting, much less any &quot;Secrets&quot; of the &quot;Experts&quot;.

It does however know some Borders, and here is another excellent production of a familiar type. The book consists of good quality b/w photographs with a 2-page introduction and a brief text to accompany each photo. The title suggests that the main topic is the steam locomotives, and I can only suppose that non-British readers will be surprised by the late dates of some of these \`last days'. Britain's railways were nationalised on the first day of 1948, but the new British Railways went ahead with their own new generation of steam locomotives when other European countries were committing to diesel haulage and even electrification. Indeed in England itself the Southern Railway south of London had already implemented an extensive electrified network between the wars, but the steam lobby went chugging ahead regardless.For loco buffs, the Scottish Border Country was mainly LNER territory, so the majority of the shots are of their engines and those of the smaller railways amalgamated into the LNER in the 1923 Grouping. You will find Gresley's famous A4 streamlined Pacifics here and other major LNER models, but the BR \`Standard' designs are in evidence aplenty too, and there are even one or two interlopers from the LMS, which served the north-western areas.However my own interest is more in the routes themselves. I am sure that this taste is widely shared, and so it is a pleasure to report that the range and variety of the scenes depicted is interesting and rewarding. I hardly know the Borders, but they are an area famous for its beauty and one that is thinly populated to this day. That does not sound like a promising location for railway investment, nor was it, but as everyone knows no such considerations stopped the participants in Britain's 19th century \`railway mania'. Honorary inclusion as a \`Borders' line is given to the branch from Carlisle to Silloth, which is wholly in England but was operated prior to 1923 by the Edinburgh-based North British Railway, later to be included in the LNER. Naturally, the focus is largely on the Waverley Route, which ran from Edinburgh to Carlisle and generated several fascinating branch lines. It was, bluntly, a vanity project. It was an express line, but not a fast line on account of its curves and gradients. It also featured numerous rural stations, and one is reliably informed that they could have been on the moon for all the signs there were of human habitation nearby. One of these was Fountainhall, and I don't know whether I have ever seen any photographic record of it before, but there is one on the cover here showing the junction with the light railway to Lauder, an early closure as you will not be surprised to know, and not extensively photographed either.The production is generally excellent, and (mercifully) not unduly \`professional'. I was not looking for errors, and the only two that I spotted casually were the spelling of Gilnockie and the ascription of the White Knight from Through the Looking Glass to Alice in Wonderland. At age 10 I think I knew the name of every station in this region, and I found that after three score more years I remembered the intermediate stations between Riddings and Langholm accurately. If that makes me a sad person, tough. Far from making me feel sad this book invigorated me."},{"Title":"Abide in Love","review":"Ernesto Cardenal talks to us in this book, with his soul, a soul that has felt the sublime experience of God's presence. His words come from that experience, and is not until the reader has had that same experience that he/she will be able to fully understand his words. This book, for me, was the explanation of those moments in which I look for solitude and silence, in which I feel the presence of God, and it is then, when I can hear his voice with my heart. I keep this book next to my bed. If I feel depressed, angry or discouraged, I take it and open it without looking for an specific page, because I know that every page, every sentence in this book is filled with praise and recognition of God's inexhaustible love. The foreword by Thomas Merton is just as uplifting, because he, as well, is able to explain the world departing from the fact that all is embraced by a loving God. If you do not believe that love is the rule and not the exception, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Abide in Love","review":"I don't know what is more remarkable--the beauty and substance of this book or its brevity. If you can't make it through a 2,000 page volume on theology but Chicken Soup For The Soul turns your stomach, I highly recommend Abide In Love. It's accessible, powerful, and never sappy or complacent.Incidentally, this book is from Cardenal's days with the Trappists, before (?) he embraced liberation theology. It's quite different from some of his later writings in that it's apolitical."},{"Title":"In Wildness is the Preservation of the World","review":"I love the book. I had a copy many years ago, and forgot all about it until I saw an old copy gathering dust at a bookshelf at work. When I picked it up to look at it, I remembered instantly why I always had loved it so. Unfortuntely, the copy was badly mildewed, so I went online to buy another copy. Much to my delight, I found a NEW copy for sale, and when I got it, it was much larger in size than the previous one. So the photos are much bigger, and the text easier to read.A great, classic book for any nature lover. MUCH more necessary now than ever before to preserve what little wildness is left to us earthlings. I hope the message is not lost."},{"Title":"In Wildness is the Preservation of the World","review":"This is a wonderful book pairing Thoreau's words with dozens of Eliot Porter's beautiful color photographs: the kind of book best perused in an overstuffed chair in a warm oak-paneled room, but which makes the reader feel such cozy comfort whatever the setting. Gazing into its expressive photos always prompts a twinge of guilt that I'm not out on a hike, camera in hand, taking pictures RIGHT NOW.However, I can't recommend this edition. The 1962 first edition includes a lengthy note about the Sierra Club's (and Porter's) search high and low for a printer up to his demanding standards for his color photographs, and the result was rich bright color on glossy stock with deep but detailed shadows. The slight yellowing of pages over the past 45 years adds a delightful warmish glow . This edition has thinner, less glossy paper, grayer shadows, differently interpreted color (usually, though not always, for the worse), and overall less emotional impact. Do yourself a favor and pick up a decent used copy of the 1962 edition."},{"Title":"In Wildness is the Preservation of the World","review":"After hearing all about the beautiful photography paired with Thoreau's words, I had to find a copy of this book.

The reproduction of the original photos doesn't come close to their original sharpness, detail, and subtle color relationships.

These photos bear little resemblance to the originals, and communicate none of Eliot Porter's unique vision.

It so inspired me that I sought out the author and studied with him for several years. I was convinced that I would never be bored if I worked as a psychoanalyst who viewed the work the way this book described it. Now that I have been doing psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy for more than 35 years, I see that this was correct. Benjamin Wolstein convinced me that every patient/analyst dyad was unique and that the \\"field of experience\\" that they co-created was unique. His radical interpersonalist perspective became one of several influences on my work over these 3 1/2 decades.Wolstein anticipated postmodernist formulations of psychoanalytic theory, the concept of intersubjectivity, and specificity theory.

A sub-character with very very very little to add in the big scheme of things has got me perplexed. Did he die of AIDS? Did he slip in a pool and drown. I just didn't get it.With that aside. Rescue Me was an intense ride in romance and the heedy side of drugs, premarital sex, and kids(pretending to be adults) acting like piranha while their mom is away living la vida loca with the car salesman. And then there's Gabriel, the black angel, who waits ten years for Amanda who dumps him like a rotten sack of potatoes for James(Jimmy)who can give her everything she's always dreamed of, a life outside of her run down drug shack.

It is quiteamazing how Gigi shuffles all the complex lives of her fictionalcharacters. She has a tough storyline to explore to her readers, butshe does this effortlessly. This is a sensational debut. It alsomakes you laugh and cry. It is quite powerful. A book you can't miss.Some character names I remember or can relate to in my life are JD,one of my nicknames. Kiki, a nickname for actress Kirsten Dunst.I feel there is at times glimpses of the unique writing style Gigi posesses during 'Rescue Me', that isn't fully realizeduntil 'Maneater'. In 'Maneater' her unique writing style anddescriptions of characters is put to brilliant use. I see 'Rescue Me'as a lead up to greater things to come.'Rescue Me' is an original novel. 'Maneater' is not a sequel. That islucky because I read them backwards. I am glad they are both seperatebooks.Let me demonstrate something, that I feel is important in expressinghow much potential Gigi has.Margaret Mitchell, best known for her epic 'Gone With The Wind'novel, amazingly wrote another book called 'Lost Laysen'. In it itsuggests 'Gone With The Wind' in embryo. Like 'Gone With The Wind',Lost Laysen' has a love triangle, and characters who give all forhonour. Everything 'Gone With The Wind' would become.So with this in mind as I read 'Rescue Me' I conclude that 'RescueMe' is like 'Gone With The Wind' in embryo, or in thiscase 'Maneater' in embryo. Greater works of fiction to come.Movies for 'Rescue Me' and 'Maneater' are in progress. I would loveto see how they turn out.Both novels have strong female lead characters. I think it would beinteresting to see how Gigi tackles a male character, if she desiresto write about a lead male character one day. Some male authors havesuccess writing about female characters. Some get a lot of praise forit. But really, it doesn't bother me. In the end it is up to theauthor and what they feel they will enjoy writing about for months oryears, and who she wants to centre her story around.I feel very lucky to have Gigi's two books in my posession. Iwouldn't want to be without them and I'd want to read more. Both werea great reading experience. Gigi is indeed a writing force to watch.Gigi turns writing on it's head and makes it her own and alwayssurprises me with outcomes I hadn't thought of. I really feel shemakes a terrific addition to the writing world. You never know whatto expect next. Always a good trait in the entertainment industry.Keep your ideas secret! Gigi you are one of a kind.Best of luck to you with future novels Gigi! You have a fan in me."},{"Title":"Rescue Me","review":"Refreshing, funny, tearjerker! A great refreshing read that did rescue me!"},{"Title":"Rescue Me","review":"The storyline was interesting but Grazer failed to fully develop her characters.

I didn't like any of the characters, and the writing was so uneven. Amanda made no sense, and the rest of the people in the book seemed paper-thin - so many things would happen for seemingly no reason. I kept waiting for everything to somehow tie together, but it really didn't. Gabe was too perfect - we are asked to believe his life pre-Amanda was just working in a car factory and hanging out with his drug dealer buddy. Also, why did Amanda end up marrying James? Even with the events leading up to the marriage, I find that hard to believe. And what about her boss at the TV show? Why was he even in the book? I honestly had to force myself to finish the book. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Rescue Me","review":"This novel is a little gem in its genre, a love story. But the author goes beyond and introduces us with a far more complex picture of L.A. society. The main character, Amanda, has to navigate among many perils and hazards. Her brother, a drugpusher, his girlfriend, a drugaddict, their son, a miracle in such conditions, her lifelong friend and lover who becomes her husband through blackmail, her boss and associates who take advantage of her with no future, and her real love Gabriel, a black factory worker who is a hundred time better than all the others. She will be forced into a marriage she does not want, and she will find Gabriel again on the very day when her husband announces he wants a divorce. The book also shows how some people, here men, from the lower classes of American society are able to make it and become successful entrepreneurs of a type or another : the land of opportunities is still here. But these men are motivated in their social climbing by women, the women they want to possess or the women they love. And yet the book goes even further by showing in great details the fate and lot of women in this American society. All women are exploited by men as sex toys, all women are exploited by men as social status tools, and yet again women resist this status of being nothing but a possession. There apparently are many ways, some closer to prostitution than human dignity, some harder than the hardest ordeal one can imagine, some rather easy and yet leading to a life of solitude and depressive alienation. Of course the end is luminous, it is a happy ending. But the book is rich in numerous pages and reflexions on the position of women in American society. It is serious and it should be read by many, men and women alike, to ponder on what they do and what they want and what they impose to others.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"Rescue Me","review":"This book is a must-read, the kind of book you'd expect to find on the Oprah book list. From the first page, you won't be able to put it down as it winds you through a journey past and present, of love and longing and fears and happiness and so many of the challenges we all face every day. Although Amanda's story is wonderfully detailed and specific, it touches on many layers of the human condition. This novel is fresh and moving and powerful.

After I finished it, I went back and read chunks of it over and over again. I have read other reviews on this site and some readers have said that some of the characters weren't fully developed, and they look at it as a bad thing. I, on the other hand, feel as though the Gigi did an excellent job and that the characters who weren't the most developed were the ones who fell to the wayside and weren't that important. They were only in the Amanda's life for a season...not a lifetime, unlike Gabriel and James.It was a well-thought out, feel good read.

Compared to Grazer's fabulous The Starter Wife, this was not good. It wasn't \\"fast-moving\\" like others claim, but in reality, bounced around so much that I could barely track what was happening. More importantly, it didn't engage me enough that I even cared what was happening! I became so bored and confused (a feat, I know) with the storyline that I eventually skipped to the end, something I also never do.

Gigi impressed me with this book and I would highly recommend this book to others. It's a good book that one can talk about with friends, or in my case co-workers."},{"Title":"Rescue Me","review":"&quot;Rescue Me: A Love Story&quot; by Gigi Levangie Grazer (screenwriter of the motion picture &quot;Stepmom&quot;) turns in a wonderful debut novel. I loved it. I found the story very compelling and well rounded. The movement fast (maybe due to her skills in movie writing) and deeply emotional. It takes a real look into the world of the human condition and what choices you make can have lasting effects on you and those around you. It touches on how you can take a deep and long look into yourself and decide if you are making the most of your life. The only problem is with her character development. She leaves you hanging a bit with some of the characters and you really crave more interaction and depth. But, that may come with more experience. She certainly has a lot of talent and it's a fresh and raw voice that has hit the mainstream. As someone else has stated, I would be surprised to see this book on Oprah's Book List. It was very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Rescue Me","review":"Rescue Me is a quick paced novel filled with the hopes, dreams and dire realities that were the 80's. Amanda's story is one that so many can relate to -- a less than perfect childhood, changes in family and friends that try our love and loyalty, selfish and selfless friends and lovers, lecherous bosses, and the colorful peripheral people who do effect our lives. And it's a story of hope -- that life can go on and love can win out, even if we think it's passed us by.The characters are so carefully woven, that as I read, I felt like I really knew them, and what an interesting bunch they are! The story reveals life in L.A. in the 80's, when we were innocent and naive (think sex and drugs), no matter how worldly and hip we thought we were. It's a love story minus the mush.A great book for a day on the beach, or a long soak in the tub. But also because of the clear, easy to follow writing, it's one of those books that you can read a few pages at a time, if that's all the time you have. But it *will* be hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Rescue Me","review":"Fresh out of college, and stuck in a boring job, Amanda and her childhood sweetheart James part ways so he can attend Harvard Law School. Amanda is living with her brother, drug dealer Val, in a seedy part of LA, while Val is slowly going over the edge. A chance meeting with his best friend, Gabe, turns into a passionate affair. James, who has never been faithful to Amanda, suspects something is up and returns to LA to collect his woman. He's upset to discover that she's taken up with a bi-racial man, and Amanda's forced to choose between the two. When an altercation with Val turns tragic, she is bound to a loveless marriage to James, all the while wondering what if her real love rescued her.The writing is stilted at some points - Grazer attempts to paint a portrait using a lot of narrative, and just goes overboard to the point where this reader was bored. It's a pretty short novel. There are about six pages between the tragedy and the big finish - nothing in between 1985 and 1995. I really think the story could have been better developed and perhaps expanded to provide detail of those missing years. Hard to believe that this was written by a Hollywood screenwriter. It just reeks of nepotism."},{"Title":"Rescue Me","review":"Anyone who has ever lived in L.A., Hollywood, the poor/rich enclave of Laurel Canyon or who's been to the movies will recognize Ms. Gigi Levangie Grazer's finely drawn characters.

A newly-discovered, fine, strong, silver thread of love between Amanda and Gabe shines through the mire and yet, ends abruptly and tragically.

Howard is the best writer ever next to HP Lovercraft. He was completely insane and that is a pre-requisite for being brilliant. The original tales of Conan....this was what I was raised on. I have every original book(these cost anywhere from $8-$50) and then this comes out. This story(Like every conan story) is an epic tale of how Conan gets himself into some crazy trouble...meets some hot chick that is in love with him because of course...he's Conan....and then he defeats some crazy demon of immense power because he's that clever and tough. These tales are so unbelievable that they are amazing. I really have a vision of exactly what is happening when I read Robert E. Howard. I really wish he would have kept writing and not shot himself in the head in 1932 because he was sad his mother died. Oh well, better to go out with a bang than to fade away."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Will this book find its audience? Obviously it is meant for fantasy fans. Hopefully the new generation weaned on Tolkien and Tolkien-clones will want to examine this precursor of their favored form. It might be a tough sell though. Howard, at his best, is gritty depression era stuff. This is lumpen-proletariat as role model fiction. Conan has a dim view of police, judges, and people in authority. He questions religion, the use of violence by governments, expansionist politics and occupations. He is a true rebel, and as much as American society pretends to enjoy rebels, the truth is that, true rebels are pilloried, jailed, and made to be as isolated as possible. The best audience for Conan these days might not be fantasy fans but fans of authors like Donald Goines, Jim Thompson, and Chuck Palahniuk.This package is definitely speaking to the fantasy fans though and that is realistically the smart thing to do. Howard was writing fantasy and his was the fantasy to emulate during the 60's and 70's. Most of Howard's hardcore fans were 14-year-olds back then and are a surly bunch of 40-year-olds now. This book is trying to appeal to more than nostalgia though. It is seeking to establish as well as re-establish REH's reputation in literature.I'm a little uncomfortable with the choice to quote Stephen King on the cover. Obviously a compliment from Stephen King can help sell books. However if one investigates the source of that quote (Danse Macabre) they would read King prefacing that quote with a slam on Sword &amp; Sorcery fiction in general and a summation that states that Howard's other work was either \\"unremarkable or abysmal.\\" I doubt the editors will be quoting that last line on a collection of Howard's King Kull or Solomon Kane stories.The blurbs continue with two onetime Conan pastichers being represented: Poul Anderson and Harry Turtledove. Not surprisingly the book carefully avoids the mention of L. Sprague de Camp. Every Conan fan knows de Camp's role in popularizing Conan but Wandering Star treats de Camp pretty much the way hard line Stalinists treated Trotsky. His name cannot be mentioned in the new version of history they are creating. I am in agreement with the editorial line that Howard should stand alone these days in unedited texts, uncompleted fragments, and as close to original drafts as possible. This book is a Robert E. Howard scholar's delight. The chance to study Howard's original intent in this series is much needed. Still, I think the introduction could have mentioned the Lancer Book series and how incredibly successful and influential it was in its day and given de Camp a nod of thanks for his arguably flawed but seminal efforts. Fans of the de Camp pastiches can find quite a bit of his work being reprinted by the apparently Fourth Internationalists at Tor Books.All in all, this is a great collection of stories worthy of being read and re-read. Stories like \\"The Tower of the Elephant,\\" \\"The God in the Bowl,\\" and \\"Rogues in the House\\" will stand the test of time. Not all the stories are gems though and a few of them contain downright ugly racism. During these moments you'll have to remind yourself that these stories were written in the 1930's and was not the most enlightened of times. Not that 2003 is all that enlightened either though."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"At last a volume of Conan tales untainted by overlording editors and PC sensitivity.

He's a murderer, a womanizer, and a conqueror. He cares nothing for his victims, and loves no one but himself and his sword. And in this collection, one put together with obvious love, you see this in every story. Del Rey put all the best of the Conan stories into this collection, with full color illustrations done by Mark Schultz.Though all of these stories are considered the best of Conan, there are a select few that make this collection great. My personal favorite is \\"Queen of the Black Coast,\\" which is the only story that shows Conan in love, and the kind of woman it takes for Conan to feel such a love. Other good stories are \\"The Phoenix on the Sword,\\" \\"The Tower of the Elephant,\\" and \\"The Devil in Iron.\\" All of these stories are of Conan at his least cliche, where he shows some true emotion beyond bloodthirstiness or carnality. Still, though the other tales are a bit simple, they are entertaining nonetheless, and tell a lot of the world of pulp writing back then.Also included is a \\"Miscellanea\\" section, which details the histories of some of the more famous Conan stories, along with synapses for stories never completed or rough drafts of stories that were since rewritten. There's an appendices as well, explaining the world in which Conan lives in, along with the publishing history of every separate story in this collection.What's sad, however, is that the famous author, Robert E. Howard, let himself get pulled into the times, and was influenced by his friend and colleague, H. P. Lovecraft. His writing shows clearly a racist attitude toward every other race, sex, or creature that isn't like Conan. The female characters (with the exception of Belit in \\"Queen of the Black Coast\\") are clingy and dependant upon Conan. The characters that are not white-skinned are depicted as stupid or simple, or wild and savage, depending on what side they are on, protagonist or antagonist. Though it is common of the times, you'd sometimes like to see a person step up and consider what he thinks is right or wrong. Howard let influences take over, which is disappointing.But if we were to judge books by an author's want for publication, none of the books of that time would be considered important. Racist writing was as common then as Harlequin romances are today. Howard's writing, though overtly racist, isn't driven by it, thankfully. So, if you are new to the Conan stories, like I was, be warned, some of what can be read in here is offensive. Its importance to literature, and more particularly fantasy, makes this an essential collection to pick up for anyone who wishes to know what was great in the days past."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"&quot;The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian&quot; marks the first unedited printing of some of Robert Howard's Conan stories in a long while - maybe since they first appeared in magazines over 70 years ago.For anyone seeking some enjoyable adventure stories, this book is worth its weight in gold.The stories are presented in the order published, and not the chronological order of Conan's life. The reader is so fully immersed he hears the screams, smells the gore, and sometimes even ducks a passing blow. Howard is both incredibly descriptive and economical with his writing; thirty pages of Conan will make your blood sing and your heart race more than two hours of the best Hollywood blockbuster.The Conan feature films, while enjoyable in their own right, do the character a grave disservice. Schwarzenegger's Conan is powerful but lumbering, clean cut and shaven, and a team player. Howard's Conan has blinding speed, panther reflexes, and animal cunning to match his crushing strength. He is fiercely independent and a skilled leader, but his appeal comes from an untamed and savage charisma that has none of the softness of civilized men.Unfortunately, Howard was probably sexist and certainly racist. However, this doesn't invalidate the quality of his writing any more than sexism or racism in writers nullifies the value of Greek philosophy or the US Constitution. If you can look past those admittedly serious flaws, you may just find some of the most exciting fiction ever written."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Great stories...One of the best writers of short stories ever.

Howard is more like a clear, shallow puddle of rain water than a vast ocean of quasi historical fiction, which is what it claims to be. Where is the depth? The cultures, characters, and places all seem so paper thin. For someone who was such a student of history (and who actually wanted to write historical fiction, but didn't want to go through the hassel of all of the research) you would think that you would get a better sense of who these people were, but it never really comes across. I think this has something to do with the medium that Howard was working with. It is hard to convey really deep characters, and cultures in the context of a short story. Having said that, I was marginally satisfied with this read, and sometimes more than a little entertained.To be honest, I quite think the film Conan the Barbarian did a much better job in layering the Conan mythos with images and story that evoke past cultures and peoples.All in all, not a bad read, but not great either."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I bought the original Lancer paperbacks in the late 60's and they were never intended to last.

What are you waiting for, go buy it now!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This series is really meant for true blue Robert E. Howard and/or Conan fans. It bills itself as pure Howard, and none of the pastiches that have come to cloud the image of Howard's famous barbarian. These three volumes contain finished Conan stories as originally published and draft stories in various degrees of completion. The stories are familiar to readers of Conan, most notably the Ace books set from about 30 years ago that blended Howard originals with pastiches.While the stories still have the same charm, there is definite continuity issues the reader must keep in mind. Since Howard did not write Conan chronologically, there never was continuity until the Ace series, but having that chronology is helpful. Again, it doesn't change the stories, but it does keep them in perspective. Another feature of the Ace series was the biographical introduction that sets Conan's wanderings up to the story at hand. This helps set the stage and keeps Conan's life journeys and experiences in order.So these new compilations are nice for Howard/Conan enthusiats, but must have some type of literary warning label that they do not intend to be chronologiccal and do not intend to be anything but what they are. The stories still fascinate me, and the illustrations help add depth to the story, so I do recommend this series."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"When I was young, I devoured certain works in the \\"sword and sorcery\\" genre. But Howard was not on the list, and I really did not have any awareness of Conan apart from the noteworthy Schwartzenegger film and the occasional, incomprehensible comic book. I kind of discovered Conan when, recently, I read extensively into H. P. Lovecraft and became aware of his and Howard's interesting correspondence. So, I gave \\"Conan\\" a whirl. And I am so glad I did!It is true that many of Howard's \\"Conan\\" tales are the stuff of the juvenile, riddled with literary cliches. But when one considers that Howard wrote the bulk of these stories for magazines, it becomes very easy to see the need for narrative speed and easy-to-grasp cliffhanger moments. And what stories! Howard clearly drew inspiration from penny-dreadfuls, westerns, and the pulps, stories that people wanted to read - fun, unapologetic escapism. But under his pen, they become something more. His archetype anti-hero/hero, depending on context, is a developed character, not a mindless shank of muscle blundering his way through every situation. His Conan is a ruler, a warrior, a scholar-prince. And Howard's mythical Hypoborian world is well-developed, clearly reflective of the anxieties (political and racial) that were beginning to beset the United States of his time. So Conan is something more than cartoon. Howard's work is also a glimpse into his own era where he brings what he thought to be the \\"virtuous\\" in his day and juxtaposes it against the perceived \\"evil\\" of his day. The sometimes unabashed but uncomfortable racism implicit in some of his work is especially telling.Still, those obvious limitations aside, it is possible to see Howard unfolding a whole world before him and being able to present the mystical and mythical as almost plausible. It is the rare writer who possesses such gifts. Also, I found many of his depictions of women, especially in \\"The Queen of the Sword Coast,\\" as remarkably progressive. True, Conan is a conqueror of women as much as he is slayer of men, but, for example, in \\"Queen,\\" when she kneels before him, she informs him that SHE has chosen HIM as \\"mate.\\" The women Howard describes are not wilting violets or damsels in distress, but empowered. I found this a refreshing surprise and something I was not expecting. Clearly, even in isolated West Texas, Howard was not insulated from a sense that his world was in a state of flux.The editors have also very wisely presented Howard's stories as they appeared in print. In simply refusing to be banal in imposing a false chronology, this book and its companions allow the reader to have the \\"magazine\\" experience Howard's original readers were able to enjoy. The generous reprints of some of his key letters and notes also provide amazing glimpses into the workings of the master fantasist's mind and creative process. Such a pleasure.I note, thought, that the paperback editions of these works suffer from bad glue spine binding. So care should be taken when buying to ask about the spine condition, and for heaven's sake don't leave one in a hot car. The books do not \\"tent\\" well at all. So be careful.I cannot recommend these tales highly enough. True, some aspects are dated, the repetitious cliches can get tiresome, and some of Howard's less advanced social attitudes can make one wince. But such failiures can be forgiven in context, and the reader will be able to enjoy a complete generation of stories that make it easy to see - and more deeply appreciate - how later and even contemporaneous writers, game developers, and artists like Barker, King, Gygax, Lovecraft, Del Rey, and Frazetta owe him such vast and freely acknowledged debts.Recommended without reservation save for the notes on binding problems."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Very enjoyable set of short stories. The imagery and atmosphere are superb and really draw you in. The stories themselves are centered around characters fulfilling one machismo fantasy after another, which may sound off-putting but in reality is a pleasurable treat.

Forget your stories of love lost and won against the backdrop of (insert contrived historical setting here). This is what entertaining, escapist fiction is about. A guilty pleasure, something to be covertly enjoyed? No, by Crom! These stories are uncompromisingly true to themselves, and as a result have more integrity than most things I've read in the last 20 years. If only those writing in Fantasy these days could shrug off the weight of tired tropes and imposed expectations of the genre, they could produce something that approaches the fresh, snappy pace and well-described action that Howard pioneered. True, he had the advantage of helping invent the genre, and didn't have to write under this weight, but that's the fun part - like Raymond Chandler, you can read these works, see the genre being invented before your eyes and realise why the style became cliche - it was so good that everyone wanted to copy it.I find it interesting that Howard, who struggled with depression, wrote stories that crackle with vitality and display what I see as a celebration of living a passionate life. Funny how that works. Anyway, I leave you with a telling quote from \\"The Tower of the Elephant\\" that sums up the noble honesty of the character of Conan and why he appeals so much: \\"Civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split, as a general thing.\\""},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian is one of my favorites.

Tolkien is rightfully hailed as a founding father of modern fantasy fiction, but The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian proves that Robert E. Howard is not to be overlooked as a vital pioneer of what we now call sword-and-sorcery.While both creators have helped shape the genre, their works bear noticeable differences. Whereas Tolkien was immersed in Germanic culture, drawing influence from such heroic elder texts as the Eddas, the Nibelungenlied and Beowulf, Howard crafts a world carved from a wider range of cultures and mythic pantheons. Conan travels far and wide, not only in lands vaguely paralleling the European North, but also ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Imperial Rome, Hellenic Greece and Africa. There are no dwarves or elves in Conan's world; only vying human factions and their dark, fearsome gods. Tolkien's Middle Earth feels vaguely medieval; Howard's world feels positively ancient.Howard has a masterful way with words. With two well-crafted sentences he can paint a sweeping, cinematic landscape complete with a stirring soundtrack... no easy task. The action is of the two-fisted variety, straightforward and gritty. And the dialogue is a joy to read, capturing the atmosphere of mythic heroism without becoming a parody of itself.Conan himself may defy new readers' expectations. He is a far cry from the Schwarzenegger stereotype made famous in the movies. He is more than a hulking brawler with a broadsword - although he is that - he is by turns a cunning rouge, a forceful military commander, and a no-nonsense king. What he may lack in relative sophistication he makes up for with instinctive wisdom and blunt eloquence.Conan is a paradox. He carries the savagery of his race and a timeless heroic nobility in equal measure. By sword, by guile, or by sheer force of will he bests the beasts of the wild, the abominations of the nether realms, and the \\"perfumed nobles\\" of the great city-states. Of all his world's horrors and perils, he reserves his fear only for \\"the curse of the gods.\\"They just don't make 'em like they used to."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The world of Conan is an amazing place. A world that takes survival of the fittest to new extremes. A world where all women are perfect bodied nudists that only the strongest man can have. And a place where the darkest of magicks and monsters of unspeakable evil dwell.It is our planet and the time is the Hyborian Age. A time so thickly described and imagined by Robert E. Howard you almost believe it really did exist. The most appealing thing about the stories of Conan is that each one takes place in different, highly imaginative land with new wonders and secret for the great Cimmerian to uncover.Conan is not the dunderhead seen in the Arnie movies but an extremely intelligent and cunning warrior who always rises to the top of any faction he has made himself a part of and is Captain of a million pirates, General of a thousand armies, King of a hundred lands and an fair fight for almost no one. Conan always wins because he's just simply the mightiest, strongest and most vicious fighter their is.But he does have morals and is more human than most people he encounters no matter how many times the call him a barbarian dog. And it's easy to identify with a man who loves to travel and keep on going, never wanting to stay in the same place too long. I mean there is so much to this world (but even more to his) that staying in an office for 40 years is downright insane.Robert E.

Howard.Robert E. Howard's life was cut tragically short, but he accomplished much in such a short amount of time. Not only did the gritty and macho Texan help lay the foundation for the sword and sorcery genre, Howard created the most famous character in all of fantasy - Conan the Cimmerian. If you are interested in learning more about the history of the author and the development of his stories and characters, the volume begins with a wonderful introduction and ends with appendices which provide a wealth of information for Howard scholars to absorb and study.Don't be fooled by the elitist snobbery that exist today concerning pulp tales; the road may be shorter but is just as engaging. Of course that is but one reason many dismiss pulp tales as being worthy literary additions to the genre. In fact, many immediately identify the raw and often lurid imagery common in pulp, which contrasts the 'safer' and seemingly politically correct archetypes found in more traditional literature, as evidence of it being more visceral than sophisticated. Many label Howard's tales and Conan as chauvinistic and needlessly violent and feel unsympathetic to a character who is at odds with their contemporary morals, values, and refined sensibilities. Let it be known, Conan isn't the proverbial 'good guy' or the virtuous knight in shining armor. Moreover, some of today's readers might argue that Howard's stories are formulaic and predictable, but all of his classic tales are filled to the rim with uncompromising, red-blooded entertainment.Many of you may have read stories containing a warrior named Conan and think you already know the character and have a feel for Robert E. Howard's writing. However, it might be quite to the contrary for, as alluded to earlier, Howard's work underwent heavy editing and significant changes posthumously. The popularity of Howard's work grew dramatically in the mid-60s, reaching its zenith in the 1970s. During this time, publishers, eager to satiate the hunger of the barbarian's fans, often produced stories chronicling Conan's adventures which had no connection whatsoever to Howard or were so heavily edited that the same passion and spirit prevalent in Howard's original character were absent. Sadly, these corrupted and grossly inferior versions are all that many of us know in regards to his most celebrated character. Undiluted illustrations of classical work in literature are rare to get a hold of in this age. This is what makes the Coming of Conan a really special treat and a must-read for all fantasy fans."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I can give this nothing but 5 stars. Any real Conan fan is going to buy this knowing it is Howard's stories and none of the overly edited, or pastiche stories. Simply put, his stories as he wrote them, of one of the most enduring characters of fantasy fiction about eight decades on. Something entirely deserving of the hardcover format. The illustrations harken back to the pulp style. The publishers definately picked the right illustrator. I would venture, any real fan of fantasy literature, particularly Heroic-fantasy would want this to go next to similar volumes of Moorcock's Elric or Corum novels, and Lieber's Swords series.Those not familiar with Howard's original stories should not expect the comic-bookishness of the later Marvel comics series, or the High-fantasy of Tolkien and others. This is heroic-fantasy. Among the best, the most relevant to the development of the genre of Heroic-fantasy."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Like many Conan fans, I first read the stories of Conan back in the 1970's through the old ACE paperback collections. It wasn't until many years later that i would find that these stories were edited, sometimes quite heavily, and also finished or collaborated on posthumously by people like Lin Carter and L. Sprague DeCamp. While Carter certainly thrived in the genre of Swords and Sorcery, DeCamp could barely contain his disdain for the genre or Robert E. Howard for that matter and it certainly shows when stories are compared side-by-side. For all Howard's critics labelinig him as a pulp hack, DeCamp WISHES he would have had Howard's skill for prose and action.This book presents 13 of Howard's Conan stories in the order they were written, although NOT chronologically, so don't get confused. The stories are the pure an unedited versions, many for the first time since they were published in the pages of Weird Tales over seventy years ago.Among the stories in the Collection are:The Queen of the Black Coast - One of the longer tales that Howard wrote as Conan meets with his first true love Belit in a jungle adventure.The Frost Giants Daughter - where Conan encounters A Beautiful snow Queen and the Frost Giants in the frigid northern Lands.The Tower of the Elephant - Classic howard with a young Conan as a thief with a nod to Lovecraft's dark Cthulhu gods.The book is illustrated by Mark Schultz who does a fine job but certainly no Frazetta or even Boris for that matter. For any Conan fan this is a definitive book to get the stories as they were originally written and intended and unsoiled by the less skilled writers who would edit them in later decades.highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Wow! This collection is a work of love. For Conan fans, getting this book is a no-brainer. For Howard purists, getting this book is a no-brainer. For sword and sorcery fans, getting this book is a no-brainer. Howard's Conan leaps out of the pages and runs wildly through your imagination. The new illustrations by Mark Schultz are well done and add to the reading. The additional material in the book (maps, history, etc.) all add further depth and insight into the world of Conan. I thoroughly enjoyed my initial reading and look eagerly forward to the next collection to finish the Conan saga as Howard meant it."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This is the first of three projected volumes collecting Robert E. Howard's Conan stories as they were originally written or presented in the pages of WEIRD TALES in the 1930's. For over 50 years, posthumous editors have meddled with the text of the Conan. Rewrites of stories, heavy handed editing, and insertion of counterfeit pastiche stories amidst the Howard Conan stories have diluted and presented a distortion of the original fiction. This gets it all back to the real unadulterated Conan and Robert E. Howard.Contents include thirteen stories, an essay (The Hyborian Age), \\"Notes on Various Peoples of the Hyborian Age,\\" four synopses, one fragment, one draft, \\"Hyborian Names and Countries,\\" and reproductions of two maps drawn by Robert E. Howard. In addition are an excellent introduction and the essay \\"Hyborian Genesis\\" by Robert E. Howard scholar, Patrice Louinet. Cover and interior art is provided by Mark Schultz of XENOZOIC TALES fame. The art is appropriately \\"retro\\" to the era these stories were written and harkens back to Hal Foster and PRINCE VALIANT not to mention Virgil Finlay, Harold McCauley, and other illustrators for pulp magazines of the 1930's. A break has been made with Frank Frazetta style illustration which though great is too closely associated with the corrupt texts and pastiches of the Lancer and Ace paperbacks of 35 years ago. This is an incredible value for the money. Go out and buy this book before having some time off because you won't want to put it down in order to go to sleep, school, or work."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"And if you do not care.. then TO HELL with You!ITISCONAN the BARBARIAN!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This is not the movie! There is a certain frown or laugh I get from people when I mention Conan books. They relate everything to the movie, not having a clue of the magnitude of these stories. See for yourself and you won't be dissapointed. Gore, guts, and beautiful women. Oh yeah, and a heck of a great story teller. Pure fantasy! Enjoy it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I bought a few Conan compilations because friends of mine said that they enjoyed the stories. I also bought them to get some background information before the Age of Conan MMORPG comes out. This book definitely helped in that respect. It has various stories describing many areas in the Hyborian world. The appendices also give some background information that some may find helpful in understanding the world of Conan.One thing to know before reading this book is that the stories are in the order that they were written. This is not chronological order of how they occured. In fact the first story starts off with Conan as King of Aquilonia already. So, do not expect the stories to relate to one another and link. They are all separate stories (most submitted to be published in the magazines at the time) that can stand alone, but together they give you insight into another world."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The Conan character has been developed and embellished by a host of writers, but it was Robert E. Howard who gave him true immortality thanks to such towering stories as \\"Red Nails\\" and \\"Queen of the Black Coast\\". This book collects the first half of Howard's output, and the tales are presented in the actual order in which he wrote them. No pastiches or post-mortem collaborations, just the real thing distilled. The appendices offer some fascinating insight into the author's mind and the development of his Hyborian world."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I, like many modern fans, first became fond of Howard's barbarian from Cimmerian in John Milius' Conan the Barbarian (you didn't expect me to say Conan the Destroyer, did you?). Here Howard's original stories are given a great presentation and curious new fans and long-time Conan fans should be very happy. While some stories are better than others, all are extremely well written and readable. Compared to the \\"epic\\" crap fantasy that people like Jordan and Erikson shovel out yearly, this is a breath of fresh sword.By Crom, it's fun."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I was introduced to REH as a kid by the ramblings of Roy Tomas in every issue of the 1980s black &amp; white oversized Marvel Conan comic mags. In high-school I secured a compilation of his novels, essays, and short-stories through the sci-fi book club. His stuff has been VERY hard to come by...until now that is. I will without a doubt buy every Conan, Soloman Kane, Kull, or Bran Mak Morn compilation of REH that becomes available.This volume is a great read. Most of these stories were not contained in the other book I have. If you have not read this man's writings you need to step up to the plate. He smokes every modern fantasy writer. Very visceral and very intense writing. Also, this compilation has excellent art-work. And for only 15 bucks you NEED TO BUY THIS NOW!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This was the first time I had ever read Robert Howard's Conan stories. I have to admit that I was impressed. From \\"The Phoenix on the Sword\\" to \\"The Devil in Iron,\\" I only became more and more engrossed in this character and his adventures that up until now I had only seen in the fabulous Arnold Schwarzenegger. The action sequences and the evil ungodly monsters that face Conan's fury were marvelously entertaining by the end of the book. I appreciated the fact that it was fully illustrated as well; however, I would have preferred not to have seen the illustrated plates of future events at the beginning of the various chapters. That, in my opinion, was a mistake.Now, as much as I feel I cannot wait until I have my hands on Volume 2, I am seriously considering finding a completely different published version from this. Why? Ballantine Books/Del Rey so incompetently put this version together, that within 1 week of me starting to read the book, the book actually started falling apart! It got so bad, that I had to use Scotch tape to hold the little sections together. Eventually, the entire cover came unglued from the book. I was shocked and will probably not be able to read this \\"text\\" again. What a waste of money. So, if you can, buy a different published version than Del Rey's--especially if it's a hardbacked version."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I do not have the slightest interest in sword and fantasy fiction. I came to Howard via Lovecraft. That being said Lovecraft and Howard are hands down the best horror and fantasy fiction writes in the history of the genres. They are kindred spirits. Both had troubled short lives. Both have written the best horror and fantasy EVER. Nobody comes close to these titans. Howard could write about a dust mote floating in the wind and make it utterly mesmerizing."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Wow!! Let me say that again--Wow!!! I am completely tongue-tied and in awe of this book. Stephen King quoted it exactly on the front cover. Howard's writing is electrifying and different than any fantasy I've ever read. Other \\"fantasy\\" novels and stories are kids books compared to this. As you read these great stories, you can feel Howard's powerful voice reverberate. And the characters, not only Conan, literaly come to life. This is pure, no b.s., top of the line fantasy and adventure. I saw the Conan movie a couple of weeks ago and laughed at how far off its portrayel of Conan was from REH's books. I don't know of anyone they could really cast and give Conan due justice. He is just too intense for any Hollywood actor. Highly Recommended!! I dont know if I'll ever find a book or an author that can match REH in this particular genre."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I've been reading Conan from the age of 11, and for me this is a dream come true. For years I had to settle with the Lancer/Ace editions, which were filled with pastiches from other authors and heavily edited in order to be more politically correct. Whoever had the bright idea of renaming \\"The Hour of the Dragon\\" \\"Conan the Conqueror\\" obviously didn't understand Howard's point to begin with. But I digress. For those who are only familiar with Conan from the comics, the movies, or the numerous pastiches written by other authors, you may be in for quite a shock. Howard's stories are grim, sexually charged, and sometimes racially offensive. If you're offended by it (Mr. DeCamp), get over it! This is the way the author intended it, and no one has the right to change his words in order to make it more palatable to modern audiences. Besides, one must remember that Howard was a rural Texan living in the 1930s. If he was a racist, he was obviously a mild one compared to most of his neighbors at the time. For instance, the word \\"savage\\" in the context of Howard's stories is not exactly an insult. Let's not forget that Howard also made the love of Conan's life a Jewish princess (Queen of the Black Coast).Some might remember that in the late seventies, Berkely tried to release definative series of Howard's Conan which were unabridged and pastiche free. The series was ultimately buried when Ace books beat them to the punch by re-releasing the Lancer volumes, which were better known and also had the advantage of much better cover art (thanks to the incomparable Frank Frazetta). Finally, after 20 years, we're able to read Conan as he was meant to be read, free of pastiches and free of politically correct editorial decisions.One thing fans of the movies/comics/pastiches might not realize is that Conan doesn't go around wearing a loincloth all the time. I always hated that. Its just so stupid. Why would a Conan in his mid-twenties or thirties still be wearing the same loincloth he presumably had on when he first came out of the wilds of Cimmeria? Howard never even wrote that the Cimmerians wore loincloths! The real barbarians of antiquity didn't even wear them! Are we supposed to believe that the barbarians of Howard's world have mastered sword-making but couldn't figure out how to make clothes? The only story where Conan is described wearing a loincloth is \\"The Tower of the Elephant\\", and its not described as an animal skin. In all of Howard's stories, Conan is dressed appropriately for the situation. If its a pirate story (Pool of the Black One), he's dressed like a pirate. If he's a Kozaki raider he's dressed like a Cossack, etc. What makes Conan a barbarian is not the clothes he wears but the person he is, which is revealed through his actions and dialogue.I highly recommend this book, along with \\"The Bloody Crown of Conan\\", and the forthcoming \\"The Conquering Sword of Conan\\". Even Howard's mediocre Conan stories are light years ahead of Robert Jordan or L. Sprague DeCamp. Howard was one of the best, and arguably the most influential pulp-fiction writers of the twentieth century. His writings should be regarded for what they truly are: literature. This is the real deal!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"It is amazing to finally have this volume released in an affordable format. \\"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\\" was originally published as a limited edition hardcover by Wandering Star press, a publishing house exclusively devoted to the works of Robert E. Howard, producing premium editions much like \\"special edition\\" DVDs. For the first time ever, the original Howard Conan stories complete and uncut with a host of original illustrations and special features. The only problem being that one hardback book sold for over a hundred dollars. And now, to have all of the same material, including the original illustrations, in an inexpensive paperback format! A dream come true!Robert E. Howard was a decent pulp writer, Brusque and manly, he waxed yarns of hot-blooded heroes quick to the gun or sword, depending on their era. When writing Conan, however, he was inspired. These tales of high adventure are as primal as their hero, tapping into some deep, recessed part of the soul where a creature runs about in animal skins and takes what he wants, but not without honor. Woman and treasure and danger and violence, but presented without exploitation and with a quality of writing that renders such things viable. Writing cut from that Hemmingway fiber, if he had written about sword-swinging barbarians instead of gun-toting revolutionaries.\\"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\\" presents, in chronological order, some raw slices of Howard's vision. \\"The Phoenix on the Sword,\\" originally intended as a Kull of Atlantis story before recasting it with his new creation, remains one of the finest stories in the genre. The short story\\"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\\" is mythic and wonderful, pitting human strength against the Gods. \\"The Tower of the Elephant\\" blends Howard's rawness with the cosmic insight of his friend HP Lovecraft. Really, they are all gems.The \\"special features\\" are an interesting insight into Howard's mind, showing story development and process, as well as providing some background on the world of Conan. in \\"Hyborian Genesis\\" there is the story of the creation of Conan, and his influences. The only \\"special feature\\" I would have liked to have seen, but is missing, is a presentation of the original pulp covers featuring Conan stories. The modern illustrations and beautiful, but I would have liked to have seen the original interpretations as well.I look forward to collecting the remaining two volumes in this Conan series."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"In the name of god, buy this edition of the Conan stories, and no other. Pay no attention to the fact that you can get a version of these stories cheaper in old paperbacks, because, believe me, I made that mistake myself. The effect of reading the paperbacks isn't half of the effect of reading the original versions of these stories, and in the correct order. And the illustrations in these trade papers aren't bad, either.The depths of de Camp's betrayal of the works of Robert E. Howard are obvious at last. It takes a great deal of arrogance to think that one can \\"improve\\" the works of another artist, let alone one whose talent level is ten notches above your own. What were that two-bit hack and his publishers thinking? Surely Crom is tormenting their souls even as we speak...or at least we can hope.Howard's supposed \\"flaws\\" are, in fact, some of his greatest strengths; they are part of his philosophy, which is a limited but a very true one. His storytelling skills, while on occasion conforming a bit too much to the commerical necessities of the pulps for which he was writing, are as good as anyone's, anywhere, ever. While at times his work is a little rushed (he was doing this for a living, after all), at his best he is extraordinary. He is always compulsively readable, with a breathtaking rhythm to his words, but at the same time he possesses a real poetic flair, as well as an almost unique ability to create very powerful atmospheres and solid characterizations seemingly effortlessly, with a minimum of suggestion. I do not overstate the case. Raymond Chandler wasn't appreciated for a long time, either. And when he was \\"on\\", which is ninety percent of the time, Howard was every bit as good at what he did as Chandler was in his arena.Indeed, Howard's talent level must have been truly prodigious, considering he was doing this stuff in his twenties! In that sense he is the Mozart of fantasy writers, but in tone he is certainly the Richard Wagner. Don't let little minds and today's limp-wristed, egalitarian pop culture tell you what is good or bad or form your opinions of the Conan stories.I mean, seriously: Lay me odds that anybody will be reading Thomas Pynchon or John Updike or that kind of thing a century from now, against odds they'll be reading Conan. I'll take that bet anytime. After all, Howard possesses two very important features that writers of that ilk lack completely, and in Howard's case they're made of brass, as well..."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"\\"Conan\\" is your typical insensitive brute floating through life with no rhyme or reason to the consideration of others, save for the woman he favors at the time. One wonders if Howard really meant to write this kind of character with this kind of story.The prose is rich and vibrant, but Conan himself is not a character to be admired for anything beyond brute animal survivalist savagery. In one of the first stories the narrative tells of how he came to the crown of his own kingdom. A tale that reads like the history of a mafia don, only instead of Tommy guns and pinstripe suits the characters wield swords and shields.Conan is a thief. He's also a murderer, though excuses his behavior with the explanation being \\"survival\\". In one story he even states that he going to \\"hide the evidence\\".The depiction of a nearly uncaring individual with a certain amount of warrior's guile is an attractive one to the reader. The lexicon Howard employs is full of poetic texture. I happen to like the reads themselves.But Conan the character? One might as well read about a sociopathic Viking, which I'm almost sure Howard meant Conan to be. Beyond that is idle speculation.The stories themselves are interesting diversions, but again can be nearly as insulting as Conan himself. In one story tall \\"black men\\" act as sadistic aliens, while in another tale another set of races are portrayed as dumb. Conan himself is painted as an \\"outsider\\" among the fairer skinned northerners of the purported \\"Hyborean Age\\". Again, speculation as to why might yield the true answer, but I'm not sure it's worth contemplating. That, and I think were the truth known, it might set back social concordances another fifty years.Then again, they are merely just stories, and you can't take this stuff too seriously. It's not a read I'd recommend for good literature. Go find that elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Somewhat of a disappointment, having read the series of Conan books re-worked by L. Sprague De Camp and Lin Carter in the 70's, I had hoped that the original stories as written by Howard himself would be even beter. Unfortunately, I did not like this book nearly as much; the action lacked the emotional impact and violence, the stories were very short and \`patchy', the flow was at times difficult and unnatural, the scenes were not as vibrantly depicted and lacked the color and feel that De Camp and Carter gave to them, and worse was the characters themselves, they lacked depth, intensity, likeability, and charm..Instead of this book I would recommend, and much preferred either the De Camp/ Carter series, or \\"The Conan Chronicles, Volume 1\\" and \\"The Further Chronicles of Conan\\", by Robert Jordan.OVERALL SCORE: (C)PLOT: (C), CHARATERS: (C-), DIALOGUE: (C-), SETTING: (C), ACTION/COMBAT: (C), ANTAGONISTS: (B-), ROMANCE: (B+), SEX: (Light), AGE LEVEL: (PG)"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This compilation of robert e howards prolific amoral barbarian is a must for every conan fan.

Howard's writing is nothing short of awesome and it's really aged well. I guess he was ahead of his time. The fights are written very graphically and you just can't help but smile during some of the epic battle scenes. You really feel like you're surveying the battle as a bird!This is basically a collection of stories with some extras. Seriously, you can read any story in any particular order you want. They're not related or connected in any way, which I think is a negative. Conan never really grows as a character. I mean in one story he's a king but he acts the same way as he did when he was a pirate. I would've preferred some character development and watching him grow as a character.Sadly, the stories do get a bit repeitious. Conan usually meets a beautiful woman in peril, fights some monsters, fights the big boss monster at the end and saves the woman. But in defense, these are stores in magazines and in that case it would've been entirely different. They just seemed a tad repetitive reading them in succession.I didn't bother to read the last third of the book. It consisted of summaries, excerpts on the races etc, and unfinished work. The quality of the book is relatively high. The book is heavy, the cover is shiny and it looks like what all softcover books should look like.If you're into short stories then this book is perfect.

Because of so many bad movies, comics and free reign given to authors undeserving to write stories involving this character (some of the written by other than Howard Conan stuff is very good, most is not) many people do not understand the true nature, depth, and greatness of this character and Robert E Howards work. These stories are often as much horror stories as much as they are sword and sorcery adventure tales, or at least a fusion of the two. There is also a philosophical side of Conan that is one part might is right style social darwinism, mixed with an Aryan warriors sense of honor and chivalry along with a Viking berserkers battle ecstacy. His attitudes on life, race and women are so politically incorrect I have to wonder if any major publisher would have the balls to put out these stories if Howard were getting started now.

Conan is more than just a swordsman, he is the ultimate individualist, he imposes his will on his enemies and would die for any cause he thought worthy. His stories are simple and yet elegant.

The included stories are (in order):1. The Phoenix on the Sword2. The Frost-Giant's Daughter3. The God in the Bowl4. The Tower of the Elephant5. The Scarlet Citadel6. Queen of the Black Coast7. Black Colossus8. Iron Shadows in the Moon (aka Shadows in the Moonlight)9. Xuthal of the Dusk (aka The Slithering Shadow)10. The Pool of the Black One11. The Vale of Lost Women12. The Devil in Iron13. The Phoenix on the Sword (first submitted draft)Plus a number of fragments and outlines, and Howard's guide to Conan's world: &quot;The Hyborian Age.&quot;All the stories are enjoyable, although a few are minor entries in the Conan canon. The superior works are &quot;The Tower of the Elephant,&quot; &quot;The Scarlet Citadel,&quot; &quot;The Frost-Giant's Daughter,&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Black Coast.&quot; The last story is the gem of the collection: a grand romantic tragedy that you will never forget. This is one of Howard's ultimate great works.The volume comes with a treasure trove of supporting material: illustrations by Mark Schultz that have a unique take on the character; an informative introduction and very detailed appendicies that go into the history of how Howard wrote the stories and some of his sources, and textual notes for the truly obsessed.This is simply a superb collection: long-time fans and first time readers will all find something to treasure in this salute to one of the major authors and founders of modern fantasy."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"If a teacher assigned a project requiring you to draw up a list of the most influential authors in the fantasy/science fiction genre, Robert E. Howard would sit safely in the top five. Along with H.P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, Howard was one of the groundbreaking influences in popular fiction of the 1930s. His influence is still felt today as evidenced by the large number of books containing stories based on his most popular creation, Conan the Cimmerian. Sadly, most of these newer tales, spun from unfinished fragments found in Howard's possession after his untimely demise in 1936, barely manage to attain a shadow of the glory found in the original tales. I think of Lin Carter's &quot;Conan the Liberator,&quot; a truly awful piece of junk based on one of these fragments, and I shudder at the damage done to Robert Howard's reputation. That's why we should all give a warm round of applause to Del Rey for releasing this comprehensive collection of the earliest Conan stories. It's great to see a collection of the original tales available for sale at a reasonable price. Moreover, the book contains a foreword from the illustrator chosen to draw for this collection, a fascinating piece of criticism examining Howard's influences, and a few other goodies shedding even more light on how Conan came about. The order of the stories, too, mirrors exactly the sequence in which the author wrote them.&quot;The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian&quot; is, I am embarrassed to say, my first foray into the original Conan tales. I looked around for these things for years, but always found the prices in the secondary market-usually for moth eaten copies of decades old versions-to much weight to place on my wallet. I did get a chance to read a few of Howard's Bran Mak Morn stories, several of his Cthulhu tales, and a couple of other great stories completely unrelated to Conan. Still, it's not the same. To know Howard is to read the Conan sagas. Included here are thirteen original stories, beginning with &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; and including such epics as &quot;The Tower of the Elephant,&quot; &quot;The Scarlet Citadel,&quot; &quot;Queen of the Black Coast,&quot; and &quot;Black Colossus.&quot; Lesser, but by no means uninteresting stories, include &quot;The Frost-Giant's Daughter,&quot; &quot;The God in the Bowl,&quot; &quot;Iron Shadows in the Moon,&quot; &quot;Rogues in the House,&quot; and &quot;Xuthal of the Dusk.&quot; Included also is Howard's history of his Hyborian Age, a lengthy discussion of the various nations and peoples that form the backdrop of the Conan adventures. The author's love for setting stories in the historical past led him to create an alternate version of world history, one that resembled in many ways our own ancient times but allowed him to make up things as he went along. The history of the Hyborian Age alone is worth the price of the book.It's impossible to adequately summarize every story, or even most of the stories, contained in the collection. A few worth noting include &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword,&quot; where King Conan of Aquilonia thwarts a coup attempt with the help of a long dead sorcerer. Another winner is &quot;The Tower of the Elephant,&quot; which finds Conan as a thief attempting to steal the wealth locked up in a malefic temple. &quot;The Scarlet Citadel&quot; and &quot;Black Colossus&quot; work so well because the two stories give Howard the opportunity to write extremely involved descriptions of huge battles against a background of magnificently executed scenes of phantasmagoric weirdness. Even the lesser tales contain enough flashes of brilliance and imagination to keep the reader riveted to the page. Conan battles giant apes, evil alien beings that turn humans into shrunken dolls in a magical pond, a vicious god preying on decadent citizens of an ancient city, and slays frost giants in pursuit of a goddess, all without batting an eye. Swords flash, armies clash, women fawn, sorcerers cast spells, and Conan wins the day in his inimitable taciturn style. All of the stories move at a lightening quick pace.Sure, a few of the stories here follow a rather formulaic structure, but that doesn't make them any less entertaining. I think there's a tendency by some people to sneer at fantasy books and stories; they argue that the simplistic writing style and predictable plots do not inspire readers to peruse REAL literature, and to some extent that claim may contain grains of truth. But as Patrice Louinet makes clear in her introduction and analysis of Howard's Conan stories, this author was an extremely intelligent, well read individual who infused his stories with elements borrowed from Bulfinch's works on ancient and medieval history. As for simplistic writing style, you won't find much of that here. Howard routinely uses elevated prose in the construction of his stories, and while he's no Clark Ashton Smith or H.P. Lovecraft in terms of OED inspired vocabulary, his language still rises much higher than you would think.The only problem I had with the book concerned Louinet's assessment of Howard's Conan canon. I haven't read much about the underpinnings of writers like Lovecraft, Howard, and the other fantasy writers in the 1930s, but I always suspected the success of these authors rested heavily on the Great Depression. Howard wrote about a warrior of great physical, mental, and moral strength, perhaps, because a man with such traits was necessary in a time of great social turmoil. American audiences yearned for stories that created worlds where bread lines, bank closings, and starvation didn't exist. Moreover, they longed for characters that could triumph over seemingly insurmountable obstacles with nothing more than their native abilities to fall back upon. Anyway, read these stories. All fans of fantasy/horror/science fiction should pick up a copy of this book immediately. I can't wait for the next volume."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"In a society in which self-conscious irony has become standard in virtually every form of entertainment, these stories shine with the blinding light of 100% sincerity. This is pulp fiction elevated to the level of myth. Howard's hero moves through, and dominates, the Hyborian Age in much the same way that Beowulf and Odysseus do in their own, older, more respected, myths.Conan is a character hewn from the fabric of saga and legend; dark, dangerous, unpredictable, as much an embodiment of the forces of nature as a human being. His world comes alive as a wildly imaginative patchwork of ancient and medieval history, filled with haunting references to our own past yet existing as a independent world as lushly alive as any in fantasy.These stories have been more influential and imitated than practically any others in genre literature. But they have never been duplicated. Howard's prose is shocking in both its power and diversity, frustrating attempts at either imitation or parody. Sharp, hardboiled sentences drive home the fierce brutality of combat. Vivid, often lyrical, passages describe the sprawling majesty of the Hyborian world. Darkly ominous writing depicts the creeping horror of otherworldly sorcery.If you know Conan only from film, comics or pastiche novels, you don't know Conan at all. Read Robert E. Howard's fiery words and discover some of the most potent, most primal, fantasy ever written."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"First, let me say that this is one of the most important books to be released in a long time. Howard was more or less totally out of print when this book came out, which is utterly ridiculous; he's one of America's best authors/poets, he more-or-less defined the Sword &amp; Sorcery genre... and even if you're too uptight to consider his writing classic (which it is...), these are some &quot;good yarns.&quot; Yarns that nobody has been able to top in 60 years. His writing -takes- you to these places with a blend of unresistable exoticism and brutal, grim realism. And finally we get the original texts. I've compares some of the stories to the de Camp edits, and there are a LOT of changes. Surprisingly, most of them are stylistic--and I wouldn't say they're improvements over Howard's. De Camp was just a meddling fool.Ok, so it's not quite a complete package yet. There are two more volumes that have yet to come out. But if they are -anything- like the one I am holding in my hand, this is by far the most complete collection of pure REH Conan the world has ever seen!Not only does this edition have the first 13 Conan stories (in order of composition), but it also has the poem, Cimmeria. Everywhere I look online, this poem is missing its last stanza, but not here. And we get a small note about its inspiration from Howard. Moreover, this book finally puts into publication the synopses and fragments (at least, the ones pertaining to the stories herein) we've all read about online, but that few have gotten a chance to see. They're more exciting to read, somehow, than the completed versions by de Camp and Carter.And we get MORE treats: a second final draft of the Phoenix on the Sword, which provides more exposition about the Hyborian Age and Conan's character. As a general rule of thumb with Howard, the more the better--because these are all short stories, edited down to the most compact packages possible at the behest of his contemporary editors. But his writing is so tight to begin with, that a spare paragraph or line of explanation is pure gold to an audience who isn't purely interested in the action--and it's not enough to bother anyone who is.I was also pleased to find his &quot;Notes on Various Peoples of the Hyborian Age,&quot; which I have been unable to find elsewhere, but which was also a lot shorter than I thought it would be.Basically, this is Ultimate Conan. The tales are captivating... a real treat, as others have described. And finally we can get EVERYTHING relating to them, in their pure form, in a nice package, and with copious illustrations (they aren't as bad as one fellow described them... but they aren't Frazetta either).Thanks, de Camp. You screwed everything up; Wandering Star and Del Rey will take it from here. Thanks guys, for all your hard work!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"It's not a question of artwork. I like Schultz just fine. He may not be to some people's tastes, but Vol 2 and 3 will have different artists. I personally think it's cool that Del Rey kept the artwork; it's a classy move, one you don't often see in TPBs anymore.Nor is it a question of packaging. They ended up running the original artwork of the artist who appears on the inside. A bait and switch would have been to run a Frazetta cover and have different illustrators inside. The book is nicely packaged and has a great retail price. 98% of the people who buy it won't notice the niggling little things that may or may not be wrong with the production.No, what an online review really should be all about is the fiction, the stories, that Howard wrote. They get under your skin and make you want to jump around. It is impossible to calculate the influence of Robert E. Howard on the world of fantasy. And these stories have been inaccessible for far too long--over ten years!Now, they are even better. Presented in the order that Howard wrote them, and with fully-restored text, to boot. Now that's a project that deserves some attention. This is Howard's most famous work, and it took a lot of people's blood, sweat, and tears to get them out for public consumption. This is an auspicious time, quite possibly the beginning of a Second Howard Boom!Howard was an original. He is often imitated (badly) and never duplicated. He was lightning in a bottle. Read these, the true Conan stories, and you can see for yourself why Howard is considered one of the greatest adventure writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Finally, Conan presented as Robert E. Howard intended. If you were hooked on Howard by reading the old Lancer/Ace versions of Conan, you ain't seen nothin' yet. The Del Rey edition presents Howard's stories as he wrote them, no editorial interference, using the original typescripts whenever possible. For me, it was like reading Conan for the first time.Not only do you get thirteen Conan stories, but also several fragments/synopsises and a rough draft or two, an interesting look into Howard's creative process. Also included is Howard's &quot;Hyborian Age&quot; essay, which outlines beautifully the world in which Conan lived, a couple of maps drawn by the author himself, and a few other goodies.The book is beautifully packaged with fine illustrations by Mark Schultz and an introduction by Howard scholar Patrice Louinet. I can't wait for the next volumes!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This is just a wonderful wonderful book. Robert E. Howard can virtually grab you by the collar and drag you into his stories with his breath-taking prose. His style isn't purple, but is dynamic and powerful. You'll want to return to this book again and again.Patrice Louinet's \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Hyborian Genesis\\" are wonderful essays, the kind of thing that should have appeared years ago, but didn't. As editor/essayist he deserves praise for his work on this incredible volume.Conan was one of Howard's most commercial constructs, and by this time Howard was so developed as a prose stylist that \\"breath-taking\\" does quite literally describe his incredible style. This material is simply wonderful.Looking down the list of stories, I know the reader will find many fine tales here. Things Howard did later became sword &amp; sorcery clich&eacute;s, but Howard did them first, and when he did them they were new and fresh. He took the adventure story and combined it with the tale of supernatural horror-and he did it incredibly well. The reader will get a thrill from the stories in this volume.\\"The Pool of the Black One\\" is one of my personal favorites from this group. As it is Conan's intellect as well as his physical strength that elevates him to the position of captain of the pirate crew.\\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" is a powerful, emotional story. The passion between Conan and Blit is intense, and the tragedy of the story's ending is just incredibly moving.\\"The Tower of the Elephant\\" is a classic in the field. Its intricacies are amazing, considering the straight-forwardness (seemingly) of the plot. For a mostly off-stage character, Yara is incredibly menacing.\\"The Phoenix on the Sword\\" is, of course, the masterpiece that started it all. Plus, the reader gets to see the last two drafts of this story-surely a treat.\\"Iron Shadows in the Moon\\" is another personal favorite. The introduction is especially dramatic, even for Howard. We immediately begin to empathize with the female lead, and the menaces are varied and awe-inspiring: the carnivorous ape, the pirates and finally the living iron statues. This tale packs a triple treat.The public may not have been breathlessly waiting for this package of unadulterated Howard tales, but it should have been. Buy two copies, because you'll wear the first copy out with repeated readings in no time at all."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"When I first heard about a book collecting the tales of Robert E. Howard's swordsman Conan I was very encouraged. That a noted artist like Mark Schultz (a friend of mine) had been approached to provide the illustrations I knew this was was going to be a beautiful book. When the limited edition hardcover finally saw print I ponied up the hard cash and didn't hesitate for a minute. The book is magnificent. The pure Conan tales without the stain of what passed for editting all those years ago are gone, and this is Mark's best artwork yet. Later, when he told me about the deal to get this gorgeous book released in a trade paperback, I waited, patiently. Again, I was amazed at the care that went into this new mass market edition.First up, it took too long for this to happen. Having read the old Lancer editions with the stunning Frazetta cover art I've always wanted to see the heavy handed editting by Lin Carter and L. Sprague DeCamp exorcised from Howard's original stories. I've never cared for the idea that someone can &quot;fix&quot; another writer's &quot;mistakes&quot;. It's the height of arrogance to assume such an idea and to follow through with it should be a punishable crime, especially if the author is dead and gone and consequently has no say in the matter.The other wonderful element that sets these tales apart from previous editions is the dropping of the artificial fabrication of the character's chronlogically shoehorned adventures. This was created to give Conan a linear path, so to speak, but it was not how the original readers read his tales. In this edition and the following two volumes the reader today gets pure Robert E. Howard and now has the opportunity to read the tales in the order in which they were published. This is done with profound respect to the author. This is the Conan that the imitators can't write about. In defense of Mr. Howard, why would anyone want to read the imitators over the original? Was there a better writer of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes than Arthur Conan Doyle?For the dissenters who prefer the fiddled with versions over the originals, well, there's still eBay. For those of us who've read the powerful work of Robert E. Howard without the tinkering (which it never needed to begin with) we now have Del Rey books and Wandering Star publisher to thank for bringing this version to the bookstands across the country. It's about time!!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Robert E. Howard stands alone as the Father of Sword and Sorcery fantasy adventure. There have been many -- far too many -- pastiches over the years of his essential S&amp;S character, Conan the Cimmerian, by inferior authors. This has done REH the disservice of blurring (if not obscuring) his real literary achievement in this genre.This book is the long-awaited reintroduction and revitalization of &quot;pure Robert E. Howard.&quot; It represents the work of several Howardian scholars over years of effort. As an added value, the book's annotations and scholarly discussion by Patrice Louinet -- and the inclusion of some unfinished REH fragments and a variation of &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; make this a necessary book for any Howard collector or any serious student of his work.If you have never experienced the power, the poetry, the marvel, the vividness, or the vitality of Howard's work -- then I envy you the initial pleasure and awe of that remembered experience. For those who have read the sundry imitators as well as some true Howard -- this is the book to sharpen your awareness of the differences. Don't accept imitations -- this is the pure stuff! A must have, must read/reread for any REH enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"If you love the fantastic tales of David Gemmell, Michael Moorcock, Poul Anderson, even H.P. Lovecraft; or if you're interested in exploring the roots of fantastic fiction which led to the modern epic masterpieces by Tolkien and Brooks, then The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian by Robert E. Howard is an addition to your library that you can not live without!Decades before Tolkien and Brooks had created their imaginary worlds of Middle Earth and Shannara, Robert E. Howard was spinning tales of Conan the Cimmerian set in the Hyborian Age - a meticulously developed world set in our Earth's distant past. Philosophizing that barbarism is the natural state of humankind, Howard's Conan tales are violent action-filled stories that will definitely please fans of Gemmell, Moorcock, & company. Given their weird and supernatural elements these tales will also thrill fans of H.P. Lovecraft, the Cthulhu Mythos and weird fiction in general.As stated in other reviews here on Amazon - the most exciting thing about this book is that it contains original tales by Robert E. Howard (and Howard alone) exactly as the author intended them. Other volumes of Howard's Conan tales were marred by the additions and \\"corrections\\" of editors as well as the inclusion of non-Howard stories written to fill in the blanks in Conan's career. This books is pure Robert E. Howard.Pure Howard means that between the pages of this book you will find tales of high adventure, bloody action, and magical sorcery. Howard's style is poetic and highly visual. His Hyborian Age vividly comes to life and immerses you in a world that is at once fantastically otherworldly and at the same time strangely familiar. These tales are great fun to read and are a superb example of the best of Fantasy, and more specifically, of Sword and Sorcery. Pure Howard also means that these tales are a product of the era in which they were written - they are NOT \\"politically correct\\". This is not meant as a negative critique but rather as a simple warning. Some readers may find passages of Howard's writing to be sexist or racist.Physically the book itself is very impressive. In spite of the low cover price this is not a cheap paperback by any means. It is sturdy and should withstand years of repeated reading. The artwork by Mark Schultz is, for the most part, excellent; a few drawings here and there are lacking in detail or bravado, while others (especially the full page drawings) are simply fantastic. Both the introduction and the essay by Howard scholar Patrice Louinet are superb and as much essential reading as the stories themselves. The extras - including Howard's background history \\"The Hyborian Age\\", rough and unfinished drafts, and Howard's maps of the Hyborian world all significantly enhance the reader's appreciation and enjoyment of Howard and HIS Conan.I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy sword and sorcery and dark fantasy. However, even general fantasy fans will find much of interest here."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"While there already is a review highlighting the Kindle versions problems, it deserves repetition. The Kindle version lacks the illustrations and what makes this more regrettable is the fact that the description in the Kindle store took the description from the original paper copy and talks up the missing illustrations. There is also a forward in each book that is written by the illustrator discussing his work. Without the illustrations, the main factor for purchasing what are mostly public domain stories is lost."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Is it good for you? No, but it tastes wonderful! Conan stories are fun romps through strange and hostile environments filled with endless ultra violence and beautiful women with little to no clothing. The underlying theme is the wild barbarian versus the civilized peoples of the world and the weirdly unnatural forces of the cosmos they sometimes attempt to harness. The wild inevitably prooves to be more virtuous than the civilized. Conan sometimes even takes on the gods themselves.Conan, while uncomplicated, prooves to be a compelling hero. In many ways, his personality is more like favorite old horses than any human I've known. His simplicity is what makes him lovable, since he's quickly understandable. He's a powerfully built man, with straightforward manner, who lives by his wits and by the sword. He likes wine and women. He has few material possessions save his weapon, be it a sword or sometimes a battle axe and armor. You know immediately who he is and what he's all about.Each chapter is an individual story, easily read in a sitting or two. They're largely independant of one another, only occasionally alluding in passing to each other. Each adventure brings him through ups and downs. In one story he might be a king, in another he's a pirate, in another, a thief or a hunted member of a defeated army. Throughout them all, Conan is indomitable. His army smashed or not, Conan remains alive.Equally fun is the lack of consistancy in environments. In his travels, Conan encounters steamy jungles, unexplored oceans, lost temples, tropical islands, ancient cities, deserts and snow covered peaks. It creates a sense of a vast world filled with the ruins of civilizations which predate humanity, lost knowledge, and unknowable mysteries. It stokes one's imagination.All in all, I can't be happier with the book. Unfortunately, snobbish readers will immediately turn their noses up at Conan. Feminists will hate him. English professors will despise him. He'll never win a Nobel prize for literature. That's okay, though. They miss the point. Conan stories are a joy to read. Howard accomplishes what he set out to do. Isn't that the essense of good writing?"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"A long-time fan of Conan, I grew up on the Lancer/Ace Books editions illustrated with covers by the great Frank Frazetta. That was all I knew of Conan at the time, and I enjoyed the books immensely, although even then I realized that some the books and stories were not written by Mr. Howard and that those were less powerful and effective than the original stories. But like many readers, I bought in to the chronological sequencing of the stories Lancer and their editors, L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter had come up with.It was only with these complete, unedited, original editions that I realized what I'd been missing, and how much the Lancer/Ace editions had misled Conan fans. The stories were not written in chronological order, Howard had not created short pastiches to link story to story, and not all the stories were as Howard wrote them! Some had been significantly altered, and the titles changed as well. Of course this was easy to recognize in the books without Howard's name on them, but not as obvious in volumes of mixed stories.It was for this reason I highly recommend these modern editions of the ORIGINAL stories, and that all Conan readers, new or old, read the stories as they were written by perhaps the greatest pulp fantasy writer ever. Howard's words fairly leap off the page, and the prose, as Stephen King notes, romps and gallops at a great pace, dragging the reader along breathlessly. Although Howard at times can be rough to read (his racial attitudes were those of Texas of the '30s, unfortunately), the good completely outweighs the bad and puts to shame any edited versions, cover stories by other authors, or lame Hollywood adaptations.There is no substitute - read these terrific and original editions, and enjoy! They're essential additions to any fantasy library."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Like most people I have seen the Conan movies and enjoyed the \\"in-your-face\\", Nitchze style of the films. Anyone who liked them will most likely enjoy the books as well. In spite of that, those movies were not my impetus for reading the Conan book.In my personal endeavors in learning to be a fantasy author myself, I came upon the fact that there are generally considered (very generally) two types of fantasy:1) High Fantasy: These are fantasy worlds more akin to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", or \\"The Chronicles of Narnia.\\"2) Sword and Sorcery: These are stories where the protagonist is generally not someone who is a magic user and must pit muscle, bone and steel against the mystic forces of the world.I had read a lot of things that could be deemed high fantasy and once I discovered its existence, I felt a need to be able to reach through the veil of sword and sorcery to be able to understand it better. This led me to the writings of Ron Howard who is credited by many with the invention of the genre.After some research, I discovered that the author had in fact killed himself before his writing became better known. I assume this is what led to many other writers either finishing the Howard stories or adopting the world of Conan as their own and sort of making their own little additions to the world.After some research however, I was able to discover the fact that this book (and only just a few others) is comprised wholly of stories written by Howard himself. In addition, there is a great section about the various human races of the rich world Howard has created. Lastly, there are also some great hand-drawn maps showing the geography.Be prepared. This world is richer than you could ever imagine. Despite the films starring Arnold, there is nothing stupid or mutton-headed about Conan or the way he was written. This collection of short stories gives glimpses into the life and endeavors of one of the most iconic figures in all of fantasy.\\"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\\" may not be high fantasy, but it certainly is high adventure."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I read Conan books many, many years ago, and found them to be great fun and a great way to relax from my usual reading of literature and science. I saw this collection and gave it a go, and I'm glad I did!The original Conan, not the one of films or of other authors than Howard, is a entertaining character, and there is a preface to this book which sheds light on the author, and his writing which is an excellent addition ot the read.I'd put these original Conan stories against anything in the genre.Buy without any reservation, it's worth the price."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Year's ago I picked up a story called Conan and the Spider god by Sprague de Camp. I was pretty unimpressed. I had read some of the Barry Windsor Smith Conan comics put out by Marvel and had seen the movie starring Arnold Scwartzenegger; I had even watched the animated Conan the Adventurer on Fox as a kid, but I hadn't experienced the real Conan.Well here it is folks. This is the first of Del Rey's three volume Conan set which also includesThe Bloody Crown of Conan (Conan of Cimmeria, Book 2)andThe Conquering Sword of Conan (Conan of Cimmeria, Book 3).There are a mix of tales here; some are great. Other tales are mediocre at best, but they are the original source material! Some of these haven't been printed since they appeared in Weird Tales in the 1930's.You get:The Phoenix on the Sword (five stars)The Frost-Giant's Daughter (five stars)The God in the Bowl (five stars)The Tower of the Elephant (five stars)The Scarlet Citadel (four stars)Queen of the Black Coast (four 1/2 stars)Black Colossus (three stars)Iron Shadows in the Moon (three stars)Xuthal of the Dusk (four stars)The Pool of the Black One (three 1/2 stars)Rougues in the House (four stars)The Vale of Lost Women (two stars)The Devil in Iron (three 1/2 stars)I'm an avid reader, and Robert E. Howard is certainly one of the more entertaining writers I've come across. He is a master of the action sequence and perhaps only Edgar Rice Burroughs (Tarzan) can give him a run for his money. If you enjoy Conan, I highly suggest picking up Howards other stories as well.The Savage Tales of Solomon Kaneis a great place to start.Finally, if you would like the entire Conan set in one volume you can getThe Complete Chronicles of Conan. However, I can't comment on the quality of The Complete Chronicales of Conan book as I have not yet held a copy myself."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Overall - I really enjoyed this first volume of the collected short stories of Robert E. Howard and his magnificent creation; Conan the Barbarian. There was not a story in the collection that I was bored with or disliked and I would heartily encourage those who enjoy the fantasy genre to delve into these stories and explore the roots of what started the genre that we enjoy today. The only faults that I have with Howard's writing are the prevalent sexist and less prevalent racist attitudes that appear throughout these tales. I did find that I was able to overlook these flaws as a product of the attitudes of the general populace at the time of the stories origin and therefore could enjoy the works for their literary merit and the quality of the entertainment that I received from them even though I personally would have found these same ideas fairly offensive at times if present in modern day literature.Cimmeria - This is a one page poem that sets the tone for the book very nicely. It is very descriptive in giving color and setting for the stories to come.The Phoenix on the Sword - Excellent story to start the book. Set later in Conan's life after he is King of Aquilonia, this story is about a plot to assassinate the great King Conan. The setup and pacing are very nicely done and there is an excellent battle scene as well.The Frost-Giant's Daughter - Another fine tale, if the rest of the book keeps up at this pace, I'm in for a treat indeed. After a fierce battle in the arctic North, Conan meets a woman who he is driven to follow seemingly to his death. Howard's prose and descriptive narrative are fantastic as the Frost Giant's Daughter leads our hero through the frozen wastes.The God in the Bowl - Not quite as good as the previous two. Conan is caught while attempting a robbery and falsely accused of murdering a man who lies dead in the building. Most of the story revolves around the investigation of the murder. The end is decent though , and I still liked it overall.The Tower of the Elephant - The most action packed story in the book so far. Conan enters the mysterious and perilous Tower of the Elephant to steal a powerful gem from a sorcerer. There are many unexpected traps surrounding the tower and the action is pretty much non-stop.The Scarlet Citadel - King Conan leads his army into battle to assist a fellow Lord. Conan however is duped and taken prisoner after a massive battle. This one started out a bit slower than most of the others, but maintained my interest level none-the-less. There are some good dungeon crawling scenes and a fantastic final battle that makes this story really rock!!Queen of the Black Coast - Conan joins some sea-farers while being chased by local authorities in order to escape. I liked the change of pace in this one as it is a sea-faring adventure as opposed to the land-based battles of the previous ones. The crew finds a mysterious river and decides to travel up it to find the treasures that legend says are hidden somewhere up its poisoned waters.Black Colossus - This entry in the collection puts Conan at the head of an army. The story starts out a bit dry, but things pick up as it goes along and the battle scenes are quite entertaining.Iron Shadows in the Moon - Conan and a freed slave girl journey to a supposedly uninhabited island where they find a mysterious temple and a band of pirates awaiting them. Along with these perils is a beast that might be more than a match for Conan.Xuthal of the Dusk - Conan and his female companion wander through the desert to find a strange city. They meet a beautiful woman who rules the city and desires Conan. Foul deeds cause the disappearance of Conan's woman and he must search the dark recesses of the city to find her. Howard creates a couple of very eerie and spooky scenes in this one that have a very good horror novel feel to them. It is a good example of the range that he has in his creative process.The Pool of the Black One - This is a rollicking action-packed adventure-filled good time. Another that begins on the sea, Conan is taken aboard as a cast-away and the ship travels to a mysterious island that the crew ventures to in order to explore. Mysterious things are found there and the battle scene and finale are among the best in the book.Rogues in the House - This is a slower paced story in which Conan is hired by a noble-man to assassinate a priest. Conan is sprung from prison by the young noble and in return must break into the fortress-like home of the priest and kill him. An interesting side note for those that enjoy the Conan films is that in this story we see the character and a few of the aspects of the scene with the mirror monster in Conan the Destroyer.The Vale of Lost Women - In another change of pace, Conan is the war chief of a band of black jungle-type warriors. This one started off a bit slow, but the pace picked up and I enjoyed it quite a bit. My only problems with this one are the racist attitudes displayed in a couple of points in the story by Howard. Of course, in its day, I doubt anyone would have taken much offense at all.The Devil in Iron - A mysterious being has risen from the grave and resurrected a ruined city on a deserted island. Conan must find the woman who is the current object of his desires and escape from this cursed place with both of their lives intact. This was a good story from start to finish and a fitting way to end the collection."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This is a great book. I normally wait until I am finished with a book to read it but since this one is a collection of short stories I am reviewing it now. I am only half way through it and even if the rest of the book stinks I would still give the first half of the book 5 stars. If you like sword and sorcery books than you will love this one as well. I have read most of the books not written by Howard and enjoyed all of them and have read hundreds of the Conan comics. Howard's stories are very well written and enjoyable to read.Strongly recommended to fans and even to fans that just want to try out a good sword and sorcery book I can not think of a better place to start.I have the Kindle version and there is a problem. This book I believe had pictures or illustrations in it. At least that is the impression you get from the forward section of the book. My first impressions with Kindle books is you will miss out on this type of things. Even the book cover on this version is really bad. It takes up about 15 to 20% of the screen and is in such poor resolution that it is almost pointless. I do not get this as I have out of copyright books from other sources that have much better pictures than the books you pay for. I really do not understand this practice. But this is still a minor point to me so I am still giving this book 4 stars. Would be 4.5 but there is no way to do that. The text is 5 stars and the Kindle really is a great screen to read off of."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The Conan stories by Robert E.

How I long for the old Frank Frazetta covers that used to bless the cover of Conan books."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"IF you are sick and tired of the over-blown LOTR hype and fed up with the hordes of Tolkien rip offs, this is the book for you. Howard is THE fantasy craftsman of the 20th century. He predates even the supposed father of fantasy Tolkien. The truth be known, Howard had success before Tolkien and this collection of Conan stories shows us why. While there are some duds here, classics like the Tower of the Elephant and the Phoenix on the Sword are gems of fantasy literature. Howard creates in Conan a character of savage fury, intelligent humor, deep honor and free spirit. It is a refreshing reminder of a style of fantasy without the angst ridden common man hero archtype. Conan is a man with personality and life that has very rarely been matched in fantasy since.While it is true that Howard allows a certain amount of sexism and racism to creep into his work if you look for it, the true theme that prevades much of Conan - Howards study of the degredation of civilization and the battle between barbarism and ordered society is what really stands out in most of the work and indeed in Conan's thought and action.If you prefer heroes who exhibit human qualities and needn't ride into the sunset ona white stallion at the end of the day, look no further."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I've collected many copies of old, worn out, out of print paperback books that had Robert E. Howard's Conan stories...edited and co-authored by Lin Carter or Sprague de Campe.I love those books...and cannot stand the modern ghost-writers, like Robert Jordan. Let alone what people have done to the Conan story with regards to the movies, though as far as Barbarian flicks go, I do like Arnie's first Conan movie...Anyways, this book is superior to the old out-of-print books I already owned. Howard's stories are published as originally published and in the order of publication. No re-organizing, no editing, no creative writing of the editor. Pure 100% Robert E. Howard's Conan.This book is the best purchase I've made in years!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"You've probably read about swords, damsels in distress, vile creatures, and foul magic, but you've never experienced it through the eyes of a barbarian until you read the works of Robert E. Howard.Concept:Del Rey compiled the original works of Robert E. Howard along with some of Howard's notes, drafts, and maps. This is the ultimate collector's gift for any fans of Conan the Barbarian or anyone who wants to read about a fantasy character who lives every second of his life.The stories included are:- The Phoenix on the Sword- The Frost Giant's Daughter- The God in the Bowl- The Tower of the Elephant- The Scarlet Citadel- Queen of the Black Coast- Black Colossus- Iron Shadows in the Moon- Xuthal of the Dusk- The Pool of the Black One- Rogues in the House- The Vale of Lost Women- The Devil in IronThere are also quite a bit of notes from Howard and an interesting article about how he was suffering from writer's block. He wanted to create a character that lived for the moment and the Conan stories basically wrote themselves, almost as if the great hero was talking to Robert E. Howard about his adventures over a campfire with some ale and a large slab of undercooked meat.Writing StyleConan is epic fantasy. The world feels solid with its own cultures, philosophies, and history. The settings are fantastically imagined. The battles are exciting, bloody, and vicious. The creatures are spawned from the darker parts of the unknown, similar to H.P. Lovecraft. Because these are short stories, some of the characters are one dimensional, but all of the characters in the stories fit together nicely.CharactersConan is larger than life and we can view civilization through the eyes of a barbarian who doesn't care to understand laws or the greater good of society. Conan wants what's best for Conan. The night before a seemingly winless battle, all of the soldiers are scared to death. But Conan is hungrily gnawing on a joint of beef without a care in the world. He can do this because the meal is right in front of him, and the battle is tomorrow. Conan rarely thinks about tomorrow, worries about things out of his control, or dwells on past mistakes. Conan lives for every minute of the day, and that's something that we can all learn from him.Feminists...... need not apply. These stories were written in the 1930's and most of the women in the stories are all well endowed helpless damsels for Conan to rescue or conquer.ActionConan battles wizards, soldiers, armies, demons, beasts, assassins... Conan will also kill someone because they were foolish enough to keep something that Conan wants. The action is visceral, bloody, and engages the reader.MaturityThere's violence, scantily clad maidens, and violence, and scantily clad maidens, and more violence and more scantily clad maidens. Because these are epic action stories, the violence is simple and to the point and there isn't anything graphic or disturbing in these books. It's ok for teens.OverallThese are great reads. Some of the stories are repetitive (Conan slays a monster to rescue a damsel) and some are better than others, but these are classic stories and will be enjoyed by any fans of epic fantasy.Buy it if you're a fan of the Conan movies, comics, or other Conan stories.Buy it if you love epic fantasy and you want a writing style that's to the point, but still manages to be epic.Buy it if you like modern fantasy and want to read a classic.Avoid it if you love strong female characters.Avoid it if you hate violence.Avoid it if you like your good guys good and your bad guys bad... there's plenty of gray here.I'd also recommend this book to people who are depressed or stressed out. Epic fantasy is a good form of escapism and you might be able to learn from Conan. Enjoy that big slab of beef that's right in front of you. Enjoy every drop of that ale that's in your mug. Your problems are farther away than you think."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I saw Renee Zelweger and Vincent Dinofrio in The Whole Wide World and was fascinated by the story of Robert Howard. My only contact with the Conan stories have been through contact with the late 20th century caricatures rather than the author's original works. Having felt that Conan has become such a cultural stereotype, I wanted to see the source material.Howard portrays Conan as a man outside of the civilization of his time. Cimmeria is portrayed geographically as being where Scotland is today, only at some remote time in Prehistory before the forming of the North Sea. His normal costume is a silk loincloth and a sword. When it is cold he will take up a red cloak and in battle, he often adds chain mail.In Black Colossus, Howard describes him as tigerish, elemental, and untamed. His profession in these stories is predominantly a mercenary. When he can't find work fighting, he tends to resort to thievery. Occasionally his leadership skills propel him into the role of King, Pirate Captain or War Chief, but his direct approach doesn't find a happy home in situations where diplomacy and discretion are important traits.He appeals to women for his elemental nature and his protective strength. Women of his acquaintance normally wear fairly revealing and diaphenous clothing that they tend to lose a lot. Nudity seems to be a fairly common situation for women of his time since this lack of attire seldom causes much of a stir.Then there is the swashbuckling. Do not read these stories if you are not a big fan of it. Conan tends to fight his way out of most situations, and the combination of his large broadsword and his amazing strength causes a lot of bloodshed and dismemberment. I had to take these stories in small doses for this reason.The end of the book has some really wonderful items for those who want something more. The editors have included an early draft of the first Conan story, The Phoenix on the Sword, an untitled draft, and a couple of synopses written by Howard. There are also some writings by Howard on the Hyborian Age, the mythic time he created for these tales. These added touches make this a wonderful book for the more serious reader. However, all fans of this genre will find these stories essential reading. The black and white illustrations by Mark Schultz are wonderful additions to these stories which bring the Hyborian Age to life."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Howard create the genera, and he remains a key writer.

I understand pages sometimes don't get separated during manufacture, but, when it combined with the pages also being folded in such a way to cause the book to grotesquely bulge open in the middle, it was rather irksome.

Robert E. Howard simply has a way with words that is undescribable. No way of detailing this other than take my suggestion and buy the book, but I will try.Howard gives us one of the most riveting characters of all time, Conan. And he take him across lands that we merely dream of. One story, \\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" is an exceptional masterpiece. A twisted romance that in which Howard lets Conan find a love as ruthless as he is. I will not go on to say anymore, except it is one of two stories that has brought a tear to my eye.Conan isn't allows a hero, or the most loyal friend, neither is he sensible at times; however, what Howard does with him will leave you in believable sense of awe and disbelief.BUY THIS BOOK> H.

The character has become that iconic. These are the first chunk of stories written by the man who developed the original character. If all you're familiar with are the various later, non-Howard Conan knockoffs, reading this collection will be like whiskey after water.The best of these stories have an elemental, primal ferocity to them -- not merely in the characters and events, but in the prose style itself -- that remains unmatched despite literal thousands of imitators. The worst of them -- and you can watch Howard's efforts decline, as he slowly realizes that Conan is a cash cow, and starts using pseudo-lesbian whipping scenes to substitute for quality writing -- is bad enough that you can understand why Conan tales are as sometimes-mocked as they are (\\"The Vale of Lost Women\\" is possibly the worst title for any story, ever). The few bad apples in here aside, the best of these stories are unmatched, and some of them (\\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" springs to mind) have been fairly hard to find for a good while now.This collection would be immeasureably better if they had cut out some of the fluff materials (the howard draft manuscripts, etc., while interesting, take up far more room than they need to) and included more of the later stories, especially \\"Red Nails\\" and \\"Beyond the Black River,\\" especially as many of the supplemental materials refer to stories that aren't even in this volume. I understand why they're dividing the stories over multiple volumes -- you can sell a lot more books that way -- but one large hardback \\"Complete Conan\\" is long overdue."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"What more can be said after 100 positive user reviews, with only two negatives which are either nonsensical or idealistically motivated, to convince you that this is a top quality book? The editors have done the heroic service of bringing the original Howard Conan stories back into print and in their original sequence for the first time, with no editorial tampering. Moreover, the stories are brought to life by the excellent illustrations of Mark Schultz, which shimmer with their own creativity and capture a sense of motion perfectly fitting the classic Howardian action sequence. Each section is preceded by a small vignette of the section's climatic episode, whetting the reader's curiosity and drawing him forward like tantalizing carrot. Top marks for the quality of the production.As to Howard's stories, I admit I was completely unprepared for this American Homer. Howard's writing style is simply marvelous with a poetic flair and vividness unmatched in the pulps. He wields a rich complex descriptive vocabulary that is almost unbelievable for someone of his years. Howard was like the Shelley or Keats of fantasy literature. Howard's writing is far more literary in quality than either A. Merrit or Burrough's, his nearest literary progenitors. The dialogue is sharp and entertaining. Howard is master of many moods, alternating from gritty realism to the high, courtly style typical of Dunsany or Vance.As to the individual stories, they vary in quality in terms of plot and imagination, as might be expected, but just about every one is entertaining and has its own great points. The stories are interesting for the variety of types of plot and settings employed by Howard. Some stories are large scale battles with madcap action, such as Black Collossus and Scarlet Citadel. God in the Bowl is a murder mystery styled after Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue, as is Rogues in the House too. Queen of the Black Coast is a take off of Ligeia. Frost Giant's Daughter is like a phantasm, while Tower of the Elephant reads just like a typical Dungeons and Dragons adventure. The best stories are to the front of the book, while the later stories begin to repeat themselves somewhat. The editors explain that Howard was writing quickly because he needed money during that period. In particular, Pool of the Black One is really weak and simply regurgitates plot elements from Iron Shadows in the Moonlight. In both a youth is tortured by large, black hawk-faced men. In one the tormentors are turned to stone, while in the other the youth is made into a statue. In both Conan slays a corsair chieftain to become leader of a pirate ship! The best stories feature poetry and prefatory songs, like the famous preface of Phoenix on the Sword, immortalized by the Conan movie. (Know, O prince, that between the years...)One downside of the stories to me is the pointless eroticism on nearly every page. The act of a female disrobing before Conan is tedious in its ubiquity. Howard casts a wide net, attempting to appeal to many varieties of fetishism. I'm not sure whether this represents Howard's own motive or a general marketing device of the pulps, which were the soft porn of their day. There is no frank sexual content and some barbaric activity is appropriate, but it gets a little too sleazy in its obvious lascivious intent.A second negative point in my opinion is a slight lack of imagination in the monsters. Almost all the badies are oversized garden creatures. Giant spiders, snakes, etc. And whatever the foe, Conan always prevails simply by hacking it to death. Never a cerebral solution to a problem. But then again, that's Conan.Another charming dimension to these stories is the philosophy and symbolism that are woven into the text--this is no mere fluff! There are many discussions of religion and literature that ring true in the real world. Xuthal of the Dusk has subtext about the decline of America--amazing how artists always see their own time as having fallen from a golden age. Lost Women has an interesting message that was stunningly echoed in the movie version. In short, these stories entertain at many levels.There are reverberations of Howard throughout the subsequent fantasy literature. Vance, Leiber, all the Americans pay homage to this genius who invented Sword and Sorcery. And the similarity between Thoth-Amon's frantic searchings for his magic ring and that of Tolkien's Sauron is more than uncanny!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Know, oh prince, that beneath the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars . . . Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand . . . to tread the jeweled thrones of the earth under his sandalled feet.- The Nemedian Chronicles._The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian_ Volume I in the Conan of Cimmeria series consists of the earliest writings featuring Conan the Cimmerian by Robert E. Howard . Howard, a native of Texas, was an early contributor to the pulp magazine _Weird Tales_ and a friend and correspondent of H. P. Lovecraft. Howard was heavily influenced by ancient European mythology, particularly as it concerned the Celts, and used it to mold his unique fantastic swashbuckling heroes. Other influences on Howard include the writers Jack London and Sax Rohmer (most famous for his Fu Manchu character). Howard's tales are full of adventure and romance, but also show the grim realities of his heroic swordsmen. The character of Conan was based on ancient European mythology. Conan is a barbarian from the north (Cimmeria), and though in some of the tales he was to become a king, he did not fit in well with civilized men. Conan's philosophy is bleak, showing his love of battle and strength, but also his motivations are chivalrous. The stories show the conflict between the various races of prehistory, since the sinking of the continents of Atlantis and Lemuria into the oceans and the rise of the Picts. Most of the stories also feature a nubile female character, who Conan must rescue from evil men or monsters. The stories also reveal the conflict between the old gods, on the one hand there is Set (the ancient serpent and his cult that used to rule the world in prehistory) and then there is Mitra (the god of the civilized people) and Conan's dark god Crom (who is entirely indifferent to men). The stories also feature the black lotus (a plant which serves to drug men into stupor and madness) as well as ape-men, the evolutionary stage in development prior to men. Most of the stories take place in far away lands, as Conan ventures to seek his fortune and along the way encounters numerous scantily clad women who become his interest. Conan represents the finest of the old traditions of the Aryan warrior, as he battles evil men and monsters in far-away lands. Conan appears at once as thief, mercenary, pirate, and ultimately king. Many of Conan's traits are to be found in Howard's earlier character Kull (who was an Atlantean king).This book provides an excellent collection of the early Conan stories. It includes illustrations by Mark Schultz. The book includes the following stories and items:\\"Cimmeria\\" (a poem written in 1932)\\"The Phoenix on the Sword\\" (1932; a re-telling of the original Kull story \\"By This Axe I Rule!\\")\\"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\\" (1976)\\"The God in the Bowl\\" (1975)\\"The Tower of the Elephant\\" (1933)\\"The Scarlet Citadel\\" (1933)\\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" (1934)\\"Black Colossus\\" (1933)\\"Iron Shadows in the Moon\\" (1934)\\"Xuthal of the Dusk\\" (1933)\\"The Pool of the Black One\\" (1933)\\"Rogues in the House\\" (1934)\\"The Vale of Lost Women\\" (1967)\\"The Devil in Iron\\" (1934)The book also includes several drafts of stories as well as \\"Notes on Various Peoples of the Hyborian Age\\" and \\"The Hyborian Age\\", both historical essays showing the rise of the Hyborian age and the Hyperborean people after the sinking of Atlantis. The book also includes several maps as well as essays detailing the life of Robert E. Howard and his creation of Conan.These stories are excellent and highly entertaining. They are particularly recommended for those who admire the early history of Europe and the fable of Atlantis. This edition of them provides a unique opportunity for the fan of Howard to read them all in one place."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Over the years, Robert E. Howard's (REH) Conan stories have been muddied by an uncountable number of pastiches as well as occasional over-aggressive editing (let's just say REH was sometimes not too politically correct). And it has always been difficult to find his works collected in one place, or, at least gathered into several volumes. Hopefully, this is the start of a collection of the complete works of REH on Conan.What we are given here is largely pure REH, untouched by modern hands and in all his bloody glory. The volume collects about one-third of Howard's Conan output and has the bonus of collecting synopses of several of the stories, drafts, fragments, Howard's notes on the Hyborian Age and its people, maps, and even a Howard poem (\\"Cimmeria\\").Part of what is amazing about REH is the sheer volume of output he produced in a relatively short span of approximately 12 years. When you consider that in addition to his Conan work he was also cranking out westerns, boxing stories, horror stories, and nearly every type of adventure story imaginable, and doing it all on a typewriter where starting a second draft meant starting over at the beginning, it is phenomenal. Imagine what his output would be had he had access to a word processing program.A minor criticism: some of the illustrations. I generally love Mark Schultz's work, but his Conan is sometimes a little too modern in appearance or maybe even a little too \\"Prince Valiant\\" like. A prime example is the frontispiece. This image just doesn't evoke Conan for me. But the majority of the art in the book is great. A better depiction is found on page 297, now that's the Conan I know and love. Guess Mr. Schultz (who I do admire greatly) and I will have to disagree over some of his interpretations of Conan.Not all Conan stories are necessarily great. Producing at the pace he did meant that the occasional mediocre story found its way into print. I've always thought \\"The Vale of Lost Women\\" was one of his lesser efforts, and it appears Mr. Schultz, who also wrote the Forward for the book, agrees with me. But this volume also contains some of the best of Conan: \\"The Phoenix on the Sword,\\" \\"The Scarlet Citadel,\\" and \\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" among them.One thing that may be slightly confusing to new Conan readers, REH did not write his Conan tales in any semblance of chronological order and these stories are printed in the order of original publication. So in some stories, Conan is already a king while in others he is still pretty much a vagabond adventuring across the world. Previous efforts at collecting REH's works often insisted on placing them in chronological order. If you are new to Conan, just go with the flow. Understand that REH had no grand plan for Conan, in fact, he often claimed the stories literally seemed to just spring up, as if Conan were telling stories of his life directly to him.My only other minor criticism: I would have preferred that there be a hardback edition. I've always preferred hardcover to paperback. Still, this oversized paperback is definitely a quality effort. someone is attempting to do it up right. Hopefully, this volume will do well enough that they will be able to complete the reprinting of the remaining Conan tales.If you are a longtime REH or Conan fan, you have to have this book in your library. If you are new to REH and Conan, strap in, you are in for a wild ride. The world of Conan is a fascinating, thrilling one. Come see the master at work and you'll probably never again be able to read any of that drivel that passes for sword and sorcery these days."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"First, I must say that I am a woman. Many have found it unusual that I would love Robert E. Howard's work, but I do. I have all of his stories, and am grateful there are new editions to replace my poor crumbling paperbacks.As a writer of fantasy Robert E. Howard is a must read for any interested in the genre. We take for granted the acceptance of fantasy in literature today, but in the 1930's-it was not respected or looked on with any serious note. I am not saying Robert E. Howard was without flaws, but he could create such heat on paper in a few sentences that takes many a writer pages to achieve. His raw barbarian hero Conan goes from age 15 to aged king and his journey is never dull. It is the scope of imagination in Howard's writing that is wonderful. The freedom to be wild. We should never forget that as writers. As a reader, I relish Howard's tales of savage myth."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The first volume of Ballantine's Conan reprints the first 13 tales written by Robert E. Howard. In addition, there are more than 150 pages of extra material such as story fragments, maps, alternate versions of stories, etc.This edition is basically a mass market version of the very limited edition of the same collection published by Wandering Star press without the added art prints, slip case and cover art. However, you pay about $20 rather than $200 price tag for the limited edition.The only drawback of the collection is the cover design. It is a shame the publishers went for the black and gold marble pattern on the front and back of the dust jacket, rather than a more contemporary look, which addresses to the pulpy roots of the character. We are also deprived of the Mark Shultz cover painting, which is replaced with an interior art plate.The publishers would have done well to look to the hardcover collections of the Dark Horse's outstanding comic book series, which is the most faithful adaptation of Howard's work in any medium.A worthwhile purchase nonetheless. If only Ballantine would hurry up and publish the next two volumes as hardcovers."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This anthology consists of the first thirteen (in chronological order of when released) Conan tales, which most literary historians agree were the start of the sword and sorcery sub-genre. The tales are well written and enhanced by terrific illustrations by Mark Schultz. Those who grew up with the Schwarzenegger films will find Howard's Conan a much more complete character (actually the Marvel Comic book series captured more of the original essence). The stories are exciting though they were written in the 1930s. The collection also includes much more information on the Conan tales including maps, an untitled draft and several synopses of potential future tales. The Miscellanea and Appendix sections are fun to read during spare moments as fans will gain an understanding of how creative the author truly was, but clearly the exhilarating stories is where the superb reading experience is at as that affirms Mr. Howard's greatness.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I've never fallen in love as hard or as fast as I havewith these Conan stories.

Howard himself. This is all Howard, no Conan tales by later authors and no stories edited beyond recognition. Each volume has its own introduction, appendices, illustrations, and unfinished writings - all of which make it worth paying the cost of the book even if there was not a single story present. The overall package makes this the first of three volumes in the greatest and most comprehensive collection of Howardian Conan writings ever published.All three books present Howard's Conan stories in the order in which they were written, NOT the order in which they were published. Therefore \\"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\\" contains roughly the first 1/3 of the Conan canon. However there are more stories presented here than in the other two volumes because these earlier stories were shorter. This collection begins with a poem by Howard called \\"Cimmeria\\" which is not specifically a Conan tale but gives us some insight into the part of Howard's psyche from which Conan was created. The following is a list of stories presented here.The Phoenix on the SwordThe Frost-Giant's DaughterThe God in the BowlThe Tower of the ElephantThe Scarlet CitadelQueen of the Black CoastBlack ColossusIron Shadows in the MoonXuthal of the DarkThe Pool of the Black OneRogues in the HouseThe Vale of Lost WomenThe Devil in IronAll of the tales from \\"Phoenix\\" to \\"Black Colossus\\" are classics that are outstanding reads. After that Howard entered a period of financial desperation where he relied on formulas to put out as much written work as he could in the hopes of getting something published. As a result everything from \\"Iron Shadows\\" to \\"Devil In Iron\\" is of lesser quality than the bulk of Conan material. They are still worth reading. Even when Howard writes badly he manages to do it in an excitingly nonstereotypical way (i.e. Rogues in the House). If you just want to read some of Conan's best tales, read from \\"Phoenix\\" through \\"Queen\\" and skip the rest. If you are a Conan completist this is the place to start. Either way the book is 5 stars and eminently worthy of purchasing.But Howard's writing was about to improve dramatically in the stories represented by the next volume: The Bloody Crown of Conan."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I don't know why it never occurred to me to read the Conan books. I'm glad I finally did.Robert E. Howard does some great writing. Although the movies cherry picked a few of his concepts, you don't really know Conan if you haven't read these stories. I picked up the three books in this 'series' and loved em all. I say 'series' because it's really just a collection of disjointed short stories. Conan as a thief. Conan as a mercenary. Conan as a king. Conan as a thief some more, etc. It's not a continuous tale. I didn't really find this to be a detraction, though. It's more like we're hearing the tales of Conan told by a bard as the tales come to his mind.The great thing is that Conan is not your typical action hero. Generally speaking it's good if Conan is on your side but don't get any bright ideas about a glorious fight to the death. I'm sure many a commander in Conan's day had the following conversation: \\"Well, we're outnumbered 100 to 1. It looks like we die here today. We shall give them a good fight, though! Right, Conan? ... Conan...?\\" Meanwhile Conan is legging it through the swamp. A lot of the stories seem to start off with him having given the slip during some big battle gone sour. Conan's momma didn't raise no fool.There are a lot of good Conan quotes too. My personal favorite is one where someone is asking him if he's afraid of fighting demons. Conan explains that he hadn't met the demon that couldn't be beaten with a sword and that, \\"I don't go out of my way looking for demons, but I wouldn't step out of my path to let one go by.\\"That's Conan in a nutshell: he's not really looking for trouble, but there's a world of hurt in store for anything in his path that decides to give him some trouble. If it can be beaten, he'll beat it. And if you see Conan put his sword away and start running for it, you'd best start running too."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The sheer number of reviews should offer solid evidence of just how popular Robert E. Howard's creation Conan the Barbarian is. Though other writers have offered their take on this great character, to fully appreciate Conan one must begin and end with Howard. Nobody but nobody wrote sword and sorcery to equal Howard. I find it interesting all of the in depth analysis of both Howard and his work both pro and con. It's gratifying for any author to see his or her words generate so much discussion. Ultimately, though, I'd urge anyone reading Howard's stories to take the time to enjoy the tale. The ultimate goal of any story teller is to entertain. I believe that Howard understood this better than anyone. You can't miss with the fine collection."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This review is strictly for the audiobook version. Howard's stories will always rate 10 stars from me.When the good folks at Tantor decided to create audiobook versions of these stories, they must have actively searched for the one person alive who could not pronounce Cimmerian. Actually, Todd Maclaren mispronounces quite a few words in this collection, but none will so completely jar you out of the story quite like the constant sound of Cimmerian when it's pronounced sim-er-REE-an. I've also heard zam-or-REE-an (for Zamorian), as well as any number of normal, every day words that take several seconds to figure out due to the oddball way he says them. It is, in fact, so glaring that I've put Mr. Maclaren on my short list of narrators to completely avoid.I've kept my rating at 3 stars because I don't want to drag Robert E. Howard's creation down because of a lousy production. I think that Todd Maclaren has dragged it down enough already."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The Conan series is classic, bold, and entertaining reading that can be read over and over again. These are the original stories written by the late, great Robert E. Howard. Some stories in this collection make for small novels, others are just fragments of not-completed stories. What a literary genius Howard was and what a tragedy that he died at such a young age, and by his own had at that. These series (this being the first one of three) is a must for any Conan The Barbarian fan. This is the foundation for other authors work. From Robert Jordan to L. Sprague DeCamp, they took the ideas and basis of stories for their Conan books from this collection. I am glad that I hot all three books of Howards immortal tales and will be re-reading them time and again in the future!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Robert E. Howard was a genius. And while lots of people may like his horror stories, his stories of heroes like Conan and Solomon Kane show an aspect of humanity that gets underplayed a lot. All of those stories show a person who has no supernatural powers of his own, just the strength of his body, mind and soul and his steel against anything. And they never will back down, regardless of what they fight.This collection includes the original Conan story \\"The Phoenix on the Sword,\\" as well as classics like \\"The Frost Giant's Daughter\\" and \\"The Tower of the Elephant.\\" Fantasy fans, take note, because this was the birth of Heroic Fantasy, which predates even Tolkien's creation of Hight Fantasy.-Ahmed Al-SheikhAuthor ofWandering Djinn: An Anthology of Fantasy"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I have been reading Howard's stories for 35 years and re-read them all the time.

Howard's Conan following the order in which they appeared and not the chronological sequence by the late Lyon Sprague de Camp. Some are classics of the genre (a genre which Howard pretty created single-handedly): \\"Phoenix on the Sword\\" -- in which King Conan, surrounded by assasins in his bed chamber, one hand against the wall, a battle axe in the other says through bloody lips, \\"Who dies first?\\" \\"A Witch Shall be Born\\" has the classic scene of Conan crucified. John Milius really screwed this up in the movie. It has none of the power of the image Howard created. In \\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" you have Howard at the height of his powers and Conan's great love of his life (another scene that Milius copped for the movie to much lesser effect). If you love fantasy than these three books will make, along with Tolkien, a great cornerstone to any library."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Having finally gotten around to trying and loving Conan 2.0:Kull: Exile of Atlantis, I was ready to try the finished version, and once again Robert E.

However a couple sentences stand out for sheer stupidity:\\"Perhaps most disturbingly, Conan glorifies the Gordian Knot solution: The proper response to a complex problem is to grab a sword and brutally hack away until the problem stops moving. Some naive readers might imagine that such a policy actually works in the real world.\\"This is an obvious reference to Howard's fellow Texan, \\"W\\" the Barbarian, and while we cannot know what Howard would have thought of him, we can know what he'd have thought of this sentiment: this idiocy is why barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Earth to Washington Post: while NOBODY thinks that grabbing a sword and brutally hacking away until the problem stops moving is the solution to EVERY problem, anyone who thinks that it is NEVER the solution \\"is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.\\""},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Howard's Conan is a warrior and not much more. The common thread of all the stories is that somewhere along the way way Conan kills someone or something. It's pretty much that simple. Some of the stories are no more than a few pages, while others cover what essentially are multiple chapters. Most of the stories have a smoking hot woman who usually starts scantily clad and ends up completely unclad at some point - though sex does not feature (keeping in mind they were written in the 1930s). Conan isn't even the main character in some cases.Outside of the tales themselves, I found the introductory discussion of Howard and the development of the Conan character interesting. What was most intriguing to me, though, was the well developed history of Conan's world, written by Howard, which is included toward the end of the volume.Overall, if you take the stories individually, try not to link them much (despite the ever-present Conan), and you like the genre, you'll probably quite enjoy this collection. It's well written and loaded with exciting action. If you want the type of character development you get from novels, and even from the Conan movies, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This is great stuff, utterly action-packed! Howard has a wonderful sense of words, and--though he makes the occasional error in cognate reuse (e.g., \\"the courier coursed down the corridor\\")--he describes people, places, and events in jaw-dropping detail. You can faint from the splendor of the fabulously wealthy cities and places he word-paints ('limns', to use a favorite term of his). I could do without the all-too-frequent brutally detailed battle scenes, indicating precisely which archers and pikemen were positioned where and whose horse slipped in whose blood. Just when you're about to lose interest, rest assured that a ferocious dragon or wacky gorilla-monster lurks around the next corner. Oh, and there's some very good black magical humor, e.g., when one wizard, in the guise of an eagle, makes off with the head of a second wizard, whose headless body runs after him, muttering curses. You've got to admit that that's imaginative. I witthold my sixth star because of the uneven nature of some of the stories: indeed, the earlier tales seem to flow better than the later ones (n.b. that Conan's character chronology is unrelated to Howard's authorship chronology). Also, the dialogue occasionally seems silly or stinted: it's hard to believe that a barbarian--even though we know he's thoughtful and good-hearted--would engage in such lengthy monologues (all but monologues, I should say) while supposedly \\"conversing\\" with other characters. His words sound like what one would write, not like what one--a barbarian, moreover--would say. But never mind these nickety-pickety nitpicks: this is great, great stuff. After enjoying these, you may want to look into the other volumes (but of course!) and Howard's other works: Bran Mak Morn, Kull, and Solomon Kane. The last of these has adventures such as battling voodoo demons in darkest Africa, chasing vampire queens into forgotten cities, and engaging in swordplay with the enchanted skeletons of murdered sorcerers. Aah! That's the ticket!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"After comparing some of my old conan novel titles with the titles found int he 3 books of this series - there are some titles that I couldn't find in this 3 series of books. It is true that Sprague de. camp might have written some of these titles (one of the books doesn't make the author of the writing quite clear int he case of \\"drums of tumbalku\\", and possibly others). But I'm not sure since one reviewer stated that there were unfinished short stories. So they could be here. anyway, here is a listing of stories that I couldn't find in these books under the same or different titles (my conan collection is not complete btw, although I do own a lot of conan books):drums of tumbalkuthe hall of the deadrogues in the housethe hand of nergalthe bloodstained godthe snout in the darkhawks over shemthe road of eagleswolves beyond the borderblack tearsthe flame knifeAs I said, my collection is not comprehensive, so there may be other books that have stories written by Robert Howard (the master), that may not be listed in these books. But then again, since I don't have these 3 books and can only go by what people write in these reviews, then I can't say for sure. Nor am I sure abou the \\"short stories\\" and what title, if any, were given to them.I haven't read conan in years. But from my memory, I think I liked most authors. No author was able to capture the magic of Robert Howard's writings. The closest that came close was maybe Robert Jordan (he even made the same type of spelling mistakes that robert howard made). But no author was able to capture the subconscious imagery which people could identify with, which may have made these writings so famous and endearing int he first place. For example, the giant collossus banging at the door (reminiscent of the angry dad trying to knock down the door), or the demonic woman - sucking the life force out of men and turning them into stone (possibly an analogy of the emotional vampirism of some women).The only author who I think that did not write anything that resembled Conan was \\"Steve Perry\\". The style of writing is so different from that of other Conan books, that I simply did not recognize it as Conan (women were respected, people were too friendly, Conan was a talkative person, you had tons of weird creatures all over the place like it was a smurf village, etc etc).And yes, people may complain about Sprague de Camp, and even Lin Carter. But it has to be remembered that these were devoted fans and researchers. Without them, the Conan revival might have never happened."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Conan the Cimmerian turned out to be a much better book than I foresaw. A series of short stories, placed in the order of their creation, they really do show us a cross-slice of Conan's life. Young thief, assassin, pirate, noble and King, he was everything you could think of.The setting is loose and wild. Robert E. Howard refused to pin anything down with too many details or solid facts which gives him a lot of room to play with. Also, while there is magic it is treated was respect and no little fear. Seems only the bad guys use it, so it can't be used by Conan to get out of problems and traps. He has to use his brains and his brawn. Fully illustrated and with tons of extras in the forms of maps and material never before published, this is a great find."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The original text of Howard's stories in the order they were written. Very nice. Sparse art complements the stories nicely."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Wanted to re-read the Conan series and am very pleased with the new editions.A few minor complaints:1) The stories are collected in the order Howard wrote them. While it's generally understood that the 12-volume Conan paperbacks were a hackjob, they did get one thing right - I think the series reads better when you can see Conan develop as a character. I recommend buying all three volumes of the new editions and read the stories in the order presented in this chronology, especially if you've never read them before:http://www.rehupa.com/rippke_chronology.htm2) The editors were such purists that they didn't see fit to provide us readers with a decent map. Instead, we get something that Howard scrawled on top of an outline of the European continent. It's useless.3) I could've done without most of the extras, and would've preferred to have all the stories compiled in one volume instead so I could have saved some money.Other than that, a job well done."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I always thought of Conan and Tarzan as being characters cut from the same cloth. Both are warriors who've attained an extreme level of physical perfection approaching superhuman, both rely on their primal nature but between the two I considered Tarzan to be the more unique so I endeavored to read through the entire Burroughs series. To my surprise I found the writing mediocre, sometimes laughably bad and gave up after the fourth book. So now I realize that one big difference between Conan and Tarzan is that Conan's stories are actually tremendously good. I'm sorry to say that I didn't even recognize the name of Robert E. Howard prior to reading this book which is a shame because he's arguably the father of the swords and sorcery genre. Much of fantasy fiction and roll playing may have never existed were it not for Howard and Conan.Rather than compare Robert E. Howard to Burroughs he would more aptly be compared to his literary contemporary and friend H.P. Lovecraft. Both created a rich imaginative genre, both specialized in short stories for science fiction magazines and both were incredibly talented writers underappreciated during their times. Howard and Lovecraft wrote with a poetry that approached legendary writers like Rudyard Kipling. Tons of his ideas were cribbed from Lovecraft including some very Lovecraftian beasts and similar names of locations and characters. If someone had told me that Conan stories contained creatures from other dimensions I would have groaned but Howard makes it all work. There is so much Lovecraftian influence that one could imagine Conan living in Lovecrafts world several millennium earlier. One creature that Howard seems to be obsessed with is enormous snakes as reflected in the Schwarzenegger film, it seems like about half the stories feature a humongous snake.Howard's Conan is both simple and complex. He has a brutal, relentlessness and a single minded aggressiveness that makes him nearly unstoppable in one on one combat even with monstrous otherworldly foes. Twice in the book a villain begins to gloat and pontificate only to get a sword in the belly before finishing a single breath. When Conan battles nothing is held back; even biting isn't out of the question. There seems to be no beast so terrifying that Conan will not engage when his back is against the wall. To his credit Howard keeps Conan human and in one story the barbarian knocks himself unconscious when he drunkenly walks face first into a wall as he's being arrested. On the other hand Conan can be a brilliant tactician when leading forces and as anyone who saw the Schwarzenegger movie knows he eventually became a king. In fact the book opens with him already king with subsequent stories jumping around his chronology. Being a wanderer Conan generally makes associates rather than friends which makes sense for someone who never stays in one place. In one story Conan forces his way onto a ship and strikes up a partnership with the crew even fighting alongside them against attackers. However, after the crew of his ship is slaughtered to the last man he switches sides no harm no foul. It's not that Conan isn't loyal it's just that he's pragmatic and why cry over spilt milk or a dead crew. He's most certainly not a classic hero and even engages in thievery up on occasion.The one glaring issue in the book is some ugly racism particularly in the story \`The Vale of Lost Women'. Blacks are described in often very unflattering ways and Howard makes it very clear that Conan is only interested in white women for whom he repeatedly risks his life. Racism was also employed by Burroughs and Lovecraft and really is an unfortunate sign of the times. Sadly, it's not much worse than Disney or Warner Brothers cartoons of the 1940's. The book finishes off with an extremely well done analysis of Robert E. Howard and his most famous creation. One thing that will stick out in my mind was the meager amount of money he made before his tragic suicide at 30 years of age. His stories are more than just monumentally influential they stylish and poetic and deserve to be grouped among the list of great classic fiction. Unreservedly five stars."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian is a collection of Robert Howard stories describing episodes in Conan's life. These are arranged in no particular order and cover the gamut of Conan the King to Conan the Thief. It turns out that although Conan is known to us as \`The Barbarian', he was something much more than that. In the stories he comes across as a force of nature. He is unstoppable by man, wizard or demon. He comes from a simple, warlike people and has no education. And yet he learns quickly and his ferocity in battle is balanced by a fairness and even kindness to those at his mercy. The astonishing thing about the stories is the high level of discourse. Consider, for example, this pronouncement from Conan in the story Queen of the Black Coast: \\"Let teachers and priests and philosophers brood over questions of reality and illusion. I know this: if life is an illusion, then I am no less an illusion and being thus, the illusion is real to me. I live, I burn with life, I love, I slay, and am content.\\"The Phoenix on the Sword is a story of the perils of kingship. Conan, at this point a king, has to put down a rebellion of his barons. Statecraft and politics are recurring themes in the stories. The ideas are much more sophisticated than simply bashing heads or the struggle of good versus evil. Readers who like fantasy will find much here to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"If you plan on playing the massively multiplayer Conan game and you don't know much about the setting which ranges from jungles to plains to mountains to seas, or the pantheon of gods and the cults that worship them, or the diverse political associations of the secondary characters, or what the original Conan was really like, then this is an outstanding introduction to the rich, compelling fantasy world and the complex hero who adventured in it.For example I was surprised to learn of all the different 'careers' that Conan had including king, mercenary, thief, and even pirate.Howard's storytelling style is great and, like the quests in the game, the stories themselves vary, from large scale strategic battles to tales of supernatural intrigue where Conan is on his own.If you want to get a feel for the 'backstory' of the game world and have a richer deeper gameplay experience, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I have all three in this series, and after having to sift through so much Robert Jordon, L. Sprague D. Camp, and other fanfiction writers and being dissatisfied with previous compilation editions that tried to edit Howard into chronological order, I am glad to now have an original Robert E. Howard compilation in the order that the stories were written. The caliber of the work contained inside these books is jaw-dropping. Not only was howard incredibly imaginative and skilled impressively in submersing the reader's attention, but he also seems to have had an uncanny knowledge of certain things about man's prehistoric past that we are only discovering now to be true in the realm of archeology and science. The only problem with this series is that Del Rey skimped big-time on the glue.I was planning to thumb through these books for all eternity, and I know I paid a cheap price for the nice looking, thick books. But one came apart after just two reads- my brother and I both read the first one I got.

The Bloody Crown of Conan will contain the full length Conan novels, and Bran Mak Morn: The Last King will contain the Bran Mak Morn stories.Hopefully someone looking for the actual text stories will find this useful, as I had to look to the Del Rey site to differentiate them from the comic books (oops Graphic Novels).Great reading, with some good illustrations. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I read the Frank Frazetta covered ACE Conan books back when I was 14 and thought they were great.

I give this book my highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This book is awesome! I have previously read a great deal of fantasy novels, including various Tolkien works, a massive amount of Forgotten Realms and what not. But Robert E. Howard's Conan, surpasses them all.

Other major fantasy authors should read Howard's work like a Baptist does the Bible."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The stories are great, but the Kindle version has no artwork.

This will be a book you will not put down until you read it cover to cover and will keep with you forever; don't count on selling it on Ebay once it gets a little musty.REH is one of the most compelling writers we have ever had on this earth; reading his stories is like hearing a symphony with no false note. He is to adults what Rowling is to small children.Admittedly, REH is a grim writer, and some of his stories may not be appetizing to some of you or considered politically correct in our place and time. But don't miss this. It is very affordable and one of the best $15 bucks or so you will spend in your life. I wish I could say I would buy back your book if you are not wholly satisfied (that's how confident I am you will like it), but unfortunately, I do not have sufficient resources and cannot make such a pledge."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Wow. I had no idea.Turns out that Arnold's portrayal of Conan in the early '80s flick isn't quite what the original author had in mind. While a \\"barbarian,\\" Conan is quick-witted and well-spoken. He just doesn't have much (or any) patience for the double-speak and hypocrisy of \\"civilized\\" society. The actual character of Conan is wonderfully fun to read about, even if his morality is often dubious (Conan sees nothing wrong in being a mercenary or pirate, or killing a man out of nothing more than ambition).The stories themselves are wonderfully written--filled with great visuals, never overdone, and compelling action. Another interesting thing about reading these stories for me, was that it made me realize that Howard and Lovecraft really were kind of writing about the same universe. I mean, most of Conan's stories are about Conan confronting some other-wordly, dark terror that has no place in a rational world; Lovecraft's Elder Gods could easily find worshippers in Stygia. Ultimately, Howard is more optimistic, as the terrors are overmatched by Conan's vigor and blade, but his blacks are still fairly deep-black, and it is easy to see why Lovecraft considered Howard a master of terror.The one complaint I might find about the collection (if find a complaint I must) is that a number of the stories are fairly repetitive in nature. Conan is new to some group which initially despises him. A great, grim need (e.g. an unnatural creature, or sorceror) arises and only Conan is competent to deal with it, so Conan saves the day and becomes acclaimed and powerful among the new set. Very often, a woman is also drawn to love him, often against her initial instincts. The rinse/repeat cycle becomes pretty familiar the third or fourth time you see it, but then I'm reminded that the original readers weren't reading these tales all in a row, but spaced out over a good deal of time. Still, it raises certain questions to the reader's mind, like how did Conan *lose* all of those pirate captaincies? And all of those paramours? Conan was Jim Kirk long before Jim Kirk was.Conan is an awesome character, and he figures into a collection of tales that are, themselves, awesome (if slightly repetitive). Howard writes stories that dip into the blackness of Lovecraft's inkwell, but his universe is brightened by the fact that man is able to overcome the shadows. Conan shows that there's some virtue to be found outside of civilized society, as the \\"barbarian\\" stands for unvarnished truth and unflinching action.A more-than-worthy collection of tales. I shall certainly pursue the next volume."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Exciting, savage, horrifying! Hands down, the biggest bang, the greatest thrill for your buck! These classic stories created such a popular commotion that book sales almost outstripped JRR Tolkien's &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Rings.&lt;/i&gt; Yet, these stories are so different from Tolkien's brand of adventure, that it's almost impossible to compare them. Whereas Tolkien's tales were written in a more sedate, classic style; Robert E. Howard's Conan tales connect with the darker side of the human psyche. Power, force, physical strength, fear, hate, futility, conflict, violence, triumph, exultation, and superstition. These stories are fast paced, triumphant achievements in story telling... whether in the fantasy or adventure genres. If you have not read these stories, you do not yet know the poetential of fantasy fiction -- and you are in for a real treat. These are some of the few fantasy stories that can actually be considered great, and they have influenced nearly every major fantasy writer for the last 60 years.Every conceivable bonus item has been included in this book... illustrations, rare information, original typescripts, hand drawn maps prepared by the author, etc. The most authoritative, comprehensive, and exquisite collection of these tales ever published.

The reminder of the book contains a miscellanea of unpublished drafts, maps and accounts by the author and friends.The only problem I see with this edition is the illustrations by Mark Schultz. Although some of them are good, for those of us already spoiled by the superb work of Frank Frazetta on the Lancer/Ace edition covers, these don't come even close. Besides, they are clumsily placed in relation to the text, often acting as spoilers of paragraphs ahead."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"REH's CONAN stories were a hit, inspiring &amp; opening the doors to a multitude of other fantasy adventurists. But unlike some other past fantasy works, these stories are still full of life. No imitators have succeeded in capturing even a spark of the essence of the passion, inventive imagination, and suspenseful atmosphere of Robert E Howard's CONAN stories.These stories are a thrill! Lush, rugged, decadent, and awe inspiring by turns, the detailed world-building is smoothly written in context, allowing the reader to be absorbed with the fast-paced action and dynamic characters.This may be a surprise for current leisurely fat fantasy book readers, but a pleasant one. Like a summer blockbuster movie, Howard gets to the point right of the bat, and his clear powerful prose keeps it moving enthrallingly. Courage and a length of sharp steel takes Conan -- and readers -- to many far exotic places and right into the fascinating thick of it.A particular favourite in this volume -- the 1st of 3 gorgeous collections -- is &quot;The Devil In Iron&quot;. It's a great example of some of REH's popular themes: haunting wondrous lost places, strong women in a harsh world, the error of confusing how civilized someone is with how smart and capable they are. Also, &quot;Black Colossus&quot;: an unnatural lust for power that resists even the ravages of death!All of them are great in there own way. And this edition offers treats for new and old readers alike, with original author versions of the stories never seen before and glorious new illustrations by the great artist Mark (Xenozoic Tales) Schultz!Plain and simply, a great read!"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This new Conan collection was well worth the wait. Editor Patrice Louinet has published the Barbarian's stories in their original order and with their original wording. No longer do readers have to wade through poor pastiches by later writers in order to enjoy Robert Howard's work. This book has the first 13 stories, as well as several early unpublished manuscripts. A fun read of a fascinating hero.Unfortunately, my two favorite Conan stories, &quot;Red Nails&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Black River&quot; are not in this text. Hopefully they will be published in a new volume shortly. But this book does have some true gems in it. Everyone should read &quot;Queen of the Black Coast.&quot; I also like &quot;Rogues in the House,&quot; even though it is not widely considered one of Howard's best efforts.But the real reason every Sword and Sorcery fan should buy this book are the excellent illustrations by Mark Schultz. The cover plate is wonderful, and the illustrations really capture some of the best scenes in the book.

Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand . . . to tread the jeweled thrones of the earth under his sandalled feet.- The Nemedian Chronicles._The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian_ Volume I in the Conan of Cimmeria series consists of the earliest writings featuring Conan the Cimmerian by Robert E. Howard . Howard, a native of Texas, was an early contributor to the pulp magazine _Weird Tales_ and a friend and correspondent of H. P. Lovecraft. Howard was heavily influenced by ancient European mythology, particularly as it concerned the Celts, and used it to mold his unique fantastic swashbuckling heroes. Other influences on Howard include the writers Jack London and Sax Rohmer (most famous for his Fu Manchu character). Howard's tales are full of adventure and romance, but also show the grim realities of his heroic swordsmen. The character of Conan was based on ancient European mythology. Conan is a barbarian from the north (Cimmeria), and though in some of the tales he was to become a king, he did not fit in well with civilized men. Conan's philosophy is bleak, showing his love of battle and strength, but also his motivations are chivalrous. The stories show the conflict between the various races of prehistory, since the sinking of the continents of Atlantis and Lemuria into the oceans and the rise of the Picts. Most of the stories also feature a nubile female character, who Conan must rescue from evil men or monsters. The stories also reveal the conflict between the old gods, on the one hand there is Set (the ancient serpent and his cult that used to rule the world in prehistory) and then there is Mitra (the god of the civilized people) and Conan's dark god Crom (who is entirely indifferent to men). The stories also feature the black lotus (a plant which serves to drug men into stupor and madness) as well as ape-men, the evolutionary stage in development prior to men. Most of the stories take place in far away lands, as Conan ventures to seek his fortune and along the way encounters numerous scantily clad women who become his interest. Conan represents the finest of the old traditions of the Aryan warrior, as he battles evil men and monsters in far-away lands. Conan appears at once as thief, mercenary, pirate, and ultimately king. Many of Conan's traits are to be found in Howard's earlier character Kull (who was an Atlantean king).This book provides an excellent collection of the early Conan stories. It includes illustrations by Mark Schultz. The book includes the following stories and items:\\"Cimmeria\\" (a poem written in 1932)\\"The Phoenix on the Sword\\" (1932; a re-telling of the original Kull story \\"By This Axe I Rule!\\")\\"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\\" (1976)\\"The God in the Bowl\\" (1975)\\"The Tower of the Elephant\\" (1933)\\"The Scarlet Citadel\\" (1933)\\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" (1934)\\"Black Colossus\\" (1933)\\"Iron Shadows in the Moon\\" (1934)\\"Xuthal of the Dusk\\" (1933)\\"The Pool of the Black One\\" (1933)\\"Rogues in the House\\" (1934)\\"The Vale of Lost Women\\" (1967)\\"The Devil in Iron\\" (1934)The book also includes several drafts of stories as well as \\"Notes on Various Peoples of the Hyborian Age\\" and \\"The Hyborian Age\\", both historical essays showing the rise of the Hyborian age and the Hyperborean people after the sinking of Atlantis. The book also includes several maps as well as essays detailing the life of Robert E. Howard and his creation of Conan.These stories are excellent and highly entertaining. They are particularly recommended for those who admire the early history of Europe and the fable of Atlantis. This edition of them provides a unique opportunity for the fan of Howard to read them all in one place."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This is Conan as Robert E. Howard both wrote and envisioned him. The dissonant bastardization de Camp and Carter engaged in by posthumously completing Howard's unfinished stories and converting other characters' stories into Conan stories even as they added pale pastiches into the mythos is here removed. Conan is just as he was originally and just as he should have always been. (As an added bonus, the editors have put Howard's work in the order he wrote it, thus letting us see his progression as a writer.) The entries range from mediocre (Devil in Iron, Xuthal of the Dusk, and a smattering others) to outstanding (Queen of the Black Coast, Phoenix on the Sword, Rogues in the House) with some worthwhile additions lying in between. Also included are some notes by Howard about his most famous character along with outlines, drafts, and fragments of other stories never completed by the Master. I'm still making my way through the series, so I won't review the latter books in Del Rey's reverent reissue of this great author's work. Nonetheless, if the editors' level of care and reverence exhibited in this volume is present there, then they will have done a fine job indeed."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Superb book. I've been a Conan fan for quite a while, but before I bought this book it was only through the Conan stories of authors like Jordan, De Camp, and others. Howard blows them all away. There is no substitute for the original. Howards writing is just so much more raw and elemental.While other Conan authors often strive to portray Conan as a roguish barbarian hero, I almost always find too much chivalry slipping through. In Howard's writing there is none of that scim of civilization on Conan. He is pure barbarism; bred in the highlands of Cimmeria and disdain of \\"civilized\\" men. The code of honor you might expect from other fantasy writings does not apply to Conan. He is certainly not evil, but neither is he good in the way Lancelot or Gandalf or any other fantasy hero is. He's more a force of nature than a man, and that is something I find extremely refreshing and engaging in fantasy. Nowhere is this better seen than in Howard's writings.This book is a collection of some of Howard's best Conan tales. Most are short, no more than 20-30 pages, but are excellently written. Commentaries on the work (some by Howard himself) offer insightful information into the mind of Conan's creator, a somewhat dark and disturbed individual himself. Definetly a must read for any fantasy fan."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"\\"Know, Oh Prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and [...] the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an Age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars...\\"~ Excerpt from \\"The Phoenix on the Sword\\"The saga of Conan is one of the masterpieces of escapist literature. Robert E. Howard's short stories of barbaric life in an age of high adventure still captivate the imagination of countless readers and strike within each of us a primal chord. Reading these stories, you feel huddled near a sputtering campfire on the wind-blown steppes and listening to Attila the Hun or Babur the Tiger recount heroisms of their youth. You share with Conan the glories of epic battles, the death-songs of clanging swords, the embraces of lustrous females and the adrenaline rush of the greatest Sword & Sorcery protagonist of all time.This particular anthology, \\"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian,\\" features the cr&egrave;me-of-the-crop of R.E. Howard's Conan fiction. \\"The Tower of the Elephant\\" is one of the greatest short-fiction pieces ever conceived and details a young, inexperienced Conan questing for a fabled jewel with Lovecraftian consequences. \\"The Scarlet Citadel\\" is a sprawling epic of dark fantasy with Conan caught between a battle of wizards and defending his crown. \\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" is both a classic adventure yarn and a brooding masterpiece on lost love set in darkest Africa. Finally, \\"The Black Colossus\\" is a mesmerizing collage of ancient curses, nameless sorcery, desert tribesmen, conquering armies and blood-drenched action.Lesser but equally entertaining stories include the first Conan story ever written, \\"The Phoenix on the Sword,\\" with Conan crushing a rebellion against his kingly rule, and the rapacious \\"Frost-Giant's Daughter,\\" based on Nordic mythology. There is also a chilling piece entitled \\"The God in the Bowl\\" that, in style, is a stage play and, in substance, is a horror story. Key moments from these stories are deftly illustrated by artist Mark Schultz who -- though not as talented as renowned Conan-illustrator Frank Frazetta -- captures the mood perfectly.For generations of fans, Robert Howard's Conan is the crowning pinnacle of reading experiences. If you have a teenager, young adult or a best friend who is unenthused by literature, I recommend buying them this collection. You will be surprised how easily these short stories will captivate them.Rating: ***** (five) out of ***** (five) starsHear the anvil of Crom, the chants of Stygian priests and tales of spider-haunted mystery."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I cannot tell you the influence Conan and Howard have had on me. Heck, I even run my own online sci-fi/fantasy e-zine and write some sword and sorcery stuff of my own! All for the love of Conan.I picked up this book to read on an up-coming flying trip and I've been delighted from the words \\"The Phoenix on the Sword.\\"A very good collection at an affordable price and all of it genuine Conan, straight from the horse's mouth, as it were."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"This review is about the 15-CD audio book by Tantor media. The CD set features an unabridged narration of the entire book \\"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\\", including the introduction and the 13 stories that follow. I won't bother to comment on the quality of Howard's writing; if you're reading this you're probably a fan of Howard and you can read all about what other people think of his stories in the reviews of the paperback version of the book. Instead, I'd like to mention a few things about the CD package and the audio recordings themselves.The CD package: A few things about the packaging annoy me. The box itself doesn't close cleanly, and I always have to fiddle with it to get both snaps closed. There are no inserts, just the CD's in clear plastic sleeves. The CD's have no identification of what they contain, they merely show \\"1 of 15\\", \\"2 of 15\\", etc. If you want to know what CD and track a particular story starts on, you'll have to make an index yourself. Worse, the stories don't always start on track boundaries, sometimes they start in the middle of a track. Other than those minor issues I don't have any gripes with the packaging, but how hard would it have been to have fixed those things?The narration: The narrator Todd McLaren does his best, I'm sure, but for me his voice is too high and light for the dark material in Howard's dialogue (\\"Rush in and die, dogs, I was a man before I was a king!\\"). The voice-over narrative (as opposed to speaking parts) should be in lower vocal tones to capture the grim and somber mood of the stories. The voices of the characters are passable, but not great; there's nothing about them that makes the characters sound distinctive or memorable. The entire recording is vocal narration; there are no sound effects or music.The pronounciation of 'Cimmeria': Okay, I admit this irks me no end. Conan's homeland is pronounced \\"Sim-AIR-ee-ah\\", not \\"SIMMER-ee-ah\\"! Ugh! Conan did NOT come from a country with a name that makes you think about cooking dinner. Cimmeria was a bleak land of cold, dark forests and fog-shrouded hills, where clouds cover the sky and the sun fears to touch the ground. The mood in Cimmeria is chilly, somber and grim, perfect for worshiping dark gods and breeding hard Viking-like warriors who live for the thrill of battle and disdain the soft ways of civilized lands. It is the land of 'Sim-AIR-ee-ah!' NOT 'SIMMER-ee-ah'! Crikeys, and I get to listen to 15 CD's of that mispronunciation. Every time he says it I correct him out loud just to keep the universe in balance. But, by Crom, I feel better for having vented my displeasure!So, why do I give the entire package 4 stars? Because if you want an unabridged narration of Howard's best Conan tales, you get it. All you have to forgive is the sloppy package production (I mean, really, not even a table of contents?) and a narrative tone that is less brooding than how I believe Howard meant his tales to be."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I bought this book because I had searched for any Conan story by Robert Howard for almost a year. It all started when I watched the first Schwartzenegger film and was blown away by the amazing narrative and monolithic storyline; I suspected the narrative had been lifted directly from the books, I happily discovered this to be true. After an extended search I came across this collection, bought it on impulse, and am extremely happy with it. The illustrations are a nice touch but find the work a bit uneven. I am also greatly suprised by Howards association with Wierd Tales and horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. His writing style is amazing, an educated and macho prose style best described as a combination between Lovecraft's own and Ian Flemming. His action sequences are particularly special as they communicate a real visceral experience, you can smell the blood and metal in his writing. Within the context of his contemporaries he can stand toe to toe with anyone, and I mean anyone without exception. It's a mistake to target this work to fantasy fans, with the exception of Tolkien I really don't like the majority of &quot;FANTASY&quot; writing. His work is like Tolkien in the respect that it is penned with a strong respect for history and mythology, incorporating enough of it into his narrative to grant it a sense of familiarity and weight. This is the kind of work that straddles genres and should appeal to far more than a predisposed genre based audience."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"All the original Conan tales in one book, and in the order they were written, finally. This collection is an exciting, fast-paced invitation into REH's Hyborian age, as the reader stands sword-to-shield with the fiercest anti-hero ever written, Conan the Cimmerian. Also, Schultz's illustrations throughout are wonderful. His realistic style illustrates Conan without copying Frazetta, but leaving no doubt who's swinging the axe or sword. This is a must for any Howard fan, fan of Conan, or of great action fantasy. I'll read and re-read these yarns until I wear the cover off. Then I'll buy another."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"Simply the best Conan anthology I've seen so far. There are nothing like the original Howard stories - fast-paced, with colorful characters, exotic settings beautifully pictured, and spine-chilling supernatural villians and fiends.What more could you ask for in a fantasy adveture collection?"},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"I first heard of Conan the barbarian when I was a kid and watched the cartoon \\"Conan the adventurer\\", a nice cartoon for kids but nothing like the real Conan. When the character appears in media adaptations (besides comics) he is often a hulking warrior who is vaguely Germanic and mainly uses his brawn in a situation. The stories but the legendary Robert E Howard however, show the original character. A proto Celtic warrior who uses his brains as much as his brawn to solve his problems, Conan is one of the most unique characters in fiction. The character floundered around under other writers and even the comics didn't always have a good version. The stories here however, are full of energy and passion. To read these stories is to enter the doorway into the mind of Robert E Howard, one of the greatest American writers."},{"Title":"The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian","review":"The first of three Del Ray volumes collecting Robert E. Howard's Conan stories, \\"The Coming Of Conan\\" presents exactly that, the Cimmerian anti-hero as Howard first conceived and developed him, as robust and elemental as he'd ever be, even when bogged down here and there by formula or lack of focus.Will those new to Conan-via-Howard want this over the later volumes, especially as the stories presented here hop around chronologically in terms of Conan's life? It is formulaic in places, like some reviewers here say, and there are a couple of misfires to be found. Yet it is also very diverse, presenting Conan in various times of life and in various parts of his mythical world, enjoying with vigor a life that is, as he tells a thief companion, \\"in noways tame.\\"People who know and enjoy Howard whether writing of Conan or any of his other creations will appreciate Del Ray's respectful treatment of his writing, very different from what Howard got in back in the 1930s (frequent rejections and slow payments of modest fees) and after his death (in the 1960s, many of these stories were rewritten by L. Sprague de Camp and sapped of much of their vitality). You get not only the stories as Howard wrote them, but an earlier, unpublished draft of the first-ever \\"The Phoenix On The Sword,\\" where we meet Conan having already \\"reached the ultimate border of my dreams\\" with the crown of Aquilonia, the most powerful kingdom of Howard's mythical Hyborian Age.For the next dozen or so stories, we see various steps of that journey, from the spider-guarded lair of an evil wizard to the blood-drenched deck of the pirate ship \\"Wastrel\\" to a mad city resurrected from its ancient doom. Some steps are more memorable than others, but together they make for a wondrously diverse and visceral experience.I think readers new to Conan will enjoy the variety of this volume enough to overlook some choppiness. After \\"Phoenix\\", there's a bit of a dip in the next story (\\"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\\", which many others love more than me) and a big dip in the story after that (\\"God In The Bowl\\"). Then Howard goes on a tear, beginning with the wonderfully weird yet dynamic and reality-grounded classic \\"Tower Of The Elephant\\" and continuing with \\"Scarlet Citadel\\" and the deepest, strangest story here, \\"Queen Of The Black Coast,\\" a tale that makes you believe in the power of true love even as it splashes the pages with gore and guts.If the stories after \\"Queen\\" betray a certain formulaic sameness, a common reliance on scantily-clad damsels in distress and climactic bouts with fearsome monsters, Howard's way of setting up the stories to their own specific locale and situation makes for great reading. Not only can he write a battle scene effectively, but he can craft some lovely word-scapes between them. \\"Iron Shadows Of The Moon,\\" a favorite of mine here even if it is one of Howard's less-original stories, has a wonderful moment where Conan and his lady are crossing an immense lake in a boat, and the drowsy woman feels lost in the infinity of stars both above her and reflected upon the water below.The weakest points in the book are still pieces that lovers of Howard and Conan will want to have, like \\"God In The Bowl\\" and the somewhat-suppressed \\"Vale Of Lost Women\\" with its gossamer-thin storyline and echoes of racism from Howard's own time. \\"The Hyborian Age\\" was an essay Howard wrote to detail Conan's world for his own reference and is a great cure for insomnia as it takes forever explaining next to nothing about the world as Conan found or left it.\\"Coming Of Conan\\" only features Howard's Conan writing up until 1933, when he apparently lost interest in Conan. Yet Howard would go on to write some of his greatest Conan stories, not to mention the greatest fantasy stories I've ever experienced. For newcomers to Conan who enjoy quality action fiction, Del Ray's later Conan volumes may be better starting points, being as they are generally more accomplished and accessible. But the foundations lie here."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"Okay, so we clearly see Sherri L. King's admiration of Laurell K. Hamiltons kick ass heroine Anita Blake, and also, Laurell K. Hamilton's sex-kitten kick ass heroine Princess Meredith. We also see Ms. King is a Buffy the Vampire Slayer (either/both Movie &/or T.V. Series) fan. But what we also see is a very talented and created individual who can take elements of both Joss Whedon & Laurell K. and NOT steal their work and try to pass of the creativeness of these two authors as her own.When I first began reading images of Buffy flooded my mind. As the story progressed it became clear Ms. King had, infact, read Laurell K. Hamilton and I began to dread I had purchased a (albeit GOOD) book imitating other GREAT books written by better authors. I am ecstatic to say I was mistaken. Yes, there are elements that raise the eyebrow (anyone notice The Travellor was eirily similiar the The Queen's Darkness? or that Cinder bares a strikingly similar physical description of The Killing Frost?) But alas, it matters not, all of Sherri L. King's characters come into their own. Besides a few nods to Anita & Buffy (gotta love that Browning) the book is entirely Ms. King's. Faced paced & action packed. If someone wasn't dying (and goodie, its typically the baddies) then someone is getting some action in the bedroom if you know what I mean. Whoa-yeah.Excellent characterization. For me personally, it is the most important aspect of a book. Well, that and the ability to actually write as if you are addressing an adult and/or literate audience (as, sadly, not all erotic romances do). I was becoming weary of the genre after reading a few godawful books recently. Desperate to find an erotic romance that dared to go beyond campy sex and/or dialogue so bad and patronizing that I often sought out a silk stocking not to bind myself to my bedpost but to hang myself from my chandelier. Won't name names ... I'll be good. . . . for now anyway.Basically, If you like the sassy-but-deadly wise-ass heroine's created by Laurell K. Hamilton and you can deal with the stoic faced tongue-in-cheek dialogue of Joss Whedon's Buffy - Well, this is the book for you. The lead character Cady Swann is a woman unto herself and darn if the romance genre, especially erotic romance, NEEDS a strong independant woman who can sink her teeth into nearly seven foot warriors and come out with, not only a wisecrack, but pearly whites still intact and grinning with girlish delight. And the men DO make you want to sink you your teeth... and visa versa (cough-cough).Anyone familiar with Johanna's Lindsey's ShaKa'Ani Warriors will want to read this one just for the hot men alone! Forget the fabulous heroine.I basically loved everything about this book. From beginning to end. I picked it up at 7:30am and finished it at 9:30am. Went online and purchased book II in the series. Now I have to wait (oh the agony) to continue the adventure. So will use my brain (and all the money in my bank account, le sigh) to buy the next four books now, tee-hee. Who cares if one is broke when they can escape to a world like this!!! *swoon*Whereas most books are great in and of themselves, I have a feeling the next chapter will be even better because all of the supporting characters in the first book where memorable and lovable. The pace of the book is fast but yet everyone has their time and you actually care when typically introducing other characters unrelated to the steamy action of the two main characters usually annoys me. Go figure.Love the heroine. Love the Hero. Love the supporting cast. Love the writing & the dialogue. I was completely enchanted & will be buying all things Sherri L King!Highest recommendations."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"This is one very hot read.

For anyone who loves a bit a humourous wit qirky comebacks very very erotic loves scenes and hunky masculine hunks this has it all..."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"I loved this book and I will definetly buy the rest of the series. It has everything I love in an erotic novel. Sexy men, wonderfully erotic sex scenes, and plenty of action! It was well worth the read. This novel blended blood/gore/action/sex into one steamy kick-ass novel! It is about a group of hunters that happen to be aliens, that track down demons and kill them. On earth this woman also has psychic powers and she also tracks and kills the ones that have started showing up on earth. That attracts the sexy alien hunters and they approach her about working with them because something evil is afoot...and so begins the horde wars."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"Get ready for a fast, hot ride into a world were the things that go bump in the night are real and there are amazing, more than mortal heroes who are willing to battle back the creatures of the night.I loved Cady and Sid's story, and the following tales are every bit as wonderful.But this isn't a sweet romance...it's a wild, wonderful, thrilling ride to true love."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"This fast-paced novel of about 42,000 words is the first in a continuing series that currently contains five books. King sets the action-adventure tone early in the story, introducing us to the heroine Cady in mid-battle. Cady's character is quickly revealed and we're given a swift introduction to the hero Obsidian as well. I was impressed both by Cady's Hispanic family heritage and the delineation of Obsidian's otherworldly qualities. Cady and Obsidian have a strong mixture of attraction and conflict in their romance; this nicely mirrors the conflicts in the greater world around them as well as their own interior conflicts.King begins to develop her complex world of Deamon Horde and Shikar Alliance at a more sedate pace, allowing us plenty of time to wonder about just what kind of adventures Cady and the others have in store for them as the story progresses. King's sex scenes are immediate, sometimes rough and well integrated with the rest of the story.King's artful introduction of secondary characters that practically scream for their own stories gives us a hint at what is in store for us in the following volumes. I look forward to more Gnostic-style good vs. evil fantasy conflict and more of her breath-stealing sex scenes."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"RAVENOUS is the first book in the Horde Wars series and as such sets the stage for all the books to come. It is from Ellnora's Cave and therefore you have some idea what to expect. Not only is it a very senusal read it is a very good story.Earth is in the middle of two factions. It is the battleground in a war against the Daemon Horde. The Shikar have battled the Horde for centuries. Now a human woman has come to the attention of the leaders of the Shikar. She is Cady Swann. When she was 15 the Daemons killed her parents and devoured her brother. Since, she has used the psychic powers she has, to fight the evil. She is able to sense the monsters and has learned to kill them.Obsidian is the leader of one of the best groups of warriors and has been sent to bring Cady to the center of the earth where the dimension they occupy is located. This arrogant male is stunned and his interest is captured by the beautiful, firey woman.Although the book was almost to hot for my tastes, the story was excellent and I had to buy the rest in order to see what happens. Each book is complete in itself. Each novel tells the story of one of the members of the Shikar.I liked the paranormal asspect and the plot is wonderful. If you like science/fiction fantasy with a hot sensual relationship, these books are for you."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"So this is the first book I have read along these line after reading Sherri King in the analogy Manaconda I absolutley had to follow up and read this.

He is contemplating his next move for his future. Those plans are cut short when a strong hand grabs his shoulder. Grimm has found him now he must return home to Shikar, a problem has developed. Grimm has been contacted by Raine a Shade, from the other side, one might say. Raine tells Grimm that a woman with empathic talents named Niki Akitoye is in grave danger and Tryton must be with his team when they rescue Niki. The Daemon Horde has surfaced again and is going after her. They must reach Niki, who is at this very minute on a plane to Seattle to meet-up with her daughter Jada. They are too late; the Daemon Horde has gotten to her first. The plane that Niki is on has crashed all aboard presumed dead.Niki in reality has been snatched midair from the plane and taken down into the earth beneath Egypt, near the Great Sphinx. In the dark, Niki runs for her life to escape a horrible and smelly creature that is right on her tail. With great effort Niki makes it to the surface with the Daemon appearing right behind her. It is about this time, that the group of Shikar warriors consisting of Grimm, Tryton, Obsidian, Cady, Emily, Cinder, Steff and Edge watch with frozen horror as the Daemon advances on Niki. With her amazing powers, Niki starts to glow with energy. She directs it toward the Daemon, killing it on the spot. At that very moment, Tryton is filled with a lust so powerful for Niki; it could rival all the past rulers of Egypt. Gods, what an ebony goddess she is glowing with all of her majestic powers engulfing her! Tryton is in awe! When these two finally get together the sparks will fly and so will your blood pressure. Their sexual aerobics are so hot, it will tease even the fish and all the creatures in the sea into procreating!LORD OF THE DEEP, The Horde Wars Book 5 is by Sherri L. King. As this reader closes this book and is writing this review, she is still taken with the emotional/sexual gratification this book imbibed. First off, let this reviewer say, bravo Ms. King, this is a superb addition to the Horde Wars series! This book could be a stand alone, but you will want to run out and buy the remaining series after reading this beautifully erotic and amazingly well executed story. The storyline will engulf your soul and tantalize the mind without mercy. The characters and the ongoing dialogues are what truly made this story come to life and will draw the reader right into the action.Tryton character is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking creatures you will ever want to lay your eyes on. He is sexually arrogant, proud, but most of all he is eternally loyal and loving. You just got to love a man that can pick-up a woman with ease and put her legs over his shoulders, while she is braced up against a door. Got that visional? Tryton also has a few secrets of his own that will be revealed in this book.Niki is a powerful empathic who's talents are wondrous to behold, with so much love to give both Tryton and Jada. Niki's daughter, Jada, is quite a handful with a smart mouth. Jada is just trying to get the attention and the love of her mother she misses terrible. When Tryton literally claims Niki it is some of the hottest and carnal love scenes this reader has ever had the pleasure of reading.Ms. King has brought together the cast of character from the previous books to unite against the evil Daemon Horde. Much more is revealed that was not disclosed in the previous books. The ending is the shocker and will leave you screaming for more of this fantastically written adventure into the Horde Wars series.Ms. King's ability to write one great story after another, with consistent grace and ease, is what makes her a beloved and much sought after author.

Do not walk, to buy your copy of LORD OF THE DEEP, The Horde Wars Book 5!Reviewed by Janalee, 2004Courtesy of Love Romances"},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"I purchased this book because the premise looked interesting to me and I read great reviews about it. Unfortunately, the explicitness of this book overshadowed the plot. I also had trouble believing that Cady and Sid were in love instead of just lust. The sexual encounters were numerous and very explicit. It seemed as though the majority of the book was about the sex that Cady and Sid were having instead of the war that they were fighting.This book is not a love story. A physical relationship between Cady and Sid is not treated as something special or sacred here. (They actually let people watch them!) Beware! The underlying plot is interesting but, the writing style is not for everyone. I won't be purchasing another one of these."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"If you like science fiction with hot sex scenes then you should enjoy this book. It is part of a series that I had to read all of them. True, they are a bit predictable but they were enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"I really liked Ravenous. There is a Buffy/Lara Croft feel to the heroine; she was completely kicka**, quirky and sexy, with a quip for any dangerous moment. I also liked that she was curvy and of a hispanic heritage. In my experience, I don't get to read that many Latina heroines. The hero was also nice to imagine: 6'10, brawny, long black hair and glowing yellow eyes. Scrumptious.There was lots of action and hot sex (even some exhibitionism). I thought it was a decent action story, if a bit derivative of Buffy in some ways in plot circumstances: instead of small CA town being invaded by demons, we have a small GA town; instead of the Hell Mouth, we have the Horde Gate, etc.Even with the similarities to other series or characters, it was still enjoyable and makes me curious enough to want to try the rest of the series. The next three books are about Cin, Edge and Tryton, but I'm most curious about The Traveler Grim.A good start to a series; definitely check it out if you're wanting some demon-hunting action, hot sex, and sexy banter/tension between the two main characters. The heroine is one tough chica and takes no prisoners. Loved her!"},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"I actually liked it... What got my attention was the cover, but what made me hesitate was the genre, erotica. I do enjoy erotica books IF it contains a good storyline and decent H/H. Maybe what I'm describing is more Paranormal Romantica than Erotica? Anyway, Ravenous definitely fit the bill. The heroine was sarcastic and funny while the hero was a serious alpha male (although on the mild side) with a great sex drive. Together, along with other Shikar warriors, they're determined to rid earth of the Daemon Horde. My only gripe is how quickly they fell in love. It seemed less than a week, but whatever..."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"This book was great! Lots of action (all types!) Especially great was the heroine, Cady, who was funny, smart, and a great combination of tough and feminine. The plot was fairly simple, not requiring a lot of backstory, but was still very engaging. I would have read it for the plot alone, though the erotic elements of this book were fantastic. I have already ordered the second book in the series. I only lopped off one star for some weak editing... and I think I was being a bit harsh."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this series. I've read the first three books and waiting only to read the other three or is it four more? She puts a story all together in both heavy intimate content and character building."},{"Title":"The Horde Wars: Ravenous (Book 1)","review":"I have read thousands of books and this is the first review I have written. Not because the book was good, rather the book was so bad I didn't want anyone else to cough up money for this. If you like nothing but sex and don't care if the plot is missing, well this book is for you. I warn you; even the sex scenes are lame. The back cover sounded interesting and the cover pic was great so I bought it, I wasted my money.I am a lover of books and I expect a book to be like a seven-course meal, but this was like chewing bubble gum- very little favor and does not satisfy the hunger.If paranormal is what you are looking for then try these good books: The Nightlife by Rob Thurman or Simon R. Green's Nightside books.If romance is for you try the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich.If you want a seven-course meal of paranormal romance then read Laurell K. Hamilton, Patricia Briggs, Kim Harrison, Lilith Saintcrow, J.R. Ward, Charlaine Harris, Rachel Caine's Weather Warden books, Katie MacAlister's Aisling Grey Guardian books, or books by Kelley Armstrong.I hope this helps someone looking for a truly good read. I would hate for someone else to lose his or her hard earned cash and be disappointed.

Not surprisingly, it feels dated as vintage 1960s [in fact, it was originally published in 1965, smack in the middle of the decade]. For it's time the ideas are fresh and anyone who is a Timothy Leary fan, will likely will be pleased with it. It includes saying (usually just a saying or a few per page) such as \\"Dropping out is the hardest yoga of all\\" (p125).

But my note is not a review, in fact. I write this note to remind you that the original tilte of this book in German is &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; not &quot;... and ...&quot;. &quot;Language is Home (Heim) of Being&quot; Heidegger said, and words are important, consequently! End of note."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"The sheer reputation of Heidegger's erudite -- and notoriously difficult -- treatise on the question of being often tends to inspire a sense of awe in its readers. Yet this reputation occasionaly makes critics and students fail to see many of the faults with Heidegger's work, and as a result, the book has assumed a greater importance than it actually deserves.The first major problem with Being and Time lies in the fact that its ideas aren't terribly original. I realize many reviewers will disagree with me on this point, but almost all of Heidegger's theories were initially noted by Kierkegaard and, to a lesser extent, elaborated upon by Dostoevsky in a few of his novels. Furthermore, those two authors not only defined the same problems as Heidegger, but they also had the good sense and intellectual curiosity to deal with the moral ramifications of their discoveries. Heidegger, as most readers of Being and Time will note, does not bother to examine the moral consequences of his postulates. Normally this would not be a problem, but given Heidegger's membership in the Nazi party, one wished that he examined this facet of his work. Philosophy does not exist in a vacuum, and as such, must be critically viewed in light of its social and political context.The second major problem I found with the book was the undue influence which German romanticism exerted on Heidegger. The ideas of the Volk have been largely discredited, and to praise a book which so clearly admires them seems downright absurd in this day and age. When the foundations of an idea become obsolete, so does the idea itself to a large extent.I do not deny the historical importance of Being and Time; I just hope that readers do not blindly admire it based on reputation alone."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"I stand by my former review. But I now no longer read Heidegger. If a reviewer cannot deduce the strong connection with Husserl that comes through in this book, then there is no point in reading it. For it is only reading it with this in mind that one sees Heidegger's own very complex relation with the, and his own, tradition. B&T; was, of course, rejected out of hand for publication by Heidegger's Uni. The reason it finally came through? Husserl saw in it a strange but important rejoinder to his own work. To not see this is to somehow idolize Heidegger into being 'the best thinker or whatever of the 20th Century,' which is just [crazy].I here give the book 1 star not because it isn't brilliant, but because people tend to read this work with glassy eyes--as if Heidegger could just rip himself out of his own background that easily. Additionally, B&T; seems to be either used as a whipping boy these days, or is just read poorly, if not revered as the work of a god, none of which I can stomach any longer. It is a brilliant work and you should purchase it. But instead of just purchasing it and listening to reviewers cackle on (including myself), take one of the other review's advice and read it with a companion."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Kudos to the translator for making the effort; certainly Heidegger isn't an everyday walk in the park. However, the difficulty in reading Heidegger's work is absolutely essential to fully Understanding how the inquery into Being is to be conducted. This recent translation lends too easily to the science of psychology, and is, hence, antithetical to the originality of Heideggerian 'brand' humanism. The profundity of &quot;being and time&quot; is to be discovered by the individual, by his own means; to use public language obliterates any hope of this."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"This book is pretty good. It asks what being is. I find the section on the problematic nature of the distinction between realism and idealism helpful. However I don't think, as some readers do, that this is one of the greatest philosophy books ever written. It is not on the level of any of Kant's critiques or the Republic or Aristotle's Metaphysics. The reason I think this is the case is that I find Heidegger's resistance to argument and rational discusion distasteful to philosophy. Notwithstanding, it is quite thoughtful and written so as to inspire anyone in the humanities to try and think about being and Dasein. It is also attractive because of its unique affect on our magical-mystical feelings."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"I am aware that Heidegger's BEING AND TIME (1931) is considered the most influential philosophical book of the 20th century. Jean-Paul Sartre himself admits its influence on his own, BEING AND NOTHINGNESS (1949). Yet perhaps every high-ranking German professor of philosophy is granted a halo because of the great stature admitted for Kant (1790) and Hegel (1830), two of the greatest thinkers of all time.Did Heidegger add significantly to German philosophy? I don't think so (nor am I alone here; the anti-Heidegger literature continues to grow, c.f. Dr. Tom Rockmore's recent book, ON HEIDIGGER'S NAZISM AND PHILOSOPHY (1992)). Was Heidegger elected to his post by a normal professorial process? No. Heidegger rose to his high post in German academia largely because he was a Nazi and the man above him was a Jew (Edmund Husserl). One often hears that Heidegger's work builds upon Husserl's work, but one never hears it from Husserl himself, nor really from Heidegger. That little myth was invented to downplay the fact that Husserl was kicked out because he was a Jew, and Heidegger took his place because he was a Nazi. Heidegger largely ignored Husserl's work. Husserl did not admire Heidegger's work. The two hardly ever spoke to each other again.The real problem with this book, however, is not its political history. The real problem is that it is an intensely famous book by an amateur in philosophy and it tends to be prized largely by those who also have a lesser grounding in Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel. The key issues of modern philosophy. Heidegger had a large following, almost as large as the following of Ayn Rand. But neither of these writers, by recent accounts, rises above the level of popular philosophy.For one thing, Heidegger claims to revive the question of Ontology, that is, the question of Being. His melodramatic justification is that Ontology is a long-lost science. But I see two major problems with his argument: (1) Ontology has a great history in philosophy, beginning with Aristotle and moving forward with Anselm and then to Hegel, but Heidegger downplays all this in order to pretend to be the first to raise the question at all; and (2) Heidegger contributes less to the problems of Ontology than any other philosopher in history who dealt with it.Actually, after a promising introduction, Heidegger proved only that he couldn't deal with the question of Being, and so he quickly changed the subject to the question of human beings - he used the term, 'Dasein, the only being for whom Being is a question.' From now on he will study, Dasein. For his followers this was great stuff. For the expert in philosophy this is an obvious evasion of the original question. Edmund Husserl noticed this right away and charged Heidegger with writing no Ontology but an Anthropology; a superficial study of human beings in the abstract. Husserl was right.Now, for some readers who don't know about Ontology anyway, the changing of the subject to Anthropology (the study of 'Dasein') is still a promising prospect. However, a closer look at Heidegger's theories of human 'Dasein' reveals an amateur effort. Heidegger decides that he will use new and hyphenated terms to describe his new subject-matter, such as, being-in-the-world, being-not-at-home, care, fallen, gear, and 'them.'In a nutshell, Heidegger sees the human being, the Dasein, as a thing like all other things in the world, affected by surrounding things. There are different types of things around us, e.g., useful things, broken things, scarce things, tools, gear, etc. Dasein takes a variety of 'attitudes' towards these things, including 'solicitation,' 'suppression,' and four emotions. Heidegger abstracts four key emotions: fear, anger, boredom and anxiety. For Heidegger, anxiety is the highest emotion because it 'honestly' recognizes the absurdity of reality.The relationship between existentialism and Nazism requires further exploration in the light of observations such as these.What are the moral consequences of Heidegger's abstract of the human being? Heidegger simply says that the right way to live is to be 'authentic.' Anybody can say that, but for Heidegger being authentic means one must not listen to 'them.' Who? 'Them.' We use the term in our daily speech, e.g. 'they say this,' or, 'everybody says that.' But the 'authentic Dasein' will not be swayed by what 'they' say.That is too easy, it is actually juvenile. What are the mature, political consequences of Heidegger's book? Ultimately, Heidegger is anti-technological. The world has gotten too technological, he says, and there is too much complexity in our capitalistic world. We should all go back to our simple roots, farm the land and live the simple life. In this way we can be truly 'authentic.'I wish there was more to Heidegger's philosophy, but there isn't really much more. Heidegger was clearly an amateur and was not an expert in the great Systems of this great science. If he wrote some promising works on Nietzsche, that is partly explained by the fact that Adolf Hitler prized Nietzsche above all other writers (and often cited Nietzsche's late anti-Semitic texts so often disputed by Nietzsche followers), and Heidegger at one time would do anything to please Hitler. It is further eplained by the fact that Nietzsche was not a Systematic philosopher, but largely an artist, a prose poet and a literary figure who also evaded the major challenges of philosophy.The main reason that Heidegger became famous was that he was the highest-ranking German philosopher from 1935 to 1945. He was widely imitated by famous writers around the world (as is common treatment for the highest-ranking German philosopher and heir to the chairs of Kant and Hegel). But how did he get his post? By firing a Jew (Husserl) and giving a Nazi (Heidegger) that job. This dirty pool is revealed by a closer look at the poverty-stricken results of Heidegger's petite-bourgeois ideology."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"I am aware that Heidegger's BEING AND TIME (1931) is considered the most influential philosophical book of the 20th century.

There are different types of things around us, e.g., useful things, broken things, scarce things, tools, gear, etc. Dasein takes a variety of 'attitudes' towards these things, including 'solicitation,' 'suppression,' and four emotions. Heidegger abstracts four key emotions: fear, anger, boredom and anxiety. For Heidegger, anxiety is the highest emotion because it 'honestly' recognizes the absurdity of reality.The relationship between existentialism and Nazism requires further exploration in the light of observations such as these.What are the moral consequences of Heidegger's abstract of the human being? Heidegger simply says that the right way to live is to be 'authentic.' Anybody can say that, but for Heidegger being authentic means one must not listen to 'them.' Who? 'Them.' We use the term in our daily speech, e.g. 'they say this,' or, 'everybody says that.' But the 'authentic Dasein' will not be swayed by what 'they' say.That is too easy, it is actually juvenile. What are the mature, political consequences of Heidegger's book? Ultimately, Heidegger is anti-technological. The world has gotten too technological, he says, and there is too much complexity in our capitalistic world. We should all go back to our simple roots, farm the land and live the simple life. In this way we can be truly 'authentic.'I wish there was more to Heidegger's philosophy, but there isn't really much more. Heidegger was clearly an amateur and was not an expert in the great Systems of this great science. If he wrote some promising works on Nietzsche, that is partly explained by the fact that Adolf Hitler prized Nietzsche above all other writers (and often cited Nietzsche's late anti-Semitic texts so often disputed by Nietzsche followers), and Heidegger at one time would do anything to please Hitler. It is further eplained by the fact that Nietzsche was not a Systematic philosopher, but largely an artist, a prose poet and a literary figure who also evaded the major challenges of philosophy.The main reason that Heidegger became famous was that he was the highest-ranking German philosopher from 1935 to 1945. He was widely imitated by famous writers around the world (as is common treatment for the highest-ranking German philosopher and heir to the chairs of Kant and Hegel). But how did he get his post? By firing a Jew (Husserl) and giving a Nazi (Heidegger) that job. This dirty pool is revealed by a closer look at the poverty-stricken results of Heidegger's petite-bourgeois ideology."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Heidegger -- like some others -- takes advantage of the common man's idea that the more difficult something it is to read, the more profound it must be.

While the work itself is very dense Heidegger's work is nothing short of amazing."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Some advocates of this book would probably argue that the subject matter and the concepts discussed are by their nature very difficult, and it would have been impossible for Heidegger to convey these concepts any more clearly than he did. This is likely true. Heidegger's concepts of ontology through being-towards-death are nothing short of revolutionary. My original review of this book was critical because I found it too difficult, but upon rereading it in 2004-2005 I have come to appreciate its value. It, along with Systematic Theology by Paul Tillich, is one of the most important works of the 20th century. This book has been of infinite use in my research and writing as a theologian. Here are some additional suggestions:1. The psychoanalytic school, especially Freud and Jung, gets a lot closer to explaining the concept of being, as well as other concepts central to man's existence, than does Heidegger's phenomenology.2. Kierkegaard, who came decades before Heidegger, is still ten times the writer Heidegger ever was. I suggest reading literally every book by Kierkegaard before reading the historical curiosity known as _Being and Time_.3. _Theodicy_ by Leibnitz, another work which came much earlier but is also much better. At least Leibnitz clearly conveys his personal belief system, and actually argues central philosophical concepts like good and evil and the existence of God.And this brings me to my conclusion. My main problem with _Being and Time_ is basically this: How can an author write a 400 page philosophical book, which takes nearly a month to read, and not even discuss issues like good vs. evil and the existence vs. non-existence of God? Why is it that after devoting a month to this man's work, I still don't even know what Heidegger's own spiritual beliefs are? This is the most impersonal book I have ever read. There is no trace of authorial intention or indentity, no soul to this work. It provides no real-world anecdotal examples with which to clarify any of its concepts. Heidegger never bothers to describe a real life situation in which his concepts come into play. This book is so completely disconnected from reality, the reader has to wonder if Heidegger ever left his house. At least in psychoanalysis, authors like Jung will actually provide real-life psychological case studies to back up their sweeping generalizations about human behaviour. With Heidegger, all we get is the sweeping generalizations and no case studies to demonstrate how people might exhibit the behaviours he attributes to humanity. Maybe Heidegger did have a good personality, but we'll never know based on this work. Once again: re-editing this review in 2010, I retract some of the earlier criticisms, which I leave as is so the reader can understand the difficulties encountered by a teenager reading this book. This book is for grownups only. As a teenager I was in position to make an inital attempt on this book, but I was in no position to write a properly vetted review from an authoritative source. This is a 5 star book and the second most important work of the 20th century behind only Tillich's Systematic theology. Please do not acknowledge any reviews wirtten by teenagers on the works of Sartre, Heidegger, or Hegel."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Okay, reading these reviews, I am frustrated... but, of course that is to be expected. Heidegger, more than most philosophers, lends himself to a multiplicity of interpretations.Rather than add my own semi-detailed interpretation of this work and its historical importance to this list [which would just further frustrate others, I am sure], I would just like to recommend to anyone approaching this book for the first time that they keep in mind the central inquiry that Heidegger is engaging in: the meaning of Being... and, as he explicitly states, this book is a preparation for further exploration, and not to be read as a completed &quot;system&quot; in itself. While the influence of Kierkegaard is obvious, relating this work to Dostoevsky (as another reviewer has) I think misses the point entirely. For all of the talk of &quot;authenticity&quot; and the &quot;psychologizing&quot; of this work that later commentators have engaged in, Heidegger is intersted in re-grounding all philosophical inquiry... not in explicating some mere existential-humanistic outlook. Whether he suceeds or not is, to say the least, debatable.I would also recommend giving a _very_ close and thorough reading to his essay &quot;What is Metaphysics&quot; before approaching _Being and Time_.A final note on this translation-- I had already wrestled with the previous translation from beginning to end before purchasing this one. This translation was more than worth the price of purchasing the book again. Stambaugh's translation is simply masterful."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Being and Time (1927) is the magnum opus of one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century and arguably Western Philosophy. Spending 7 years writing this first of 67 books, Martin Heidegger turns Husserlian phenomenology (Husserl being Heidegger's main teacher) on its head and introduces to the Western tradition a whole new way of understanding ontology (the formal study of existentia). Being and Time is the first installment of a greater work that was to compromise two parts each with three divisions. Being and Time is only the first two divisions of Part One of that endeavor. For the continuation of Heidegger's overall project, readers must purchase &quot;The Basic Problems of Phenomenology&quot; and &quot;Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics.&quot; These three books together compromise the existing (though still not complete) totality of Heidegger's undertaking. &quot;The Basic Problems of Phenomenology&quot; is particularly helpful because it outlines all three Divisions of Part Two of the project. If you read Being and Time, I recommend these other two as well, though they are by no means an easy read folks. To read either of those books one will require a background in the history of philosophy, especially in Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant.As for Being and Time itself, this is not a beginner's book. If you were just attracted to the title and have no background in philosophy, I do not recommend this book--you will be lost and hate it. This is not to say you are not an intelligent person, the problem is the language and understanding of Heidegger's worldview. This is not to say he doesn't have good ideas, they just take much time to acquire, a lifetime really. The language is difficult not because Heidegger is arrogant and not because German is generally that hard to translate into English. The true reason why Heideggerian text is so hard to comprehend is because there are no words that explain the thoughts that Heidegger is dealing with. He had to invent his own language becuase language was itself to confining to what Heidegger was conceiving. If you're serious about this fellow, it would be worthwhile to learn the major word-concepts one at a time: Dasein, authenticity, inauthenticity, care (Sorge), ontic/ontical vs. ontological, existentiell vs. existential, thrownness, being-in-the-world, fallenness, being-with, idle talk, disclosure, discoveredness, hermeneutic circle, ontic-ontology, Being of beings, being-in, pre-ontological, call of conscience, et cetera. This is not to discourage but to prepare for the huge undertaking that this book demands.Personally I love this book. It is extremely hard and Americans in particular struggle with this German philosopher. Philosophy majors and even professional philosophers can find Heidegger to be extraordinarily difficult so be patient and reserve any judgment stemming from your frustration of the language. You will find many of Heidegger's books much easier than this one. I recommend George Stenier's book &quot;Martin Heidegger&quot; if you're new to him. Dreyfus' book Being-in-the-World is alright for terminology, but it is too epistemological and often misrepresents Heideggerian thinking. Skip over chapter 4 and the stuff on A.I. and &quot;expert systems&quot; et cetera. The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger is excellent for undergrad. philosophy students. Look at chapters 4-7 in particular and the Introductory section. Re-read these chapters several times for it all to sink in, or else you'll miss stuff.If you're still interested in Being and Time at this point and recognize the historical significance of Heidegger, here are some introductory remarks on the book itself. The book is broken down into two Divisions. Division I is often referred to as the &quot;hermeneutics of everydayness&quot;; meaning that humans interpret their existence through the way the world is disclosed to them via their day-to-day lives. As Heidegger says on page 42: &quot;What is ontically nearest and familiar (i.e. our day-to-day lives) is ontologically the farthest, unrecognized and constantly overlooked in its ontological (i.e. existential) significance.&quot; Thus in order to understand the abstract existential problems of Being, we must first realize our human being essentially is. Heidegger uses the German phrase Da-sein (German for &quot;being-there) to signify human being, or more specifically, the possibility of understanding Being through the disclosure of the &quot;There&quot;.Division II is often referred to as the &quot;hermeneutics of suspicion&quot; because this is Heidegger's attempt to break out of our everydayness and explain primoridally the existential underlying constructs of Dasein. The road to this understanding passes through death, because death is the ultimate possibility for all Dasein, for we are essentially temporal. The temporality of our being-in-the-world forces us to realize the fundamental truths of our existence. It should be noted that Later Heidegger rejected Division II of his book. Sartre and the existentialist movement misreads Division II and it eventually forced Heidegger to abandon that half of the work. But unlike what Dreyfus thinks, I still see the importance and relevance of that Division. But readers may want to note that most contemporary Continentalists emphasize Division I a heck of a lot more than Division II.Hopefully this was useful. Best of luck friends.Drake University"},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"In case you've not already ordered the new translation of Being and Time -- I'm more and more dissatisfied with the terminology the translator has adopted.

I can't of course. However, I can make some brief comments. First, for those of you who have never read Heidegger, you should. This text will force you to confront your life. It will change the way you think about the world and human existence. Heidegger's existentialized phenomenology is a radicalization of the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, with the question regarding the meaning of Being as its ultimate goal. Yet in order to adequately pose the question of the meaning of Being in general, Heidegger must first investigate the being of the one who is able to pose the question, namely Dasein, or human existence. What follows is a mordantly brilliant destruktion of the history of western metaphysics. We are left with an irreversible transformation of the understanding of Being and existence. A few words on the revised Stambaugh translation. There are a few improvements, and a few disadvantages. Vorhandenheit and Zuhandenheit have been translated as \`objective presence' and' handiness,' rather than the previous \`ready-to-hand' and \`present-at-hand.' One can see that the former is more elegant, but I still think some of the sense of the German is lost in places. However, Stambaugh often includes German terms in brackets. This is proving to be a more authoritative edition of Being and Time every year in philosophy programs. And there are good reasons why. Still, be sure to consult both in order to see where things have been altered in inadequate ways. Don't miss this astonishing masterpiece."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Dennis J.

He has native fluency in German which, combined with his philosophical acumen, has enabled him to produce this most valuable work."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"To me, Heidegger is one of the peaks of Western philosophy, his writing is very meaningful and enjoyable to me. If you get IT, this book (and his later writings) can change you life. This is difficult reading, but so very rewarding. However, Being and Time is not the place to begin reading Heidegger. There are several very excellent introductions: Steiner's Martin Heidegger,and Macquarrie's Heidegger and Christianity both are very excellent. When you read Being and Time (which is so much better than Sartre's more famous gloss, Being and Nothingness) you WILL need a commentary. I approached Heidegger as a Buddhist, so his main concept, dealing with the recognization of Being, was very familar to me. I found Heidegger to be wonderfully enriching in my own insight into the most essential question of philosophy. I studied German for 2 years in order to read Heidegger in his Original langauage (and also to read Rilke's poetry in it's original). The German source is very precise (a trait of the German language, which lends itself to precision of language with new word combinations to create new expressions). The terms are necessary to get us to see the meaning that would not be visible with out new expressions. For me this works, and put into words (as nearly as anyone has) some of the great \\"mystical\\" insights. If you are reading only in English, you must have a commentary and both translations; start with the Joan Stambaugh, it is easier reading; but you will need the older Macquarrie & Robinson translation for comparison. Some concepts are better explained in one, some in the other. Also recommended Basic Writings : From Being and Time (1927 to the Task of Thinking) and WHAT ARE POETS FOR? and Heidegger's writing on Kant and Holderin. If you enjoy philosophy, this has my highest recommendation. This is philosophy that will awaken you in this moment."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"This is essentially a new translation of Heidegger's \\"Being and Time\\", a book which needs to be recognized as one of the great achievements of Twentieth Century thought.The translation is now not simply accurate, but illuminating.

It is not a book that one should try to read without the necessary background (some knowledge of phenomenology) and, ideally, without some guidance (i.e. a class in Heidegger). There are a number of books that attempt to make Being and Time more accessible. Unfortunately a number of them are very problematic. Personally I would recommendA Guide to Heidegger's Being and Time (Suny Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)by Magda King. It is not the easiest or most accessible of the commentaries on Being and Time but it is one of the more accurate in my opinion. It also focuses more on the second division which is really the more important division though it is also the more difficult division and for precisely that reason it often gets less attention in the secondary literature.I would like to say a few words about this new updated translation by Schmidt. I do not read German but I have read both the Stambaugh/Schmidt translation and the Maquarrie/Robinson translation and so I have a few comments in regard to their relative virtues. I do like the Maquarrie/Robinson translation, probably in part because it was the first translation I read and so I got used to the terminology, but also because it maintains some of the clunkiness (for lack of a better term) of Heidegger's terminology. Stambaugh/Schmidt is definitely smoother so it is probably a bit more accessible. But the real virtue of the new Schmidt translation, in my opinion, is that Schmidt puts brackets for all of the 'sein' related words letting you know precisely what German word Heidegger is using. This overcomes, to a large degree, the problem of having to come up with different terms or capitalizations/hyphens, etc. to adequately reflect all of the different 'sein' terminology. This is extremely helpful because it is extremely important to be able to distinguish the 'sein' words as Heidegger uses them (particularly Seiende, Seiendheit, and Sein). That alone makes this translation worth having.Heidegger is, of course, primarily interested in the question of Being as he makes clear in his two introductions. Heidegger believes that Being is something that Dasein understands. We understand what it is for something 'to be' but we understand it in a vague way. Heidegger wants to make this vague understanding explicit but to do so he must understand the being that understands, i.e. Dasein. Most of Being and Time is taken up with an analysis of Dasein and its manner of being. The first division lays out what Heidegger calls the existentials of Dasein. They are like the categories that are applied to beings other than Dasein, the existentials are the a priori's of the being of Dasein. In the second division he grounds all these existentials temporally, specifically, on the three temporal ecstases of the having-been, the present, and the to-come. For Heidegger Dasein is essentially futural meaning the future has precedence. Dasein is its possibilities. This might seem strange but it makes perfect sense. Everything we do has reference to the future and to projects. I read Being and Time because I have projected a future in which I become a philosophy professor, etc. (the father in Cormac McCarthy's novelThe Road (Oprah's Book Club)discovers this essential truth when he is looking through a bookcase at the end of the world and realizes that books make no sense when there is no future; their very being as books is predicated on a future. There is no reason to read after the apocalypse when there is no future because there are no human possibilities). McCarthy is being very Heideggerians since one of Heidegger's basic insights is that it is on the basis of the future, a thrown project, that Dasein is able to exist meaningfully in the world and make sense out of inner-worldly beings.This review is merely the barest skeleton of an outline of a few themes from Being and Time. Ultimately it is impossible to write a summary of such an epoch-making book. It might have been better to simply avoid trying to summarize it at all but I wanted to say at least something about the book. Heidegger has completely altered our understanding of our own being as well as the meaning of Being in general. Heidegger's influence on Continental philosophy is incalculable. All roads into Continental philosophy lead through Heidegger.There are many who seem to think, due to the difficulty of Heidegger's text, that it is in fact non-sense, a giant prank, and that Heidegger is not really saying anything (this is an extreme view I know but it is not all that different from the critiques leveled at Heidegger by prominent philosophers like Rudolf Carnap). For now I will simply offer my assurances to the reader: Heidegger's text is difficult, there is no doubt about that, but if you are truly interested in understanding it and you have the patience to work through it over many years (it will take many years) then I promise you Heidegger's book does make sense! Whether you will agree with Heidegger's positions is another question but it is my honest opinion that anyone who truly desires to understand this book can if they are willing to put in the work."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"&quot;Being and Time&quot;, in my opinion, could be ranked along with Plato's &quot;Republic&quot; and Kant's &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; as one of the greatest philosophical works in the history of western thought.

Should I give this One Star or Five Stars? But then it struck me: does it matter? No - it doesn't. The enormous and numerous difficulties encountered in this reading are not due solely to the style in which it was written, and more so, not to what it is trying to say. Not at all. A third factor, underplayed (or completely unknown) by many is the book is written for a person who is in himself concerned, in the highest and most dangerous extent, about the issue of being, to a person who's being is at stake, and therefore, to a person who has in his mind the &quot;guidelines&quot; of thought, the very well and spring and &quot;metaphysical beginning,&quot; as regarding the question of being, beingness, the being of others, and above all, the historical condition of the world, from where it has originated, and, without hesitation, to where it is going. Being and Time is a book for those who already posses at their grasp a certain type of intensity, a &quot;monomania,&quot; if you will - it is not at all for your average &quot;open-minded&quot; person, not for anarchist of spirits and the all-too liberal &quot;humanist,&quot; not for liberators, not for fighters, but for those who (this is said at my own risk)...for those who have at least dreamt all of this philosophy *already* and are only now, for the first time, encountering what their dream is like when it is put into words. I must admit that I doubt that just anyone can understand this book without having been acquainted - not with...mere philosophy - but with that same haunting intensity which plunged Heidegger to the conception of this book. We all must understand that this book *has* and will always be misunderstood or regarded as an oddity by many professionals and critics - but the book is clear. It's very clear. It demands that you think for yourself. No. It demands that you have thought for yourself all those ideas, or at least felt that strange and inexplicable feeling which, by all means, borders on these ideas. Philosophically I disagree with Heidegger and even think he is naive - but that is refreshing to see. Nevertheless, the beauty (yes, beauty), enigma, and power that this book has is undeniable - even in disagreement, Heidegger deserves more sincere and distant reverence than any other philosopher in the 20th century. At the end, one summing up comment: this book does not teach you anything new, it only illuminates and builds on what you should already know, thought about, felt so intimately."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Heidegger--who spends a good chunk of the Introduction to B&amp;T explaining why _no_ scientific approach can approach the problems he's interested in, who clearly explains why his approach isn't and can never be grounded in science, scientific method or any of the sciences because such approaches must assume answers to the very questions he's raising, who says over and over throughout his work that science is _incapable_ of thinking or generating thought-- is this the Heidegger the reviewer read?My suspicion is that he read another Heidegger, and another B&amp;T. Or had it siphoned by a prof who was none-too familiar with it. First, the notions mentioned haven't 'floated down' from the Greeks in this work.. they're specifically raised again by Heidegger--as essential in his attempt to regain a ground where ontological questioning is even possible. Also, he clearly states that the questioning _can't_ depart from the world as its origination point, that *da sein* shows itself as the only reasonable place to start this inquiry. Finally, limiting B&amp;T to some kind of reaction/rejoinder to Husserl is almost comical. He barely gives a few nods in the direction of Husserl and the more typical problems of phenomenology in general, as if to keep up appearances (yes, lame pun intended.) Heidegger was interested in raising again the question of the meaning of being and regrounding all philosophical inquiry on that basis. His entanglements with Husserl's phenomenology are secondary considerations _at best_.In any case, this work is profound, disturbing and courageous in what it attempts to begin. At the same time, understanding what has been happening in continental philosophy for the last 80 yrs. is impossible without at least a passing understanding of what Heidegger raises here.

It's not easy to rethink our genetic/psychological world-view, built up on the \`irrefutable' principals of empirical demonstration. That Heidegger succeeds (or, at least, ruffles some feathers), is a tribute to his powers.Emotionally, Heidegger perhaps appeals to a reactionary nostalgia for more ancient understandings. His work calls to our ennui generated in a time where everything is supposedly already on the way to being \\"explained\\". In reading Being and Time I found that familiar phenomenon the Germans often manage to conjure - a vision both rigorously demonstrable yet transcendental to the point where the everyday world appears with new illumination.That Heidegger saw so much that is now routinely passed over in all fields of knowledge is a defining moment for the past Century, and a grim outlook for the next."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"&quot;BEING PROFOUND AND SEEMING PROFOUND -- Those who know they are profound strive for clarity.

This variation can range from the lowly motivated, \\"Guess it might be nice to understand Heidegger,\\"to the highly motivated, \\"I must understand Heidegger, at all cost.\\" Readers can also vary in their expertise in philosophy from those who are general readers to graduate students and professors of philosophy. I count myself among the latter spectrum, i.e., the highly motivated, although I'm not a professor of philosophy nor was I a graduate student in philosophy.Insofar as one is sufficiently primed to read Being and Time, this translation by Joan Stambaugh and Dennis J. Schmidt makes Heidegger especially accessible. My first attempt to read Being and Time ended in frustration and failure. So I obtained several seemingly more comprehensible books: \\"Introduction to Metaphysics,\\" by Martin Heidegger (English version, 2000, Yale University Press); \\"Being-in-the-World,\\" by Hubert L. Dreyfus (1991, MIT Press); and \\"Heidegger Explained,\\" by Graham Harman (2007, Carus Publishing, Open Court).After studying the books mentioned above I obtained Being and Time in the current translation (Stambaugh/Schmidt). What a difference! Compared to my first attempt reading Being and Time the second time proceeded more smoothly and with greater comprehension. Preparing myself by reading the preparatory works mention above was well worth the effort. Being and Time is now highly accessible to this highly motivated reader.Whether one studies texts supplementary to Being and Time I suggest one method of reading Heidegger's treatise: simply plod along as best as one can. The temptation - at least for me - was to meditate on small bites of text trying to digest their meaning perfectly. This is a bad strategy in my opinion. Using this method, finishing Being and Time could take months. Instead simply move along at a slow but steady pace without worrying about perfect comprehension. This is because Heidegger repeats the major themes in Being and Time throughout the entire book. Perhaps think of reading Being and Time as climbing a steep, treacherous mountain. The highly motivated hiker encounters all sorts of difficulties along the way but keeps moving forward towards the summit.I recommend highly this translation of Being and Time."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Some declare Sein und Zeit and Heidegger's other work as opprobrious epithet, including the scholars of the 20's-40's, until suddenly philosophers began seeing things in his ontological thought. What did they see? Something analagous to what Deleuze saw in NIetzsche, that shaped postmodernity, where thought can no longer be thought in terms of Hegelian dialectic, something so fundamentally accepted that philosophy had to be rewritten. Such a revolution is certainly present in the work of our favorite Nazi. Sure, he was a Nazi, and sure, he was morbid (anyone who says he isnt doesnt take death seriously; Heidegger is morbidity, and it never looked so resounding), but the gods be damned, he finally uncovered something only Cicero speculated; that \\"to philosophize is to learn how to die.\\" Not that one need to even focuse on authenticity in the light of the horizon of being to find revolutions in our way of being, but it is for Being and Time, if one hopes to ask that continuous question, the question of the meaning of being. This question couldnt be more straightforward, being directly asked from the opening pages, and yet it couldnt be more difficult to grasp. Heidegger's style is, without a doubt, one of the most complex and hard to read proses ever created, with terminology that a native German couldnt follow. But Heidegger does nothing more if not a working in and through the traditions of philosophy (including the complication of language) in order to uncover primal grounds. It will probably take a person longer to get through this text than it took the author himself to create it. Thus, this is by no means a book to be read by a layman, nor by someone lacking time (?) and dedication.Considering the massive numbers of poor interpretations that have arised in Heidegerrian analyses, one must remain skeptical before accepting what a college professor might offer up, if one were to take a class on Heidegger in hopes of discovering more than he would on his own. Just search the internet for class lecture notes to see what I mean.As another reviewer mentioned, \\"Read Being and Time and skip Sartre, whose dumbed-down appropriation of Heidegger's ideas is one of modern philosophy's most egregious mistakes\\", many, including Heidegger himself, agree with this. One of the reasons Heidegger has been interpreted as proclaiming an ethics and transcendental understanding of Being is because Sartre twisted Heidegger's authentic Dasein into some unified self, whereby all future \\"existentialism\\" fell into place. \\"Existentialism\\" is almost as erroneous as former \\"postmodernity,\\" which we all know was proclaimed a joke by none other than Rorty himself. Heidegger is not an existentialist, nor is he a transcendentalist. He is a phenomenologist engaged in an ontological investigation of being.Stambaugh (which is misspelled by the amazon.com) does an excellent job of fixing a number of misleading translations by the more popular M&R; translation. The only complaint I have is the lower-casing of Being when used as a noun; this was done so as to not put emphasis on being as some sort of transcendental figure, but a note of that would have sufficed and saved readers the even further complication of Heidegger, since now one must determine when it is being used as a noun and when a verb, which can be trickier than one might think inside a Heideggerian text. But still a better translation."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"I took a graduate philosophy course a number of years back with Joan Stambaugh, in which we read what was then just the typescript of her translation, finally published by SUNY Press.

He rejects analysis of the phenomena found &quot;within&quot; consciousness (as Heidegger's mentor Edmund Husserl prescribed) in favor of investigating the structure of human existence--how we exist. Heidegger claims that we exist as &quot;thrown projections,&quot; that is, &quot;thrown&quot; into already-existent and distinctly historical nations, cultures, families; and always &quot;project&quot; a concrete future against a background of possibilities.In Chapter three, he examines of the primary modes of &quot;being-in-the-world.&quot; We are entangled in a world which has two possibilities: the &quot;ready-at-hand&quot; and the &quot;present-to-hand&quot;.The former state involves our mode of &quot;taking-care-of-things&quot; when we are in the flow of normal everyday activities; the &quot;thingness&quot; of beings is covered up, because we are absorbed in what we are doing.The latter state is disclosed when a disruption in the flow occurs: we notice the thingness of things in the world; in this state, the background significance of our activities (the projection) recedes.His analysis reveals that the second, &quot;derivative&quot; form of &quot;existing-as&quot; has lead to both philosophical problems and the scientific outlook, and in the course of his &quot;deconstruction&quot; Heidegger undermines the many readymade answers Western philosophy/science has used to essentialize reality. Fundamentally, Dasein is &quot;always already ahead of itself,&quot; and this existential state cannot be encompassed by discourse, or symbolized in any way. Hence Heidegger's almost mystical idea of &quot;silence&quot; in the face of this state, which leads to the &quot;call of conscience&quot; which can bring a person to a state of &quot;authentic being-towards-death&quot; (my professor who taught &quot;Being and Time&quot; spent ten years trying to tease out a substantive doctrine to Heidegger's concept of authenticity. But there is none, and Heidegger admits it; to do so would contradict his idea of authenticity, for each person, always already thrown, must LIVE resolutely as the possibilities of life whittle away).Part two of &quot;Being and Time&quot; was unfinished. There are several strains of mysticism throughout this work (Heidegger was trained as a theologian) particularly with regard to anxiety (angst) revealing the possibility of nothingness as our ground, a la Meister Eckhart.&quot;Being and Time&quot; is a tough book to read, no doubt about it. Heidegger coined many torturously hyphenated phrases to express his concepts, and many questions remain unanswered, especially with regard to Part 2 on Temporality for which I've docked it one star (many of these threads are picked up and refashioned in Hubert Dreyfus's book &quot;Being-in-the-World&quot;, an excellent intro to BT).But with effort this is one of the most challenging philosophical inquiries ever written."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Heidegger is already fairly dense to begin with, but I think this translation does a great job.Personally, I found this particular translation significantly easier to read than the older Macquarrie/Robinson version.Additionally, the kindle Text-To-Speech function is extremely helpful.

He has not only immensely influenced comedy - and drama and literature generally - but is also practically the only source giving any idea what Greek comedy was like, making his work of immense historical value. Of course, as with all comedy that is truly universal, one need not know or even think about any of this. He is more than entertaining in his own right - indeed, still screamingly funny. Reading him, we get a profound sense of just how little comedy has changed. It is not just that what was funny nearly 2,500 years ago is still funny; techniques are basically unchanged, subject matter only being ephemeral. Aristophanes was above all a satirist, which inevitably means that many of the things he mocked and parodied are no longer intelligible without notes. We can still appreciate these with help, but what truly makes him worth reading is that the spirit of the satire - what really matters in contrast to passing fodder - continues to shine through distinctly. Human folly has changed little - has probably only increased if anything. His general observations are thus still funny - and, to those who look below the surface, still damning. Perhaps more immediately, it is striking to see that humor many think of as distinctly modern - religious blasphemy, bathroom humor, sexual humor - was as common and at least as good this long ago. Aristophanes also delights in more \\"serious\\" humor like puns and other wordplay; simply put, whether one prefers high- or low-brow, he has something for all. Humor aside, his sheer creativity still impresses; his plots and characters show near-boundless imagination and would be a significant accomplishment in even the most ostensibly serious artist. All this makes him almost unbelievably accessible - in translation of course; his tragedian contemporaries take a certain mindset and considerable dedication to appreciate, all but excluding casual readers. However, anyone can read Aristophanes with enjoyment, which is not the least of his virtues.Thesmophoriazusae, elsewhere translated as The Poet and the Women, tackles gender identity issues that, if anything, are more pertinent than ever. The question of what makes femininity and masculinity is variously dramatized, provoking much thought even with the comic handling. The play gives great insight into Greek culture, particularly how men and women were viewed. Current society likes to think of the Greeks as barbaric in these matters, yet it is astonishing to realize that we have not answered these questions; it is easy to dismiss the treatment as silly, but we can likely learn more from it than we are willing to admit. All this makes it sound serious, but it may even be Aristophanes' funniest work. The humor is more than usually slapstick, and sexual jokes abound; a phallus prop even figures prominently, which is probably all that need be said. The highfalutin may scoff, but The Poet probably has the most universal humor in any of his plays, rivaled only by Lysistrata as most likely to delight a current audience. Though not his best play, it has the significant virtue of leading to other Aristophanes works and is more than worthy in itself."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Our Schools: Teaching Character, Academics, and Discipline (2nd Edition)","review":"Ryan and Wynne are leaders in the character education movement, yet they believe that the only way for a child to develop character is for expert authorities to inculcate it.

I'm considering the UMLS to prototype a search engine because it is a compilation of a number of ontologies. However, this provides numerous options for subsetting the UMLS; for those relatively new to these ontologies it is not clear which ontology subsets are the most important (i.e., which play a pivotal or lesser role for my intended use). For example, I can include SNOMED and HL7 subsets, but do they provide redundant concepts for my needs and if so, in which areas? It is not practical for me to learn then all, so I was hoping to obtain this information from this book. Unfortunately I was unable to do so quickly and have to dig more on my own (which was the reason to buy the book.....).Item 2 - I noticed a couple of areas that may be missing for those more interested in the tools and process of using ontologies. For example, I did not see the Protege and LexGrid tools for visualization, from Stanford and Mayo Clinic respectively, in the index (I had located them in prior web search). In a more general sense, as I've been working with ontologies more and more, I've noticed that platform selection and interoperability seem to be stumbling blocks. This topic was not a major focus in the book.Due to the breadth and complexity of the platforms and tools needed to effectively use ontologies, and the complexity and size of the ontologies themselves, addressing both of these large subjects in sufficient detail in one book may be very difficult. Perhaps this is the reason that this book did not reach the 5 stars potential. Perhaps it would if it had addressed one or the other, but not both.Perhaps if the description and title clarified the focus of the book, I would have gotten a better idea of the content before purchasing (and unfortunately, returning).Keep in mind that I'm relatively new to using ontologies."},{"Title":"Ontologies for Bioinformatics (Computational Molecular Biology)","review":"One of the most clearly written books I have found on the topic.

This is very good approach, as I believe that it is not possible to properly teach hand to hand combat techniques (or any other complex movements) without an instructor to oversee the action. Instead of techniques, the book is filled with truths about mental preparation and the winning attitude.There are two major, and few shorter chapters in the book. The main chapters discuss training mainly from instructor's point of view, and defense against deady threat. These two chapters cover about two thirds of the book. In other chapters Christensen presents main principles and concepts of combat, discusses the nature of combat, tells how to create witnesses, and so on. The text is filled with humor and witty cop stories from real life, making the book fun to read.I think that while reading the book can be useful to anyone interested in real-life self defense, it is self defense instructors who benefit most from it.

Often, dealing with a naive, stupid and uncaring politically motivated police administration is tougher than wrestling some crazy doper to the ground.Great in-your-face book.

Obviously this book is geared toward the law enforcement and public safety reader, but you will pick up a wealth of information about fighting for real. The author claims to have been in 300-400 fights in his career and he has several valid points about self-defense principles. He seems to have a bit of a love-hate relationship with grappling saying on one hand that it is absolutely imperative to have one of your trainers skilled in jiu-jitsu or judo and, on the other hand, saying that he has never been taken to the ground and feels there is an inordinate amount of danger to be found there.

The author's experience, sense of humor, and real-life adventures make it a quick, interesting read despite its 200 page length. His long experience training other officers really shines through.You will learn how to stay safe patrolling (or simply walking) the streets, protect your weapon, deal with multiple attackers, handle stronger, larger opponents, and otherwise deal with deadly threats. It is especially good for law enforcement personnel who do not have a martial arts background. It is a bit more strategic than tactical yet I feel that hits just the right blend. There is an introduction to the \\"right demeanor\\" (which is reminiscent of Verbal Judo by George Thompson), a large section on control techniques, principles and concepts, and important insight into the nature of fighting.

I found nothing new or exciting contained in the text, of course, I rarely do in most of the books published today.

I was extremely pleased with it, though, the more and more I read. It is a wonderful portrait of the beginnings of activism as well as an indictment of the corruption in business and politics where environmental issues are concerned. There are many good ideas to be found in this book other than the obvious: just why is it that the poor fisherman not following the rules finds those rules strictly enforced when a huge, multinational corporation doesn't see the same vigorous enforcement of environmental laws?

This is an autobiography of an amazing woman - a role model for all people who are concerned about the health and safety of their families in industrial America.

I got used to the conversational style, and looked more intently at the heart of the story and was not disappointed. The work is believable, credible, and gives a good sense of what life in the coastal, industrial areas of Texas is like, how hard a shrimper's life is, and how some of these communities are hanging on for dear life.I could not put this book down.

A true story of what really goes on here in Texas with the chemical companies"},{"Title":"An Unreasonable Woman: A True Story of Shrimpers, Politicos, Polluters, and the Fight for Seadrift, Texas","review":"This is an eccentric book. It's actually a hybrid, two stories in one, but only one of them is good.In the good one, the author tells-in standard English-of her epic battle to stop chemical companies from polluting the Gulf Coast waters that she and her neighbors had fished for generations.In the bad story she tells us-in polluted English-about herself, using an ungrammatical persona that seems an affectation aimed at being perceived as a pugnacious, in-your-face, don't-mess-with-me woman.Too bad. She's an interesting, courageous woman in her own right, with no need of affectation. Almost alone, she took on the big corporations who with impunity were ravaging her Gulf Coast environment, spilling huge toxic wastes into land, sea and air with criminal disregard for public health, worker safety, state and federal regulations, and in general all God's creatures. These corporate behemoths were able to rape the environment because their deep pockets had bought compliance among venal local officials, political influence from Texas to Washington, D.C., and their hiring power and big payrolls silenced the easily cowed.The only person they couldn't silence or buy off was Diane Wilson, whose story is a model of how to fight both city hall and Goliath and win, and is a tribute to her grit and pluck.But why the author laces her story with such graceless prose is puzzling, and why the publisher let her do it that way defies understanding. Listed on the copyright page are the names of a Chelsea Green editor, a managing editor, a copy editor, and a proofreader, all of whom presumably worked with this manuscript.Did none of them know that bad writing in a good cause is not nearly as effective as good writing in a good cause? Did none of them know that a double negative actually says the opposite of what the speaker intended and that, in any case, nothing is gained for any cause by a disingenuous use of clumsy and ignorant speech?Didn't they notice that Miss Wilson told the story of her fight in standard English, but the story of how she felt about the fight in another English altogether, one that sounded too ignorant to have come from the same person who told the first story?Maybe not. Dust-jacket copy bills the book as \\"a novelistic tale,\\" and Chelsea Green's specialty is environmental activism, not fiction. Anyhow, here's a sampling of Ms. Wilson's writing that somehow passed muster with an intelligent writer and escaped an editor's pencil, too:\\"Doomsday don't always stay doomsday.\\"\\"I had ran out of answers.\\"\\"So the coffee got drank and a jarful of candy got ate . . . \`Then there's the just plain bad writing:\\". . . panic clambered through my body worse than two babies running through the hall . . .\\"\\". . . he wasn't no dandelion tiptoeing around the issues.\\"\\". . . the sun laid a heavy hand on her hair.\\"\\". . . his tone was still as feverish as a preacher with a message scribbled in his pocket.\\"On the plus side, here's one of the few good ones: Describing oystermen who filed in after a long day at sea to sign her petition, Ms. Wilson wrote, \\"They looked tired-as if the wind and the cold had blown out the light in their eyes.\\"A similar cold front must have moved through the editorial offices of Chelsea Green Publishing Company in White River Junction, Vermont, while An Unreasonable Woman was being prepped for press. Green River (and Ms. Wilson) should stick to straight-forward reporting from the environmental front.True-life experiences can be novelized with great effect. Truman Capote and Norman Mailer proved that with, respectively, In Cold Blood and The Executioner's Song. But they didn't pick an ignorant-sounding narrator to tell the tale."},{"Title":"An Unreasonable Woman: A True Story of Shrimpers, Politicos, Polluters, and the Fight for Seadrift, Texas","review":"Diane Wilson is not only an unreasonable woman she is an outstanding human being. She is a reluctant hero, the most authentic kind. She eventually stands up for her native waters, mother earth and the very survival of the human race.Doing something doesn't necessarily mean you can write well about it. In this case, Diane writes in her own authentic and electrifying voice. Her story rings true and reads like the most exciting fiction.

This leader of Taiwan's petrochemical industry had environmental practices so appalling that twenty thousand Taiwanese came out under threat of police violence to protest its proposed new $8 billion dollar complex. That's how Formosa decided to shift its operations to Texas. Texas was willing to give Formosa $200 million in subsides and to look the other way on environmental violations for it's proposed $1.3 billion expansion of its PVC manufacturing facility in Calhoun County, Texas.Diane wanted to know why in her small community \\"a man could make the arrest column in the local newspaper any day of the week for running his truck with expired license plates or no insurance, but let a chemical company, half a mile wide and with a thousand unknown chemicals zipping through their pipes, release eighty tons of a baby-aborting chemical into his neighbor's backyard, and it would be lucky if it made a note in a report. The plant manager sounded startled over the phone. \\"Good God!\\" he said. \\"Of course we can't put that type of information in the paper. Do you want old Mister Weaver across the street to have a heart attack?\\" \\" (p. 250)Vinyl chloride monomer is one of the worst cancer-causing chemicals in the world.\\"It's so hazardous the government says you're in violation if a single pound is released. But here seventy-four tons of vinyl chloride was released within one mile of an elementary school right across the road from Point Comfort. And if that wasn't enough, Formosa, in the same breath they were polluting with, asked the state to permit a tenth reactor while the ninth was violating production permits. You tell me the state is getting it? You exceed permits and you're rewarded with more?\\" (p.186)Maybe all this had something to do with Formosa giving campaign funds to U.S. Senator Gramm, who appointed his former campaign advisor to the head of EPA Region 6, and who was now the final authority on Formosa's penalty and all their permits.\\"The commission decided that even though Formosa's fine warranted something in the seven-figure bracket, they would calculate it thirty times lower, and although Formosa continued to violate their wastewater permit on a daily basis into a body of water they had already degraded, the state would allow the waste water permit and violations to continue.It wasn't the Water Commissions fault, Chairman Bucko said. The blame lay squarely with the federal agencies who prevented the Water Commission from dealing appropriately with the environmental issues at Formosa. Maybe now the agencies would back off their demand for a comprehensive environmental impact statement and let the state regulatory process work.\\" (p. 208)"},{"Title":"An Unreasonable Woman: A True Story of Shrimpers, Politicos, Polluters, and the Fight for Seadrift, Texas","review":"Shrimp boat captains, polluters, and a forty-one year old female fourth-generation shrimper come together in the dramatic story of a showdown between one woman and one of the nation's worst polluters in the blend of autobiography and adventure of An Unreasonable Woman: A True Story Of Shrimpers Politicos Polluters And The Fight For Seadrift, Texas.

I really had to push myself through the last half of this book and ended up skimming and skipping through parts of it.

While what I had heard about Diane Wilson certainly sounded like a great story- that of a small-town woman who turns into a national activism- I was doubtful that the book would really draw me in.Boy was I mistaken! Wilson's writing is colloquial, almost chit-chatty. While sometimes this tone can produce poor writing, in Wilson's case it simply draws us into her personality, sharing details completely relavant to her transformation from a shrimp-farmer to an anti-corporation environmental activist.This book inspires interest not only in Wilson's personal story, but in the broader context of industrial pollution, corporate whistle-blowers, and how activism can really make a difference.Wilson had me rooting for her side from page one of this book, and her writing had me enthralled by the end.

Or understands that women actually can play characters other than vamps or victims? I've read books populated with women all my life, but until this real life story, I've never met a woman like Diane Wilson. In a literary world dripping with testosterone, car chases, and gun play, Wilson is no shrinking violet, no damsel in distress.Exactly the opposite. She intuits her way through what becomes one of the most courageous struggles for justice I've read in a long while, challenging corporate control over our economic and political life with grit, good humor, and vernacular insights that, while uneven in some places, made me laugh and cry and cheer and buy copies of this book for friends and family.She also, in the most wry and self-deprecating way imaginable, made most of the men in her life look like pantywaists by comparison.Books like an \\"Unreasonable Woman\\" come along only rarely. Diane Wilson is a working class heroine with heart, an activist with the guts to do something about the problems confronting her. The world is a better place for having her and her story in it.If you are not inspired after reading this book, it might be time to forgo reading altogether."},{"Title":"An Unreasonable Woman: A True Story of Shrimpers, Politicos, Polluters, and the Fight for Seadrift, Texas","review":"It took me about 2 weeks to read this book.

With this book, the world can now read about it . . . from her own pen, not ghost written and packaged for a \\"target market.\\" Her voice is fresh, raw almost and it grabbed me from page 1 until the epilogue.Kudos to Wilson.

Ms. Wilson writes as she speaks, as the people of the coast speak. As I spoke for many years. Most people would only see this kind of talk in William Faulkner's writing. He didn't make this form of English up. Thank you Mr. Publisher for not converting it to standard English. This gives a feeling that Ms. Wilson is actually writing this.Second, is the story itself. This is what it takes, unfortunately, to get our Government to do what it is supposed to be doing. The encouraging point is that this is what one individual, one person can do to make matters better. Ms. Wilson has learned what one person can do. It takes courage, it takes persistence, and it takes a stick through to the end, a dedication that isn't common.Thank you Ms. Wilson, we need more like you.I might mention that if you do a Google search on Seadrift, Texas, you get a lot of web sites.

Personally, I feel we need this fighter. This book is a detailed analysis of this great fighter.When I received my copy, I read it all the way through. The book is written in great detail by Miller. There is a lot of color and b&w; photos taken by Miller himself and through Lockheed Martin archives, many never before released. The pics are crystal clear and many of later Raptors based at Nellis and Tyndall AFB. Text is full of details that can be released and each photo have captions for it.In addition to sections about the YF-23 the proposed naval F-22, adn the FB-22, the book also includes part of the original Aerofax YF-22 text that Miller wrote with Richard Abrams back in the early 1990's to refreash the history of the Raptor back in the ATF (Advanced Tactical Fighter) competition days. I also have the older YF-22 Aerofax book and the good news here is there is new photos and captions of the YF-22 prototype included in this new book.My only wish is that this edition included the DIOT&E; (Dedicated Initial Operational Test & Evaluation) results and photos of the Raptors based at Langley AFB, VA that were starting to be delivered in June 2005 Both events started after this book was printed . It would have been great to include some of the results and pilot and maintainer perspectives from the results of these tests (it is reported that the F/A-22 Raptor kicked everyone's A$$ that dared go up against it). Perhaps Miller or another great aviation author Bill Sweetman will include this section and photos in their next Raptor book.

Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Lockheed-Martin F/A-22 Raptor: Stealth Fighter (Aerofax)","review":"I have been an avid reader of Aerofax books since they were initially published in the early 1980s. This book generally follows the approach of earler volumes but is distinguished by the large quantity of high-quality photographs. It includes a detailed chronology of the engineering and manufacturing development phase, and some of the encyclopedia-like detailed subsystem descriptions typical of the series.What I found lacking was the history of the evolution of the design leading to the demonstration and validation phase (Dem/Val). A limited description of the Lockheed Martin development process along with elements of those of the competing teams was provided; however, I did not think it was coherent and easily followed. The overall discussion was disjointed most particularly the ultimate combining of the Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics concepts, which was a major driver in the final configuration of the YF-22. In addition the photographs chosen to illustrate the design delvlopment consisted mostly of somewhat random wind tunnel models and program viewgraphs. It would have been very helpful if a set of drawings depicting the evolution of the F-22 leading up to Dem/Val was prepared specifically for the book.Further insight into the selection of the F-22 over the F-23 would have been welcomed. I would have enjoyed a comprehensive discussion of their attributes and an explanation of the decision process includung the technical and political aspects, particularly with the advantage of almost twenty years of hindsight and the author's knowledge of the program.Another shortcoming was the discussion of stealth. It was extemely difficult to follow even for someone with some familiarity with the subject, omitted major aspects of low-radar signature design, and seemed to be more gratuitous than informative.I had the impression that the book was quickly assembled without having gone through a rigorous editing process. The subsystem desctiptions were not as balanced as I would have liked to have seen and seemed to be somewhat reliant on illustrations provided by the manufacturer. It read more like a technical manual than a book.Having said all of this, it is still worth having if you have an interest in modern military aircraft. The photogrpahs alone are almost worth the price."},{"Title":"Lockheed-Martin F/A-22 Raptor: Stealth Fighter (Aerofax)","review":"Jay Miller tends to do good work, but the books are seldom balanced - always coming off a bit like a cheerleader for whatever subject he is writing about. A case in point is the F/A-22 book. The airplane is undoubtedly pushing the state of the art, but it has had a constant string of troubles that are not addressed in this book. Then the entire policy issue of why the USAF needs this airplane, or how 100 F-22s are going to replace 1,000 F-15s and F-16s.

At at least $200 million each, it is certainly the most expensive. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, is it needed?The plane that eventually became the F/A-22 began as a planned replacement for the F-15 and F-16 as they were reaching the end of their useful lives. The thinking about the plane began as early as 1969. Now in 2005 they are being delivered to the Air Force.This is a beautiful book that starts with the early thinking, goes through the competition, initial testing, early production troubles, engine development, everything and in great detail. There's a bit about the competing F-23 fighter, which also looks like it would have been a pretty good bird.There are some artist's concepts of a proposed F/B-22 bomber version and a comment that Northrop was dusting off their F-23 design to make it a bomber. A bomber like this might finally enable the Air Force to have a self-defending bomber like they thought they had with the B-17.Do we need the F/A-22? -- I think that yes, we probably do. The United States professes to be a peaceful nation, but we go to war a lot. And if we do, I'd want our warfighters to have the best possible equipment.

It offers details that a non-Chinese expert can really value. Recommend for people studying transitions in Eastern Europe besides just Asian scholars."},{"Title":"The Potting Shed","review":"Much is written about English novelist Graham Greene, 1904-1991. He was a novelist, short story writer, playwright, screenplay writer, book & film reviewer, and has written children's books.The 1957 English play, The Potting Shed, a 3-act play and a psychological family drama that carries themes of marriage, faith, religion, resurrection, betrayal, deception. It begins with the patriach dying, and his grown children are sent for by telegram with the exception of the protagonist, James Callifer, middle-aged and divorced. Something happened when he was a youth, and without any information from his distant mother or relatives, he sets out to discover what happened that has his memory wiped out after the incident.TIME magazine review called it a \\"truly dramatic of detective stories, what-done-it, a shadowy trek backward from an effect to a cause.\\" But don't expect a common detective story. The what-done-it aspect is not the focus, but moreso, why-was-it-done, what happened when it was done.If you do have in your possession, the book of The Potting Shed book that includes artwork on the cover, you can pretty much guess what happened in the potting shed, otherwise, as I say it is not the focus but the mystery is dramatic as it leaves one asking why would a 14 year-old boy do something so uncalled for and know nothing about it in his later years. Excellent play....Rizzo"},{"Title":"The Potting Shed","review":"I bought this book thinking it was the novel storybook and not the play.I was sure it said in the description that it was the book.After years of searching I still have not found the book, but the staff at the store were very helpful in trying to find the book.Who know it may not exist. but this book store is great for service.Thanks anyway.Mary"},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"After reading Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power (which is one of my all time favorite books!), I was naturally drawn to reading the biography of Fools Crow. Alas, I found the book a bit tedious and disappointing. I am sure Thomas Mails wrote an accurate account, but his style and the points he emphasizes make for a plodding read.Despite these troubles, I found the book to be informative of life on the 20th century Pine Ridge Reservation. The problems outlined in this book are not going away, and if this book raises concerns about what must be done to correct these terrible issues it has done a great service.This book is also very good in regards to giving a history of the Sioux since the Great Sioux War of 1876. So often the history of this great nation is placed in the background to the white culture making it difficult to see with any degree of accuracy. This book is from the vantage point of a Sioux elder and tells the sad tale of an oppressed people."},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"This is the story of Frank Foolscrow: The Ceremonial chief of the Teton Sioux:I very much enjoyed the story of the politics on the reservation.I do have several problems with this book.1. The story was recorded by Thomas E. Mails a Lutheran, and I found it disconcerting that in some places the Term &quot;God&quot; is used, and in others the Sioux term &quot;Wakan Tanka&quot; is used.2. On page 100 Mr. Mails equates the tobacco ties as a rosary. The Tobacco ties had nothing with a rosary. They were simply offerings to his 405 helpers.3. On page 107 Mr. Mails implies that Frank Foolscrow was a Catholic. It is clear that he retained his spirituality.4. I am VERY disturbed by what he calls &quot;The Kettle Dance&quot;. I am not from that culture, and do not know what it represents to the people. So I have no right to judge it.5. The colors associated with the directions are wrong. I don't know if Mr. Mails got this wrong, or Mr. Foolscrow believed this information was too sacred to share. The accurate colors for the Sioux medicine wheel is.Black in the West and represents Earth. White in the North and represents Air. Red in the East and represents Fire. Yellow in the South and represents Water Green in the Center and represents SpiritYou can see the accurate layout of the Sioux medicine wheel on the cover of &quot;Native Wisdom&quot; by Ed McGaa.Questions or comments.

Be sure to put this on your reading list."},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the ways of the old Lakota medicine men, or would like to know what happened after Wounded Knee to the Lakota. He was hesitant to speak about some of the things he knew, but he knew the Creator wanted him to preserve these things for future generations. There will never be another Frank Fools Crow, but his spirit lives on in his words written here."},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"There are, to the best of my knowledge, two books written about this great Holy Man. They were suggested to me by a Choctaw friend. He suggested that I read this book first, and then read the second and larger book titled, Fools Crow, Wisdom and Power. They are both wonderful books and you really get a feel for the spirit of this wonderful man. Anyone interested in Native American Spirituality would do well to read this book. Frank Fools Crow was the nephew of the famous Holy Man, Black Elk of Black Elk Speaks. This book gives the reader an intimate look into the life of a modern day medicine man. Not some kind of unreal and exaggerated tale, but the true story of a real, human, modern day holy man and what reservation life was and is really like. This is a book that anyone with a heart and a soul will read and re-read again and again. You should order two, because you will certainly be loaning it out to your friends."},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"Prior to reading this book, I thought Black Elk must have been the most amazing and righteous man who ever lived. Now I read about his nephew, Frank Fools Crow, who outshines his uncle in many ways! The author makes it an interesting and even emotionally compelling read."},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"This is the first book about Fools Crow written by Thomas Mails while fools crow was still alive.Frank Fools Crow was a ceremonial and spiritual leader of the Teton Sioux, he spent nearly a century helping those of every race. Fools Crow did not limit who he healed or helped along his life path, he showed us all how we should live life. Frank was a disciplined, gentle man who upheld the old ways, he was disturbed by the social struggles he saw occurring with his own people and he was forthright in denouncing them.The author Thomas Mails had a special relationship with Fools Crow, he was so respected by him that he actually gifted his sacred pipe to Mails before his death. When he died in 1989 at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, he was widely loved and respected.The book Fools Crow is based on interviews conducted by Thomas Mails in the 1970s. The holy man tells Mails about his eventful life, from early reservation days, to later times when he battled alcoholism, the economy, and World War II. He describes his vision quests and how he became a medicine man. His spiritual life--the Yuwipi and sweat lodge ceremonies, the Sun Dance, and instances of physical healing related in great detail. Fools Crow also recounts his travels overseas with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, his two beautiful marriages, and his role in tribal leadership. He lived long enough to mediate between the U.S. government and Indian activists at Wounded Knee in 1973 and plead before a congressional for the return of the Black Hills to his people. Fools Crow left and lasting impact on mankind. I highly recommend this book and the companion book \\" Power and Wisdom\\" written after his death."},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"This book is the counterpoint to Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power. It is more a retelling of his life story, there is less description of his worldview which is more the focus of Wisdom and Power. One feels reading this that he could have gone on and on about the politics at the reservation, he doesn't and for me seeing how he expresses his views about this situation while keeping a gentle ad moderate tone is quite revealing of his personality. There is a fascinating account of his exerience at Bear Butte, which is the highlight of the book."},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"Tis is one of the best native American books I have read so far. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Fool's Crow","review":"I'm in the process of reading this book. It arrived very timely and in very good condition. I'm pleased with the service and promptness."},{"Title":"Democracy: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Democracy is spoken of as the panacea for the world's woes. Fukuyama's END OF HISTORY seemed to operate just on this premise. Crick's book focuses on democracy's historical evolution, its polyvalent adaptations and its transformation into republicanism. Following his essay from Greece to Rome to American and European democracy, we see how democracy is not necessarily another way of saying just and/or good politics. Most interesting are the final chapters on the conditions needed for a democratic polity and the responsibilities of the individual in a system of democratic citizenship. He ends with a nice quote from Reinhold Niebuhr, &quot;Man's inclination to justice makes democracy possible; but man's capacity for injustice makes it necessary.&quot;"},{"Title":"Democracy: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Bernard Crick's contribution to Oxford's Very Short Introduction series, like so many of the volumes dealing with political thought, is long on history and short on philosophy. Perhaps this is as it must be in such tiny books. (I'm actually beginning to lose faith in the whole VSI project, to be honest.) But it's nonetheless frustrating.In his Democracy, Crick devotes a good part of his energy to discussing the history of democracy, beginning with the Greco-Roman ideal, working through the republicanism of Machiavelli, and culminating in the French, American, and British experiments in the modern and contemporary eras. All of this is to the good, although a bit whirlwindish.But the hard puzzles of figuring out what democracy is and whether it's as admirable as we like to think in the West tend to be shortchanged in the second half of the book. Crick discusses de Tocqueville's worry that American-style democracy leads to a leveling-down, but doesn't analyze the factors that contribute to such a possibility. He recognizes that populism and majoritarianism are dangers in democracies, but doesn't ask whether they're endemic to them. He worries that consumerist democracies ask too little of their citizens (especially when compared to the republican models), but fails to provide explanations. And toward the end of the book, almost as if he's run out of steam, Crick's chapters are little more than checklists of characteristics for responsible citizenship and bona fida democracies.To his credit, however, he refuses to fall into the easy discourse of describing democracy as the magic bullet (a tendency especially prevalent in the U.S. for the past ten years or so). Democracy must stress liberty, but also equality of human rights.A decent read, but I'd recommend skipping this one and going instead straight to Crick's In Defence of Politics.____* Page 109."},{"Title":"Democracy: A Very Short Introduction","review":"It's a tiny book, but it contains various materials with high quality which lead us to the core of Politics. Obviously it is helpful to beginners such as undergraduates (especially freshmen). It's a tiny book, and so students in Non-English area could read it easier."},{"Title":"The Penguin Book of Ghost Stories","review":"This book was published in 1984 and contained 33 short stories by as many writers. The pieces ranged from 1810 to the 1980s, with the majority from the 1890s to 1960s. Nearly two-thirds of the stories in the book were from the 20th century.For the editor, a ghost story contained a spirit of one or more persons showing itself or seeming to do so, haunting a place, person or thing. For some reason, poltergeists were excluded. The greatest works were those that went beyond entertainment to explore states of consciousness, examine appearance and reality, the meaning of existence and the dark side of the mind.As with The Penguin Book of Horror Stories, a companion volume by the same editor, the preference was for a blend of classics, lesser-known writers mainly from Great Britain, and an avoidance of modern SF and other contemporary writers seen by the editor as crude or obvious. As he'd said about horror stories, the editor claimed that the vast majority of ghost stories in modern Western literature came from English, and that most of them were by British writers.There were 20 writers in the collection from Great Britain, 4 from the U.S., 3 each from France and Germany, and 1 each from Ireland, Russia and Italy. Ten of the authors were women. From the early to mid-1800s, there were Kleist, Hoffmann, Pushkin, Walter Scott, Elizabeth Gaskell and Margaret Oliphant.From the late 19th century up through World War II, there were LeFanu, Maupassant, Zola, Mann, Henry James, Bierce, Wharton, Kipling, Wells, Blackwell, M. R. James, Benson and Bradbury. Lesser-known writers from this period included Ann Bridge and A. M. Burrage.Those after World War II included Muriel Spark, Penelope Fitzgerald and A. S. Byatt. Among the others were Marghanita Laski, Fielden Hughes, Elizabeth Walter, George Mackay Brown, Alain Danielou and Mario Soldati.In a lengthy introduction to the tales, the editor surveyed antecedents in Roman literature, the Bible, historical records and oral tales of the Middle Ages, Chaucer, Froissart, the Tudor and Jacobean dramatists, ballads, folklore, Defoe, and English and German Gothic writers. The early modern ghost stories in Europe were fictional creations by Kleist and Hoffmann in the early 1800s: to the conventional depiction of a haunted place, they added a sense of the past, artful descriptions of customs, characters and social relations, the buildup of a sinister atmosphere and an ironic tone.Later works by Irving, Poe, Pushkin, Dickens, LeFanu and others brought the genre to the 1870s, by which time it had been fully established. By then, it was \\"almost as if [ghost stories] were beginning to fulfill a kind of spiritual need; as if the possibility of ghosts was a reassurance of an after-life.\\" For the editor, the great authors in the field were LeFanu, Henry James, De La Mare and M. R. James; he saw no contemporary writer to rival their achievement.The classic pieces in the collection included \\"The Queen of Spades,\\" \\"The Horla,\\" \\"The Moonlit Road,\\" \\"The Room in the Tower,\\" and maybe \\"Mr. Justice Harbottle\\" and \\"Afterward.\\" These were among the most impressive for this reader. \\"The Queen of Spades\\" by Pushkin told a ghost story and poked fun at the nobility and human greed. \\"The Moonlit Road\\" by Bierce described a series of tragic events from multiple, conflicting points of view; it may well have been one of the inspirations behind Akutagawa's \\"In a Grove,\\" filmed later as Rashomon. \\"The Room in the Tower\\" by Benson described a sinister dream and suggested dreadful inevitability in ways that can't easily be forgotten.Of the others, \\"The Buick Saloon\\" by Ann Bridge was an ironic tale set in Peking among the British community. \\"Angeline or the Haunted House\\" by Zola, described as that author's only ghost story, described the conflicting rumors behind the creation of a haunting. \\"The Open Door\\" by Margaret Oliphant, written in the 1860s, was notable for including a rare demonstration of religious faith confident in the face of a haunting, as well as a sort of exorcism. \\"Footsteps in the Snow\\" by Soldati, in which a man recalled a lost love, was both funny and sad. \\"The Axe\\" by Fitzgerald was set in the modern business world and depicted the familiar case of a devoted worker who got the boot. Many of the other stories, though, were fairly tame.Among the authors absent from the anthology: Robert Aickman, William Sansom and Vernon Lee. It was surprising to see Poe omitted from a horror anthology, but the editor claimed that Poe was somewhat overrated despite his influence, and that his best stories had to do with horror and suspense, not ghosts.Other large anthologies of horror fiction include The Supernatural Omnibus (1931), A Century of Creepy Stories (1934), A Second Century of Creepy Stories (1937), Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural (1944), Dark Forces (1980), The Arbor House Treasury of Horror and the Supernatural (1981), The Penguin Book of Horror Stories (1984), Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural (1985), The Dark Descent (1987), The Penguin Book of Vampire Stories (1989), The Mammoth Book of Terror (1991), The Omnibus of 20th Century Ghost Stories (1991), Final Shadows (1991), Masterpieces of Terror and the Unknown (1993), The Oxford Book of 20th Century Ghost Stories (1996), The Oxford Book of Victorian Ghost Stories (2003), The Mammoth Book of Haunted House Stories (2005), The Mammoth Book of Modern Ghost Stories (2007), American Supernatural Tales (2007) and The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories (2008).Smaller volumes include The Ghost Book (1926), Great Ghost Stories (1930), Great Tales of Horror (1933), Best Ghost Stories (1945), The Second Ghost Book (1952), The Third Ghost Book (1955), The Supernatural in the English Short Story (1959), The Pan Book of Horror Stories, Vols. 1-30 (1959-88), The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories, Vols. 1-20 (1964-84), The Fontana Book of Great Horror Stories, Vols. 1-17 (1966-84), The Thrill of Horror: 22 Terrifying Tales (1975), Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories (1984), Weird Tales: Seven Decades of Terror (1997) and Haunted Houses: The Greatest Stories (1997)."},{"Title":"The Penguin Book of Ghost Stories","review":"In this volume JA Cuddon brings together 33 classic ghost stories ranging from the dark and Gothic to the spine chilling and eery, as spine-chilling and eery as well as the witty and irreverent, and the poignant and sad.Some begin in a ghostly and eerie fashion, and in others you only realize there is a ghost at the end.In Angeline, Or the Haunted House, By Emil Zola, we actually discover an innocent explanation of love renewed while My Adventure in Norfolk by AJ Alan, leave us to discover that the people we thought were alive were ghosts.some of the stories involve ghosts taking revenge on those who have treated them cruelly or caused their deaths years before, such as The Old Nurses Story by Elizabeth Gaskill, or Sir Edward Orme by Henry James.some are more poignant than frightening, such as the July Ghost by AS Byatt, but all are great reading and all have some twist or surprise.Ghost stories included here range from those written in 1810 to 1981, and set in Italy, Germany, Scotland, England, Wales, Russia, France, the United States and India.My favourites include The Beggarwoman of Locarno, the eerie The Entail, the twister The Queen of Spades, The heartbreaking The Old Nurse's Story, the spine chilling La Horla, the mystery of The Open door by Margaret Oliphant, the beautiful Angeline, My Adventure in Norfolk and the poignant and heartfelt The July Ghost.All of these are classic and engaging stories about ghosts and the supernatural."},{"Title":"I Am an Oil Tanker","review":"Fi Glover, a dj on BBC in England, finds herself between radio gigs for a few months, and decides to see what radio is like in other countries. So she buys a wind-up radio that requires no batteries or electricity and sets off for some places she'd heard were interesting, radio-wise. Travels With My Radio is the result, a hodge-podge of radio adventures in Europe, America, Lebanon, and the Caribbean.The original title was I Am An Oil Tanker, based on a radio blooper made by a dj reading a breaking news bulletin. I'm glad the title was changed to something more straightforward because I would have ignored the book otherwise, thinking it was a children's book. As it was, I saw the title in a catalog (since Amazon doesn't sell the book, only the audiotape, I don't have any qualms about saying that I found it in The Common Reader catalog) and thought, what a great idea for a book. I always travel with a tiny transistor radio and enjoy hearing the different programs around the world.Since Glover is in the business, she gains access to stations and radio hosts wherever she goes and this behind-the-scenes look is quite revealing. She sets off determined to meet Howard Stern and Art Bell, as well as some less famous, less quirky radio personalities. At least half the book is set in the U.S., in California, Las Vegas, New York, and Chicago.Part of the fun of Travels With My Radio, for me, is the Britishness of it. (The book is not published in the U.S.) It's always fun to see what someone from abroad thinks of your country (Ciao, America by Beppe Severgnini, for example). Glover translates everything American into something her intended readers, Brits, will understand. So we end up with a New York traffic reporter saying \\"there's one flipped over on the carriageway in Queens,\\" and a Santa Rosa dj saying \\"another beautiful summer day in Sonoma County with lows of 25 (celsius) on the coast.\\" She misspells unfamiliar placenames: Pahrump, Nevada is consistently spelled Parumph and San Bernardino as San Bernadino. And she decides to take the Greyhound bus to Palm Springs from L.A. Naturally she finds her fellow riders are an odd, scraggly lot, because in this country, no one rides the bus unless they are unable, physically or legally, to drive a car. When she tries to take the city bus within Palm Springs, the bus driver advises her to take a cab.Even though it is now possible to listen to just about any radio station in the world on the internet, Glover still manages to make her radio travels relevant. Her description of Gene Hackman giving a petulant interview, her arrival and adventures in Las Vegas the very week that Art Bell was quitting his paranormal talk show (coincidence?), her white-knuckle drive through Beirut, all great stories. She should be on the radio."},{"Title":"Winnie-the-Pooh's Storybook Set","review":"These books are much smaller than most board books--much smaller than I expected--at about 2-1/2 inches by 1-1/2 inches by 1/2 inch.

There are 6 tiny, different colored board books in a box, each measuring only about 2.5\\" by 3\\". They are eye catching and intriguing, and little fingers virtually itch to get to them. These scaled down versions of Milne's stories, each with 5 pages of text each set across from one of Shephard's original illustrations, have been perfectly simplified for my 2.5 year olds' attention span without loosing the feeling of being real little stories. The set includes; Pooh and Some Bees, Tigger Has Breakfast, Eeyore Has a Birthday, Playing Poohsticks, Pooh Goes Visiting, and Piglet's Rescue. A typical page reads something like this:Pooh pushed his way through the hole, and at last got in. Pooh always liked a little smackerel.\\"Honey or condensed milk?\\" asked Rabbit.\\"Both.\\" said Pooh.Besides being a darling set of books, it is also a matching game, of sorts. The reasonably sturdy box has a little nestling place for each very sturdy book, with an illustration beneath so the child can match book to character. It's all very enchanting for a little Pooh devotee, and I feel like I stumbled onto something truly wonderful here. This would make a perfect gift or even travel toy, as the individual books slip so easily into a purse or bag. I also love that these are the original illustrations and stories, versus the more modern, commercialized ones. All in all, this was a treasured find."},{"Title":"Red Hat Linux 7 for Dummies","review":"This book sets itself apart from other Red Hat 7 books:1. It actually contains a Red Hat 7 CD.

A good complement is Linux Networking For Your Office by Roderick Smith, once you know the basics of Linux and want to set up a network to share files.This book would have gotten 5 stars if not for one bad omission... it doesn't say enough about dual-boot installations. in particular, it doesn't tell you that if you're installing Linux as a second operating system with Windows NT or 2000, installing LILO in your Master Boot Record will make Windows inaccessible.

If that's what you want to learn, this ISN'T the book you want. The only parts of this book good for that purpose, along those lines, are about five chapters and appendixes (out of 28).

It's not a very good one. The premise is good, the characterizations as usual are very nice, but the plot goes nowhere and stays there from about halfway in until the last, disappointing page. Changing narrators in the book was a nice risk, but it ruins everything. Having the book be about computers and then putting in a 14-year gap was also not the wisest thing. If you want to start off on the right Francis Foot, try PROOF or WILD HORSES or ENQUIRY, and there you're neck-deep in characterization, plot and thrills.

I actually program these silly things for a living, and listening to this book in 2001 was interesting purely from this historical computer languages angle. However, I found myself distracted througout wondering if it was the initial story about Jonathan that was intended to take place in '81 or the second story 14 years later. I don't think I buy it either way: programs don't last 14 years.My verdict: centering the plot on a computer program? Good.Breaking the story into two, changing narrators, and setting the 2nd half 14 years later? Good.Both?

Along with his other books, it's a great read. Good story, good bad guys and good guys who are just your average person. Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Twice Shy","review":"I'm usually a Dick Francis fan. I don't know much about horse racing, but I always assume that Dick Francis does, given his background.However, my background is computers, and I found the computer-related plot elements so unrealistic they took me outside the story. Maybe horse racing hasn't changed much from one generation to the next, but computers sure have.It was an interesting idea to have the story in two parts. The first was from the point of view of the older generation, and then the 2nd part sees the consequences visited on the next generation. Dare I compare it to The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings? Bilbo finds the powerful ring, and then later his nephew Frodo must deal with it. Here the computer program is the \\"magic\\" that the older brother acquires accidentally. Much later the younger brother has to cope with the dark forces that pursue him for it.For this computer professional, using the same computer software AND hardware in both generations was too \\"fantastical\\". A BASIC computer program that implements a rule-based race prediction system, and it works and continues to work for 2 decades? No way. I can accept a magical entity that predicts the future in a fantasy novel, but it doesn't work for me in a Dick Francis."},{"Title":"Twice Shy","review":"This was the first novel I've ever read by Dick Francis, and although the plot wasn't particularly earth shattering and didn't always make sense, I still found the novel to be enjoyable. The characters were interesting and easy to relate to, and Angelo, the antagonist, although not a very deep character, was certainly a dangerous one. I thought not every aspect of the plot was well thought at, and at times I didn't really feel a strong sense of danger for the characters. Despite it's flaws, Twice Shy was enjoyable.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"Title":"Twice Shy","review":"It's always satisfying when the good guys are more cunning and effective than the bad guys, and Dick Francis delivers that satisfaction twice over in Twice Shy.This is the story of two brothers and a terrifying killing machine named Angelo. The book divides into two parts as the narration switches from Jonathan Kerry to William Kerry.Jonathan is a 33-year-old physics teacher. A friend of his has programmed a computerized betting system based on statistical probabilities that, if properly followed, can generate considerable wealth. Not surprisingly, the system is of great interest to crooks.Jonathan's friend, who's been threatened by a couple of thugs (Angelo and cousin) passes on tapes of the program to Jonathan, who thereby becomes the target for Angelo's murderous attentions.Jonathan manages to escape England and Angelo, in rather heroic style, but fourteen years later his younger brother William inherits the problem. William is an ex-jockey with a high-level job in the racing world.This is only the barest hint at the plot, which is quite complex, despite the unifying factor of the obsessive and insanely violent Angelo.Love, friendship, marital troubles and wry humor mix quite successfully with criminal depredations in a book that is curiously lighthearted, despite some serious bloodshed.No doubt the computer content of the story is hopelessly out of date. Dick Francis could not have foreseen the incredibly fast pace of change in systems technology in 1982, when this book was published. So I looked the other way and just enjoyed the story. I found the ending quite a delight."},{"Title":"Twice Shy","review":"TWICE SHY by Dick Francis is an off day at the track. Jonathan Derry is a nice enough young physicist who acquires some musical tapes, which are in reality a fancy computerized betting system. But in the world of computers a hiatus of fourteen years doesn't work and neither does the change in narrators.Add TWICE SHY to your collection by all means, but try WILD HORSES for a trip into the power of Dick Francis.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"Title":"Twice Shy","review":"Interesting one that I read to start with, revolving around a computer prediction program.

I found it intriguing, mysterious, exciting and incredible. I have read it three times already and it is one that will stay in my bookshelf as long as I have a bookshelf. Read it and enjoy the ride! The only regret: there are not enough Goldman thrillers to read."},{"Title":"Control","review":"I just read the other reviews here, and I am in agreement with them - I just want to add a few words about Goldman's style. His style is absolutely captivating. He is one of the few authors I read (Trevenian also comes to mind here) not so much to see what he says, but, rather, how he says it. The book has so many stylistic gems that there is no room here to recount them all. However, I must say that the &quot;beer identification&quot; scene is prehaps the funniest piece of prose I have ever read. When Hagerty claims that the actor's name (Mifume, I think) is the only other Japaneese name other than &quot;Hirohito&quot; that he could think of, and even Eric would not have fallen for that, I swear I laughed out loud for about a week. Very, very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Control","review":"...and weep with &quot;true love&quot; for some wonderful characters. A bizarre (and mysterious) blend of mind control, past-life regression, and (gasp) even a wee bit of time travel. Fascinating read. Shining characterizations: a melancholic artist (murdered, or suicide?), an old cop / young cop relationship which is hilarious and touching, an evil GIANT psychopath (although gigantic, he is a bit short) who can turn his giant arm into a giant club, an evil genius who looks unnervingly similar to Henry Kissinger -- and the eerie series of events (murders, prison breaks, rooftop duels, suicides, psychic connections, etc.) which knit these engrossing characters into one heck of an engrossing tapestry. If you loved &quot;The Princess Bride,&quot; seek, search, or hunt down &quot;Control.&quot; But beware, it's easy to get kinda hooked on William Goldman (the higher your IQ, the greater your danger). Don't say I didn't warn ya."},{"Title":"Control","review":"Re-reading this book after twenty years or more it's hard to believe that Goldman was once the king of all media, and his novels and screenplays were snapped up fresh, hurtling to the top of the charts. He is still with us, I believe, but more or less a spent force. Here, in CONTROL, he effortlessly turns out one of the more interesting thrillers of the 1980s, a book that feels like the best Stephen King book not written by King. Parts of it are very much like King's FIRESTARTER, but ever since My Lai and Watergate many thrillers took as their underlying mise-en-scene a government corrupt on the inside with a specialty of bizarre military experiments that involved an absoulte disregard for human life.In this one--well, it isn't fair to say. Goldman fans love his powers of invention and his grasp of all kinds of characters--an elementary grasp, but a powerful one, like Schwartzenegger's handshake. Here he goes back to BUTCH CASSIDY form to re-stir yet another buddy-comedy plot, in this case a young cop and an old cop, who hate each other, then love each other, that is perhaps the best thing about the novel. I don't think Goldman's true talents lie in trying to imagine the inner life of an ambitious female painter--no, that is beyond him. The paintings that Edith Mazursky accomplishes are, we are told, great behemoths of something entirely new; her dealer swoons over them, the critics rave, but we never believe any of this for a minute.The savage killer, \\"Billy Boy,\\" is another laughable cliche, but perhaps time has supplied the laughs and back then in 1982 he wasn't such a carbon copy of every other sociopath. I'm undecided about this and will give Goldman the benefit of the doubt.Finally, the creation of the tutor, Theo, and the spoiled rich princess, Charlotte, is something new under the sun, and still, years and years after Goldman first wrote CONTROL, this subplot is still daring enough to take the reader's breath away. I can't say why here, for it depends on a trick of perspective--the sort of \\"twist\\" that made THE SIXTH SENSE a surprise only if you didn't know there WAS a twist going in. So forget I said anything, and I think you will get a big kick out of the mind of William Goldman and his awesome CONTROL."},{"Title":"Control","review":"As already noted in the reviews, Control has some wonderful characters-- the housewife painter Edith Mazursky, the killer Billy Boy, the erudite cop Eric. Unfortunately, the plot itself (a convoluted conspiracy theory about reincarnation and time travel) doesn't hold up and feels rather hackneyed. Possibly that's because the ground has been covered so much since Control was written."},{"Title":"Reading Skills for College Students (Learningexpress Basic Skills for College Students)","review":"Excellent tutorial for anyone who wants to improve their reading skills.

Only about half of the book is really about Bob Wills, and it's a poorly-written book to boot. It's similar to listening to someone just &quot;ramble&quot; all over the place, from one subject and time period to another, with little or no warning. It never flows and is hard to follow.

But readers who find this volume valuable may also want to get the collection Errico Malatesta: Life and Ideas (compiled by Vernon Richards) - a book containing 200 pages of writings by Malatesta as well as a lengthy assessment of his importance by the editor.The Anarchist Revolution makes available 25 polemical articles originally published in 1924-1931, including classics like A Project of Anarchist Organisation, Democracy and Anarchy, and Questions of Tactics. Although the articles are polemical in character, they are also more scholarly than the average anarchist tract. Readers who are looking for violent sloganeering will be disapointed.Of particular interest are Malatestas insightful commentaries on the different varietes of anarchism - syndicalism, mutualism, individualism and communism. His own preferences are for communist anarchism, but he remains pragmatic and open-minded in the face of differing opinions. To quote from his 1929 essay Some Thoughts On the Post-Revolutionary Property System (reprinted in this collection, pages 113-119):&quot;Probably all possible forms of ownership, use of the means of production and all forms of distribution will be experimented with ... until practical experience identifies the best form or forms.&quot;Malatesta comes across as an erudite anarchist journalist in the pages of this anthology, and I gladly recommend it to anyone who wants an introduction to libertarian communism."},{"Title":"The Age of Constantine the Great","review":"This is a good treatment of the time from Diocletian to Constantine (actually shortly before and shortly after those landmark reigns). The book will be profitable to all readers, but it will be most valuable to those who already know at least a little of Rome's history. Certain background is presumed, and some important events are merely glossed over rather than treated in depth. This isn't really a drawback -- not every book can be a comprehensive history; some have to look in more detail at certain aspects!Burckhardt is at his best in describing the state of paganism and of the arts in this age. He really comes alive here.One drawback is the very &quot;19th century&quot; feel -- e.g., certain events or behaviors are sweepingly and uncritically characterized as due to race or gender. Another is that, in discussing Constantine and the Church, it seems clear that Burckhardt doesn't want Constantine to be a Christian, and this may cloud some of the presentation and interpretation.But, overall, a good treatment. Don't read it for a biography of Constantine -- you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Age of Constantine the Great","review":"Written in the middle of the nineteenth century, this is a book whose fate it has been to live in the shadow of not one but two masterpieces , Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (volume 1 and 2 of which cover the same period ) and Burckhardt's own Civilization of the Reniassance in Italy, written about ten years later.Like Gibbon, Burckhardt begins his narrative with the accession of Marcus Aurelius's lamentable son Commodus to the Imperial throne, and he covers the same ground and shares many of the views of Gibbon. . One may well ask then, why, if given a choice, be reading an excellent translation of German into mid-20th century American English, when you could be reading the prose of Gibbon instead? But if one is patient, one soon discovers places in the book that reflect interests and areas of expertise peculiar to Burckhardt. He is alive to the extent to which the Balkan soldier emperors of the third century, those \\"hard men \\" as a recent writer (James J. ODonnell ) happily terms them, were in the thrall of superstitious beliefs. He is aware of the visual and plastic arts in a way that Gibbon was not, and is in fact a serious student of art, what we would nowadays term an art historian, as well as an historian. He ventures comparisons of late antique literature and architecture with the works of Rubens and Bernini respectively, something one couldn't imagine getting from Gibbon, or J B Bury.As you read you often feel that you are catching Burckhardt halfway in his development into the author of The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy. He's getting his chops, so to speak, for that bravura performance, but is not quite there yet. The pace is often pedestrian and plodding and lacks the buoyancy and energy of the later work. Unlike the Civ of the R in I he doesn't dispense with narrative entirely but includes narrative and topical chapters . He also doesn't seem to have the confidence that in the Civ of R in I allows him , in a book intended as a survey of 300 years of history, to alight in one particular place and moment and remain there two or three pages, or in other places end a paragraph in a place completely different from where he started , new people, places and topics entering the discussion from often the obliquest of angles with each succeeding sentence.Also the Civilization of the Reniassance in Italy, the later book , feels like one book when read from ststart to finish, even though he ranges over the politics, religion literature social mores of the period. In this book,by the middle of the long sections on paganism you feel like you're in a different book from the one which you strted. That is to say, the gears of his chapters of religion and the arts , rarely if ever catch on the gears of his chapters on political and military history. He doesn't seem to have conceived of the organization of the book in such a way that a common theme is present throughout ,or in such a way that in \\"the division of labor\\" between chapters there is one and one ideal place only for a given piece of information.Books of history written more than 100 years ago age particularly badly, in my opinion when the engage in conjecture and guesswork. \\"Let them sin bravely, and beautifully!\\" one almost wants to say, and if the effect created is arresting enough, that is sufficient -we have been seduced into an interest in the period and the events that he writes about {[cf. Prescott and Macaulay]. We can then nitpick and fact check later when our leisure allows us to do so. In several places in Constantine he hedges for several sentences running with phrases such as \\"must have\\" , \\"neverthelesss, it is certain\\", 'however,it may be conjectured with certainty\\", doubtless, probably, etc.., which hardly makes compelling reading. You begin feel that the historian is not fulfilling the tacit ( albeit rather naive) pact with the reader, to tell what happened, as opposed to theorizing about what might have happened. One also can't help feeling unsure whether a modern sensibility would make the same construction on the same paucity of information, assuming (as is actually not true)that nothing new has been discovered in the intervening 160 years. But to be fair he is being intellectually honest about answers he was able to find to questions that he feels pertinent to ask, including (as in the Renaissance book ) questions that historians had never really asked about the past before.Also, the period that he writes about is not as well documented as we might reasonably expect, not even as well documented as the succeeding reigns (those of Constantius, Julian, and Valentinian/Valens). Here a comparison with Gibbon may be pertinent. In his retelling of the Diocletianic persecutions of Christianity, Gibbon plunges into the story and presents the finished product to the reader. Burckhardt's discussion of the persecution begins with several pages of hand wringing over the reasons why the persecution might have taken place and a highly critical use of the existing sources (Eusebius and Lactantius). Gibbon tells the story from Lactantius of the private palace meeting in Nicomedia between Diocletian and his deputy emperor Galerius in which Galerius convinces Diocletian to initiate the persecution, relegating the obvious quibble - if it was private, how come Lactantius knew about it? - to a footnote. In Burckhardt the meeting is mentioned in a paragraph in which he tries use the other writings of Lactantius and what we definitely know about Diocletian and Galerius as evidence to demonstrate that it and other circumstances attending the lead-up to the persecution mentioned by Lactantius could not possibly have occurred.One \\"parlour game\\" that I found myself playing as I read was, if one were to put out a \\"Viking Portable\\" type book for Burckhardt which would be comprised of \\"The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy' in toto and excerpts of this and his other works, what would one include , what would one cut from The Age of Constantine? Certainly parts of the narrative chapters that feel perfunctory, where e.g. he is relating how Constantine disposed of Maximian, Maxentius amd Licinius in a series of shifting alliances and betrayals could be dispensed with. I would want to include his chapter on the arts which he titles \\"Senescence of Ancient Life and Culture\\" even though many of his judgements on the art architecture and literature of the period today seem dated and onesided. Part of the fascination of Burckhardt from the vantage point of our century is that he was as completely developed as a person can be as both a political historian and as a historian of art, a combination not likely to be seen again. In many places in \\"Senescence of Ancient Life and Culture\\" he betrays himself as someone not only conversant with the technical issues of artmaking but also as someone who has a deep feeling for great art and carefully worked out views on the conditions necessary for its creation."},{"Title":"The Age of Constantine the Great","review":"This is one of the most helpful resources for Roman and Byzantine history I have come across. Burckhardt seems to follow a precise timeline and his transitions from ruler to ruler are flawless. I would not recommend trying to read this book straight through as it is quite dense but all the information presented is necessary. This book is a great tool for memorizing rulers by personal characteristics and historic legacies and I have used it as a reference for many college research papers. If you are looking for a historical analysis of this period I would definitely pick this up."},{"Title":"The Age of Constantine the Great","review":"Don't bother with this one. Burckhardt was a 19th century academic with an ax to grind against Constantine and a mission to rehabilitate the Christian-persecuting Diocletian. He pursues both of those ends with blind and tedious enthusiasm.The book takes about 240 pages just to get to Constantine at all, as Burckhardt loses his focus amid 60 page digressions on pagan practices in the ancient Mediterranean world.Perhaps most annoyingly, the modern translator has seen fit to strip out all of Burckhardt's references which makes the book into an unverifiable manifesto as opposed to a serious scholarly work.There are much better and more accessible works out there on Constantine and his times than this one, such asConstantine and the Christian Empire, just to give one example. Or, if you prefer to go straight to the primary source, try:The Life of the Blessed Emperor Constantine: From AD 306 to 337 (Christian Roman Empire Series, vol. 8)."},{"Title":"Tranquility: The Piano Solos of Phil Coulter","review":"Phil Coulter is a master!

Her lover went missing 50 years ago and everyone suspects that Iris had something to do with it. When Beth finds bones in her basement, she decides to keep them a secret to protect Iris.Widower Brad has arrived in town with his surly daughter in tow in search of his missing father Armed with a complimentary post card as his dad's last known destination, he starts asking questions and Beth tries to keep him from talking to her aunts or making the discovery in the basement. Meanwhile, all her efforts to get a loan are thwarted, and wealthy entrepreneur Aubrey is trying to buy her out (he is the long lost son of Iris). But somehow she and Brad find the time to ogle each other and have sex in the barn before it goes up in flames.Millie Criswell is an automatic buy for me, but after this one, I may have to rethink that. This was such a hard book for me to get into. I usually read a book a day - this one took three. Frankly, the story was clunky, the characters unoriginal (Aunt Ivy reminded me of the elderly hookers from \\"Left turn at Sanity\\"), and overall, the story was just stale - particularly the dialog. I had a hard time with the romance between Beth and Brad. On the one hand, he did not trust her, and he thought that the aunts were guilty. Yet he continued to let his pre-teen daughter spend time with them so that he could be with Beth. There were also too many subplots that conveniently got wrapped up in the end. Get this one from the library.

Worst yet, she has dug up bones in the cellar that she fears is Iris' lover Lyle McMurty, who was allegedly murdered fifty years ago.Widower Dr. Brad Donovan accompanied by twelve years old daughter Stacy arrives from Virginia in search of his missing father, whose last message was a postcard from the inn. Beth pretends to know very little as she now fears the remains in the cellar is that of Brad's dad. Brad soon realizes that the three females are hiding something from him as none are good liars. As Brad and Beth fall in love over the objection of his daughter and the elation of her aunts, the missing father keeps them apart while businessman Aubrey Fontaine has arrived allegedly to buy property targeting the inn in particular, but in truth for something more personal.ASKING FOR TROUBLE is a fabulous humorous romantic cozy starring a beleaguered young woman just trying to make it when the skeletons in her family closet decide to come out and rattle quite loudly. The story line is character driven as the support cast provides zaniness (the older generation) and seriousness (the daughter and Aubrey) that either propel or repel the romantic pair. Millie Criswell provides a warm romance with a secondary lighthearted mystery to spice up the relationships.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Asking For Trouble","review":"This book is worth the read just for the characters.

In Tony Evan's testimony and exhortation, believers who truly desire to grow in relationship with God will find much food to contemplate in their Bible Study on the Holy Spirit. Can there be a church without the working of the Holy Spirit? Can a church grow without the working of the Holy Spirit? Can we even as individuals be effective followers of Christ without the Holy Spirit? Not only does Dr. Evans answer those questions but also, using the Bible as the foundation, explains why, how. For whatever reasons, many church-goers are unaware of these foundational teachings, and as a result, they and their churches face significant issues and may potentially damage their witness for Christ. I highly recommend that anyone who dares to call him or herself a Christian to quickly get into their possession a Bible that they can read and understand, and Dr. Evan's book. Perhaps suggest to your minister or worship team that this be a part of your church's Bible study discussions."},{"Title":"The Promise: Experiencing God's Greatest Gift, the Holy Spirit (Life Topics)","review":"The Promise should be required reading for all Christians. It covers the Ministry of the Holy Spirit completely and accurately. This is a subject many pastors do not understand let alone teach. Tony Evans book covers the subject completely and in language that a child could understand.I recommend this book to anyone regardless of denomination. To the non Christian it will be interesting reading however the finer points will not be evident. The Promise outlines the personal relationship one must have with Jesus Christ in order to receive the gift of salvation.Religion will not in its self suffice as this is mans attempt to attain salvation through merit. Salvation is bought and paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ and it cannot be atained through works. This book covers the subject very well."},{"Title":"The Promise: Experiencing God's Greatest Gift, the Holy Spirit (Life Topics)","review":"Thank you for your prompt response and the good condition of my book.

You will learn solid doctrine without even knowing it by reading this book! The author uses very down to earth and easy to understand illustrations to make points. Tony Evans is not charismatic, but at the same time he is diplomatic.

To date, the question of her existence, her beauty, her scholarly abilities and her poetic gifts remain a mystery. The book is an account of Umrao's life, documented by a close friend and supposedly dictated by Umrao. While the novel offers no twists and turns shuttling the reader into a &quot;what happens next?&quot; frenzy, it is a remarkable and very effective attempt to capture the essense of what it meant to be a courtesan in royal india. The novel weaves Umrao's story with a delicate sprinkiling of poetry, royal societal dynamics, as well as an indepth glance at a long since forgotten profession. I highly reccommend this novel to any enthusiast of Royal India, Indian poetry, and South Asian studies in general. For poetry enthusiasts, and for those readers who are well versed in Urdu, the Urdu version of this book is remarkable."},{"Title":"Umrao Jan Ada (courtesan of Lucknow)","review":"A courtesans life told as no other than Ruswa could tell it.

What i particularly liked other than the story itself, was the intro to ruswa...it gives insights into his motivations/inspirations...and you can then fully understand the story and how far to actually take it as fact...The translated poetry is pleasure itself...and it's a very touching book, especially the start...It pulled at me in a mysterious way, evoking strong feelings of something akin to bittersweetness..some dusty memories...my grandmother brought up (almost) in that time period told me stories of how it used to be and this is a leap back to those stories/memories...It's a great book...which will pull you in."},{"Title":"Umrao Jan Ada (courtesan of Lucknow)","review":"Would've been perfected if the pages weren't dented and crinkled.

Isilwath continues in the tradition of Anne Rice - beautiful, sensual, &quot;human&quot; vampires - but she takes it much further. She explores vampires and religion in a very unexpected way. The heroes of her story are not the evil monsters of Dracula, they are not portrayed as abominations, but as part of nature itself. This is a tale of a few vampires and their discovery of their origins - but more importantly who they are. The characterization in this novel is wonderful. The vampires and even the goddesses and gods come alive. The author gives you just enough history of each character so that you understand them, their motivations, and their fears. The characters of Tobias, Rain and Sky are especially memorable. The story is, for the most part, well paced. The plot is good, makes sense, and is believable. Isilwath's world is one of the most exciting I have seen in awhile, and I hope she will write future books in this world. Any vampire fan would enjoy this book, and I highly recommend it. I have already read it twice!"},{"Title":"Blood Origins: Book One of the Bloodlines Series","review":"T. Isilwath has spent years honing her skills as a writer and Blood Origins is the result. A unique take on the often cliched idea of vampirism, Blood Origins rethinks the mythologies that so many of us have taken for granted and sets them on their ear. The result is a refreshing look at vampires and the world around us. This book is easily ten times better than Chris Rice's hilariously bad so-called novel Density of Souls and is certainly better than anything Anne Rice herself is writing these days. I truly recommend giving Blood Origins a try!"},{"Title":"Blood Origins: Book One of the Bloodlines Series","review":"The most original vampire story I have ever read.

A little girl goes out with her red umbrella just in case it rains. It does rain and she puts up her umbrella, which is very small and just the right size for her. On each page, however, she is joined by newcomers seeking shelter from the rain: a little dog, some kittens, some rabbits, a lamb, etc. It's fun to watch the umbrella magically grow on each page until it's huge and big enough to shelter the little girl and the entire menagerie including a great big bear!The simple illustrations and text are perfect for the very young.I think this book has been out of print for way too long - time to bring it back, and while the little edition is just right for lap cuddles, a nice big format would be better for reading to groups."},{"Title":"My red umbrella","review":"Affordable price caught me on this one.

A book approximately 4x6 inches of 44 pages is over priced at $14.99 is wrong. Other than that it is a decent book, but unless you are really interested in William Lloyd Garrison, I wouldn't spend the money.Let's look at the book. It spends about 5 pages on biography and the rest of the book is a very brief history of the abolition movement in the United States written by a resident of the British Isles. The author explains the interest of Benjamin Lundy in the American anti-slavery activity. He shared Garrison's view that slavery should be immediately abolished. On January 1, 1831 the Liberator the paper that would cause Garrison so much trouble and do so much for the antislavery movement. Just 12 months later the first Anti-Slavery Society was founded.The author introduces Benjamin Lundy, Arthur Tappan, George Thompson, Maria Weston Chapman, Harriet Martineau, Angelica and Sarah Grimke, Lucretia Mott, and the Ladies' Anti-slavery Society.

The story is really cute but H.A. Rey's utterly charming illustrations make this into a treat that should NOT be missed. The details of the various animals are so jolly, the faces so expressive.

But the framework is an autobiography, beginning with brief mention of his childhood in suburbs, which he describes almost as if they were crowded cities, and from which he began to escape at age 15 to backpacking and climbing. A college student during the Vietnam War, he later sought in wilderness &quot;authenticity&quot; and &quot; a model for just and sustainable human societies&quot; -- which he did not see in the world he and his friends had grown up in.He begins the detailed story with a difficult High Sierra climb -- between his military service (having volunteered for a program of Russian studies and intelligence work in order to avoid Vietnam itself) and graduate school. As he seeks for understanding of his motivations and feelings, he speaks first of challenge, thrill, danger, and athletic pleasure, but eventually realizes that he has become a naturalist, appreciating nature in all its complexity, not just the physical challenges and dramatic views. We follow his wilderness explorations, first in the mountains of the southwest during his first three years as a professor in Utah, then his disappointment in leaving the mountains for his next job, in Minnesota. There, however, he develops an appreciation of the wilderness of the flat country, mostly in canoe trips.Certainly an offbeat English professor, he had his students read nature writing, then accompany him on difficult treks to mountains and lakes, and return to write about their experiences. This approach was not appreciated by his colleagues, who apparently preferred traditional methods of teaching literature and writing. He ends this volume with the shock of being denied tenure -- but finds new awareness in the metaphor of a pine cone that releases its new life only in fire."},{"Title":"Meeting the Tree of Life: A Teacher's Path","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was in my last semester of graduate work at Kansas State University. I was about to graduate with an M.A. in English that I had no idea how I was going to use. Tallmadge's autobiographical tale of his struggles with nature, self, career, and others encapsulates perfectly the agonizing dilemma that strikes any teacher with the slightest amount of idealism still in their blood. He wants to be true to himself, to, as Joseph Campbell put it, \\"follow [his] bliss.\\" But he keeps getting derailed: first by the army, and then by a succession of teaching jobs that seem intent on crushing the budding idealism out of his teaching methodology.While the book is at times a bit overly idealistic and starry-eyed, you can't help but admire the enthusiasm and passion with which Tallmadge tries to instill his passion for nature in his students. He's the kind of teacher that any lover of Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, or modern writers like Terry Tempest Williams, Leslie Marmon Silko, or the like would immediately take to. He wants his students to understand their connection, not only with the land, but with each other, as a community of learners as well as a community of human beings. And then, at the end, when everything seems to fall apart, he finds solace in the simplest of items: a jack pine cone. I'd say more about that, but I don't want to ruin the moment of revelation that comes at the end.Sufficed to say that \\"Meeting the Tree of Life\\" will leave you with a greater appreciation as well as understanding of the complex relationships that exist within nature as well as within the human soul. Like this review the book can be a little overly flowery at times, but the understanding that comes with reading this book makes those moments of saccharine sweetness almost pleasant. Give this book a try and I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Meeting the Tree of Life: A Teacher's Path","review":"Tallmadge uses the events of his own life to illustrate mankind's connection to the environment and the necessity of wilderness. Writing in the spirit of his admired predecessors, Thoreau, John Muir, Edward Abbey, and Aldo Leopold; Tallmadge attempts to find his own unique voice in the enlightenment of his experience.

In the popular show, the only genuine elements were the landscape of the outback itself and the glimpses of wildlife. In Kanze's clear-eyed view of the same landscape, the aborigines, like our Native Americans, displaying the \\"ugly and all-too-universal result of western mercantile culture mixing with a tribal society.\\" The aborigines encountered near Alice Springs - unsmiling, clutching whiskey bottles - provide one of the human portraits that truly makes Kanze's book stand out among travelogues of natural history. But as always, Kanze's eye for flora and fauna predominates and his descriptive powers are masterful: \\"Suddenly, bubbles appeared in the water before me. I cocked my camera, switched on the flash, and held my breath. There - there -there - I was struck dumb by my good fortune. A black, rubbery bill wider than a duck's pushed through the surface immediately before me. It was followed by webbed feet, a hairy face with beady black eyes, and a furry brown body about the size of a muskrat's. I fiddled with the camera. The platypus was so close that my lens could not focus.\\" The frame of Kanze's story is a nine-month, 25,000-mile odyssey he and his wife Debbie took around the rim of, and to the center of, Australia. (In fact, the author has used the sections of The Odyssey itself to parallel their journey.) Along the way they meet friendly and helpful nature enthusiasts - as well as characters they'd as soon never see again. For those of us who will visit \\"the America on the other side of the world\\" (Melville's phrase) only via the armchair, the Kanzes make irresistible, funny and erudite traveling companions."},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"I read this book just after having finished Bill Bryson's travel book on Australia, &quot;In A Sunburned Country,&quot; and the contrast could not be more vivid. Bryson focused mainly on the cities, towns, and people of Australia, and I believe he only saw a few kangaroos in his entire sojourn there. Though he did cover some natural history, most of his work was focused on the human history and culture of Australia. Kanze on the other hand on his massive journey around Australia with his wife Debbie spent very little time in cities, trying to avoid urban areas for the most part, and saw a great deal of wildlife, including probably hundreds of kangaroos. In fact, the principal reason they flew to Australia, bought a car, and spent the better part of a year driving around the continent/country (including Tasmania) was to see a bewildering array of plants, animals, and natural landscapes in the &quot;bush.&quot;The author introduces the reader to a many animals, some familiar, many not. We meet a wide variety of kangaroos, including the \\"big four,\\" the common wallaroo (known as the \\"euro\\" in Western Australia), the red kangaroo, the eastern grey, and the western grey, as well as the musky rat-kangaroo, most \\"primitive\\" of kangaroos, smaller than a housecat, distinct in that hops on four feet rather than two, carries nest material with its tail, and is the only kangaroo that raises two young at a time rather than the usual one . They encounter the sugar glider, a marsupial that is strikingly similar to the flying squirrel of North America, one that feeds on the excretions of sap-feeing insects and eucalyptus resin, something few marsupials can digest. A wide variety of parrots (the continent possesses fifty-six species) also amazes the Kanzes when they encountered them in virtually any setting, from rain forest to desert to the middle of large cities. They meet koalas several times, a strange animal that Kanze informs us actually for a time grew more common after English settlement, as Aborigine hunting of them declined as their own populations retreated before the Europeans, only to suffer in turn when koalas caught the fancy of London furriers. They run into the ubiquitous termite mounds of Queensland, thousands of which tower over the landscape up to eight feet in height, vital to the local ecology as they serve the function of earthworms, which are unable to survive the monsoonal inundations of the local landscape. Interestingly, we learn that at least some termite species build their mounds with their broad fronts parallel to the earth's magnetic poles, one end pointing to magnetic south, the other magnetic north, with the mounds thus situated to soak up morning and afternoon sunshine but only present a thin edge to the blistering midday sun. They meet the potentially dangerous cassowary, a huge flightless bird able to run thirty miles an hour, jump five feet into the air, and disembowel a man with the slash of a talon. Advised to hide and freeze should they encounter one in the forest, the Kanzes run into an overcurious youngster and its protective parent at one point, a situation that could have ended in disaster. Told that if one froze they might be missed, as their eyesight is poor, a comment that to me brought to mind \\"Jurassic Park,\\" a thought the author apparently shared. Kanze roots around underwater with a snorkel and mask for the elusive Arafura file snake, not formerly described until 1980, a snake with unusually loose but rough skin that uses to grip slippery fish, a water snake that hunts, sleeps, breeds, and gives birth without leaving the water. Among the many other animals they meet and describe for the reader are the manatee-like dugong, honey possums (the only terrestrial mammal to subsist entirely on pollen and nectar), Tasmanian devils, the hated alien cane toad, a wide variety of native frogs, bowerbirds, bandicoots, platypuses, flying foxes, dingoes, echidnas (also know as spiny anteaters), lyrebirds, sunbirds, and a wide variety of reptiles including sea turtles, pythons, many poisonous snakes, goannas (among the largest lizards alive today, goanna being the Australian name for a monitor lizard, the name probably a corruption of &quot;iguana&quot;), and crocodiles (both freshwater and saltwater varieties).I learned a lot about Australian wildlife and landscapes and some about Australian history and culture and really enjoyed the book, but do offer a few small complaints. Kanze repeatedly compares his journey throughout Australia to that of Odysseus and his trials that were described in \\"The Odyssey.\\" While sometimes the comparisons were apt and even mildly humorous, sometimes they seemed a bit forced and even slightly tedious, with occasional asides into Greek mythology that seemed out of place. Second, many times Kanze mentions taking pictures of a variety of animals throughout his journey, yet there is only the cover picture; nowhere are there are photographs in the book. I would have liked to have seen a few pictures at least of landscapes.Having said that though, this is a very good Australian travel and natural history book, one I would recommend."},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"For one who has not been to Australia yet, reading about this wildlife journey has been great fun. The author gives his readers a real sense of the joy of discovery and excitement of the search. Along the way, he imparts a great amount of fascinating information about the countryside and the people encountered during their travels.I highly recommend Kanze's book for armchair travelers who have an interest in wildlife, or those who may be contemplating such an adventure for themselves. The view of Australia, its people, and its wildlife is extraordinary!"},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"It is always a delight to read any of Mr. Kanz's books and this newest offering is just a joy. Travel is always an adventure and to be guided through the space of Australia by Mr. Kanze and his wife is a rare treat. He expertly weaves the natural history with the constant joys and uncertanty of meeting new people. People, places, nature, and new sights are what travel is about and these two have given the reader the chance to share in their wonder and adventure. BRAVOBe sure to check out his other books. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"I loved this book, and found it hard to put down. The sheer scope of the trip that is the subject of this book is truly awesome, and the enthusiasm of the author for his subject is almost dangerously contagious. By the time I had reached the end I was ready to take off to Australia myself."},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"Great armchair rideabout through the land down under! Witty and intelligent, Kanze has a knack for making one feel as if he and his wife were sitting in rockers in your den telling these tales. He is able to balance intelligence and knowledge with humor and candor of his own foibles. I want to go to Australia!"},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"If you ever read this, Edward, let me start by thanking you.I am a naturalist and photographer who is planning an extended trip across Australia. My goal, only marginally different than his, is to see as much wildlife as I can. The only place I deviate from his interests are that I hope to see more marine systems as well as the terrestrial systems that he described..Needless to say I adored this book. The adventure he and his wife share with us was done on a shoestring budget over three quarters of a year throughout Australia (I'm only through three fouths of the book myself at this time).So about the book. Kanze is a good writer and describes the scenes without getting overly flowery or overly descriptive, but he gives you enough to share his vision. Very nicely done. To be honest as I read his book I from time to time pulled out my Australian Bird and Herp books so I would have a better sense of what he was finding. Not necessary, but helpful for me, because I'm thinking about what I hope to find on my trip. There have been some references in other reviews to not having photos even though he continually mentions that he is photographing along the way. I would suggest that printing costs may have been an issue (approaching 400 pages it is a large book) . Another issue; he traveled in a pre-digital era. In the pre digital era getting good photos especially of birds especially requires a lot of time and expense, both of which they didn't have a lot of. But I am only speculating.As a biologist myself I really appreciate his explanations of the natural history of the wildlife (and even fossils) he encountered (and even those not encountered). His skill as a ranger who interfaces between wildlife and the public is very evident as he is a great communicator.My criticisms are minor. As a naturalist I think it would have been nice to have something like checklists lists of the organisms he found which would be helpful in my own quest which cannot be as long as his. I do wish he had some images too. I can't say his references to the Odyssey always hit the mark with me, but I did still appreciate them and reconnected with an ancient adventure. He IS the artist and as it was his way to carry on the story, that is perfectly fine to this reader.Maybe in some future version of this book it would be cool to link his references to photos. Maybe the Sierra Club could refinance his next journey to Australia along with some decent digital photography gear and a better vehicle?! IMHO there is no book out there anywhere as helpful as Kanze's for future Ozzie vagabond naturalist/nature photographers like myself or armchair naturalists. Some funny stories too here and there, a fun book. This book is soooo much more reflective than Bryson's Book; I can tell sure tell you who I would want to travel through a Sunburned Country with."},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"I enjoyed this foray into the outback. If you are at all interested in this area of the world read this book."},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"Sometimes I don't realize I have a pet peeve until I read a book like Kangaroo Dreaming. In this case, I can't stand Kanze's decision to repeatedly and painfully compare his trip around Australia to the Odyssey. It is something that would have been fine to use once, but even with all the adventures and difficulties that he and his wife face are nothing like what Odysseus faces in his 10 year journey form Troy to Greece. Kanze didn't seem to trust the story of his trip to see as much Australian wildlife and wilderness as possible, which at least to American and even one that spend several months in Australia is much for interesting then being retold a fairly well known Greek Myth. He also includes much Emerson, but thankfully not to the point that it becomes distracting. I also felt that compared to other travel books, I didn't get much of a sense of himself and sometimes don't get much about his wife save when they argue or chase down another bird.Otherwise Kanze has obviously read what previous writers and explorers have written about Australia, which he includes where useful, as well as facts about the unique wildlife he and his wife encounters. So don't read it for a great travel book, read it as a piece of nature writing that happens to involve travel. I agree with other reviewers, why weren't a few photos included with this book? I would have loved even just a few to refer to as he describes a particular encounter."},{"Title":"Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey","review":"Why so much language about the scrapes and mishaps of Kanze and his long-suffering wife? I want to read about the wildlife, not about them. This book is too egocentric for me."},{"Title":"Naming the World: A Year of Poems and Lessons","review":"This anthology is a valuable companion for any teacher who wants to incorporate poetry into their classroom. I love many of the selections, reading each poem either quietly to myself or out loud to my students; however, several poems are inappropriate for middle students.Some poems contain curses and mention alcoholic beverages. Suicide was a topic in one or two, while a small unit seems to be devoted to an anti-American theme. (I believe a one-sided political agenda is unimaginative for young writers; they deserve a spectrum of viewpoints.) While every poem is well written, I feel uncomfortable saying the \\"n\\" word or imitating a speech impediment, for example, to a group of middle school students. (I can't think of a setting where I would feel comfortable doing this.) Use your discretion with this book.Fortunately there are a few hundred poems. So, if daily poetry is something you'd like to add to your teaching repertoire, and I highly recommend it, this is a good start."},{"Title":"Naming the World: A Year of Poems and Lessons","review":"I've used Nancie Atwell's IN THE MIDDLE to set up reading and writing workshops in my 5th and 6th grade classrooms and when I saw NAMING THE WORLD and looked at the sample lessons I had to order it. I was not disappointed. The author has chosen poems that demonstrate the large range of poetry available and has given teachers ideas on how to introduce and get students talking about the poems. She also has included suggestions for the teacher to get students to use the poems as a model for their own poetry writing. I loved the poem choices. They were thought-provoking and most were new to me even though I read a lot of poetry. The included Guide to NAMING THE WORLD gives more insight into the process the author uses to hook students into the whole how to read a poem, what does it mean to me, and what does it give me ideas about for writing my own poetry. This is a wonderful resource for anyone who wishes to give the gift of poetry to their students. And for those who would like to know how to \\"unpack\\" a poem or get ideas for writing their own poetry, it is one of the best I've seen."},{"Title":"Naming the World: A Year of Poems and Lessons","review":"A GREAT RESOURCE!!!! I love using this in my gifted 7th and 8th grade language arts classes. They have become excited about poetry after only a week of working this in to my daily routine. It's amazing how many \\"state standards\\" I can just happen to cover while discussing these poems with my students. What a fun way (for students and teachers) to cover critical reading strategies and writing style/voice!One word of caution...Not all poems in the book can be used for middle schoolers, so you will have to pre-read and plan ahead."},{"Title":"Naming the World: A Year of Poems and Lessons","review":"As a student teacher, I found this resource tremendously helpful. This is probably the best poetry anthology for grades 6-9 I have found. The lessons are realistic, helpful, and open-ended enough to apply to almost any classroom. Even though there are a few poems that might be inappropriate for middle schoolers, there are more poems in this book than you can possibly cover in a poetry unit or semester. The Literary Terms Glossary, list of resources, classification of form, style, and themes is top notch. Even an experienced teacher can benefit from this book. The poems are both challenging and provoking. They are the types of poems I read as a kid that have made me want to teach English. They move you. They make you forget you're reading. This book is a must-have. A+"},{"Title":"Naming the World: A Year of Poems and Lessons","review":"Overall, this saves the upper-grade teacher a lot of precious time. The poems, in general, are very useful and the guides give the instructor a quick overview of what to discuss. However, I would hesitate to use several of these poems in my school district. Not all students would be emotionally mature enough to handle all of these poems so educators need to be careful about what they choose. This is not a big deal. The program delivers well on what it promises."},{"Title":"Naming the World: A Year of Poems and Lessons","review":"I have used this book for a number of years but just shifted to a new school that didn't have a copy so I decided to but my own copy so I could continue to use this with my class"},{"Title":"Naming the World: A Year of Poems and Lessons","review":"Naming the World fits in exactly with what we need.

You would have hoped that after all she had been through in the first book, she would have learned to be more cautious. But even after accepting help, Jenna is stubborn as ever when it comes to people telling her what to do. In this one, I just couldn't get past the sheer stupidity that her stubborness caused. The name of a sudden love interest is a dead giveaway from the beginning, and again you find yourself wanting to slap sense into the girl as she falls into trap after trap... as it drags on, the only relief is Simon who is more likeable already. Despite some unbelievable circumstances and suspiciously lax airport security, when you finally get to the end, you find yourself drawn into the next adventure.

I had to buy it for myself after reading the first one in advanced reader form (booksellers get these). I waited for the rest of the series and it was well worth the wait!There are few books I read that have such a blend of humor, action, struggle, magic, wonder, and destiny.

The two are Joined by a guide who is a member of the Knights Templar. Jenna is immediately captivated by the handsome guide. By using the resources of the Knights, Jenna and company begin to narrow down their search. But research can not replace Jenna's connection to the Boards and her feelings point her in the right direction. Meanwhile, Jenna's opponents are manipulating events from behind the scenes in the hopes of gaining the Boards for themselves.But nothing is easy. Simon and the guide keep fighting about Jenna. Desire and jealousy seem to be at the heart of the fights. Eventually the Trio narrow down the search (with a little help from Jenna's friends back in the States) and they set off to get the second Board. Truths are discovered and battles fought. Jenna continues to gain mastery of the first board although it keeps trying to gain control of her. Can she find the second Board, survive the plots against her, and work out things between Simon and the guide?Right at the start of the book Jenna and Simon arrive in Israel. There they are met by their guide before going through customs. Simon even makes a comment about trying to find customs. With Israeli airport security in the news so much after 9/11 (because theirs is so tight) I found it hard to take this story seriously right from the start. These problems continue through the book almost to the end. The second Board has been hidden for millennia in a spot open to the air that archeologist are constantly searching. How they missed something that wasn't actually hidden is a mystery. I had thought this series would appeal to fans of Charmed but this book is more like Indian Jones (with shameless plugs actually in the text).

In addition to the pictures in the book, he had stuffed animals that he passed around to the children which represented the animals. The pictures are colorful, and the depictions of Jesus are very warm and tasteful. You have to get past a bit of fiction in the idea that these animals \\"witnessed\\" the events, but if you're willing to do that, you'll find a wonderful teaching tool."},{"Title":"The Story of Easter (Eyewitness Animals)","review":"I picked up my edition at a thrift store, thinking it might be cute and that (hopefully) it would help my children remember the story of Easter.

Clip Clop donkey is present at the triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, Whiskers Mouse witnesses Jesus wash the disciples' feet, Digger Mole is in the garden when the women learn Jesus is alive, and many more. What makes kids keep coming back to this book, though, is that when you tell the stories, the book prompts you to have the children make noises, touch their ears, open their eyes wide, shake their heads, and other actions that help them pretend they're the animal in the story."},{"Title":"Herbert's homework","review":"Herbert is now in the 7th grade and this book centers around Herbert's adventures as he faces class with a demanding new teacher.

I was looking for primary source material about the infamous Becker-Rosenthal case of 1912, and \\"The Becker Scandal- A Time Remembered\\" was a work of fiction.I almost sent it back. But I'm glad that I resisted the impulse.Vina Delmar has written a surprisingly engaging story told from the perspective of a nine year old girl whose family is nearly destroyed by the emotional undertones of the Rosenthal murder. Herman Rosenthal was her father's friend yet a figure of contempt for her mother, whose sympathies lie with Charles Becker and his saintlike wife, Helen. Delmar has done her homework, as evidenced in the accuracy of her treatment of the trial and its aftermath.Historic fiction, yes. But an intriguing look at Mr. and Mrs. (and Miss!!) America during one of the previous century's most politically and emotionally charged murder trials."},{"Title":"The Becker scandal,: A time remembered","review":"I was prepared to consider the money spent on this book as money wasted--the author's name was so ridiculous, a silent-film heroine, Norma Desmond name. My interest in the Rosenthal-Becker case led me to purchase the book. I am glad that I did.Ms. Delmar is a first rate writer who brilliantly conveys time and place. I owe her an apology.This autobiography contrasts her artistic parents' disintegrating marriage with a tremendous news story of the period. Her father's street morality contrasts with that of her somewhat primmer mother (who was right about the case, as it turned out.)Even if you know nothing about the sensational 1912 murder, this is a book that will charm you."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visual C++ 5 in 24 Hours (Sams Teach Yourself...)","review":"It's a solid introduction to MFC programming but don't plan on learning C++ from it.

Williams simply walks through the steps he takes to make a program without explaining why he is doing it or what predefined functions and classes mean.

Veronica Miller has returned to her hometown twenty years after her parents were murdered. The townspeople seem to wish she'd leave again--for good--and someone seems determined to either kill her or drive her insane. Only Detective Nathan Dawson believes her. A slam-bang beginning quickly falls into a rut. Something suspicious happens to Veronica, Nathan comforts her, sexual tension abounds, rinse, repeat. That's pretty much all that happens for the first 150 pages: one threat, one bit of investigating after another, only interrupted when they finally have sex. Even worse than being repetitive, it's not very exciting to begin with. They don't even begin to piece together anything useful for solving the mystery until the 175-page mark, and thereafter, everything becomes really slapdash. None of the characters other than Nathan and Veronica are very well developed--a problem considering there's at least twelve other relevant characters, and I didn't care for how Veronica spends most of the book guilt-stricken (&quot;I cause people to die,&quot; she tells Nathan on page 247), yet the epilogue simply says she gets some therapy, and by the time the book ends on page 249, she's all better.

It is every bit a must-read for Christian educators as Gaebelein's The Pattern of God's Truth. Riesen very carefully argues that a liberal education rightfully belongs to Christian schools and that there is no essential conflict between academic excellence and faith. As a long-time educator, I wish that every teacher, board member, administrator, and parent associated with Christian schooling would read and embrace the ideas found in Riesen's book. Only then will Christian schools understand the mandate to consistently produce educated and articulate graduates, fully capable of intellectual and spiritual discernment regarding our world and culture--and perhaps, more effectively influencing it by the grace and mercy of our Lord and for the sake of His kingdom."},{"Title":"Piety and Philosophy: A Primer For Christian Schools","review":"After 30 years of administration in private education, Riesen's book was an absolute wonder.

When I was reading it, I literally would get \\"fed up\\" with the authors writing style and have to put it down and take a break before continuing.It is written in the format of several short essays on concepts related to the question of what exactly a good christian education should be. This format works well, but the author goes back and forth on several questions...arguing first one, and then the other, side before finally choosing the side to stay on... For example, he first argues that Christians should not have anything to do with education, then afterwords, argues that actually we should. And although I know this is very nit-picky of me, he also uses the term \\"I\\" an awful lot... at times it seems the book is all about HIS opinion, although I hope it wasn't meant to come off that way.My quarrels with this book are small and mostly superficial, but there were enough of them for me to bump down the rating to 3 stars.

GURPS line Editor Sean Punch took ahold of this and compiled the newer rules into one book, making it far easier for players and game masters to generate characters.Reconciling some contradictory material took some effort but not too much and Punch does invite his readers to note similar advantages, such as Universal digestion and Cast Iron stomach.The first lets you eat anything non-poisonous, the second makes you resistant to an upset stomach and fights off poisons.Overall a must for any serious GURPS player."},{"Title":"GURPS Compendium I : Character Creation","review":"Steve Jackson Games have managed to do for GURPS 3rd edition what the D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia did for D&amp;D.

He was completely negligent in the manner in which he conducted the War. And the monumentally tragic decisions he made with respect to post-War Europe and Asia are simply unforgivable.As a pure politician, Roosevelt was out of his league in dealing with Stalin, notwithstanding his assertion to Winston Churchill that:&quot;I know you will not mind my being brutally frank when I tell you that I think I can personally handle Stalin better than either your Foreign Office or my State Department.&quot;Someone should have questioned the man's competence when he uttered the words:&quot;I have just a hunch that Stalin doesn't want anything but security for his country, and I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work for a world democracy and peace.&quot;Stalin had already annexed half of Poland and all of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia when Roosevelt made that remark!With the partitioning (and millions of lives) of Eastern Europe at stake, this man was acting on a &quot;hunch?&quot; Anyone who knew anything about Communism would have known that FDR's hope of appeasing Stalin was wishful thinking. Of course, none of his &quot;learned&quot; advisors (Harry Hopkins, Alger Hiss, etc.) said anything because it would turn out that they were Communist sympathizers.But that doesn't excuse Roosevelt who should have been informed on who and what he was dealing with. After all, there were ample voices outside of government telling the administration that it was playing with fire by cuddling up with Uncle Joe Stalin. But Roosevelt just turned these voices off by labeling them &quot;Nazi&quot; or &quot;pro-fascist.&quot;The Bolshevik Revolutionary himself (Lenin) had said years before:&quot;We are living not merely in a state, but in a system of states; and it is inconceivable that the Soviet republic should continue to exist for a long period side by side with imperialist states [e.g. America, Britain]. Ultimately one or the other must conquer. Meanwhile a number of terrible clashes between the Soviet republic and the bourgeois states are inevitable.&quot;Exactly what part of this did Roosevelt not understand?Additionally, assessments from one of FDR's military advisors stated:&quot;Russia's post-war position in Europe will be a dominant one. With Germany crushed, there is no power in Europe to oppose her tremendous military forces. It is true that Great Britain is building up a position in the Mediterranean vis-&agrave;-vis Russia that she may find useful in balancing power in Europe. However, even here she may not be able to oppose Russia unless she is otherwise supported.&quot;That FDR was mesmerized by Uncle Joe and wanted to keep him happy is beside the point. As the most powerful man in the world with the greatest military force behind him, why did Roosevelt ignore the Communist threat? Why was he giving Stalin so much with so few conditions?In fact, Roosevelt seemed to go out of his way to assist Stalin, giving him things without a request from the Soviet dictator and even in his absence! Roosevelt apparently thought he was exercising wise foreign policy when he stated:&quot;Of course, it's just the thing for the Russians. They couldn't want anything better. Unconditional surrender [of Germany and Japan]. Uncle Joe might have made it up himself!&quot;And in stating the following, it wasn't the first time that FDR would make Churchill part of his act in cozying up with Uncle Joe:&quot;Trouble is, the Prime Minister is thinking too much of the post-war, and where England will be. He's scared of letting the Russians get too strong.&quot;That Roosevelt was good at schmoozing with other politicians is beyond doubt. However, in making the above statement, he showed his utter incompetence in dealing with Russia effectively and realistically. If FDR had understood the Russian threat even half as well as Churchill did, the ensuing enslavement of Eastern Europe behind the Iron Curtain would have been averted.As a learned man of history, Churchill understood the threat of a Russia occupying Eastern Europe. Consequently, he had been promoting a plan for an allied invasion through the Balkans in order to occupy Eastern Europe. At the time Churchill made his proposal, Germany was still on Russian soil. An attack up through the Balkans would have enabled American, English and French forces to occupy Eastern Europe before Russia:&quot;The paramount task before us is, first, to conquer the African shores of the Mediterranean and set up the naval and air installations which are necessary to open an effective passage through it for military traffic; and, secondly, using the bases on the African shore to strike at the under-belly of the Axis [Balkans] in effective strength and in the shortest time.&quot;However, it was not to be. Stalin didn't like the plan. Consequently, Roosevelt did not like the plan. As America's General Clark would later comment:&quot;A campaign that might have changed the whole history of relations between the Western world and the Soviet Union was permitted to fade away ... Not alone in my opinion, but in the opinion of a number of experts who were close to the problem, the weakening of the campaign in Italy in order to invade Southern France, instead of pushing into the Balkans, was one of the outstanding mistakes of the War ... Stalin knew exactly what he wanted ... and the thing he wanted was to keep us out of the Balkans ... It is easy to see, therefore, why Stalin favored ANVIL [Normandy Invasion].&quot;May Truth be redeemed and this man (FDR) dethroned from his mythic throne in the annals of history."},{"Title":"Roosevelt's Road to Russia","review":"This excellent exposition of FDR's relations with the Soviet Union makes us think... of the obvious. We think of Saddam defying the civilized world, we think of North Vietnam using the Kissinger treaty to overrun the south, we think of Anna Nicole with a case of Nesquick--Franklin would certainly try to charm Stalin and he would lose. That America tried to shmooz the communists instead of confront them certanly prolonged the cold war. If Frankin had not thought he could grin the reds into an decent deal, millions would have been free sooner. Crocker gives us Roosevelt's idiotic attempt at such idiocy a full hearing, and finds him a jackass."},{"Title":"Accounting Principles, with CD, 6th Edition","review":"I purchased this book because I wanted to learn more about accounting.

I think a person COULD study this on their own but they must like to work out logic problems and have the patience to figure out what is wrong when the problems don't balance.The CD program that makes spreadsheet that comes along with this is stupid.

An interesting fact is that the universal contract provided that each week these two men could have the day off. On this day, they would go into the radio studios of the Mutual Broadcasting System, where they would give two performances of the same show. Remember, in those days, there was no global Communications Network as we know it today and soul, two performances were necessary; one for the East Coast and one for the west. This was something that these two professionals were very used to. Listening to these shows, one realizes just for professional Rathbone and Bruce really were. These shows were recorded live, with no editing for mistakes. In radio, if you made a mistake, you simply had to keep going. You had to know the material backwards and forwards because the studio audience was counting on you to transport them to 18th century London, far away from the news of the war. At home, there were other drives, Peter drives, and, price ceiling. But for one day a week, Americans could forget about all that and travel with Holmes and Watson, as they undertook another case filled with murder, industry, and intrigue at the turn of the sentry. And Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce acted as tour guides to this adventure. Now at last , these wonderful adventures have been released on CD so that people of my generation, who were not know all lucky enough to be born during this time radio broadcasts were a staple of american entertainment, can now enjoy them. These shows providing ample evidence that dramatic radio is not dead after all. Dead,?

Immortal writing, portrayal of Holmes and Watson.!!!!Don't Miss a single episode.!!!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Casbah and Other Mysteries: New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","review":"\\"Murder in the Casbah\\" is the third CD collection of 1945/1946 radio broadcasts starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Its title episode is prefaced by CD presenter Ben Wright pointing out that Holmes and Watson travel from London to Algiers in the space of a musical bridge, but in fact this foreign journey seems more believable than those in such other episodes as \\"The Vanishing Elephant\\" (on a previous CD set). \\"Murder in the Casbah\\" is an unusually good episode in which for once, although the crucial clues are fairly and clearly presented, I did not perceive their significance until Holmes explained it -- a satisfying experience. \\"The Tankerville Club\\" is a Colonel Moran story. Although Watson's encounter with Moran here might seem to contradict his later unfamiliarity with him in Conan Doyle's \\"The Empty House\\", this is a forgivable lapse, since Conan Doyle himself committed a similar solecism with respect to Watson's knowledge of Moriarty in \\"The Final Problem\\" and \\"The Valley of Fear\\".\\"The Strange Case of the Murderer in Wax\\" was performed on a theater stage for a large audience of servicemen. Perhaps to appeal to that audience, it is an unusually action-packed story -- but, refreshingly, Holmes himself expresses dissatisfaction at the case's conclusion with its having been resolved physically rather than mentally, giving the case an authentically Holmesian feeling in its very unusualness. Holmes adopts one of his most startling disguises in this story, which inspires him to be even ruder to Watson than usual; but a couple of scenes later, he is touchingly glad to see Watson, even though the doctor appears on the scene an hour earlier than Holmes had requested. The audience of men in uniform gives this story a gratifyingly loud and enthusiastic ovation.\\"The Man With the Twisted Lip\\" is a reasonably faithful but somewhat reduced adaptation of the Conan Doyle story. The opening scene with Kate Whitney's visit to the Watson household is merely described by Watson rather than dramatized, and Watson's ensuing visit to the opium den is actually less fully told here than in the reworking of the same scene at the beginning of \\"The Eyes of Mr. Leyton\\" (on the previous CD set). Very unfortunately, the CD intro to \\"The Man With the Twisted Lip\\" includes a major spoiler for the story.\\"The Guileless Gypsy\\" is an extremely unusual episode in that it presents a quasi-romantic attachment for Holmes with a woman other than Irene Adler. A scene in which Holmes' fortune is accurately told seems to violate the rational nature of the Conan Doyle stories, but is forgivable due to its Holmesian tone and detail. \\"The Camberwell Poisoners\\" (misspelled as \\"Camberville\\" on the CD and packaging) is a version of an \\"unrecorded adventure\\" mentioned in the Canon for which Watson gave not only the title, but the basic plot gimmick of the story. The tale writers Denis Green and Anthony Boucher have woven around that gimmick is extremely dark -- perhaps more dark than Conan Doyle would have ventured to write -- with an especially downbeat closing sentiment from Holmes.\\"The Terrifying Cats\\", set in Rome, is one of the best episodes on these Rathbone CDs, despite featuring a breathtakingly appalling Italian accent from the actor playing Inspector Bellini. Holmes stories set outside Great Britain often feel unauthentic, but Boucher and Green cleverly tie this story to the end of another \\"unrecorded adventure\\" from the Canon, \\"the sudden death of Cardinal Tosca\\". Because Nigel Bruce was ill the week this episode was broadcast, Watson was played by Eric Snowden, whose Watson sounds much more intelligent than Bruce's despite not being written any differently.\\"The Submarine Caves\\" is a quasi-sequel to Conan Doyle's \\"The Bruce-Partington Plans\\"; Holmes' brother Mycroft sends Holmes and Watson on their mission, although he remains offstage. This episode was broadcast after the end of World War II, but still reflects wartime anti-German attitudes. It is unusual for a Sherlock Holmes story in general and this series in particular in that, much as in a \\"Columbo\\" episode, the identity of the culprits is quite clear early on -- so clear that I erroneously thought they would turn out to be innocent -- and the suspense of the story comes from wondering how Holmes will outwit them.\\"The Living Doll\\" is a dark but charming story set after Holmes' retirement, involving a little girl who comes to Holmes for help when her doll is mutilated. \\"The Disappearing Scientists\\", which takes place on the very day Holmes retires, is an especially clever story in that none of the suspects ever appear, and Holmes solves the case without meeting any of them!The two episodes on the final CD of the set, \\"The Speckled Band\\" and \\"The Purloined Ruby\\", are introduced with dramatized scenes in which Harry Bartel, the announcer of the original broadcasts, \\"goes back in time\\" to meet Irene Adler, with whom he discusses the two Holmes cases in question. Although this is a charming idea, it is not quite logically carried out. When Bartel tells Irene that he had sat down to discuss \\"The Purloined Ruby\\" with Watson, this does not jibe with the fact that that episode was in fact hosted by a different announcer.Given that the other Conan Doyle adaptations on these CDs are quite faithful to the original texts, it is deeply surprising that \\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\" substantially and unnecessarily alters the most highly-regarded of the Holmes short stories. The basic outline of the plot is the same, but major details are altered, including Watson knowing Holmes' client from years earlier when they were strangers to each other in the original tale. (Some of the differences reflect elements of Conan Doyle's stage adaptation of the story.) \\"The Purloined Ruby\\" ends the CD collection on a weak note with the unexplained return of a character whose resurrection is entirely impossible to make believable.Like the other CD releases in this series, \\"Murder in the Casbah\\" is a fun collection of Holmes pastiches, and \\"The Terrifying Cats\\" is, in my opinion, exceptional."},{"Title":"Murder in the Casbah and Other Mysteries: New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","review":"I enjoyed this so much I named my Son after one of the Characters! Truthfully I can't get enough of it.

The role of Amnesty International, a private citizen's organization created to hold governments accountable for their actions, has been critical to bringing human rights issues to the forefront of global foreign policy concerns. The simple approach of having citizens write letters to government officials expressing their interest in and concern over political prisoners has resulted in the release of thousands, and has brought hope to many. Amnesty International's efforts have demonstrated that individual citizen action does make a difference; it has become a model for other organizations around the globe.Unfortunately, the author does not successfully capture the importance and significance of Amnesty. There are a number of factual errors which, while not significant in their own right, are jarring and do raise questions regarding other statements. As one example, he states that both Nigeria and Rhodesia were British colonies in 1966; both were former colonies but by 1966 were both independent nations. His analysis is not always strong; in other instances it is virtually non-existent. On more than one occasion his writing meanders and concludes without making any point; this is particularly the case with the chapter on the history of Amnesty, and on the Baader-Meinhoff gang. On the other hand, his discussion of Amnesty's role in China is well-written, and the chapter on human rights violations is well-written, well-documented, and provides important commentary and analysis concerning the human rights record of a nation that has high standards but that does not always live up to them.Literary and analytical weaknesses aside, the importance of Amnesty's mission, and its success (and failures) over the years, make this an important book to read. One only hopes that someone will be motivated to write a more thorough treatise on the subject."},{"Title":"Like Water on Stone: The Story of Amnesty International","review":"Amnesty International was started in 1961 by Peter Benenson, a british lwayer who read about students in Portugal (at that time under a military dictatorship) who received long prison terms for toasting freedom. His idea of flooding the offending government with letters, telegrams and unpleasant publicity was derided at the time as silly. Over the years, AI has kept its emphasis on those prisoners who do not use or advocate violence, and has stayed as non-partisan as possible in various international disputes while double and triple-checking all information it receives. Today, with members in over 160 countries, Amnesty International is the world's most influential private organization dealing with human rights.This book looks at the difficulties faced by AI in its work around the world. Nigeria is the home of AI's most famous political prisoner, Olusegun Obasanjo (now President of Nigeria). Amnesty's attention to detail and fine detective work exposed the massacre of more than 100 children in the Central African Republic. Political freedom in China seems to go through phases of openness, only to be slammed shut by the government. The book also deals with death squads in Guatemala and attempts to bring former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to justice.The author also explores human rights in America. Around the world, America is the first one to say something to other countries whose human rights records are less-than-perfect. But, looking at America's domestic record of police brutality, racial profiling and inability to ratify various human rights conventions and treaties, the word &quot;hypocrisy&quot; comes to mind.This is a fine piece of writing. Those who are already active in the human rights field, and those who just want to know something about AI (before becoming members) will learn a lot from this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Like Water on Stone: The Story of Amnesty International","review":"This book is rather difficult to figure out, and ultimately it doesn't do justice to its titular organization. Despite the title, this is not really a history of Amnesty International. Instead, it is more of a compendium of investigative journalism towards the subject of human rights in the second half of the twentieth century, using examples of problem areas in which Amnesty made some impact. In fact, it becomes apparent that Jonathan Power is merely reporting on human rights episodes that he happens to be familiar with as a long-standing foreign affairs correspondent. Thus, the supposed focus on Amnesty International as a social movement and non-governmental organization, and the effectiveness of its efforts, mostly falls apart as the book progresses.The actual history of the organization appears awkwardly in one chapter in the middle of the book, with most of the remainder consisting of rather standard political coverage of a very selective collection of human rights stories that seem to have been chosen arbitrarily by the author. At certain times, this does lead to very informative examinations of political and historical episodes that may be unfamiliar to the knowledgeable reader, such as a brutal dictatorship in the Central African Republic, or the inconsistent human rights record of the supposedly enlightened South Korea. Also, the chapter on Amnesty's concerns about rampant abuse in the American prison system offers a pretty balanced, if sometimes inflammatory, outside perspective.Unfortunately, other sections are marred by Jonathan Power's soapbox sermonizing. For example, he wraps up examinations of trouble spots like Colombia, China, and North Korea with one-paragraph pronouncements on how these nations' myriad problems can be immediately solved. Also, there are a fair number of factual errors throughout the book (especially with the dates and locations of major geopolitical and colonialist developments), and I agree with the previous reviewer on how such minor missteps can add up to major reservations about Power's coverage. And finally, the reader may want to skip the interminable final chapter in which Power unleashes a windy and inconclusive lecture on the current state of human rights around the world, with only occasional non-sequiturs to remind the reader that this is still a book about Amnesty International. Overall, this book that claims to be about that great and committed organization is often just tangentially influenced by it.

This story is about the North Star and why it is the most important star in the night sky. It also involves the Greek myth of Callisto and Arcas, the original of which Marzollo is longer and more complicated than what Marzollo has simplified for young children. However, down the road students will be able to find other, more detailed versions of the same myth. Meanwhile, they will find out that the title of this book does not mean what they think it means.The little birds that are talking on the bottom of the cover continue to talk throughout the book, which begins with a picture of the night sky and has the birds telling you to come back and look after the story to see if you can spot the constellations that make the pictures the ancient Greeks saw in the stars. Think of the birds as a sort of caustic Greek chorus. The story is about how Zeus visited a beautiful woman named Callisto who had a baby named Arcas. Hera, the jealous wife of Zeus, changes Callisto into bear so that Zeus will not want to visit her any more. As Callisto learned how to be a bear, she kept an eye on her son, who grows up and learns to shoot with a bow and arrow. Then one day, Arcas is about to shoot his first bear, not knowing that it is his mother.The constellation part of the story comes at the end when Zeus creates Ursa Major (Big Bear) and Ursa Minor (Little Bear), known by us today as the Big Dipper and Little Dipper. But once you understand that the tails of the bears become the handles of the dippers, you should be able to see both. The idea is that the last thing Zeus touched last was the tail of the Little Bear, which is the North Star (also known as Polestar and Polaris). A Parent/Teacher Guide on the last back of the book explains when young children can understand the abstract concept of north and how the Greek word for bear, \\"Arktos,\\" gives us the words \\"Arctic\\" and \\"arctophile\\" (you should know the former, but the latter is what you call somebody who collect teddy bears, which is probably more relevant to young readers)."},{"Title":"Little Bear, You're a Star! : A Greek Myth About The Constellations","review":"A good simplified version of the story of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

C. S. Lewis is exceptional in his ability to take the most complicated human issues and make them understandable.Blending into a queu awaiting a bus ride without fully understanding to where or why (how many of us blend sheepishly with the masses this way?), the narrator, George, takes a fantastical ride through heaven and hell. Just two possible end points on this trip, and with that, Lewis makes it clear: as much as we try to rationalize and wiggle, there is no gray area in life, or, in this case, the after life. You choose. Black or white, good or evil.With a cast of colorful characters, ghostly figures and helpful angels who only wish to give the undecided one final chance to decide, we ride along with those who, we soon realize, resemble everyone we know. Including you and me. The whiner and the complainer, the cheater and the liar, the rationalizer, the egotist, the shortchanger. Even the overly devoted mother, who, upon closer examination, clings to her son more to serve her own selfish needs than to let him go in a loving manner for his wellbeing is not the marytr she believes herself to be.It is not in the big falls that we lose our way to heaven. It is, more often than not, in the petty details of our lives, all those grand intentions come to nothing, all those shortcomings and shortcuts taken, all those more challenging routes avoided, where we take wrong turns that will land us only in hell. A stern Father reminds us, \\"Your will be done,\\" rather than His. And so, for all who did not trust in Him, but stubbornly held to their own willful ways, the bus has only one last stop.As amusing as this little tale (novella) is to read, the message is heavy duty.

If someone is looking for a picture of how a good God could possibly let people go to Hell, this illustration though not a picture of the truth, nor is it intended to be, is incredibly powerful. The wisdom some of the conversations that are held in heaven contain is enormous, and I will never forget Napoleon pacing in his gloriously unfulfilling mansion in hell. Lewis' platonic vision of the afterlife is fascinating and that such a small book could be so heavy with eloquent expressions of truth is extraordinary.Some people may not like Lewis' writing in general because of his large vocabulary so my advice is to not be afraid to learn some new words, its good for you."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I could not put this fictional story down. The story representing heaven and hell is short but captivating. The numerous characters in the book reject the offer to heaven and give excuses that are really excuses people give for rejecting heaven while they are on earth. I must admit that there were parts of the story that I did not understand, but the basic premise was obvious and interesting."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I gave this book three stars because while it is entertaining, there is a significant potential for people to try and get theology from it, which for the most part I don't recommend. The author makes sure to make that point at the end of the book, though. But I'm sure it's too late for a lot of people by then.The primary theological point that C.S. Lewis is actually intending to make is that one goes to hell as a consequence of rejecting God and \\"loving\\" self. It is the person's rejection of God, not the other way around. However, in trying to make this point in a novel, a lot of the theology seems to get messed up."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Take your time with this one. Its dynamics, allegory and symbolism--if you catch them-- will illuminate your mind and soul with a sobering and healthy thought-proving self-reflection. It consumed my mind, for sure. What an author....what can one say? I am speechless.Wonderful, spectacular, outstanding and highly recommended.Carrie Lynn JonesAuthor of:It All Began... When Jesus Gave Me Sneakers"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Some people claim that the process of \\"speculating\\" about certain things that are not mentioned in the Bible (when it comes to discussing Christian theology) is dangerous at best and heretical at worst. This is probably because it's usually done poorly. That is not the case in this parable/allegory of the afterlife written by one of the great writers of the modern era. Lewis does a masterful job at not only describing some of the dangers of the Christian life, but also gradually revealing them in a way that allows for the reader to discover the important points of each argument as his/her own place. This is truly one of the best books I've ever read, and I learn something every time I re-read it. Highly, HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"No one can write like CS Lewis. The ideas will challenge any conception of Heaven and Hell you have, not to mention eternity and our decision-making process. The narrator does a great job with varying the voices to follow the dialogue of the characters too. I honestly don't think I could read this selection and get as much out of it."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I enjoyed this book. Lewis patterned this fairly short novel on Dante's Divine Comedy with a dream visit to Hell/Purgatory and what he describes as the \\"Valley of the Shadow of Light\\" or Heaven's front yard if you will. Most of the book is concerned with various \\"ghosts\\" from Hell rejecting the offer of Heaven for selfish reasons. Lewis makes a lot of good points about Hell being the rejection of God's love. Doctrinally the book can be a bit fuzzy, such as having Hell and Purgatory be the same place, but it was not supposed to be a book of theological doctrine but rather a story. I wish more time had have been spent in Hell but that wasn't the point of the book. I would recommend this book, and highly recommend Lewis' Screwtape Letters as well."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"\\"The Great Divorce\\" is a strange allegorical novel written by the well-known Christian writer C.S. Lewis, who was also a friend of J.R.R. Tolkien. \\"The Great Divorce\\" is also my favorite work by Lewis, alongside the classical children's story \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\".The novel is about Heaven and Hell. Hell turns out to be a boring, great city, where the sun never really rises. An angel operates a bus that takes people from Hell to Heaven. Anyone who likes can go onboard the bus. In Heaven, the denizens of Hell are met by angels who call upon them to enter. The offer of salvation is (almost) free. Despite this, most of the bus-passangers voluntarily decide to go back to Hell!On first reading, the story might sound completely absurd. Who would be so stupid as to voluntarily remain in Hell, if you are offered an eternity in Heaven instead? The story makes more sense if read as an allegory about why people reject the Church here on Earth. For instance, one of the main characters is a heretical priest who refuses to accept the truths of traditional Christianity, even when confronted with hard evidence. Another character is some kind of bohemian left-wing artist. They both retun to \\"Hell\\", i.e. the meaningless, grey, secular world outside the Church.The story could also be read as a criticism of modern society. The people in \\"Hell\\" live in houses that slowly but steadfastly move away from each other, making the inhabitants more and more socially isolated from each other, and more and more preoccupied with their own negative feelings, rather than turning towards what C.S. Lewis believed was the best source for Meaning in life: traditional Christianity. (Poor Napoleon is held up as a particularly bad example of a meaningless, self-preoccupied denizen of \\"Hell\\". Lewis was British.)But the story is also theologically interesting. Indeed, Lewis seems to have believed that his allegorical description of Heaven and Hell reflected something real. It's not just a story about modern man rejecting the Church, or modern society becoming increasingly meaningless. It's also a story about the actual, supernatural realms known as Heaven and Hell.Lewis felt extremely uncomfortable with the traditional idea of Hell. Small wonder. The traditional idea is deeply immoral: Jesus throws most of humanity in Hell, for eternal torture, simply for disbelieving in him and his mission. Christian groups who believe in this, claim that everyone who disbelieves *them* will end up in Hell. \\"Ultra ecclesiam nulla salus\\". And once you've been cast into Hell, let go of hope, for there is no turning back, not even an \\"Arbeit macht frei\\".Modern Christians have tried to mitigate the hellish ideas of traditional Christianity somewhat. Some say that people who go to Hell choose to go there voluntarily. Others claim that even non-Christians can go to Heaven, at least if they act as Christians. Still others, who really believe in Hell, refuse to discuss the matter if a critic gets to close for comfort. For instance, did the victims of 9/11 go straight to Hell? Most of them weren't born-again Christians.Lewis felt so uncomfortable with Hell, that he went one step further still. He essentially identified Hell with Purgatory, and claimed that those who want to leave, can do so. He thus rejected the idea, based on the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in the New Testament, that denizens of Hell cannot leave their place of habitat. Lewis created a more humane, rational and logical view of Hell. What a pity that main-stream Christianity took millenia to come around to this position! Indeed, many still haven't.At the same time, Lewis couldn't accept universalism, the idea that everyone gets saved in the end. What if people don't *want* to be saved? And that is precisely the main point of the novel. Why would a person voluntarily reject Heaven, even if given unlimited chances to enter? Why indeed? Many people here on earth refuse to get helped. They refuse to listen even to the most kind, loving advice. In fact, we all do, to a greater or lesser extent. What makes us think that angels or God himself could change this? Yes, many people would be changed, but the greater the love, the greater the rejection might be, the more supernatural the love, the more supernatural the rejection. Hence Heaven and hence Hell. And at a certain point in time, people get so ingrained in their real or imaginery insults, that they are simply beyond redemption. That, I take it, was Lewis' point. And no, I'm not saying I believe in Lewis' supernatural speculations...And yet, Lewis simply couldn't end his book on a sombre, pessimistic note. He was no Albert Camus. Good old Jack seems to have been quite a party-animal, perhaps even a bit too hedonistic for his fellow high churchmen. So in the novel, he lets one of the characters discover that the seemigly endless City of Hell is actually just a pinprick compared to the vastness of Heaven.In his heart, I think Lewis might have been a universalist after all.Goodspeed, Jack, wherever you are.Five stars!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I must say that it seems that any time anyone says something somewhat intellegent, It reminds me of C.S.Lewis. The Great Divorce is not just a book it's a progressive revelation. I'll be driving down the road thinking and all of a sudden understand what the heck he was talking about. Lewis was the master. I've read this book two and a half times and it isn't enough.Andrew Klicka"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"For some reason, I find myself returning to this book about once a year to re-read it. It's a short and easy read, but it's length is deceptive. Lewis is an excellent observer of the human condition and this allegory is very thought provoking. Written over 40 years ago, it still stays fresh.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"We all remember stories of The Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe, about Aslan and his famous victory over the Witch. The Great Divorce was something of a different nature. Lewis still had his ideas about heaven and hell, but they were a bit more obvious. There weren't a lot of undertones as in the children series, but everything he wrote was concrete and it was obvious what his views were. This made the book a lot better and I enjoyed it very much especailly the ending, showing Lewis' rather cruel humor and sense of style. If anyone likes Lewis I recommend this book and I would also recommend The Screwtape Letters. Then if you enjoyed Screwtape I would recommend This Present Darkness and it's sequel Piercing the Darkness by Frank Peretti."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I'm not usually a fan of allegories such as this. And, in truth, I'm not overly fond of this allegory either. It's not that Lewis' points aren't excellent ones. It's not that the story isn't interesting. I imagine it's because sometimes the points are so allegorical that I have to sit and think too long before I really understand what he's driving at, and I don't like to stop so often when I'm reading a narrative. Still, the metaphors are beautiful and often brilliant, and the book did hold my interest until the end. With a little patience, I'm sure I could have gotten a great deal more out of it. Those who choose to put in more effort than I would probably find it well worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If I had to choose only one book (excluding the Bible) as my all time favorite, this would be it. I was brought up as a Catholic and turned Protestant. This book helped put into perspective the concept of Purgatory and the idea that God does not send anyone to Hell, rather, they choose to go themselves. The imagery in this book is wonderful, the senarios are timeless. I have read this book many times, but I have to keep buying new copies because I love this book so much that I keep giving it to other people to read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is a fascinating, entertaining, short read about a group of travellers who take a bus excursion from hell into a place where they are given a chance to go into heaven. Surprisingly, they actually seem to prefer hell. This is not a book about what heaven is like or what hell is like. It's about people like us, and our choices, and how they affect our lives as eternal beings.Reading the dialogue as heavenly beings try to convince them to come to heaven, I found myself trying to keep track of who was the \\"right\\" person and who was \\"wrong\\", because the way the hell-people were talking was just the same way I talk! Of course, they seemed so stupid to me because I was on the heaven side of the book. But it reminded me of a quote from the movie The Truman Show (paraphrased): \\"I think what bothers you is that Truman prefers his cell.\\"These people lived in hell (and that description is interesting too) and they would rather go back there than swallow the pride that had made them reject God in the first place. One of Lewis' easier reads, for people who find him difficult to follow."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This week in class we read The Great Divorce. It's a great book and if you haven't read it... just... go read it.The book is about a bus that goes from hell to heaven. People from hell can get on the bus and go to heaven where people are waiting to greet them and convince them to let go of their sins and follow them to the mountains. The people who come from hell, however, are like ghosts against the landscape of heaven which is very hard. It is more real (hello, Plato!). Anyway, the narrator is met by George MacDonald, the Christian writer whose writing helped to convert/inspire C.S. Lewis.The thing about C.S. Lewis' view of hell is that it is essentially a hell of your own choosing. He takes human freedom so seriously that God's grace can ultimately do nothing about it.The interesting thing, which can be seen in other works by Lewis, is that all of the sins that keep people from hell are the deep sins that take a person over. Each person is very consumed by themselves. My personal favorite character is the Episcopal theologian who is so obsessed with the questioning and the prestige that he can get from coming up with new questions and theories that he forgets that the questioning should lead to answers.Interestingly, the one person who made it from hell to heaven was the person who had the sin of lust. The thing that I found interesting about all that is that if you looked at the media or even just what the Church focuses on, you would think that lust is the WORST SIN POSSIBLE. But, it is not all consuming like some of the other sins and, as I said, ultimately the person with the sin of lust is the only person who makes it to heaven.This is one of my personal C.S. Lewis favorites, the other being \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". If you like Lewis, you'll love these and if you haven't read anything by him, \\"The Great Divorce is a perfect place to start."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":". . .people send themselves there.Every moral choice one makes moves one either closer to God or farther away from Him. Finally, if one moves far enough away, one will be so far off that one cannot move back, and will have forgotten that it is possible, and will have forgotten that it is desirable.Yet God is always ready to give a person a chance to return to Him, and will help someone who really wants to be helped. But He will not force anyone. He has limited His omnipotence in this way as a sign of His love for us. (Remember that 1960s saying, \\"If you love something, set it free. If it comes back it will be yours forever.\\"?)Lewis has played with this concept fictionally in this work. Those who are in the edges of Hell--not so far away that they have lost all memory of God and the chance to return--are given a chance to come back to Him. But they must renounce everything that has come between them and Him--pride, envy, malice, greed, whatever. This is harder than it sounds. As sometimes a surgeon must cut off a limb to save a life, just as chemotherapy may be almost worse than cancer, so the renunciation of what keeps us away from God may be painful, but necessary.Of course, by stressing human free will, Lewis gives short shrift to divine soveregnty, as another reviewer remarks. But Lewis is not attempting a complete exposition of Christian doctrine here."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Though I've read many of C.S. Lewis' books multiple times, I just finished this one for the first time. How did I never read it sooner?The Great Divorce takes readers on a bus ride through an \\"imaginative supposal\\" (as Lewis put it) of the afterlife. The narrator travels from the grey city -- described later as either Purgatory or Hell, depending on where one ends up -- to the foothills of Heaven. Along the way, citizens of Heaven plead with those from Grey Town to turn away from the petty things that they cling to, and embrace the better, more Real life offered in the high country.The title of the book is an allusion to William Blake's \\"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\\". Lewis intends to show that one can only obtain eternal life and enter Heaven by completely divorcing oneself from all the attachments to things that we love more than God. Sometimes the things we hold on to are obviously sinful: lust, gambling, pride, etc. But sometimes -- perhaps even most of the time -- the things which keep people from coming to Christ are those things which seem like good things: love of one's children or country, for instance. It is as Tim Keller wrote in his recent book Counterfeit Gods: \\"Sin isn't only doing bad things, it is more fundamentally making good things into ultimate things. Sin is building your life and meaning on anything, even a very good thing, more than on God.\\"Many have criticized Lewis for his use of the term \\"Purgatory\\" to describe the state of those who are not in Heaven, but are being offered the chance to get there. Is this proof that he affirmed the Roman Catholic dogma of Purgatory?I don't think so. First of all, what is described in this book is certainly not a description of \\"Purgatory\\" that would please a Catholic. Whatever Lewis means by the word \\"Purgatory\\", it is certainly not the traditional Catholic understanding.Instead, I believe Lewis was using \\"Purgatory\\" as a literary device, meant to depict that our time here on Earth is the period during which we have the opportunity to purge the sin from our lives, divorcing ourselves from Hell and betrothing ourselves to Christ. For those who are being sanctified and made more like Christ, this world will become more and more like Heaven. For those who reject Christ's offer of salvation, life becomes Hell on Earth. In this way, what we make of our lives we will carry with us into eternity.In any event, this is a great novel, and worthy of your consideration."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If you have been introduced to the work of CS Lewis byMere Christianity,The Screwtape Letters: With Screwtape Proposes a ToastorThe Chronicles of Narnia, give yourself the delight of discovering his amazing other works--especially this gem THE GREAT DIVORCE. It might just change your life as it did mine. I first read this ideal book club selection 16 years ago while I was in seminary and this brief, 128 page book has flooded my mind ever since. Upon New Years 2010 I decided to read it again. To my amazement, the two characters I had thought the book centered around were only on THREE pages of the book. Clearly these characters (a ghost with an annoying red lizard on his shoulder whom he hated but tolerated because he wasn't ready to give it up) struck a cord in my life at that time. Lewis introduces this book as a fictional tale of the afterlife, purgatory if you will. We begin at a bus stop at dusk in a gray town of ghosts (who don't know they're ghosts). The adventure goes on from there as the ghosts go on a field trip where they are really going to meet spirits of friends gone before them who encourage them to walk away from their well guarded misery and choose joy in Heaven. Each ghost is told it is their choice to remain in hell, yet what we encounter is ghost after ghost who sadly chooses to hold onto their anger, bitterness, pride, envy, pity, grudges, celebrity, and bickering rather than give it all up for the gift of heaven right in front of their eyes. As you read the pages you will see glimpses of many people you know and yes, even of yourself....perhaps that is why for 16 years I remembered the book as being about these two little characters who only took up 3 pages--it must have reminded me of annoying things I've been holding on to rather than laying them down before God. It's an easy, quick read, unlike Lewis' MERE CHRISTIANITY, and yet you'll ponder it long after."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"It is understandably difficult to offer an accurate depiction of any existence beyond that which humans experience on a daily basis. Fortunately for the reader of this text, Mr. Lewis claims to do no such thing. Yes, within this work the main character finds himself in Heaven, as well as Hell; however, it is this reviewer's opinion that the descriptions of these places are far from that which the work is intended to convey. Rather, it is that which this character observes and comes to understand while in these places that carries the weight of the message.In his typical, albeit masterful, fashion, Mr. Lewis presents the reality of decisions made by every individual. In this case, such decisions expand beyond the temporal and into the realm of the eternal. Within this work, the point is clearly made that indecision is a decision in itself and that the decision to decide or not to decide must be made just as any other seemingly harmless decision if ultimate good is to be attained; perhaps in the form of a Heavenly existence. That is, there must be a complete and total surrender to good which can continuously lead to greater good, as opposed to evil or lingering indecisiveness which, while detrimental actions, behaviors, and/or perceptions can be rectified, can never transform into good simply by pressing onward.Mr. Lewis vividly illustrates many of the snares which may disallow an attainment of that which is, ultimately, happiness through the means of intriguing character interactions and dialog incorporated within an extremely enjoyable and readable storyline. While Heaven and Hell might be little more than an abstract thought to many, if not most; Mr. Lewis has, yet again, applied a brilliant mind to difficult concepts in such a way that the message is made readily accessible to anyone that is fortunate enough to acquire a copy of this text. The message, however, could be easily missed, misunderstood, or lost by those that do not believe in the eternal consequences of decisions. Nonetheless, this is a must read for those that do subscribe to this belief and may prove to be, at least, thought provoking for those that do not."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This little book is a total joy to read. I know that the author makes it very clear that one should not suppose that he is factually presenting details of the afterlife, yet, in the end he has created a most satisfying image of a plausible afterlife. As for the title, he is referring to the poet-mystic William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell. He points out that this is a synthesis that can never be, for to do so would compromise the absolute Goodness of Heaven, thereby making a Hell of both. Perhaps there can one day be a marriage of Heaven and Earth (thereby showing both to really have been Heaven all along), but never of Heaven and Hell.I loved the imagery of Hell being very much like a never-ending city on Earth where it is always twilight and eternal night always on the verge. Yet, it is not a crowded city for people keep moving apart because they cannot stand each other's presence. That's just it. People dwell in Hell by their own choice. It is the obsessions that separate them from God and the highest reality that keep them from leaving. It is even shown that such higher impulses as love and pity, if unhealthily indulged in for their own sake and for nothing higher or transcendent, can keep you in Hell. Yet, this Hell is also Purgatory for those who workout their obsessions. In fact, there is a regular bus service to Heaven for fieldtrips that serve just that purpose (I always suspected that the omnibus originated in Hades.)As for Heaven, it is perpetually just the moment before dawn and eternal day. The idea that Heaven is actually more substantial than Hell, or Earth, is reasonable, since it is after all the more Real of the two being closer to the Creator. Indeed, the visitors from Hell appear as pale and insubstantial deformed ghosts who find the adamantine hardness and density of the higher plane physically painful (even walking upon the grass.) The residents of the realm however are radiant spirits who do everything that they can to point out the mistakes and illusions that the ghostly visitors still cling to- and which are the only thing keeping them from traveling higher up and farther in to the one true goal. The most detailed and believable of these tutelary spirits is Lewis' own spriritual mentor, George Macdonald."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis had a knack of titling his works with either extreme modesty or with seemingly unrelated terms. This is the case with \\"The Great Divorce,\\" which sounds like a romance novel, but is meant to reveal the separate nature of the two realms of Heaven and Hell, yet speaks very little to the actual content of the work.The short fictional piece is a fantastic journey through, what at first could be taken as any dreary British town, complete with gray architecture and quarreling citizens. Until the point when the bus on which these citizens are riding is lifted off the ground, the reader may take the setting to be home. The setting is definitely not home, but the personalities are the same. The characters throughout are used as a way to illustrate good and bad behavior and that which would get you in to the grand and beautiful Heaven or leave you in the small, pointless, and gray Hell.Lewis is entertaining and thoughtful and once again comes up with brilliant points about human nature and the moral law, including Christianity (though this is but a subtle underlying theme). One interesting point Lewis makes that people will relate to is that given the clear choice between going to Heaven or Hell based on their beliefs, people will insist on maintaining their irrational beliefs and actually choose a pointless and brutal, yet familiar, Hell.This is a great one-day read and part of a collection of Lewis' work that cannot be overestimated."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book became an instant favorite with me because of Lewis' amazing originality and thought-provoking ideas. Though many of the scenarios are, by his own admission, not truly his views of heaven and hell, they remain excellent and creative ways of causing the reader to evaluate other ideas and concepts. Lewis' creativity shines through in this little book more than any of his other books."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Clives Staples Lewis was born in Belfast in 1898 and died on Nov. 22, 1963. In between those two dates of beginning and ending Lewis wrote immortal works such as \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" and other fantasies as well as several Christian apologetic works including \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" and \\"The Aboliton of Man.\\"This book is a short tour through the regions of hell and heaven as Lewis hops a supernatural taxi to the lands beyondmortality.The work is a tour de force as Lewis meets several hellishindividuals who have become ghosts and dwell in the nether regions due to their sinfulness and refusal to repent.The journey to heaven is a joy ride as Lewis insists the Christian life is one of joyful faith.If you have not read Lewis or are seeking an intellectual who believed Christ then Lewis is the man for you! Like Aslan in the Chronicles of Narnia he roared out his belief !A classic of the Christian apologetic tradition."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is an enlightening novel. I began the book thinking it would be something like Dante. However, after the first thirty or forty pages I could tell it was different, but only near the end did I realize how different it was from Dante. The difference stems from the difference in their viewpoints of hell. I believe that Lewis sees hell as a separation from God while Dante sees hell as a place of torment for nonbelievers. Lewis, therefore, deals with reasons why some people will be separated from God. The narrator in the novel overhears conversations between people from hell visiting with souls from Heaven. The Great Divorce attempts to show why \\"good\\" people may end up in hell. The people the narrator overhears are not the stereotypical \\"bad\\" people who we \\"know\\" are going to hell. He attempts to show the pride, bitterness, or sin of the \\"good\\" people who most assume do not deserve hell. I enjoyed this novel. A common objection to the Christian Faith: Why a loving God would send good people to hell. Lewis attempts to show why. I recommend buying this novel, and I have already given my copy to a friend."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"With clear moral and spiritual insight, Lewis delves into what keeps man from God. Using a mythical bus trip from Hell to Heaven, he shows what humans have to sacrifice on the way to Heaven. While, some say Lewis is a bit cold in this book, I disagree. Lewis merely shows that even the best virtuals can be twisted into vices. Like men who kill innocents in the name of God, or the stalker who terroizes the one he &quot;loves&quot;. The major problem is that like the Screwtape Letters it is more piercing than we would like, but just as piercing as we need."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If you don't care for C.S. Lewis, you will not care for this book. On the other hand, if you like C.S. Lewis (and appreciate what he was up to) you may thoroughly enjoy, even love, this book. I say \\"may\\" because an honest reading of this short allegory can reveal a great deal about the author's soul and view of the moral universe and something about the reader's own soul and views as well. In other words, it can entertain or disturb or both. It will, in any case, provoke a great deal of thought for any reader who bothers to think at all.I read The Great Divorce many, many years ago and could never forget it; some of its images and episodes were and remain indelible. By some quirk or inspiration, I recently suggested using it for an adult Sunday School class of folks who love good, mental exercise, good literature, etc. and thus got back into it - big time. In preparing ten lessons on the book, I rediscovered why I loved it in the first place but then I also discovered a myriad of rich nuggets and not a few whole veins that I had completely blitzed by in the earlier reading. This second time I found it to be absolutely magnificent and have gone from being a CS Lewis fan to a serious and devoted student of the whole \\"mythopoeic\\" approach that he (along with many others, including now, most famously, JK Rowling) have championed.You don't have to be well read or a Christian or an intellectual or a theologian or a Bible scholar or even a full grown adult to truly enjoy - or be really bothered by - this book. The premise, after all, is that not everyone would enjoy a holiday in the Valley of the Shadow of Life (post-mortem or otherwise), much less a few hours with C.S. Lewis himself. (It does help things, however, to have a good imagination and sense of humor.)Like scripture, like great poetry, like any of those guys in my title (all of whom are embedded in the text and context of this book), this book and everything else I've read by Lewis is worth reading ...and worth reading (including reeading) carefully and soulfully."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A gray man, in a gray city waits with other gray people for a gray bus. This is the opening of C.S. Lewis' THE GREAT DIVORCE, Lewis' allegory on Heaven and Hell. This isn't the Hell of Dante or Revelations, filled with fire and brimstone; this is a Hell that is the complete and total absence of God. This is a Hell that is of one's own making, the only options are to totally embrace God's love or continue to hold on to those earthly wants and desires that we all possess and remain trapped. According to Lewis, these choices are mutually exclusive; this is not a \\"cafeteria\\" relationship where one can pick and choose.Arriving at a place midway between Heaven and Hell the travelers meet various guides that have come to help move them closer to God and Heaven. Lewis creates a series of dialogues between the travelers and guides to address the questions many have regarding earthly matters and be shown how utterly insignificant they are. Choices are then made to continue to move towards God or turn back to the grayness.In his other works, Lewis has explored this vision of God, a God who is not indifferent to us but One that expects, at the very least, we make the effort to accept Him and receive the fulfillment that can only be found in His embrace. THE GREAT DIVORCE is a fine work; easily read and very clear in its presentation; this is a book to be read by any age that's ready to explore the relationship of God and man, Heaven and Hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"&quot;There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \`They will be done,' and those to whom God says \`They will be done'.&quot;This is a quote from this little volume, and effectively sums up the entire book in that one sentence. THE GREAT DIVORCE, like Lewis's TILL WE HAVE FACES, is his song of songs, his great achievement. Tolkien's was LORD OF THE RINGS, Adams' WATERSHIP DOWN, Sinclair Lewis' MAIN STREET. These novels are generally regarded as their major works. This little book, published in a little periodical called The Guardian, is one such book. (It was this periodical that Lewis's classic book THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS also appeared). Sadly, SCREWTAPE, though excellent in and of itself, is often given much more credit than this, which is a deeper work (and to those who know THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, know what a feat that is).Perhaps one reason that this work is such an excellent little volume is its length of gestation: it was concieved in 1931 and written in 1944. Insipred by a sermon found in Jeremy Taylor's WORKS, suggested such a premise as to think, or take, the absuridity of damned souls getting a real refreshment from hell. Also another source was the fourth centru Latin poet named Prudentius Aurelius Clemens (his contribution can be found in &quot;Hymn for the Lighting of the Lamp). Assuredly, one of the reasons that it took so long to be written (the first known written account is a diary entry by his brother Warnen on Paril 15, 1932) is he had not had it visualized. In terms of inspiration his fiction arose from &quot;seeing pictures&quot; in his mind. (Example: One of his images he received when he was about 16, and it was a faun with parcels in one hand and an umbrella in the other, standing in a wintery, snow laden forest).Much of this short little novel has a direct comparison or parellel to Dante's DIVINE COMEDY. Just like Beatrice to Dante, so also was George MacDonald to C. S. Lewis. MacDonald was almost a Universalist. He believed most of the world populace would submit and enter into joy, and know God's love. A lot of this would occur after death. According to Sayer, Lewis did not believe this, but thought it was a possibility (much my view on purgatory). What Lewis had to do was to rectify this belief with the others of purgatory, hell, heaven, predestination, damnation, etc. How he did so was a stroke of genius: he made hell and purgatory the same place. To those who would leave and give up a vice, it was only purgatory; but to those who were determined to keep their wickedness, instead of entering into joy, were damned. To enter into Heaven, the only prerequiste was to give up a vice. That was all. Some lust, some apostasty, some selfishness and false love (the mother Pam for her son Michael). Just like Dante, Lewis has an Apostate Anglican bishop in there.One of the things that he has done most brillantly is the potrayal of the Platonic belief that the essence of something is more real than the thing itself. Virture is more real that the vitrue that is practiced. Everything in God is much more real and tangible than hell, and Lewis does this marvelously. A device he borrowed from a writer whose name was unknown to him, Lewis made everything very, very real, and the damned men and women were but ghosts in that heavenly place. Each had an accompaning Spirit, one who has surrendered to God. In that place, the ones saved are real and can bend the grass and walk and swim, but always traveling further up and further in (to borrow a Narnian phrase, although it equally applies here). To aid the damned, the real, the saved, must go back and forsake their journey for a time, to aid those that will.One of the grandest scenes is toward the very last, in which a lady named Sarah is seen. In this, another of his master's ideals is expressed. Sarah Smith is no great woman by earth's standards, but she is so close to God, everyone she meets she changes for the better. God wants to use you, not only for his own intimate purposes, but for you also to update and bring the quality of the life for others around you to a much better place. Her whole train of follows is transformed by her love, because she allows God to work through her, and submitted to her; in turn, she transforms others, because she is a yielded vessel. Macdonald states of her &quot;There's joy enough in the little finger of a great saint such as yonder lady to waken all the dead things of the universe into life&quot;. Likewise, because of Lewis being yielded to God, this book has a similar effect (as, perhaps, all of his books do -- I cannot say all because I have not read all).Ultimately, the entire point of this beautiful little book is that there could be no damnation without free choice. God made us to fellowship with us, not to damn us to hell. We are to enter into joy - but because we live in a fallen world, we might choose to hang onto some vice instead of entering into joy. Joy, that grand and beautiful intimacy with the Lord, real satisfying water that will forever quench your thirst, that is what C. S. Lewis is about. Let us not choose to stay in Hell. But one must understand this - Lewis is not advocating there is such a thing as bus rides to hell. The novel is, of course, but a dream. It is no way an examination of what lies after we die, although it does give thought to MacDonald's view on Universalism, though Lewis did not hold that view himself. Enter into joy, dear child, and meet Christ."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The perfect blend of logic, common-sense, and insight, the Great Divorce is typical CS Lewis. It is a masterpiece of Christian thinking, even by Lewis's standards, and ranks among his best in my opinion. This short work of fiction seeks to explain why some people go to heaven and others go to hell. Lewis's thesis is essentially this: those who are in heaven are there because they want to be, and those who are in hell are there because they want to be there, too. In other words, Divine judgment does not send individuals screaming down to hell--in fact, they go there themselves.Lewis's guide in the story, who just happens to be George MacDonald, tells him that most people have the attitude best expressed by Milton in Paradise Lost: \\"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.\\" According to Lewis, it is pride and selfishness that keep people from wanting to go to heaven. In the story, a number of \\"ghosts\\" are brought to the outskirts of heaven by bus, yet almost none of them wants to actually enter heaven when given the chance. They all have some reason why heaven isn't good enough, why they shouldn't go there. In other words, they willfully go back to hell.Of course, this story rocks the traditional views of the separation of the good and the evil, but Lewis presents his thesis in such an applicable story that it makes one stop and think. Why would a selfish, self-centered person want to be in heaven, anyway? What would they do? In Lewis's mind, there is no \`marriage' between heaven and hell, because the two (and those who occupy them) want to keep as much distance between them as possible. Hence the title.As I said, I think this is one of Lewis's best. It definitely got me thinking. This is a great book, suitable for young adults and adults alike, that will certainly expand your mind on how we choose to live in our own personal heaven or hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"We who still live on Earth will probably never see another C.S. Lewis. The man was in a category all by himself. Most writers live to write ONE great work...Lewis wrote many including the Narnia Chronicles (NOT just for children!), The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity and many, many others. The Great Divorce is my second favorite Lewis work, just (barely) behind Till We Have Faces. Lewis introduces the work by citing Blake's concept of the marriage of heaven and hell, then writing about their divorce. Many of the details of the book have been cited by other reviewers, so I will only add that the book is a wonderful, thoughtful portrait of the human condition from the mind of a brilliant thinker. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The blurb of the edition that I grew up with says, &quot;Few know that from Hell one can can take a day excursion by bus to the outskirts of Heaven. The author finds himself, in this fantasy, taking such a trip....&quot; with interesting results. Hell itself is interesting--despite a previous reviewer's comments, Lewis's vision of Hell is not quite the traditional one. Lewis in the book, once in Heaven, becomes more or less a bystander, watching angels meet the others who have taken the trip from Hell and trying to convince them to give up, again in the words of the blurb, &quot;their most precious sins,&quot; those things they insist on keeping even at the cost of eternal joy. Twerpy as that seems, it becomes all too believable as encounter after encounter takes place. These are superb. There is the Tragedian, who uses 'his manly, bullying tone--the one for bringing women to their senses;' the chattering woman; the man in the grip of lust, a little lizard--'I promise I won't do it anymore. I'll give you nice dreams, sweet and fresh and almost innocent. You might say, quite innocent...;' the Big Man; and (best of all!) the Apostate Bishop, with his theory about Jesus, who was 'a comparatively young man when he died. He would have outgrown some of his views, you know, if he'd lived. I shall point out how this deepens the significance of the Crucifixion...&quot;(point out, I should say, to his theology study group in Hell). The descriptions are fantastic, the comments on target; even if the reader doesn't agree with Lewis's views in general, he or she will recognize human nature in the characters, drawn with a very steady and sure hand."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis explains things about heaven, hell and the like in the form of a novella in this book. It uses great imagery and symbols to grasp spiritual and deeper concepts.

It is worth buying and reading over and over."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I decided to pick up The Great Divorce after a 15-year hiatus when I saw a play based on this work. The play was splendid, so I decided to reread this short but power-packed book. Based on the decisions made by the characters who made the bus trip to a place between heaven and hell, I decided that not much has changed since Lewis' day (or since I last read this). Some very insightful comments are made, and I found myself challenged in several ways. Lewis has a way of putting things that, though complex, he makes sound almost simple. I appreciate his insights and hope that I can apply some of the lessons into the last half of my life. I'm grateful to people like Lewis when they are able to have such an impact in the way I think. Definitely one of my top five Lewis favorites."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I'm not ordinarily interested in fantasy, but I liked C.S. Lewis's book The Great Divorce.

It's full of powerful dream-like imagery and I found myself having to read a number of pages twice in that -- it is just so -- intense. Imagery, beyond the best imagery of Pink Floyd, Alice in Wonderland, or miles and miles of melting clocks.Imagery of life and...time. Lewis has us look at our lives -- through the lens of time -- but from an eternal position.The characters in the book are so pathetic and yet so familiar to my life -- which is unsettling.It's a powerful book and I think Lewis' storytelling (opposed to preaching / teaching) is enormously enlightening when the topic is spiritually heavy. I remember thinking this (the storytelling aspect) may have been why Christ used parables to teach."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In The Great Divorce the narrator takes a bus trip to Heaven. He travels with people with a variety of beliefs. When he arrives he realizes he is insubstantial; he, like the other passengers, is a Ghost. They are met by inhabitants of Heaven - Spirits, or Solids - who come to this pickup point to guide them in the new land. The passengers have the opportunity to go back, or to become more substantial here, if they make the rest of the difficult journey. The passengers confront those matters that have gotten in their way to God. This may be refusing to forgive someone, loving someone more than God, or self-pity to the point of denial that the joy of Heaven could exist, or a refusal to take part in it. In every situation, it is the person's choice.The story is another spiritual journey, a common subject to Lewis, as is shown in Pilgrim's Regress and The Chronicles of Narnia. Like Pilgrim's Regress, this story takes after Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. For example, the journey, once arrived in Heaven, is to a mountain. The Great Divorce differs from Regress in its conversational tone and address of everyday living. Regress addresses philosophies; Divorce addresses common beliefs and behaviors, in a way that Screwtape Letters does. The former work is more academic than the latter."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I read this gem of a book on a lark. But it drew me in and kept my attention from beginning to end.

The central characteristic in each of us is Free Will and our daily choices to embrace God or not.

He sees the reality of Hell as a place where people choose to go, and Heaven as another possible choice. Through encounters with several spirits and help from his teacher, George MacDonald, Lewis learns how different attitudes toward God affect eternity.To use an image from the book, I've always found this book useful as a lens to see things more clearly."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I already liked C.S. Lewis, but had never read this book before now. It is about life and death, physical and spiritual, as well as our choices regarding God, good and evil. Being a rather small book, this surprised me. It is written somewhat, in a story format. Still, it makes one think very hard, and in ways one may not normally think. Lewis reminds us once again that life is more than meets the eye, and that our choices in this life count not only for this life, but the hereafter. I still like C.S. Lewis, even more so now. I appreciate how his writings cause me to think on the important things in life, regardless if I may agree with him or not. Heaven and hell are discussed, and more than once I was taken aback at how he looks at humanity, and man's problems, etc. A must read, only make sure you read it all the way through to the end, as well as read the preface."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This must be the singal greatest work I have ever read, and definatly cements C.S. Lewis' place in twentieth century literature. The book is an amazing examination of religion, what makes us human, philosophy, and so much more. It provides an unparralelled picture of how we should live. An excelent, even life changing read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Upon finishing a 2nd reading of this book, I don't know where to begin. It takes some time to get a reasonable hold of the world and methodology Lewis is employing, but once you do, the book is fascinating. In keeping with custom, Lewis is tremendously skilled here in discussing an idea indirectly, either through metaphor, fiction, etc. While this book is enjoyable to read, it's deadly serious, and one must pay close attention to every detail. The images, actions, and dialogues are dripping with import, and one would be hard pressed not to see at least of bit of himself in the characters. Lewis' thesis of heaven/hell being extensions or thresholds of earth is just brilliant. While I'm not sure if I agree with every facet of Lewis' tale, I cannot deny how penetrating this work is. From the perspective of eternity, we are forced to examine our notions our love, loyalty, joy, goodness, morality, and life itself. This is yet another of Lewis' works that alternately leaves you chuckling to yourself (as he sheds light on the absurd manner in which we often live our lives), and then sitting back, looking up, dropping your pencil, and then thinking - often disturbed - about the implications of what he suggests. [Speaking of pencils, I would recommend reading this with one.] I cannot overstate that although this book is \\"nice to read\\", the topic is of chilling importance, as our very lives and souls hang in the balance."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It says in imagery and dialogue what I wish I could in a sermon. It shows the fundamental divorce between those that know God and those that don't. Those who have in the final analysis given up their selfishness indeed become \\"solid\\" people who are able to \\"journey into the mountains\\" for eternity, transformed and glorious. Those that retain their selfishness stay entrapped in an smokish, empty hell due to their own obstinacy and refusal to come to the truth.In response to another reviewer, CS Lewis absolutely smokes William Blake when it comes to representing Christianity. Blake simply conjures up his own religion in his book \\"Marriage of Heaven and Hell.\\" For example, he dialogues with the Biblical prophets Isaiah and Ezekial, and makes them say things that are simply heretical.CS Lewis' objective, on the other hand, was not simply to make up a fantasy based on his own shoddy metaphysics and obscure philosophies, but was, in response to Blake, to illuminate orthodox theology in an imaginative way, hoping to lead people to truth.Blake's writings are dangerous if you aren't familiar with Christian teachings, and I would discourage anyone looking for God to look at William Blake. They amount to not much more than the primacy and fulfillment of the natural self, whereas Lewis (and in fact the Christian premise) turns on the ultimate denial of self, in order to find the reality of the kingdom of heaven.I would encourage everyone to read The Great Divorce by CS Lewis as a visionary book. Though fiction, it gives us some helpful pictures to think about what in fact may be going on in eternity."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Cold, gray, you might get a chill just reading this book. CS Lewis uses a clever story to convey a different, though no less frightening scenario of hell and Heaven. This book will not only make you re-think your life after death.....it will challenge you to consider giving greater meaning to your life right now.The brilliance of Lewis is that he was able to convey his message equally well through non-fiction or fiction. Mere Christianity or The Great Divorce, both take different paths to the same destination...the need for God, for Christ in our lives. And the consequences of living our lives thoughtlessly or thoughtfully."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The format of the story is this:A bunch of &quot;ghosts&quot; board a bus in a dreary, drizzly town which is in perpetual twilight (we later learn that this place is &quot;the valley of the shadow of death&quot;). This flying bus takes them up to a bright (as in &quot;a minute or two before sunrise&quot;) natural setting (which we later learn is &quot;the valley of the shadow of life&quot;). Here the narrator (presumably Lewis himself) sees how without substance the ghosts (including himself) really are. They are not even substantial enough to bend the grass beneath their feet. Some of them are barely visible. They are met by &quot;spirits&quot; (each ghost has a specific spirit coming to meet him/her) who are bright and solid.The narrator describes each &quot;interview&quot; he sees between ghost and spirit. Each interview highlights a specific manifestation of pride, greed, selfishness, pettyness, manipulation - any of the sins that weigh us down. Eventually, the narrator meets the spirit sent for him (writer George MacDonald).If you read this book, you will see a lot of people you know.If you read this book HONESTLY, you will find pieces of yourself as well.This book is a magnificent moral story. An absolute must read!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In reading this tale of a visit to the lands outside heaven, one cannot help but see himself and those around him in the characters in book.

Lewis's brand of science fiction/Christian fiction. It is not so much that I can not appreciate his writing as that I have trouble picturing the fantastic concepts that Lewis paints. This being said, I was able to take quite a lot from this book.In \\"The Great Divorce\\", the narrator dreams he has taken a bus ride that allows him a visit to eternity. Visiting both heaven and hell, Lewis paints a picture that in some ways reminds me of the movie \\"What Dreams May Come\\". Beneath the imagery is a morality play in which people's choices have consequences. Some people make choices that put them in a position that causes harm to their soul which can be healed if they are made to see their fault. The most famous line of the book epitomizes the concept: \\"thy will be done\\" or \\"Thy will be done\\".Readers need not accept the imagery created in this book to appreciate the messages. Choices have consequences for our soul. The correct choices decrease the burden on our soul and allow us the opportunity of eternal life in paradise."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis' \\"The Great Divorce\\" may be the most unusual book you will ever read. Beyond allegory, beyond fantasy, this look at the nature of Heaven, Hell, and the denizens of both has radically altered the view of what happens after we die in the lives of more people than any book you will encounter.Lewis provides an utterly original view of the afterlife through the mechanism of a bus trip from Hell to Heaven. The portrayals of the vast, nearly-empty city in Hell and a Heaven more real and solid than our reality are so profound that many will find their thoughts on the two places forever altered.Also included is an examination of the question that has haunted many: \\"How can a loving God send people to Hell?\\" Lewis brilliantly answers this in a way that is completely satisfying to even the most demanding inquirer. You'll have to read the book to see.There are so many gems in \\"The Great Divorce\\" that any further discussion would spoil the book. But suffice it to say, this work of fiction may be the greatest ever written for provoking long and enjoyable discussions with others. As a worthy diversion from more heady small group studies, it is without peer."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"You always hear about people talking about life-changing books. Perhaps I greeted this with a certain degree of incredulity. Surely they were referring to books they simply liked, or maybe even loved?That was before I happened upon this book. It was recommended to me by a minister and director of a youth organization where I volunteered several years ago. And it isn't until now that I completed it. But I can finally say that I have encountered a book that has truly sparked cause for me to take a look back on my life.Lewis takes the reader on a bus ride from hell to heaven, or rather the Valley of the Shadow of Heaven. In heaven we see that all who took the bus ride are merely Ghosts here: ethereal figures. They are greeted by Spirits, people of light and substance who have accepted God as their ultimate Love. The Ghosts are given the choice to continue on to Heaven, or take the bus back to Hell. The path to Heaven won't be without pain, as the Ghosts must give up the earthly vices they have made their God.Lewis' talent is in depicting so well the nature of humans. Don't expect to see the Ghosts' vices being anything so simple as hate for someone. Rather in one instance it is a mother's love for her son that keeps her from choosing Heaven, a love that blinds her from the ultimate love of God. I see so much of myself in these &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and Lewis paints a very compassionate picture of the &quot;damned&quot; (they need not be if they choose not to be). Lewis' book in a sense almost helps you to step outside yourself and look with less clouded vision on the person you are. It is for this reason this has become my favorite work."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This brilliant little piece of literature takes only an hour or two to read, but will foster a lifetime of contemplation and thought concerning heaven and hell. What if God gave people in hell (which, in the novel, is a gray, drab, lonely place) a second chance at heaven? Would they take it, or would they desperately hang on to their miserable lives, which is a hell in itself? Lewis, in his &quot;dream&quot;, sees a procession of people who are given that chance and, sadly, hardly any take it. That illustrates what I've always believed about hell: God doesn't send you there, you basically send yourself by rejecting His free gift of salvation. To those &quot;ghosts&quot; in hell, heaven is actually a scary place, at least at first. Most don't want to go any further past the &quot;hard part&quot; to the glories that reside up the &quot;mountain&quot;. Some may get a little tripped up by the rather unorthodox theological implications, but don't let that hinder you. Just enjoy the ride, and let it speak deeply to your spirit."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"THE GREAT DIVORCE is remarkable for being a book by C. S. Lewis that is as likely to be criticized by Christians as by non-Christians. While MERE CHRISTIANITY is an apology for traditional Christianity, THE PROBLEM OF PAIN an attempt to deal with problems in theodicy, and THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS a help for analyzing psychological dimensions of temptation, THE GREAT DIVORCE can best be described as speculative theology. This is not the only place where Lewis allows himself to speculate on matters theological. For instance, he elsewhere suggests that pets and other animals who have interacted with humans will go to heaven, while wild animals will not, because these animals have gained a personality through human contact. In this work, Lewis speculates about the nature of the afterlife.Inevitably, Lewis's work will unfairly be compared to Dante, who like Lewis is granted a visit to the afterlife. It is unfair because Dante's DIVINE COMEDY is without debate one or the two or three greatest masterpieces in the history of world literature. THE GREAT DIVORCE is not even one of Lewis's best works. Still, as long as one does not force Lewis's work to compare favorably to Dante's work, the comparison is not uninstructive. Like Dante, Lewis finds a guide. While Dante is shown through Hell and Purgatory by Virgil and through heaven by Beatrice, Lewis's guide is the Scottish theologian and fantasy writer George MacDonald. This is not inappropriate for a couple of reasons. What Lewis is suggesting about heaven and hell in THE GREAT DIVORCE is not precisely orthodox, and MacDonald himself, while devoutly religious, was somewhat heterodox in his advocacy of universalism, i.e., the belief that all humans will be redeemed, and not only Christian believers.In THE GREAT DIVORCE Lewis tries to take a midpoint between universalism and a traditional belief in eternal damnation in hell of unbelievers. Lewis is hardly the first to attempt this. Origen, the brilliant if eccentric father of the early church, among other things toyed with the idea that being sent to hell might not be a permanent state. Lewis attempts to preserve the notion of the punishment of sins, but shifts the agent of that punishment from God to the individual involved. Basically, people place themselves in hell and prevent themselves from ascending to heaven. All one need do is surrender one's will to God, and cease insisting on one's own conception of things. In a sense, the primary thing an individual can do to receive grace, even in the next world, is to humble oneself.The great negative to Lewis's view is that it doesn't correspond terribly well with either the views of the New Testament or to traditional Church teaching. The great advantage is that it absolves God of any complicity in sending people to hell. A host of factors will determine whether one will find one or either of these views desirable. Like George MacDonald, I tend to be quite orthodox on most Christian doctrines, but somewhat heterodox on the issue of the damnation of the unsaved. I personally am quite drawn to Lewis's views on the afterlife, and while I concede that they don't mesh well with the Bible's teachings on hell, I believe they mesh well with the Bible's teachings on the loving nature of God. It solves some key issues at the heart of theodicy, or to paraphrase Milton, it justifies the ways of God to men.Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with Lewis, this marvelous book raises some important theological questions. It also complicates the normal picture of Lewis as a staunch defender of traditionalism. We find in it that Lewis was also a bit of a theological rebel."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This little book is a total joy to read. I know that the author makes it very clear that one should not suppose that he is factually presenting details of the afterlife, yet, in the end he has created a most satisfying image of a plausible afterlife. As for the title, he is referring to the poet-mystic William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell. He points out that this is a synthesis that can never be, for to do so would compromise the absolute Goodness of Heaven, thereby making a Hell of both. Perhaps there can one day be a marriage of Heaven and Earth (thereby showing both to really have been Heaven all along), but never of Heaven and Hell.I loved the imagery of Hell being very much like a never-ending city on Earth where it is always twilight and eternal night always on the verge. Yet, it is not a crowded city for people keep moving apart because they cannot stand each other's presence. That's just it. People dwell in Hell by their own choice. It is the obsessions that separate them from God and the highest Reality that keep them from leaving. It is even shown that such higher impulses as love and pity, if unhealthily indulged in for their own sake and for nothing higher or transcendent, can keep you in Hell. Yet, this Hell is also Purgatory for those who workout their obsessions. In fact, there is a regular bus service to Heaven for fieldtrips that serve just that purpose (I always suspected that the omnibus originated in Hades.)As for Heaven, it is perpetually just the moment before dawn and eternal day. The idea that Heaven is actually more substantial than Hell, or Earth, is reasonable, since it is after all the more Real of the two being closer to the Creator. Indeed, the visitors from Hell appear as pale and insubstantial deformed ghosts who find the adamantine hardness and density of the higher plane physically painful (even walking upon the grass.) The residents of the realm however are radiant spirits who do everything that they can to point out the mistakes and illusions that the ghostly visitors still cling to- and which are the only thing keeping them from traveling higher up and farther in to the one true goal. The most detailed and believable of these tutelary spirits is Lewis' own spriritual mentor, George Macdonald."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book is a psychological masterpiece. The dialogues are pure genius. Lewis' skeptical biographer, A. N. Wilson, acknowledging his wit, thought Lewis' parodies cruel. But is it cruel to warn of the corruption of the soul, in a way that might lead to healing? We may see the characters described here in the &quot;real world&quot; around us. Lewis is hoping, of course, that we will recognize some shadow of ourselves, and recognize our need of God's help in attaining freedom.Lewis warns in the preface that his purpose is not to promote speculation about the nature of heaven and hell. Still, the book is very thought-provoking on that count as well. This book might be helpful to someone who is trying to reconcile the love of God with the Christian doctrine of hell, as it was to M. Scott Peck, for example.A few days ago I saw an interview of a great character actress who, when asked what she would like to hear God say when she arrived at the gate of heaven, replied, &quot;Everybody in.&quot; The audience applauded loudly. Lewis, noting the remark of Milton's devil that it is &quot;better to reign in hell than serve in heaven,&quot; in effect poses the question, &quot;What if not everybody wants in?&quot; Or as Jesus put it, what if, when the invitation to the wedding of the Lamb arrives at our door, we are busy with livestock and real estate transactions, and we decide to stay home?"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As Lewis says in his introduction, there are a couple of ways of looking at our journey through life. The first is a circle from which we all stat on the perimeter and wind up in the center. The other view, which Lewis and I hold, is that of a road with forks in it every mile or so and we are forced to choose between the two paths. In the first view we all end up in the same place while in the later view we may end up in different places, depending on our choices. If one of those places is hell, it raises the question of how a loving God could allow some to go to hell. This book is the best answer to that paradox that I have read. In short, Lewes shows that those who go to hell do so of their own free choice, but more interestingly he uses various characters to show the type of person who chooses hell over haven and why they chose hell."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The theologian who would rather lead a theological discussion in hell than experience heaven?The poet who is always slighted, never appreciated?The man who is too proud to accept any \\"bleeding charity\\" and must have his \\"rights\\"?The artist who would rather fight for his style of art than stay and take in true beauty?The materialist (entrepeneur?) who would rather try to take a bit of heaven back to hell for a proffit than enjoy the real thing?The cynic who believes everything is a sham?The grumbler who has finally become a grumble?

Of course, Lewis does not address or claim to address all the questions or attempt a comprehensive thesis on heaven and hell.What he does discuss adroitly are the choices that people make and the grace that God gives to all people to accept his gift of salvation or to reject it.By using various characters faced with the decision of heaven or hell with different perspectives, Lewis shows the flawed logic, spirituality, views of God and selves, etc that cause people to reject God and all of his goodness. He also shows how a person can relinquish pride and self-righteousness to enter heaven by accepting God's gift.This is a stimulating story that also serves as apologetic and defense of Christian principles without being overtly religious or theological.The reader for the cd version dramatizes the characters and enhances the writing.Craig Stephans, author of Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis always fascinates. In this easy-to-read small volume, he takes us through a fictional dream about the afterlife. Starting in a dark, rainy and grimy town, he boards a bus that takes him and a number of grumbly souls for a trip to heaven. There, they meet relatives and friends who try to get them to stay. It's Lewis's perceptive genius that his lost souls are rarely inherently wicked, but have turned back on themselves and away from the ultimate source of love. There's the mother who demands to see her long-lost son; the wife who intends to continue improving her husband in the afterlife; the well-meaning religious person who is more interested in lecturing about God than experiencing God firsthand. To the saved, the dark town is only a purgatory - the place where they finally shuck their human attachments. To the lost, even heaven itself seems like hell, and they long to return to their gray and dismal existences.Other than a line or two here and there, as with the mention of Purgatory, there is little to indicate that this work was written by a committed Catholic. Frankly, you don't even have to believe in the afterelife to apprecciate Lewis's ability to see through human illusions and attachments. An interesting exploration of human frailty by a subtle and gifted writer."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis begins The Great Divorce by talking about Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, a marriage which Lewis finds impossible. Heaven and Hell must be divorced and all of his readers considering one or the other as an ultimate destination must realize that they won't be able to have it both ways. The two places are, by definition, different one from the other. You must embrace the joy that is heaven without reservation and you must renounce absolutely that which partakes of hell. The book itself, of course, is absolutist but it is also suffused with joy. Lewis' method of description/delineation of these alternate destinations is fantasy/allegory. His story moves along briskly and his arguments are sharply etched as they are embodied in spirits and those spirits' dialogues. This is not my favorite book of Lewis' but it is a nice introduction to his ways and his thought. It is also a very quick read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Doesn't matter if you are young or old you can read this again and again"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"CS Lewis in this book proves once again why he is a favorite of so many Christians today!He gives a picture of what those in hell would do if they ever actually got into heaven, and how our personal problems are really caused by ourselves.

And, truly, only by seeing through Christ's eyes can we see the truth of who we are!The book is an AMAZING read, and a wonderful picture of humans, God, heaven, and hell.Again, this book is not intended to be accurate to the Bible, nor is it theology (CS Lewis states this himself), but a wonderful literary fantasy!

Using his extraordinary descriptive powers, Lewis introduces us to supernatural beings who will change the way we think about good and evil. Although he doesn't mean to give his readers \\"even a guess or a speculation\\" of what Heaven or Hell is actually like as to factual details, there is still much food for thought for anyone concerned about eternal life, both here and hereafter. In incredibly creative, imaginative vision! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is just what I needed and it works great."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis takes us on a fascinating travelogue through Heaven and Hell in this book. Lewis' Hell is like an endless dreary town where people get further and further away from each other and more and more twisted up in ancient resentments. Lewis takes the gentle Christian's approach to Heaven--anyone who wants to enter Heaven may do so, but many choose not to, for one reason and another. As an atheist, I can't take Lewis' evocation of Heaven and Hell as seriously as Lewis would like me to. As a metaphor for the human condition and the way we allow ourselves to get wrapped up in the trivial and ignore the things that truly bring us happiness, it is excellent.At one point in the book, the narrator is discussing with his teacher that he thinks he ought to feel sad about all the people who decide they don't want to go to Heaven and instead return to Hell. The teacher replies that this is \\"The demand of the loveless and the self-imprisoned that they be allowed to blackmail the universe: that till they consent to be happy (on their own terms) no one else shall taste joy: that theirs should be the final power; that Hell should be able to veto Heaven.\\" This certainly has some wisdom in it. I sometimes feel that I ought to feel sad that people are starving around the world, and there are so many other problems. Lewis gives a gentle reminder here that whatever I do or don't do about the world's problems, there is no point in my being personally unhappy about things I can't help.As fiction, the book is fine and interesting. Before taking it too seriously, however, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. Christianity has a nasty habit of ignoring the major problems of our time, including overpopulation and exhaustion of resources, because they aren't mentioned in the Bible. As far as the major problems of our times, I would suggest Kunstler's \\"The Long Emergency.\\" For a defense of the naturalistic worldview, I would suggest Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" or Taner Edis' \\"The Ghost in the Universe.\\"I read \\"The Great Divorce\\" because I feel as a scientist that it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce, is with only few exceptions, my favourite book.

If you're honest, you'll either see your past self in this book or you'll see your current self in here. Lewis wasn't just a good writer, but also had a keen insight on human nature.The Great Divorce makes an excellent discussion tool for the believer to share with their unsaved friend. Of course, don't build your theology DIRECTLY off of it - it IS allegory and all of the images presented therein (i.e.- folks in the shadowlands simply going on about their lives in the perpetual gray darkness and the opportunity for a 'shadow' to become 'solid' by travelling to the foot of the land of the solids) may have to be stretched a bit to be fully Biblical, but folks will get the idea.As a believer, this book will give you some serious thinking material.

Actually, it seems he did this quite often -- That Hideous Planet, etc.What he does in Great Divorce is to assume the role of one having recently died. He appears on the scene of what may be a holding area for the dead; specifically, he finds himself among persons awaiting transportation.An omnibus flies them through the air (space?), up into a frightening for some chasm toward a dawn of sorts. Arriving at the destination, some return to the bus, while others try to explore, and Lewis only seems to explore as he observes the others.His encounter with one of his benefactors -- George MacDonald of the previous century -- gives reason and grounding for Lewis' moralizing.Lewis' perspective on life after death should raise the hackles of the conservative Protestant who seems so often to idolize Lewis -- after death there is a process during which one has many chances to rectify one's lack of loving during life on earth.Is there a Hell? There is some sort of Purgatory!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I haven't read too much of C.S. Lewis's work. I'm not a huge fan of his writing. But someone at work was reading this, and I had it sitting at home, so I decided to pick it up and go through it. It wasn't a very satisfying read.An unnamed character is transported by bus to heaven from what he eventually learns is hell. He meets a diverse group of people on this bus, and even more when he reaches heaven. These people, which are actually ghosts, are each met by someone from heaven who tries to convince them to let go of what they are holding on to and leave hell. Our unnamed character(who tells the story in the first person) is met by George MacDonald, of Lilith fame. The two engage in dialogue that expounds Lewis's thoughts on heaven and hell.This book is a response to William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and is not very well written, especially when compared to some of Lewis's other works. The overall thought is that you can't fully embrace Christ while embracing the world, and that whatever you lose in the world will seem trivial once heaven is gained. A nice story and moral, but the way it is told isn't great."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Let me begin this review by making a couple of things about this book absolutely clear. First, it's not a book about marraige or divorce. Secondly, it depicts a vision of the relationship between Heaven, Hell and Purgatory which is utterly incorrect. However, Lewis admits to this second point at both the beginning and end of the book. It's a work of fiction; nothing else, so with that said, we can move on to the book itself.In this novel, a soul travels from Hell to Heaven, with a few of his fellow souls, and bit by bit, each discovers just why they don't belong there. The slavedriving, condescending boss doesn't even want to be around so many miscreants, the apostate is repulsed by the idea of knowing one idea to be true and all the others false, the thief finds he can't steal anything from Heaven, because he has nowhere to put it, etc... It's a clever little device for a story, although as the book goes on, one is forced to wonder; just what did the narrator do to end up in Hell, and will he be able to overcome it and remain in Heaven?This, by the way, is the element of fiction that the book makes ample use of; that technically, souls in Hell are given a chance to visit Heaven, change their ways, and remain there. This is ludicrous, of course; the very idea of Hell implies that people have already chosen not to change their ways, and made their final decision already. There are no further choices of this sort to be made after Death. Still, as a basis for a story, it's an amusing little plot device. It's just a shame that we never really learn anything of substance about the narrator. I feel Lewis could have fleshed him out and made him an interesting character, rather than a mere cypher for viewing the other occurrances. Still, it was fun to read, for what it was.Now, on to specific goods and bads about the story. I have no major complaints to speak of for the entire first half of the book. As I said, the premise is absurd, but apart from that, it holds up very well.However, in Chapter 9, Paragraph 88, one of the saints says that people who drink the waters of Heaven see their works as though they belonged to someone else. Thank you, but no. I already know what it's like to watch other people do great things, and I know it's not sufficient. If I wanted that, I wouldn't need to go to Heaven for it.This is one of those things that I don't think Lewis ever really understood; the notion that being with God implies the -exhaltation- of man, not his reduction. In retrospect, many of my problems with his books stem from this basic problem.Ch9Par100-103, for example, in which the ghost of a painter \\"realizes\\" that people receive no recognition in Heaven at all, except from God. Needless to say, I don't agree. God grants to the saints all things which are good, and no things which are evil. Recognition from peers is a good thing. Therefore...In Ch11Par14, it's implied that people must never treat God as a means to other good things. While I admit readily enough that God is the greatest possible goodness, and should not be undervalued, we sorry humans sometimes need to motivate ourselves, which is made even harder for those of us who have difficulty being motivated by something as abstract as true and complete goodness, or as humanoid as the son of God. In this kind of situation, it would be prudent to seek some other good, so that one might be motivated to make the right decisions and arrive in Heaven to receive it. Now, this is not relevant to the situation of the woman the saint was talking to in this paragraph, but I feel it should be pointed out.As the book continues beyond these segments, however, it begins to make a number of very good and interesting points. First is Ch11Par113, where it essentially says that every aspect of man can be raised to glory, so long as it's killed first. I personally believe this to be true, since otherwise, the glorified man wouldn't really be a complete \\"man\\" at all.Next is Ch13Par43, which makes the point that those who make others miserable until they choose to be happy on their own terms will be very unhappy in the end. Still, I think this point needs to be studied just a little more closely. On the one hand, this point really only applies to those who make other people miserable by their own choices, but on the other hand, it could be misread to imply that there's something wrong with being hard to please, which I don't think is true by itself.Then, in Ch13Par47, we learn that the action of pity must be elevated, and the passion of pity must be executed. Mostly correct, I think, and an important distinction to make. When we become weak and immoral, and let ourselves become victims as a result of feeling pity towards others, we're not helping anyone, and there does need to be some way to correct this.Finally, I feel I should mention that this book includes George Macdonald as one of its characters. He shows up as a saint in Heaven, which by this point, I'm inclined to think he is. Macdonald's biggest problem, aside from not being Catholic, was his universalism, and unless he intended to apostatize, which seems unlikely, I don't think his mistakes were enough to merit eternal punishment. I disagree with him about some things, but I don't see any reason for supposing that he failed to make it to Heaven. It did bother me a bit to see him treated like the old mentor there, though.Ultimately, the book is about the people we observe; the study of the kinds of people who failed to make it to Heaven and why. Of course, during this study, we examine many types of choices and psychological conditions, and find out what's wrong with them and what kinds of problems they cause for the soul of whoever has them. This is the real meat of the story, and I really enjoyed it, in spite of all the things I was hoping to see.On the whole, I found this book to be very enjoyable and very fun, although again, it needs to be treated as the fiction it is. Take it in that context, and you should be just fine."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"While I don't necessarily agree w/ Lewis' ideas of heaven and hell, it was written in an innovative way and was certainly thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is Lewis at his best.

I wish I had read it years ago. It is now one of my personal favorites, one I recommend to my family and friends.My view of the afterlife...and current life....has been forever altered and enhanced because of this book. Lewis's imagery reinforces biblical teachings in a powerful way and encourages Christlike living NOW to avoid the miserable extended journey in the next life.So many powerful scenes and imagery, but my personal favorite was the lizard on that man's shoulder, representing lust, that was constantly wispering into the man's ear. The man could not shake it off himself, but had to be painfully ripped off by the angel once the man gave his consent. The man quickly recovered, and what happened afterwards to the man's soul once it was free of the lizard was thought-provoking.I highly recommend this book to all.

My favorite scenes are those where he describes Heaven as being more substantial and weighty while at the same time painful for those who are not a part of it.

But what you get is an electrifying glimpse into the divine and the vast worlds upon worlds that span all the horizons beyond our feeble minds and hearts.Reading Lewis did not make me stay an orthodox Christian but in a deeper sense he conveyed some fundamental truths that go beyond Christianity (a sentiment he would have no doubt have found horrifying!)"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If I were alone on a desert island, I would hope to have this book with me!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.

But that really didn't matter, because that's exactly what Lewis wrote in \\"The Great Divorce\\".In it, Lewis used a rather interesting vision of what heaven and hell are (not) like. I say \\"(not) like\\" because Lewis admits in his introduction that this was intended from the first to be a moral story, not an exploration of what might be. He explains his purpose in a clarity that only a writer of his caliber can explain - and I highly recommend reading the introduction, because it is short and simple, but sharply insightful.The great divorce which Lewis is writing about is that great separation between Heaven and Hell.

Lewis deftly and surgically dissects these and exposes their inherent danger.I fear to attempt to explain much more for two simple reasons. I think my explanations will confuse more than intrigue, for I don't quite have the talent of Lewis for simplicity.

I've read it several times and I've had to buy new copies because I keep giving it away. The Great Divorce starts off a little slowly, but you have to hang in there through the first couple of chapters. It is NOT a book about marital divorce, but rather about letting go of the things you think you want or need in order to gain that which is of much greater value."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I remember enjoying this book because it opened a door. You must understand that I view religion as an important tool for giving people a since of security and moral foundation. Religion hands people comforting answers to questions that can be difficult to take without support (i.e. What happens when we die? and Why are we here?). It also helps to setup responsibilty over and above the laws of the land. When you are held before your maker you will be more caitous than if you were to break a traffic law and are judged by your next door neighbor. This book shows that there is a wide array of possible scenarios for life after death. My belief is that it doesn't matter what you choose as your answers. It matters that you do believe in your answers to give you the security to live your life. I happen to like C.S. Lewis' view of Heaven and Hell. It makes me wonder if some of the Bible could have been someone's answers put down on paper."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Short and sweet allegory that can be read in a day. I know that it's intended as fiction, but it really said a lot about human nature and hinted at what heaven might be like. It's been a struggle throughout my life to find a description of heaven that makes any sort of sense to my post-modern mind, and I think this comes really, really close. And in the end, I think the question it's asking the reader is, \\"So what character are you going to be like?\\" It's a book I recommend to readers from all kind of backgrounds if they've ever wondered about the afterlife."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Another important work; few put words to print as Lewis is able. Through a dream: The journey to heaven; leaving earth. A fantasy depiction of the after-world. Outstanding--beautiful work--powerful. \\"A solely imaginative supposal\\" of what's to come--the purpose is to deliver a moral message.We follow his journey as first person: We meet travelers on the way; the righteous forms and the lost ghosts. The story is set between worlds (purgatory?): Exquisite, harsh, interesting, hard (literally), and in a way entertaining. We observe the learning of truth through conversation and the choice to make the right changes. We discover what we thought was righteousness and the abandonment of God (apostatism). The lost are caught up with the past world; they are blind.Christ is the only way-there is no other-believe in Him; believe as a child believes. Leave worldly things behind.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I'm not quite sure what I had in mind when I picked this book up, but a full length analogical story definitely was not in my mind when I started. But that really didn't matter, because that's exactly what Lewis wrote in \\"The Great Divorce\\".In it, Lewis used a rather interesting vision of what heaven and hell are (not) like. I say \\"(not) like\\" because Lewis admits in his introduction that this was intended from the first to be a moral story, not an exploration of what might be. He explains his purpose in a clarity that only a writer of his caliber can explain - and I highly recommend reading the introduction, because it is short and simple, but sharply insightful.The great divorce which Lewis is writing about is that great separation between Heaven and Hell. To me, it seems, the primary concern is with personal priorities and values. How much value do you place in your children, your friends, your personal opinions and soapboxes thereof?

He illustrates beautifully the great difference between selfishness and selflessness. Buy this book if you are interested in something that won't rot your brain."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is an excellent primer on sin.My impression is that many of the reviewers have taken Professor Lewis too literally here. In my view the entire thrust of the book is spiritual and in particular it is an excellent analysis of our sinfulness.Each parable discribes a sin. Much of the book is autobiographical in terms of sin and I think this is most remarkable.If one reads this book with care one will see that it is often a biography of ones own sin. Do not get tied up in the presentation. To do so is a little like critizing the Gospel parable about daily wages as a story about economics."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book show's how horrible sin is. How it ruins people, How it ruins their minds. Read this book and think about yourself. Think about what you are holding onto in life, and ask yourself if its worth it. This book should shed some light on the subject."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The interaction between the Ghosts and the Solid People in &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is heartbreaking to me, because it reminds me of how I desire to cling to pieces of Hell and still enter Heaven. Yet, in order to become a citizen of God's kingdom, you have to surrender yourself wholly to the forgiveness and grace of Christ, which I believe is one of the major themes of this book. C.S. Lewis asks a question that could possibly be the most important one we answer in our lifetime: what are you willing to sacrifice in order to obtain the eternal happiness of Heaven and the glory of God's presence?"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"And what's your excuse for not walking in faith??

I saw the reflections of so many so-called Christians that I know. But the more I got into it, the more I was confronted by my own false pride and assumptions about the afterlife and how God sees us. Reading this book was like the first time I read (and REALLY thought about) the Sermon on the Mount."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"One of my absolute favorite C.S. Lewis books, told as a parable of a grey world with grey people who meet their former colleagues and loved ones in a bus trip to the edge of heaven. Here Lewis combines his vivid imagination and brilliant writing with timeless theological questions. My favorite scene is the last one that has remained with me for many years: the picture of sin as a lizard sitting on one's shoulder, with its tail wrapped around its victim's neck, whispering with greater and lesser intensity depending on how aware one is of its presence. My description doesn't begin to capture the wonderful mythical quality of this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Good quality edition. The hardcover looks great in my library. And the story is life changing- a must read for all CS Lewis fans and Christians!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This approach to the afterlife - although Lewis makes it clear that this is designed as fiction, not an exploration of what the afterlife may actually be - is a highly thoughtful way to introduce our difficulty as men and women to release the natural world and all of it's trappings for the spiritual world. Each person the main character observes or interacts with experiences a different challenge, many of which I see in myself, my family and my peers. Lewis gently reveals how broken we all are, but that it's a simple choice - a choice we each can make - to be healed."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis a conservative Christian put together the most intuitive metaphor as to what a loving God has for us after death"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"this is an unbelievably good book by CS Lewis he has a great insight into the human and spiritual mind as well, I highly recomend this book to anyone looking for answers about themselves."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"When you encounter a writer and a work that provokes thought to the degree that CS Lewis does you read and then you re-read!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Having read all of the Narnia books I was already a fan of Lewis but had not read any of his more overtly Christian works. I was not sure about the premise but as I started reading it really started to make sense to me.

It started out slow and flexed my brain a bit trying to picture what was going on, but soon I had a good understanding and the characters were interesting and made me really understand what CS Lewis was trying to get across. It is possible that people in this world will get so attached to it that when presented with something far greater they might just choose something else."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The Great Divorce is a light, one-night read. However, as usual, Lewis manages to meditate on weighty topics. He highlights that the core of faith is based on knowing God and Christ, in contrast to a philosophical understanding of or assent to God's methods and requirements. Permeating this entire fantastical account is the idea that we must die to ourselves in order to really live and to be free. Ultimately, I think the message of the story is that faith is not a matter of hedging our bets. As Lewis points out in this fantasy, \\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.'\\" There is no marriage between Heaven and Hell, hence The Great Divorce!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"An excellent book. I read this even before I became a Christian and it really spoke to me. \\"The Great Divorce\\" is pretty much the story about a group of people in hell taking a one day vacation to the \\"entrance\\" of heaven. In it, Lewis paints a vivid image of what the \\"truth\\" of heaven would look like from the point of view of the weak and faiding souls who are too scared to leave the pitiful \\"comforts\\" of hell. Lewis, as always, gives deep insight and clear understanding of the various tactics and lies we use daily to \\"protect ourselves\\" from hearing, seeing, and believing the Lord's Truth."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of the little known but POWERFUL books by CS Lewis. He has a way of making you really think about your life and what you're letting control you. As he points out in this book, amazingly things that annoy and torment us we tend to cling to and keep around. Hmmmm, why do we do that? You will ponder this book and its message for years to come."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is a fantasy book about a fantasy journey, not what I expected after reading Lewis's \\"Mere Christianity\\" and The Four Loves\\". This book is like a thinking man's \\"Pilgrims Progress. C.S. Lewis has the whole plan of a soul's trip to the after life worked out. The logic and symbolism is what makes this book. C.S. Lewis has worked out a neat little belief system. As a new arriving soul, C.S lewis narrates his journey, he meets other souls with personalities we have all met. Lewis's helpful guide explains away the problems other souls have in reachng the \\"mountains\\". This book was a very thought provoking book presented in the context of an journey, all the while handling the major questions of life and religion. One does not necessarily have to subscribe Lewis's reasoning to enjoy this book. It can be read on the basic level, a simple jouney or asan explanation for the major questions of life and death. One can see why Lewis's works maintain their popularity over the decades. I thought some of the coversations of newly arriving souls was a litle long winded in some parts and it took away from the flow of the journey."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"If it would have been anything other than an allegory, it may not have snagged my attention. A friend foisted it on me, and now I'm the one foisting. From &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;, I came away with this: &quot;Every poet and musician and artist, but for Grace, is drawn away from love of the thing he tells, to love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only in what they say about him.&quot;For this alone, Mallowcups for the master."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A captivating imagination of what is heaven going to be like. Must be read on a regular basis. Imparts a real sense of eternity and grace."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The imagery Lewis uses in this book is incredible... it is impossible to walk away from it unaffected. I saw myself in so many of his characters, a little bit here, a little bit there."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I love how Lewis always manages to sneak a point or two past you. With all his religious writings, I find myself turning back a chapter or two saying, &quot;Oh, so that's what he was getting at!&quot; Lewis provides an intriguing look at what Heaven and Hell might be like while clearly indicating that it is only an idea. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Beautifully written ideas about Heaven and Hell as a state of mind; I absolutely LOVED it. It puts a peaceful, truthful perspective on struggling for peace. I want to read it five more times!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the great spiritual classics. The imagery is brilliant and the message is compelling. For me, reading The Great Divorce was a life-altering experience. If I could take only five books to a desert island, this would be one of them."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As a pastor, so many times people want to know about God, and God condemning people to hell. They want to challenge me that a loving God wouldn't let anyone be punished.But they forget that God has given all of us free will. God has given us choices all of our lives. What if the choice to be separated from heaven doesn't come from God, but rather comes from within ourselves. What if we are the ones who can't tolerate heaven.In this intriguing book, we are challenged with that very concept. Is C.S. Lewis right or wrong? I'm not sure it matters. What matters is that this opens up the conversation in a very different way."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I am not a fantasy fan, much to the chagrin of many, and I still don't \\"get\\" the magic of the Narnia series (even though I am glad to see it have so much meaning for others). It was with this mindset that i finally picked up The Great Divorce, and I admit to being pleasantly surprised.As some reviewers have pointed out, this probably shouldn't be used as a theology text. What it is is a thought generator and a conversation starter with those who have questions about eternity. And, beyond that, something that can be read--even thoughtfully--in only a couple of hours."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis' The Great Divorce is a chilling story which goes deeper than it seems. It is very easy to pass this little tale off as mere philosophy or &quot;thoughts on death&quot;; the truth is, this book is a warning against those who think their &quot;story&quot; is neither good nor bad. Lewis doesn't leave much wiggle room in describing heaven: it is a place so substantial that it cuts and causes pain for those who don't realize the wonder of it. There isn't much solace in hell, either: completely reversed, hell has no substance at all. In fact, its residents don't even realize they are even in hell in the first place. I believe Lewis intended this to be a caveat against a lack of substance in one's life as well as death. Of course, Lewis and I are both Christian, so working within that understanding, there is much more to be said. But even for non-believers, The Great Divorce is a commentary of great value, as many of Lewis' works are. In the end, it would seem that The Great Divorce isn't about Heaven and Hell; it is about the great chasm between Life and Death themselves."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book had a profound impact on me when I read it for a class in college. It seems a more believable vision of heaven and hell than the traditional fire n' brimstone/pearly gates and harps version. When you think about it, what could be worse than forever wallowing in old resentments, temporary schools of thoughts, or the should have, could haves of life?I think Lewis' central message is that we all have the means to our own salvation---for some it is a seamless process, but for others it's a struggle involving \\"fear and trembling\\". The benefits of reading this book is that it puts the things in life that seem such a big deal into a perspective of is spending time on this going to hinder my spiritual progress or not? It reminds you to \\"render unto Caesar, the things that are Caesar's\\" and keep your focus on becoming selfless and not letting anything get in the way of your spiritual growth.....even if you believe that what you are doing will benefit your own brand of religion. This book never ceases to shock my thinking because any of us can identify with the characters he depicts in hell....how they refuse to shed their fears, hatreds, pettiness, trendy thinking, whatever. This book is a wake up call for everyone regardless of their religion. It quite frankly offers a better way to live."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Reading \\"The Great Divorce\\" was formative for me the first time I came across it (some years ago); and with each re-reading, I'm reminded of just how apt are Lewis' descriptions of human interaction and the often blurry lines between what he terms \\"brass\\" and \\"gold\\" -- that which we might otherwise accept as a \\"natural\\" virtue, and that which is of everlasting, divine makeup.Of all the books CS Lewis wrote, I think \\"The Great Divorce\\" is the most often passed over-- regrettably so. I don't know why that's the case, but I do know that those who are introduced to \\"The Great Divorce\\" after having read other Lewis classics (such as \\"Mere Christianity\\" or \\"Screwtape\\") are often left with a new favorite in their Lewis collection. That was certainly true of me.What I find most powerful about \\"The Great Divorce\\" is Lewis' ability to distill examples of human conversations that reflect some of the most basic realities of our engagement with each other and the divine. That gift of Lewis' is what made the Narnia Chronicles so popular; with equal imagination here, he draws out even more subtle theological precepts. I often use the vignettes from this text as illustrations for not only those who ask for a thoughtful consideration of Christianity, but also a thoughtful consideration of human nature."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I don't happen to be a believer in a higher power, Christian or otherwise, but I thoroughly enjoyed this bus ride from the very first page. C.S. Lewis' writing is contemporary and hits a nerve. The story is about the the great divide between heaven and hell but I was drawn to the character studies. Lewis was a psychologist, self-taught no doubt, by being a keen observer of his fellow travelers. A voracious reader I rarely have time to re-read a book but, I've picked up this one several times; you'll never forget the story. It's the kind of book you can open at any page and have a good read. He shows you that it's the little character flaws that keep you small. And little they are, but powerful. And it's done with a degree of humor which was unexpected. I promise you won't be disappointed. This book is a fairy tale for adults (definitely not for children). It didn't change my views about religion, but I learned some lessons about good and evil."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Any Lewis book is a guaranteed good read. But if you want to expand your viewpoint about the afterlife, the value of this life, God's mercy and justice, or virtually any other highly important topic, pick this one up. It's an extremely quick book (the chapters are short, and the book is thin) with brilliant imagery and an interesting concept- what is Heaven and what is Hell? However, Lewis warns in a preface not to take this writing literally, and I do the same. The plotline serves more as a contextual setup in order to get his point across. You'll have to read it to discover that point.A great addition to your library."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of Lewis' easier reads with beautiful imagery, but as with all of C.S. Lewis' books thought provoking. It does suggest a purgatory, but I think the main purpose of this book is to illustrate how people willingly choose sin over God and that it is a choice. A choice that we can easily fall into without thinking, but nonetheless a choice. Regardless of whether you believe in purgatory or not you can get quite a bit from this book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This man has done many amazing things. C.S. Lewis never fails to amaze me! When it comes down to it, anything I pick up by him becomes one simple question, and that question is this. Where will he take me this time? Well, in this case, it happens to be a bus. And seeing as I've ridden in many a bus, there probably aren't any seatbelts, so you just have to hang on!The Heaven and Hell concept, right? There is a Heaven and there is a Hell, rest assured. And even though this is allegory along with fantasy, don't fool yourself into thinking that it was simply made up. C.S. Lewis was always inspired! So don't be surprised when you see ghosts. If you ever read Lewis before, you won't be too surprised if this makes you think. Do we really ever think about what we say and do in everyday life? I'll tell you right now... I don't! Reading this really shocks you back to reality.There is usually at least one part of each Lewis read that really hits me. This is no exception. I found this to be so simple, yet so amazing! Here's just a tidbit... \\"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \\"Thy will be done, and those to whom God says, in the end, \\"THY will be done.\\" All that are in Hell, choose it.\\" So also keep in mind when reading this, that you have and I have free will. We make our own choices, people.Speaking of choices, whether or not you choose to read this is entirely up to you. I'd say you're missing out. But for those who haven't missed out know that this is one amazing read! On the backs of most his Lewis's books it says that he continues to attract thousands of new readers every year. It only took me about 27 years, but I'm glad he finally caught my attention! This man not only grabs the attention, he pricks the heart, and you just hold on for the ride! WOW!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I love CS Lewis and had never read this one but it has now become my favorite. He gives an intriguing and insightful look into the afterlife and into the possibility that the most recognizable sins are quite possibly not the most difficult to overcome. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially Lewis fans."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Only C.S. Lewis can write a story like this. A man takes a bus ride through Hell, then Heaven and witnesses the choices made by others in their lives.The vivid stories within the story show that indecision is still a decision... it underscores the petty things in our lives that we allow to dominate us, things that will still plague us in Hell for eternity if we don't abandon them.Lewis' concepts (fantasized, of course) of the substance of spirit versus the substance of flesh and blood are incredibly thought provoking. There are mental images I got from reading this book that I will never forget.It is basic truth - you choose life, you choose death, or you choose not to choose. You will either give up the things that are holding you down (whether they be bitter resentments, anger, material gain, control, etc.) or you will cling to them until they become your master and you their slave.The book presents these concepts in such a non-threatening way that you've gotten a life lesson that you don't realize until you've finished this short, yet vibrant book."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Although this book is written as a novella, it contains TONS of thinly disguised theological truths and brain-shaking ideas. This is one of those books where everything means something. Every bit of the scenic description of Heaven and Hell reveals something that Lewis believes to be true about the two places and how people respond to them. Other fascinating things about this book are the fictional characters and seeing how different types of people respond to being in Heaven. There is one man who realizes that now that he is in Heaven, and in the presence of God, he is no longer useful. But he doesn't want to start feeling useless, and so cannot enter the presence of God--because in Heaven God provides for everyone's needs. This book really makes you contemplate whether Christianity is more about the journey or the destination. It's entertaining and full of wisdom, and is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Some folks only know Beethoven for his 9th symphony. Some folks only know C.S. Lewis for one of his &quot;greater&quot; works. (Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia etc..) What a loss. Anyone who has read any C.S. Lewis should make the time over the course of their lives to read THIS C.S. Lewis. I loved this book. No writer in the twentieth century ever hit the nail more directly on the head when dealing with human nature than did Clive Staples Lewis. This book is a perfect example of his talent in this area. Not even the Screwtape Letters did it better. I heartily recommend this book to all readers."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"The brilliance of &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is Lewis' focus on the spiritual aspects of Heaven and Hell and not just the literal aspects. The very day I became a Christian, the thought entered my mind that the very worst things about Hell had to be the absence of love and the absence of Christ. That was as far as my thinking went. Lewis took me much further with this book-- The lustful man lives in a kind of Hell already. The woman with a forgiving and humble heart lives in a kind of Heaven already. In the Bible, believers are described as already seated with Christ in Heavenly places-- spiritually, they have already arrived at their eternal destination. The converse is true of unbelievers. They dwell in the dark shadows of the underworld-- willingly without love and without Christ, burning in the flames of their own selfishness. An excellent read!! Lewis mentions his predecessor, George MacDonald, in &quot;The Great Divorce.&quot; I have read that Lewis derived much of his theology from MacDonald's interpretations. I recommend MacDonald's book &quot;Phantastes,&quot; the very book which Lewis partly credits for his conversion. I also recommend highly, and I do mean highly &quot;Castle of Wisdom&quot; by Rhett Ellis."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"As Lewis explains in his preface, The Great Divorce is a response to the attitude of William Blake, among others, that someday there will be an ideal union of the secular and divine, or Heaven and Hell. Unable to see how this could ever be, Lewis wrote The Great Divorce to explore the issue further. The result is a religous allegory of the highest caliber and impeccable, nearly frightening, insight.As with all allegories, The Great Divorce relies on symbolism to make its point. Lewis admits his book is not to be taken literally as a tour guide of either Heaven or Hell, but merely as an artistic expression of his ideas. And the plot device works well--Lewis's intensely brilliant yet readily accessible and familiar writing style makes it easy to imagine oneself in the narrator's shoes on the uneasy bus ride out of Hell, hunkering under the great mountains of Glory, or even talking uncertainly with Ghosts or Spirits (oh yes, there is a big difference!).The Great Divorce is a fine read for anyone, believer or unbeliever. The former will find many challenges and assurances; the latter will discover new insights into the Christian faith not readily available from other sources. Above all, The Great Divorce is a Dante-esque tour of not only the Worlds Beyond, but just as importantly one of the often unexplored metaphysical World within us all."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Lewis' \\"The Great Divorce\\" is a book that I have owned for years but only recently read. I don't know why it took me so long, but now that I have read it I want to read it again all the more. I guess that is a sign of a good book. Many of you reading this review are no doubt familiar with Lewis the philosopher, theologian, writer, and speaker. Suffice to say he remains one of the most esteemed and brilliant thinkers and writers of the last century.This book easily compares to the best of his work. The idea of using a fantasy-land constructed around a bus trip to try to give us some look into the unknown is pure Lewis. A dark, desolate, rainy bus stop gives us a mental picture of hell that reminds me of the films \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Dark City\\". The descriptions of a heaven-like place given in the book remind me of the house of Elrond and the elvish city in the recent \\"Lord of the Rings\\". The book essentially follows the author as he tours both of these worlds-seemingly seperated by a million miles. With George MacDonald as his guide, the author witnesses many interactions between those in the 'heavenly' world and those arriving from hell on a bus. The heavenly beings-who are solid-attempt to convince the spirits aboard the tour to remain with them and allow themselves to be made whole by the overseer of the heavenly realm.Unfortunately, most of the spirits prefer to deal with their various troubles 'some other time' or not at all. Wishing to remain as they are, they refuse the help of the heavenly beings. We witness spirits literally and figuratively in chains of pity, anger, pride, arrogance, and fear. The answer to all of these maladies is offered to them with outstretched arms, they need only accept the gift.The most powerful exchange in the book comes between a spirit who arrives with a little red lizard on his shoulder. (Readers of Lewis will recognize this from his earlier essay 'Horrid Red Things' in \\"God in the Dock\\"). The lizard embodies the spirit's struggles with lust; it continuously goads him on. As the spirit comes into contact with one of the heavenly angels, the angel states that if the man will only ask him to, he will kill the lizard. The lizard immediately warns the spirit that the angel is capable of this and reminds the spirit that if this is allowed, he-the spirit-will never enjoy the pleasures of lust and sin again. The spirit hems and haws, asking the angel many questions. Each time the angel responds \\"...MAY I KILL IT?\\"It is heartbreaking to read as the spirit decides to allow the angel-hands hovering just around the neck of the lizard-to kill it, only to relent when he realizes that he himself will be hurt in the process of obtaining freedom. The angel responds: \\"I never said it would not hurt you, only that it would not kill you.\\" This seems eerily similar to so many of us in the 'real' world who, when offered freedom thru Christ and the solutions to our myriad of social, emotional, spiritual, and physical struggles, raise an angry hand to God and reject His offer. How many of us want our problems to be fixed, our wounds healed and our pain dealt with-without any pain!? How many of us prefer to hold onto the very things that are destroying us? Keeping us from God?A brilliant treatise on the ability of the human-in this case the spirit of departed humans-to rationalize and justify our behavior, whether it be an overbearing, controlling mother, a frightened woman, a man diseased with lust, those consumed by career, or any of the other characters in the book. Look deeper because there is a message for everyone in this book. A powerful allegory of the struggle to make the Gospel known to others.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I don't think Lewis meant to &quot;preach to the choir.&quot; He knows that many fine people deny Christianity because they think its a naive and silly belief. Lewis understands the skeptics mind and speaks directly to it. He isn't an entrenched, Christian Theologian, he is a normal man who speaks planely. In fact he almost always prefaces his books by downplaying his own knowledge of Christian Theology. This make Lewis very approachable, yet intellectually sound.Unlike the other reviewers, I am not a Christian and I have read and enjoyed this book. Lewis was a die-hard ATHEIST before he became christian. He was a brilliant intellectual and made the leap of faith, not because he got hit on the head, but because he objectively analyzed the Bible. His background alone puts me immediatley at ease when I read him. He won't try to manipulate the facts to push you toward Christ. He just lays down his ideas, with nothing up his sleaves and lets you make of it what you will. Unlike many Christian apologists, he knows that you can't be forced into Christianity (God Knows Many Have Tried).Skeptics, myself included, should read at least some of Lewis. I suggest Mere Christianity as a primer and then The Great Divorce. If you are a responsible intellectual, unsatisfied with other &quot;Christian&quot; apologies, and looking for concrete answers concerning the Christian Faith, it would be foolish to ignore Lewis."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Please don't be amazed at my poor rating of this book; it is not actually a rating of the great C.S. Lewis's &quot;The Great Divorce,&quot; of which the earlier reviews speak eloquently; rather, it is this particular edition by HarperCollins/Zondervan. Simply put, this edition is liberally peppered with typographic errors, perhaps even a missing word here or there--you won't be able to tell unless you get a reliable edition elsewhere and compare the two. But I found errors like &quot;to&quot; spelled as &quot;eo,&quot; &quot;the&quot; spelled &quot;teh,&quot; and so on, far too many simple errors to be permitted in such a slender volume. Hey, Harper/Collins and Zondervan: no one cares if fundamentalist claptrap books has typographical errors, since these are not read by thinkers, but when you set to reprint a work by one of the Great Authors, at least show him the courtesy of hiring an editor and proofreader to check the galley pages. Suffice it to say, since this edition is part of the &quot;Signature Series,&quot; and presumably other Lewis books in the series is prepared in a similarly slipshod fashion, I will have to look for other editions of Lewis's works that I don't as yet own. (Of course, none of this may be important to the reader if he doesn't mind less than acceptable fidelity to the original editions of &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;: in which case, I suppose this edition is better than none.)--A Former Editor"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"A friend told me that this book opened his eyes to the fact that some people don't want answers, only debate and politics. He couldn't believe people would think that way, but then he went to college and experienced them for himself.Lewis has written a fun, memorable story about going to hell in a dream (or vision) and taking a bus tour of heaven. The ghostly figures that file timidly off the bus are barely visible in the bright light of heaven, and the grass is so much more real (or true) than they are it hurts their feet. One man tried to steal a golden apple, and he may as well have been trying to hiest a boulder. Lewis himself, writing in first person, feared a coming rain may pummel them into the ground.But after the initial shock of a world more real than he could imagine, he watched the other tourist interact with heavenly friends who had come to greet them. Some of them were friends from earth, some just kind-hearted people. Again and again the hellions (if I may call them that) choose to hold on to their worthless pride or foolhearty beliefs rather than humble themselves to the truth. Pride manifests itself in a hundred subtle ways as these pitiful souls whine about perceived injustices or irrational motives. Thankfully, a few tourists do humble themselves, become transformed into marvelously real beings, and remain in heaven. But most don't, about which the great Scottish author George MacDonald, Lewis' heavenly guide, says, \\"They may not be rejecting the truth of heaven now. They may be reenacting the rejection they made while on earth.\\"This book has curious insight into our human hearts and teaches a few Biblical ideas in very memorable ways. I enjoyed reading it myself and again aloud to my wife. Lewis has a nice, readable style. 4 stars, only because a guy can't give everything good five stars."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Allow me to begin by saying that I am, at best, skeptic regarding the existence of God. Yet, C. S. Lewis remains being one of my favourite authors, and this is by far one my favourite books by him. Through the allegory of a bus journey, this Christian writer allows to enter what he believes Heaven and Hell to be like. This, however, is just the means Lewis uses to face us with something much deeper and, to many of us skeptics, mind-boggling: The question of Free Will. Why is it that some people are granted entrance to Heaven, while others are doomed to Hell? How can a benevolent God punish his creatures so cruelly? He does not, Lewis claims; it is us who make the choice, whether consciously or not. This is what THE GREAT DIVORCE is about: making us aware of our own actions and where they lead us, thus forcing us to take a good, hard look at human nature... and our own. Afraid to do so? Then you should definitely read it.PS: What can I say? I've declared myself an atheist for a long time. Yet, the more C. S. Lewis I read, the more I doubt my beliefs- or lack thereof.Andrea"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S. Lewis is one of the most praised writers in the christian literary world. I am not a fan of this book. I found it extremely hard to follow and all around just a hard read. I ended up having to find a study guide online to make it through the class."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Am I the only one who finds this book mean-spirited, even sadistic? Lewis takes these poor neurotic people and consigns them to hell. They get a chance to go to heaven for a visit. There, they only see Jesus briefly from behind as some kind of celestial bus driver, and God not at all. They are mostly left to shift for themselves, without a single kind word, even though they are obviously in extreme psychological pain. Occasionally heaven deigns to send them a helper in the form of a flaming angel or someone they despised on earth. The outcome is already decided,though, in nearly every case, allegedly by their &quot;choices&quot; on earth (although one expects that they were always neurotic and weak; they just grew that way, like an oak seed grows into an oak tree). Lewis refuses to be drawn into a discussion about predestination, but it is clear he has nothing but scorn for these poor weaklings who didn't cut the mustard to begin with. There's no talk of grace here; it seems clear that the inferior neurotics just don't &quot;deserve&quot; to get into heaven, unlike all the &quot;great&quot; &quot;well-adjusted&quot; Christians who reside there. I suspect what is really going on here is that Lewis despises the neurotic aspects of himself, and has found a way in fantasy to damn them, while celebrating his own rectitude. I would have been much more impressed if the people in heaven had faults and weaknesses, but were full of grace, love and understanding instead of &quot;virtue&quot;; and if Christ had met the neurotics with assurance and love and help instead of just sitting at the front of that d--- bus. Lewis's sneering, superior attitude toward the poor &quot;sinners&quot; in this book is particularly unjustified, in light of what should be apparent to everybody: neurotic sinners usually end up being neurotic believers."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"In The Great Divorce the narrator takes a bus trip to Heaven. He travels with people with a variety of beliefs. When he arrives he realizes he is insubstantial; he, like the other passengers, is a Ghost. They are met by inhabitants of Heaven - Spirits, or Solids - who come to this pickup point to guide them in the new land. The passengers have the opportunity to go back, or to become more substantial here, if they make the rest of the difficult journey. The passengers confront those matters that have gotten in their way to God. This may be refusing to forgive someone, loving someone more than God, or self-pity to the point of denial that the joy of Heaven could exist, or a refusal to take part in it. In every situation, it is the person's choice.The story is another spiritual journey, a common subject to Lewis, as is shown in Pilgrim's Regress and The Chronicles of Narnia. Like Pilgrim's Regress, this story takes after Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. For example, the journey, once arrived in Heaven, is to a mountain. The Great Divorce differs from Regress in its conversational tone and address of everyday living. Regress addresses philosophies; Divorce addresses common beliefs and behaviors, in a way that Screwtape Letters does. The former work is more academic than the latter."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"I read this gem of a book on a lark. But it drew me in and kept my attention from beginning to end. What amazes me is how much of C. S. Lewis' theology shapes the characters, plot, and outcome...a bold artistic creation that is definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This is one of my favorite C.S. Lewis book. I have read it twice but had misplaced my original copy so I bought it again because it is a great addiction to your reading library. I don't want to give it away, but the way the author writes about the topic of the afterlife was very very interesting."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"It was a little hard at first to get use to the view point and analogies that CS Lewis uses. Then it made sense to me and gave me a lot to think about and a new perspective on life and my little world of problems. I really liked it and highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This little story utterly changed my life, in that it actually provided (hypothetical, but completely plausible) answers to me for my questions regarding the difference between religiousity and Christianity. Make no mistake, there is a RADICAL DIFFERENCE!!! Can be read in an hour or two. I keep re-reading!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"C.S.

It's a 'get out of hell free' ticket to heaven where you will meet some incredible people and be exposed to some 'outside the box' thinking."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This book helped me gain a new perspective on the idea of heaven. It wonderfully written and though it is fiction it really reaches deep into your mind and asks you to think... really think."},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"This may be my least favorite of C.S. Lewis's stories, but that isn't saying a lot. I thought the bus ride to heaven and hell was a bit goofy, but everything else was phenomenal. From detailed descriptions of the physical properties of heaven to the wisdom of George MacDonald, this book will make you rethink your priories in life and the afterlife. It serves as a \\"reality check\\" of sorts. Though told as a fantasy story, I believe this book is more of an essay.I would not pass over this book!"},{"Title":"The Great Divorce","review":"Good old Lewis gets us on the bus from Hell!
