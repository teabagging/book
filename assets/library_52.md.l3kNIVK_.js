We come to books by different routes in terms of personal background, literary expectations, or cultural climate; it is only reasonable to acknowledge them. For example, I was initially attracted to the book by its resonance with my own Oxbridge days, the seduction of people from older families or greater wealth, and late adolescent confusion about sexuality and religion. More recently, I come to BRIDESHEAD REVISITED after reading a number of earlier Waugh books, together with those of his fellow convert to Catholicism, Graham Greene; this perspective casts a different light on a book that I knew only from the now-iconic BBC serial of 1981. And more recently still, there is stimulus of the new Miramax movie, a magnificent experience whose significant differences from the book nonetheless help to focus on what Waugh was actually doing. Personal, literary, and cultural: let me address these points in the opposite order. I shall try not to give any outright spoilers, but I am writing for people who already know the general outline of the story.The movie first: splendid acting, fine period detail, and a feast for the eyes -- although Castle Howard in Yorkshire, one of Britain's grandest buildings, is surely at least twice the size of Brideshead. My greatest surprise in reading the book was to discover how many liberties the screenwriters had taken with the dramaturgy of the original. It was not just a matter of removing discursive passages and tightening things up; significant events had been taken out of order and others inserted, with invented dialogue to go with them. In both film and novel, the middle-class narrator Charles Ryder falls under the spell in turn of Lord Sebastian Flyte, his ancestral home Brideshead, and his sister Julia. The movie makes much more of the implied homoeroticism between Charles and Sebastian (which Waugh probably could not have done even if he had wanted to), but it also introduces his awareness of Julia quite early as a counterpoint to this, culminating in an episode in Venice which effectively causes a break with Sebastian. By the time Sebastian and Charles have parted in the book, however, Julia has made only peripheral appearances and has barely entered Charles' radar. Similarly near the end of the movie, the scene where Charles bargains for Julia with her Canadian husband Rex Mottram has no equivalent in the book whatsoever; Waugh simply glides over the transition as though it didn't matter. But then Waugh treats Julia's marriage to Rex as a hole-in-the-corner affair; he is a divorced man whom, as a Catholic, she can marry only in a state of sin. In the movie, by contrast, Rex too is Catholic and a splendid catch; the grand scene of Julia's engagement ball makes a dramatic climax, at which Sebastian disgraces himself by appearing drunk, and Charles is banished from the house.So did Waugh not have the trick of the big dramatic moment? On the contrary, he could manage this perfectly well, as his other novels show, but here seems to aim at something entirely different. In every case, the adjustments in the movie tend towards a more conventional drama, in terms of social tensions, personality struggles, and the cavalcade of events. Much is made, for example, of Charles' lower social status, but there is nothing of this in the book, whose characters are grace itself. Emma Thompson has a virtuoso grande dame role as Lady Marchmain, the mother of Sebastian and Julia, but the character is the book is altogether gentler; she works through persuasion, not by force of will. Things that happen in the movie like a coup de th&eacute;tre, such as Charles coming together with Julia or Lord Marchmain returning home to die, take days or weeks in the novel. The movie is in the moment but earthbound, while Waugh has another dimension. His rhetoric is not that of a Hollywood actor; he is trying to represent the still small voice of God.BRIDESHEAD REVISITED (1944) is an often funny book, with satires of upper-class twits, sanctimonious hypocrites, and posing aesthetes, but it is rooted nonetheless in a basic sense of civility. Waugh's earlier books, such asPUT OUT MORE FLAGS(1942), were more obviously satirical and not so rooted, but you can see the author struggling to give them moral ballast. This occurs most obviously inA HANDFUL OF DUST(1934) where, in an attempt to resolve the frivolous immoralities of the novel, the author tacks on an ending that belongs to a different world altogether. Here, although the religious themes are introduced as a matter more of biography than belief, they are nonetheless pervasive. Compare Waugh to Graham Greene, who converted to Catholicism four years before him. Greene's fascination with sinful characters who nonetheless find salvation, as inBRIGHTON ROCK(1938) orTHE POWER AND THE GLORY(1940), is an assertive statement of a doctrinal paradox; Waugh is more subtle. Indeed, it would be possible to come away from the movie believing that it was an anti-Catholic tract. And yet in the book, Lord Marchmain, Julia, and especially Sebastian in his later years as movingly described by his younger sister Cordelia, emerge as just such prodigals returned to the fold. Even the agnostic Charles appears at the end to be at least half-way towards conversion. Brilliant though the movie's final scene in the chapel was, the ending of the book goes deeper.So what are those universal themes I mentioned? You don't need to have been at Oxford to respond to such a fine description of the springtime struggle to define one's place in society, one's sexuality, one's talents. You don't need to have lived through a war to lament the passage of time and feel the need to honor the past even when hailing the future. You don't need to come from a noble family to recognize the importance of roots, something essential that comes through no matter what; dysfunctional though the Brideshead family may be, it is no accident that Charles is presented as being virtually without a functioning father at all, deprived of the very roots that make them who they are. And you do not need to be Catholic or even Christian to seek some guiding principle in life, or find a means of living without one."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Published in 1945, this novel, which Waugh himself sometimes referred to as his \\"magnum opus,\\" was originally entitled \\"Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder.\\" The subtitle is important, as it casts light on the themes--the sacred grace and love from God, especially as interpreted by the Catholic church, vs. the secular or profane love as seen in sex and romantic relationships. The tension between these two views of love--and the concept of \\"sin\\"--underlie all the action which takes place during the twenty years of the novel and its flashbacks.When the novel opens at the end of World War II, Capt. Charles Ryder and his troops, looking for a billet, have just arrived at Brideshead, the now-dilapidated family castle belonging to Lord Marchmain, a place where Charles Ryder stayed for an extended period just after World War I, the home of his best friend from Oxford, Lord Sebastian Flyte. The story of his relationship with Sebastian, a man who has rejected the Catholicism imposed on him by his devout mother, occupies the first part of the book. Sebastian, an odd person who carries his teddy bear Aloysius everywhere he goes, tries to escape his upbringing and religious obligations through alcohol. Charles feels responsible for Sebastian's welfare, and though there is no mention of any homosexual relationship, Charles does say that it is this relationship which first teaches him about the depths of love.The second part begins when Charles separates from the Flytes and his own family and goes to Paris to study painting. An architectural painter, Charles marries and has a family over the next years. A chance meeting on shipboard with Julia, Sebastian's married sister, brings him back into the circle of the Flyte family with all their religious challenges. Three of the four Flyte children have tried to escape their religious backgrounds, and this part of the novel traces the extent to which they have or have not succeeded in finding peace in the secular world. \\"No one is ever holy without suffering,\\" he believes.Dealing with religious and secular love, Heaven and Hell, the concepts of sin and judgment, and the guilt and punishments one imposes on oneself, the novel also illustrates the changes in British society after World War II. The role of the aristocracy is less important, the middle class is rising, and in the aftermath of war, all are searching for values. A full novel with characters who actively search for philosophical or religious meaning while they also search for romantic love, Brideshead Revisited is complex and thoughtfully constructed, an intellectual novel filled with personal and family tragedies--and, some would say, their triumphs.

Long did I search for this novel: long did I search for Waugh! When I first picked it up (I call it fate), it was only a matter of moments before I knew in my heart that we were old friends. It has the sensational richness and deepness of European aristocratic life, and an unparalleled portrayal of early century Oxford. Just delicious. I couldn't put it down, and when I did I felt a regular beast, and picked it up again. Everything I love about literature was preparing me for this novel. Read it. Of course Waugh's a staunch Catholic, and that (God love him!) only sharpens his mind for what is vice and folly. But you get goodness and beauty, too."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This book is not written in accordance with current literary tastes. It is descriptive to the point where it is florid sometimes; the writer's politics and elitism can easily offend(he is thoughtlessly snobbish towards characters such as Hooper); and he is describing a vanished world that can be difficult to understand--the sort of aristocrats he describes do not exist anymore and maybe they shouldn't exist (one could reasonably call them parasites). However, the same things could be said about many of the novels that are most worth reading (think of novels from nineteenth century Russia for example). The sensitive reader will soon realize that Waugh is talking about the human condition in this book and showing the necessity of faith, as all that they have materially cannot satisfy these people. They still have a void that can only be filled by God and God pulls them, no matter how much they try to run away from this fact. These are real human beings who are involved in definite sins such as adultery; homosexuality (though it is unclear whether Sebastian and Charles have a physical relationship, the homoerotic undertones in their relationship are very strong, and there are several other openly homosexual characters);alcoholism runs rampant; the narrator has the sin of pride. However, God has grace to handle all of it, and Waugh brilliantly uses Dante's philosophy of human love (including the sinful love such as the adultery and that with the homoerotic element) leading human beings towards the divine love which it is a mirror of. He will make you uncomfortable and challenge your late twentieth/early twenty-first century ideas of moral relativism as he is very uncompromising about what is right and what is wrong and believes in such unstylish things as 'sin', 'redemption', 'duty' and 'sacrifice'. However, he NEVER preaches. The depiction of Sebastian in his later years is one of the most moving things, I think, in all literature, as he describes the destruction of his beauty and his grace in the alcoholism, shows what a total wreck he has made of his life by worldly standards, and yet lets you feel that he has achieved something else with his pain, which is the salvation of his soul. And so there is hope for Julia, for Charles and for all of the other extremely flawed people in this novel. In a world that seems to be dying (one of the best things about the book is its depiction of the world at war).Maybe some of us could use some of this message in a world in which so many more people, not just the 'aristocrats' but also the 'Hoopers' of the world (at least in Europe and America) have so much financially, and are spiritually so miserable. And don't even realise that our disease is spiritual, or if we do, try to salve it with easy, patched-together counterfeits of religion that can do nothing for us, like people taking pleasant-tasting placebos instead of real medicine."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"'Brideshead Revisited', Evelyn Waugh's finest non-satirical novel, is concerned with the operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely-connected characters and the decline of the English aristocracy and their stately homes. The novel is a panegyric and a valediction and expresses a yearning for a lost Aracadia and a loathing for the changing world (see Henry Wallace's 'Century of the Common Man' speech). Although there are many passages of buffonery the themes are romantic (homosexual and heterosexual) and eschatological. The novel is firmly ficticious but many characters (and events) are loosely drawn from the authors life - e.g. Lord Sebastian Flyte is based on Alastair Graham and Hugh Lygon, Anthony Blanche is based on Brian Howard and Harold Acton (all contemporaries at Oxford), Rex Mottram is based on Brendan Bracken (a Canadian politician who gave Waugh leave from military duties to write the novel), Mr Samgrass is based on Maurice Bowra, Sebast! ian's teddy bear Aloysius is based on John Betjeman's 'Archie' (although Betjeman carried his around to mock the upper classes), etc. The archtitectural details of Brideshead were supposedly based on Castle Howard in Yorkshire, which Waugh had visited (the 1981 television series was filmed there). The characterization is generally excellent although Lady Julia Flyte has been compared to 'cardboard' and a 'wax mannequin' by two of Waugh's biographers. The novel is set in various luxurious and exotic places including Oxford, Brideshead in Wiltshire, Venice, London, Paris, Morocco, South America, on board a transatlantic liner. 'Brideshead Revisited' should not be taken out of its historical and social context. The novel is written in the baroque style and contains florid passages (see 'The languor of Youth' speech) and many high-flown metaphors. Waugh wrote in this style because of the Basic English written by many of his contemporaries. Because of the bleak period! of writing (1944) the novel is 'infused with a kind of glu! ttony, food and wine, for the splendours of of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language'(see the preface to the revised edition of 1960). In 1944 it would have been impossible to foresee the English aristocracy maintaining their identity to such a degree; the future &quot;cult&quot; of the country house in the United Kingdom would also have appeared inconceivable. I would recommend this novel to all first-time Waugh readers and to people interested in the subject and period (1920s-WW2)."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Nothing to add regarding the story, Brideshead is and will be, one of my favorite novels. A note about editions though; Waugh originally published Brideshead Revisited in 1945. Waugh wrote it during the war years and with time, developed a \\"growing dissatisfaction with its literary style. He found it too lush, too decorative or ornamental in too many places.\\" For me, that \\"lushness\\" is one of the reasons that I fell in love with the language of the novel. He republished the novel in 1959, with a number of the passages trimmed or \\"toned down\\". There are some additions as well but overall the novel is tightened up (although I would disagree with the author that his revised version is \\"better\\"). For more information you can read \\"Companion to Evelyn Waugh's 'Brideshead Revisited' by David Cliffe on the internet. Through a convoluted history, which need not be discussed here, the original or first edition is referred to as the \\"American\\" edition and the revised one is the \\"British\\" edition. I own both copies in hardback myself and find that both have merits but as previously stated, my preference is the original. I am glad to say that the Kindle version appears to be the original version. I have found the quickest way to tell which one you are reading is by going to Book I, Chapter 1 'Et in Arcadia Ego' (God knows how much has been written on that memento mori) and reading the first paragraph. In the original edition the words \\"fool's-parsley\\" is written and the phrase is \\"soft vapors of a thousand years of learning\\". In the revised edition, the fool's-parsley is eliminated and the phrase is changed to \\"soft airs of centuries of youth\\". Hope this helps as the original version available on the Kindle was the revised one.

No long-winded review is necessary to impart what is important: the novel is surely one of the best-written stories ever. Waugh's use of language is astonishing. His ability to paint a scene and a mood is also a learning experience for all would-be writers. The story itself is captivating, a glimpse into the inner-workings of a rich Catholic family in decline and one man who comes under its spell. These characters are unforgettable, a testament to Waugh as a writer and an artist."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"BRIDESHEAD REVISTED begins with a friendship that Charles Ryder, this novel's snobbish protagonist, establishes with Sebastian Flyte, the son of a wealthy Catholic family and the owners of Brideshead, a beautiful country estate. This friendship begins when Ryder is a fresher at Oxford:\\"I knew Sebastian by sight long before I met him. That was unavoidable for, from his first week, he was the most conspicuous man of his year by reason of his beauty, which was arresting...\\" And: \\"He was entrancing, with that epicene beauty which in extreme youth sings aloud for love...\\"Between their first and second years at Oxford, Charles accompanies Sebastian to Venice, where they stay with Sebastian's father and his mistress. She observes: \\"I know of these romantic friendships of the English and the Germans.... I think they are very good if they do not go on too long... In England it comes when you are almost men; I think I like that. It is better to have that kind of love for another boy than for a girl. Alex [Sebastian's father], you see, had it for a girl, for his wife...\\"To the contemporary sensibility, Waugh begins BR by establishing a gay relationship between Charles and Sebastian. But then what happens? Instead of keeping his focus on this issue, Waugh expands the interests of the haughty Charles from Sebastian to the entire Flyte/Marchmain family, their old money heritage, and his sister Julia, who must find a suitable husband.Meanwhile, Waugh appends to Sebastian the problem of alcoholism. This certainly gives Waugh something to write about. But, as presented, this problem doesn't really explore Sebastian's character. Instead, it allows Waugh to follow Sebastian's plight over 20 years while downplaying his sexual orientation. BR, in other words, seems to address manufactured, not character-driven, themes. It lacks the courage to explore its content.This failure to confront content is also apparent in Waugh's treatment of Sebastian's family. Here, the pompous Charles believes that the Flyte/Marchmain family represents something great and discerning, as well as superior to commercial work-a-day England. Illustrating this are Charles's observations about Lady Marchmain's brothers, who died in World War I. \\"These men must die to make a world for Hooper [a feckless enlisted man reporting to Charles in the prologue and epilogue]; they were the aborigines, vermin by right of law, to be shot off at leisure so that things might be safe for the traveling salesman, with his polygonal pince-nez, his fat wet handshake, his grinning dentures.\\"But, in fact, the men of the wealthy Flyte/Marchmain clan are simply spoiled and useless twits, uninterested in finding meaningful roles in life. At the same time, the issue in the life of Julia is the standard female problem of finding the right man. What Waugh tries to do in BR is to endow these very limited characters with historic dimension. But, the only quality about this family that is other than mediocre is its wealth. IMO, Waugh, through his protagonist Charles, can't see the true dynamic of his characters because he is a captivated by their money. Again, he doesn't truly confront his content.Certainly, Catholicism plays a big role in Book III of BR. But you know what? Once again, this subject feels like something Waugh appended to his narrative so there was something to write about. Will Lord Marchmain accept the sacrament on his death bed? Will Julia acknowledge her core Catholicism? These are matters that come up in the conclusion of BR. But these aren't emblematic of issues that Waugh has explored throughout his novel. Instead, Catholicism functions as a layer of melodrama that Waugh has added to a bizarre book, where the emotional engine of the narrative diverts from its story."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I average two books a week, and have given up on approximately a dozen books in my lifetime.

It is peopled with real characters that leap of the page in all of their complexity, it is a fervent convert's exuberant praise to his recently realized God, it is a glimpse of the fading aristocracy of England, and it is a story of a few people and their journey to find their faith and proper place in the world.This book is vastly different from Waugh's satirical earlier works. There is still satire and humor in this text, but it is dryer and less central to the plot than in some of his previous novels. Also, unlike his previous efforts the characters in this novel are not caricature, but well developed human individuals. It is also rather episodic in plot and we follow the characters from their late teens to early thirties, a rather formative time in one's life.I think that reading this novel will be a fuller experience if the reader has a religious background, and some personal experience with faith. But it is not necessary to enjoying (and getting something) from the text.The novel deals with a close circle of friends, and depicts how they all in their own ways come to God. I feel that Mr. Waugh was trying to write a great novel of faith (my personal opinion) and to that extent I think he left religion, and the Catholic Church in particular, open to some criticism, which I don't think was his intent. However, one could read the same sections that I think expose the weakness of the church, and see them as plot details that strengthen the argument for faith. Waugh was much smarter than I, and I am going to assume that was his goal. What makes the text so layered is that one can read the novel and see a great testament to God and Church, and others can read it and just as easily argue for the destructive power of religion on individuals. To me, that is one of the greatest assets of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\".This novel got under my skin, in a good way, and has been knocking around in my head since I finished. To me, that is high praise. I will be revisiting this text again. Probably again, and again...Read it with a group of friends, there will be lots to digest, and the vastness of reactions this novel will be sure to engender will make the process all the more enjoyable and richer."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I first read Brideshead Revisited at the University of Wisconsin in the mid-1960s. Then I read it for its wonderful characterizations and dialogue and for the fascinating, to me, glimpses into the mores of pre-war England, as well as for its elegiac view of traditional English culture. (I also wondered frequently what, exactly, was going on between Charles and Sebastian!)All of those aspects remain interesting, but this time I concentrated on the theme stated by Waugh himself in his preface--'the operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely connected characters'. I don't want to give away the plot because it's a good one. Left to myself, I would have guessed that the theme had to do with the many varieties of love, but can see, after re-reading the book, what Waugh meant to do. There are many varieties of love among the group of people who populate this story, and Waugh considers them all to be precursors, or 'forerunners' of love for their Christian god. Waugh himself, like many midcentury English intellectuals, was a convert to Roman Catholicism.I certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the English novel. It's more serious and more philosophical than Waugh's satires but has its own charms.This is Waugh's revised 1959 edition of the book originally written in 1944 during an army furlough. Critic Frank Kermode has written an introduction and there's a brief preface by Waugh for the new edition. Also included is an interesting chronology of Waugh's life, paralleled by corresponding literary and historical events. There's also a bibliography of his works.This Knopf Everyman's Library hardcover edition is quite attractive, with shots from the movie tie-in on the dust jacket. I had one small complaint about the physical book--the inner margins are quite narrow.A postscript--The main character, Charles, has two children, Caroline and John. His wife insists on calling the son Johnjohn, much to Charles's dismay. This is curious, no?I received an advance review copy from the publisher."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"For a couple of bucks, you get Brideshead Revisted on your Kindle !!!

The new movie doesn't hold a candle to the e-book."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Brideshead Revisited is in many ways an anomalous work in the oeuvre of Evelyn Waugh. Better known for his scathingly funny satires, Waugh, in writing this novel, turned his freewheeling wit and awe-inspiring command of the English language toward writing what is perhaps his most serious work. The book is nonetheless, in many places, hilarious--but more so, from start to finish, Brideshead Revisited is charming, convincing, and infinitely compelling in providing a timeless panorama of English youth and high society whose power and beauty transcends all cultural barriers.I've heard all the criticisms of this book--I've heard Martin Amis accuse it of snobbery for its defense of English nobility; George Orwell ridicule the conservative sentiments of Waugh that sometimes seep into the novel; and many a critic denounce the novel's attempts to unite the story with theology as a failure. But none of that matters to me, because Brideshead Revisited was one of the few books I've read that I sincerely regretted finishing, for the sole reason that I'd rarely read a book that so thoroughly engrossed, entertained, and enlightened me.Well nigh all of the characters, minor and major alike, attract the reader's unwavering interest, often accompanied by a strong sense of sympathy, scorn, or even both. The book centers on the relationship of the protagonist, Charles Ryder, with the entire Flyte family, an aristocratic clan of Catholics who fascinate Ryder. Without giving away too many specifics, Brideshead Revisited, before its duration is spent, will relate one of the most authentic accounts of male friendship in literature, as well as what is, in my view, one of few literary love affairs whose ultimate success I found myself passionately rooting for all the way. From the witty and eminently likable Sebastian, to the sometimes endearingly maladroit Bridey, to the tragic Lady Marchmain, to the radiant and resolute Julia, the Flytes are one of the best-developed and most intriguing families you'll ever read about. As their stories, and Charles', unfold and interwine, the novel marches toward its inevitable and all-too-human conclusion, while drawing the reader closer and closer with every turn of the page--with some help from a stellar supporting cast.Perhaps the aspect of the book that fascinates me the most is, although all of the characters an events therein are figments of Waugh's imagination, one gets the irrepressible sense that the story could have played out no other way. The novel, of course, is rife with Waugh's choice themes and motifs--but to me those, and their alleged flaws, are all secondary concerns, because Brideshead Revisited is masterly storytelling at its pinnacle."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Originally published in 1944, and in spite of the military setting of the prologue, this novel has little to do with the World War, but is almost wholly about the estrangement of life among the upper British society as penetratingly portrayed and satirized by the antics of the Flyte and Ryder families during those years that paralleled the historical angst that lead into the Second World War.One of the very greatest writers of the twentieth century, Waugh is a commanding painter with words: such brilliant, precise, well-planned and placed words, much like a great work by Beethoven, ordered so inevitably that one knows that no other combination could speak clearer or louder or softer - or with more encompassing wit. It is a delight to read - and then re-read, to savor many of its perfect passages. Like: \\"...their barn-yard daughters will snigger and think their father was quite a dog in his day...\\"and: \\"Charm is the great English blight.... It kills love, it kills art; I greatly fear, my dear Charles, it has killed you.\\"Even the surnames are characterizations: Ryder - Charles, and even his unruffled father, smug in his mocking schemes, seemed content to just ride along with what the world subjects them to, sheltering an underlying laxness - or even care - with a smile of agreeableness and charm. The Flytes, all six of them, denizens of a countryside castle-like manor named Brideshead, have interesting ways of fleeing reality, acting at times like automatons grasping at or revolting against selected religious catechisms, or choosing the quiet death of a passionate alcoholic. Scenes change from Oxford, London, Venice, the Casbah or boat crossings of the Atlantic, but always, it seems, Brideshead calls. \\"...for we possess nothing certainly except the past...\\"Brideshead Revisited is the culmination of years of masterful writing and perhaps his very best novel: the biting satire and broad-handed humor of A Handful of Dust and Decline and Fall have been honed by experience and refined by humanity, as we come to respect and care for all the book's major characters, while along the way many subjects and ideas are presented on the reader's stage: faith and the role of God's Grace, independence, homosexuality, art, rights and responsibilities, and although a priest plays an important part, the reader will not be inveigled to find a confessional. Waugh gives us \\"...one of those needle-hooks of experience which catch the attention when larger matters are at stake, and remain in the mind when they are forgotten...\\"To paraphrase a Joni Mitchell song, Waugh has looked at love and life from not just both sides now, but countless sides, up and down, and given us the finest illusions to recall.This is a masterpiece of English literature: this classic cries out for reading!"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I loved this book. For those that do love this book it probably says something questionable about them. I first thought of this book as Existentialism meets Catholicism, in a uniquely English sardonic way. I think there is more to it than that. It is a about a man in conflict with the noise of life, he finds himself through the love of a college mate who he engages in undergrate frivolity with, despite the urgings of a graduate student relative. The haunting aspect of this novel maybe that the noise of life turns out to be his wife, his children, as well as his relationship with the army, and his own dad. The man that, if any, can be given credit for helping the narrator find himself, ends up losing himself. They all seem to lose themselves, in the end, except for one saving grace, their Catholic faith - which the narrator, despite much incredulity, in the begininning, also seems to fall into. After reading the reviews posted here I think it is safe to say that you may or may not like this book to the extreme. However, there does seem to be a universal love of the 1982 video series, with Jeremy Irons. The thred that seems to run through the Evelyn Waugh books, that I have read thus far, is the mockery of guru sorts that are often found in Existential novels. Maybe he is saying that one should not expect to save themselves, or find meaning, in anything but faith. The rest is noise. It is just troubling what the noise turns out to be."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Brideshead Revisited is a deeply moving book with sections that are better classified as poetry than prose -- from the opening sequence of Charles Ryder looking back at Brideshead and his past, comparing his falling out of love with the army to a man who has fallen out of love with his wife; to the scene where Charles and Julia crash against the wall aboard the windswept ship, her body pressed against his as he gazes out at the starry sky through her long hair against his face.But even more than the poetry of this book and the beautiful descriptions of Oxford and the time in which it is set (interwar Britain), it is the slowly unfolding tragedy of the book that makes it so appealing and moving. That, and the gradual but inexorable process of Charles' journey into maturity and the recognition that there is more to life than he had first realised. Definitely one of my favourite books of all time."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Evelyn Waugh made his name with acidly satirical novels focusing largely on the British upper classes' early twentieth century decline. Brideshead Revisited, ironically probably his most famous work, has similar themes but differs substantially in not being primarily satirical. There is some trademark Waugh wit to be sure, especially for those on the lookout, but this is more conventionally serious and ambitious. Not easy to classify, it is part comedy of manners, part historical fiction, and part romance; there are also quite a few comic and didactic elements and some symbolism. All this strongly suggests that Waugh was going for a masterpiece, and many fans and critics have called it such. It is certainly a commendable novel that deserves the high reputation it still has and is exemplary for characterization, a well-told story, and generally strong writing. The issue of whether it is Waugh's best book is essentially subjective, but it is certainly his broadest and probably his best written in conventional terms. However, it is brought down somewhat by a weak ending that makes the execution less stellar than Waugh's satirical masterworks and also harms his didactic purpose. This does not stop it from being an excellent novel but does keep it from true greatness.Unlike most Waugh works, Brideshead functions on several levels. Charles Ryder, its first-person narrator, is still young but past his formative experiences; now a World War II British Army Captain, he looks back on the events that brought him to where he is and made him the man he is. Chronologically, there is a definite progression - if not necessarily progress - from relatively carefree, nave youth to hard-won, belated adult wisdom. The novel can thus be legitimately seen as a bildungsroman - one that, moreover, many British men surely related to, as Ryder had many of his generation's characteristic experiences. This aspect is not strong enough to make Brideshead one of the great bildungsromans, but it is an important part of the book's worth and lasting value.More important is the Flyte family that is the focus for most of Ryder's important experiences as well as the titular homestead that is metonymically linked to them. Like the Last family in A Handful of Dust, Waugh's most enduring other work, they are a traditional upper-class British family struggling to keep up with modern society and maintain ancestral dignity. It is a tough battle, and history has shown that there were almost no survivors. Ryder comes from a class that is distinctly beneath them but close enough for him to become active in their affairs, and he sees their tragic disintegration as both observer and participant. They stand in for the many families like them, and there is much pathos in their story, which also brings out other emotions. This is all the more so in that, in contrast to Waugh's usual way, he does not poke fun at them. Their fall is portrayed in an unadorned manner, letting us draw our own conclusions about its social and historical meaning.As this suggests, Brideshead is a very moving and engrossing novel; it might not quite bring tears but draws us in and runs us through an emotional gamut. This is all the more notable in that, as in much of Waugh, no major character is likable. Only Cordelia, the youngest Flyte, and the family's Nanny Hawkins are even remotely so. The rest are vain, selfish, self-pitying, melodramatic, and more - yet, though they are far from conventionally sympathetic, we feel with, if not quite for, them. This is a triumph of Waugh's art, a trick only the best writers can pull off. The Flytes have a tragic flaw - the inherited pride the refuse to abandon -, and it proves to be their destruction in various ways. Objectively speaking, it is easy to say this is deserved, but it would take a hard heart not to have some feeling. There is a sense that they are doomed - if not necessarily victims of venomous fate, at least to a large extent casualties of time and place. Their story is fascinating and emotional enough to make the book worth reading.However, there is quite a bit more to the novel. A realist triumph, it is a vivid portrait of a distinct era; we get a good idea of how various British groups lived and thought. There is much social observation, especially in regard to class, religion, and art. Brideshead is particularly valuable as a realistic document of pre-WWII British college life; the most surprising thing may be how little has changed. We also get an interesting glimpse of an era when Catholicism was still a great social stigma in England even among the gentry - a topic close to Waugh. Class relations are also variously explored in Ryder's interactions with the Flytes. Ryder's role as painter meanwhile interestingly dramatizes the artist's role in the era and may be meant as far-reaching symbolism again arguably touching the author. Finally, though only briefly, the novel vividly shows WWII's profound effect on all aspects of British life. All of this is engrossing and entertaining; much is moving, some is comic, and quite a bit is thought-provoking.Brideshead also benefits from one of modern literature's most memorable and moving, if unconventional, depictions of love. Ryder and Julia Flyte are not the most likable characters to ever fall in love but are among the most believably and vividly drawn; much of what they experience will be widely and movingly familiar. As one would expect with Waugh, their relationship is no fairy tale; Brideshead does a superb job of conveying love's constant ups and downs with verisimilitude and emotion.Ryder's relationship with Julia's brother Sebastian is nearly as interesting in this regard and far more so otherwise. It is a startling example of just how recently intense male friendships could be carried on openly in Western society without homosexuality rumors. The move away from this is of course far more pronounced in America than in Europe, and the novel will certainly be far more of an eye-opener for Americans in this way. To what extent Waugh meant the relationship as homosexual, if at all, is of course debatable, and the seemingly ever-growing Queer Theory movement has few texts more open to explication, but there is much of sociological interest here for all.The novel could have been truly great, an undeniable masterpiece, if it only had an effective conclusion, but it unfortunately does not. The dubious tradition of having hedonistic and otherwise conventionally immoral characters undergo perfunctory religious conversion at a literary work's end goes back at least to Apuleius' [check]The Golden Ass, and this is unfortunately another entry. Waugh stated that the main theme is God's grace, and those paying any attention can see that it is, though there is no hint until the last few pages. The Flytes' troubled relationship with Catholicism is a theme throughout, and their trauma is the sort of thing that typically drives even the most guarded into desperation and thus religion, but the relative ease with which various members embrace it is simply absurd. The patriarch's deathbed conversion is particularly overwrought; however guilty his conscience, it is highly implausible. Far more significantly, Waugh fails to portray is convincingly. Ryder's anti-religious comments and actions throughout the scene have center stage, and any moderately engaged reader would think sympathy and strength are with him, yet Waugh would have us believe he is on the losing end. One critic aptly remarked that this episode would be one of Waugh's most brilliantly and subtly satirical if it were not meant so seriously - but unfortunately it is. The mercurial Julia's sudden conversion is far more plausible, especially as Waugh takes care to carefully foreshadow, but he should not be offended if many readers cynically question her sincerity and wonder how long her resolution will last. Most ridiculous of all is the conversion of Ryder. A staunch religion opponent throughout the novel lacking even the slightest sign of giving in, his change and newfound optimism, however uneasy, are simply unbelievable. He has had some difficult experiences but nothing to bring such a change. The sudden switch is almost self-parodical, an embarrassing artistic flaw leaving a bad taste in our proverbial mouths.I would dismiss all this as a cheap narrative trick in a lesser writer, but we must give Waugh the doubt's benefit. It is most likely a simple case of didacticism overcoming art; Waugh has a point to make about how God's mercy operates in seemingly illogical but ultimately beneficial ways but pushes far too hard. This would seem obvious even if we knew nothing about him, but there may be much biographical insight. Waugh converted to Catholicism not long before writing Brideshead and had a somewhat uneasy relationship with it for the rest of his life; most who have looked into it believe he was sincere even if hardly a model Christian. His desire to portray this in his work is very understandable, perhaps even inevitable, but many critics think that, like nearly all authors in similar situations, he let beliefs reduce artistry. Balancing them is extremely difficult and certainly not limited to religion; that Waugh could not is unfortunate but hardly surprising. This was the first real instance, but it is generally thought to infect his later writings to varying degrees. However, the ending thankfully does not ruin what is otherwise an excellent work, even if it does frustratingly hold off greatness.A few minor, additional warnings may be needed. Waugh is in my view one of modern fiction's great stylists, his conciseness, straight-forwardness, relative lack of allusion, and general avoidance of Modernist techniques making him stand out in an era when literature became ever less accessible. He may lean toward overly simple for some, but he has the great virtue of clearness that I value highly and that is so sorely lacking in much post-nineteenth century literature. That said, what was concise and clear sixty-plus years ago is not exactly so now. Waugh is formal and, in contrast to much subsequent fiction, especially the popular kind, somewhat stiff. He was not really pretentious but can easily come off as such to those not prepared to take him on his own terms. He was also uber-British, and Brideshead is particularly so; the country's culture and history infuse every aspect of the novel. This is of course not a bad thing, but those unfamiliar with British culture and literature - or who are averse to it - may be somewhat averse to the novel. My advice to them and all others not immediately taken with the novel is to stick with it. The ending is certainly a letdown, but Brideshead as a whole is one of the best post-nineteenth century English novels and should be read by anyone even remotely interested in literature of its various types."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"The purchase of Brideshead Revisited is one of sure investments in your library.

Alas, this, being my first journey into the mind of Evelyn Waugh, has ruined me for his other novels as they are not very similar to this one. This book, for me, has had a magical aura. It was written Post World War I, as a treatise to the past, which explains the grand departure from style and content from other novels. Charles Ryder returns to the Brideshead estate, releasing memories of his school days and his friendship with the exquisite Sebastian Flyte.This novel also carries an extreme theme of Catholicism and a family's attempt to flee from the faith of their mother. Like an unwoven spider web, the children, Sebastian, Julia, and Cordelia eventually become ensnared and return to the religion their mother showed them when they were children.This is an amazing novel.

Having read this novel several times, I always come back to it as Charles Ryder returned to Brideshead - with a host of memories and a feeling of great warmth. This was the novel which made me fall deeply in love with literature and is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful books ever written.The novel begins when Charles Ryder is billeted on an unknown country estate during WWII, which turns out to be Brideshead, a place he knew well. The story then unfolds of his meeting of the young Lord Sebastian Flyte at Oxford and his coming under the spell of the Marchmain family and of Brideshead itself. As the young promise of Sebastian declines into drink, Charles leaves Oxford and becomes an architectural artist, before finding that his relations with the family are not yet over when he meets Sebastian's sister Julia on a ship returning from New York.Evelyn Waugh looks at many themes in this novel: love, loss, family and religion all intertwine and interweave in this story. Of course, Waugh was a committed convert to the Catholic faith and religion lies heavily on virtually every page of this book. Divorce, conversion and the pressure of religion are all present. Lord Marchmain, living abroad with his mistress, does not enter the novel for some time, but he haunts the pages and his eventual return to Brideshead and death scene are a pivotal part of the book. This can be criticised for being about the aristocracy (Waugh himself wrote it during the war during a time of restrictions and privations and the glamour and wealth of a past life pour from the pages) or not being relevant, but the themes of disappointment, love, religion and loss are things we have all experienced.If you are interested in reading more about the family and house on which Evelyn Waugh based \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" you might enjoyMad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead(there is a kindle version, but it does not contain the illustrations available in the book version).

I too saw the 1981 Irons interpretation of Brideshead revisited. I tried to watch it again recently but it was very slow moving. When I saw this on the shelf at the library, I picked it up because Handful of Dust was a great book about colonialism. I was very surprised when I read in the preface that Waugh wrote this in 3 months! That's amazing! I disagree with many of the reviewers here in that I don't think Waugh was an amazing prose writer, but he did have a very interesting talent. His dialogue manages to capture things said and unsaid. The part where Ryder and Julia are in the boat are magical. Almost all of the religious discussions deal with such magificently huge issues but in an almost quick, offhand manner. He mentions that he toned down the excesses of food and opulence because he had written it in such a time of rationing and greyness. Just fascinating bit of historical fiction, and the interplay between the characters is great. I'm not sure I ever caught the charm of Sebastian, and being Catholic myself much of it was overwrought. I really recommend to anyone who picks up the Everyman version, check out the Preface. He writes that he didn't know at the time that Country Houses would be saved by the aristocracy, so he was writing with such vivid nostalgia. Anyways, he says it better than I!"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"On August 17, 1939, Waugh wrote in his diary, \\"I don't want to influence opinions, events, or expose humbug or anything of that kind. I don't want to be of service to anyone or anything. I simply want to do my work as an artist.\\"Certainly nothing useful can be added to the abundant praise of Waugh's wonderful artistry in creating \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", nor in Lindsey-Hogg's skill in bringing the novel faithfully to life on the screen. But we may wonder if Waugh lived up to the intent stated in his diary because \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" seems at first acquaintance to be an unabashed effort to present religious faith in a serious positive light without the skepticism so often found in modern fiction. Waugh strives to reach his goal through the delineation of his characters of whom Charles Ryder is masterfully portrayed by Jeremy Irons. We find Charles a rather cold, diffident, unsympathetically remote agnostic, and largely a foil for bringing the other characters to life in illustration of Waugh's chief agendas.Waugh's biographer, Christopher Sykes who knew Waugh personally, characterized him as something of a snob from middle class origins who looked up to the aristocracy, and looking down on the lower classes did not hesitate to make people feel ill at ease with regard to their origins through a clever form of bullying. We see this depicted by Waugh's reveling in the social gaffes on the voyage, and in the hair-cutting incident with Hooper and Charles contemptuous treatment of him, but curiously in the end Hooper appears to rise cheerfully above such harassments. Does Waugh see Hooper as too stupid and insensitive to know that he has been insulted, or of such inner strength that he makes his assailants look shabby by comparison? Waugh is said to have despised the man he modeled Rex Mottram on, characterizing Mottram as a fraud marrying Julia for advantage. But Mottram also is revealed as a pragmatic success in a society bound by the questionable prohibitions of Catholic doctrine regarding marriage and divorce.Biographer Sykes, a Roman Catholic himself, wrote that Brideshead Revisited. \\"is solely addressed to believing Catholics and admirers of the Catholic Church. The general reader is rather left in the cold.\\" This is certainly evident in the story's climax at Marchmain's deathbed scene where Charles first argues vehemently against a priest administering the last rites but suddenly undergoes a totally surprising conversion at the dying man's sign of acceptance. Whether Waugh brings this off successfully or not will depend of what the viewer/reader brings to the scene. Certainly what Waugh has shown us to this point is what misery the strictures of organized religion can impose on the lives of its subjects through guilt and conditioning. Sebastian drowning his remorse for his homosexuality in alcohol; Marchmain's alienation from his wife's obsessive conformity driving him to Paris and a loveless relationship with a mistress; Brideshead's mindless obedience condemning him to collecting matchboxes and a ridiculous marriage; Julia's lapses from doctrine leaving her with a life of endless tormenting guilt summed up in her final remark to Charles as she sacrifices her final chance at happiness, \\"I am not quite bad enough to set up a rival good to God's\\". All this and more leaves us with many questions as to what Waugh's intentions actually were as revealed in this masterpiece that is reality rather than fiction."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Charler Ryder, a rather sarcastic non-beleiver, reminisces about his experiences at Brideshead Mansion and its owners the Flyte's.Ryder first meets the family through his friendship with Sebastian a rather foppish character whose life is spiralling wildly out of control.

His multi-faceted and strikingly human depictions of the Brideshead inhabitants, his facility with language, his stately compression; few writers can claim to have so often struck upon le mot juste.

I read A Handful of Dust a few months ago and thought that the present book had more in it, i.e.: longer and a more interesting read, and it had a more realistic plot. According to what we know, Waugh had a few second thoughts about the present book.The story is really three stories that are separated in time which have been pieced together. It is set in post WWI England and it is about the protagonist and narrator Charles Ryder, a student at Oxford University college and his encounter with members of the Flyte family at Brideshead. The novel contains descriptions of his life as a student and then folllows through ten years or so into his adult life and his marriage.I will try and not give away the plot but give a quick sketch. The three pieces or sub-plots are his relationship with Sebastian Flyte, then Julia Flyte his sister, and then finally Lord Marchmain, an Anglican, converted to his wife's religion which is Roman Catholicism.Each of the three sub-plots has a different slant to the story. The relation with Sebastian is similar to an Oscar Wilde situation, and the reader is left in doubt to the extent of the relationship. Is it physical or platonic? Also, the author brings in the subject of alcoholism. Finally, that first section gives us a glimpse of life at Oxford post WWI.The central to last part of the novel with Julia is a more conventional love story, and then at the end we have the theme of divine grace and reconciliation of the father.Most people focus on the theme of Catholicism, and I thought that theme was rather weak until the last ten pages or so. One can suspect that the author has taken this approach so as not to isolate the audience early in the novel. We can assume the audience for the novel is not Catholic.Does it work? As a simple novel or as an entertaining work of art it works and the novel is interesting; it is ingenious and is a compelling read after the first 40 pages or so.As an advertisement for the Catholic faith I am less sure that the book works but the reader can judge.Recommend: 5 stars."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is the most beautiful book I've ever read!

The first section, in which we are introduced to narrator Charles Ryder and his Oxford friends, boded ill. The characters were all spoiled, lazy, unsympathetic, and I didn't see the book going anywhere of interest. Charles soon fixes on friendship with the particularly wealthy, juvenile Sebastian Flyte, whose antipathy for his family seems at first hard to understand.The bulk of the book relates Charles's dealings with Sebastian's family, and the rapid changes in tone and direction of the story provide so much pleasure for the reader that it would be cruel for me to allude to any specific developments and thus spoil them for others. Suffice it to say that the book deals with at least three major themes -- love (and more specifically, how people fall out of love, or realize they were never really in love), family (and more specifically, how our well-meaning relations can damage or stunt us), and religion (both the specific role of Catholics in early-20th-century Britain and the general challenge that people of faith have in dealing with those who don't, plus the shadow that one's childhood faith casts over the lives of even those people who think they have totally abandoned religiosity). Secondary themes include the passing of aristocratic mores in the years after WWI, and aBuddenbrooks-like consideration of the fall of a wealthy family. At a couple of points in the story, I expected that last point might develop into the book's major theme, but it never does, and I am pleased by this, as it would have been relatively cliche, and the book as written never is.Waugh's language is sometimes challenging, using academic or architectural words I've never seen before and may never see again (what is the significance of one's \\"oak\\" at Oxford?). However, on balance he picks his words perfectly. I was particularly fond of \\"crapulous\\" and \\"bondieuserie\\", words that really should make a comeback.Not all the characters are entirely realistic; the main characters are given some caricatures to play off of, and some of these (Rox Mottram for example) become the source of the book's funniest passages.Some passages are phrased so perfectly, so clear in communicating complex ideas without ever leaving the narrator's voice. I am thinking in particular of his groping for an analogy to describe English social relationships in terms of the interaction of subatomic particles, and also the narrator's recurring dream of a looming avalanche (the significance of which I can not mention without spoiling a significant plot point)."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I did a \\"cold\\" reading of this novel; that is to say, I read it without having seen the film version or even having read a synopsis of the plot.

The narrator's voice is laced with humor as well as quiet reflection, and he captivated me from the beginning. The first half of the novel, chronicling Charles Ryder's friendship with an eccentric young aristocrat, is the better half -- entertaining, original, quirky, unexpected. The second half takes the novel in a more conventional direction (though there was still plenty to keep me going).Beyond the social commentary and homoerotic undertones which are often central to people's analyses of the novel, Brideshead Revisited is first and foremost just a good read -- a detailed character study, a portrait of a family, a view into another world."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Told mostly in a long continuous flashback by Captain Charles Ryder during WWII, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a novel about sin and grace and the fall of the English aristocracy. The novel is divided into two parts. The first section deals with Ryder and his friendship with Sebastian Flyte. At the beginning of the novel, Capt. Ryder and his troops arrive at Brideshead, an English manor and estate that Ryder stayed in throughout his college days and youth after WWI. Brideshead was Sebastian's former home. This part of the novel deals with Charles relationship with Sebastian and how Sebastian's family came to \\"adopt\\" Charles into their strange little world.The second section of the novel begins years later and deals with the romantic relationship between Charles and Sebastian's sister, Julia. At this point, Charles is a semi-famous artist who is married with children. During a chance encounter aboard a ship returning to England, Charles and Julia meet again. Married to people that neither loves, they soon begin an affair and contemplate divorcing their spouses and starting a new life. What follows is an emotional and spiritual struggle as Charles and Julia wrestle to find temperance between their love for each other and Truth.BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is the first Evelyn Waugh story that I have ever read. I have been told that it is one of his best, if not his finest work. The novel is full of wit, local colour, and passion. It contains beautiful descriptive passages that at times I read several times over just because it was written so well.Nevertheless, Waugh has a very unique style. At times the reading is demanding at other times it was frustrating because I could sense condescension emitting from the pages. At times this tone caught me off guard and caused me to distance myself from the piece. There are many readers who just can't read a novel like this very well or if they can, they won't enjoy. Even though I wouldn't say it's one of the best books I've ever read, I did, however, enjoy the book. It is a novel filled with tragedies and triumphs. It is a novel about life, love, and loss. It is a novel about sin and grace and ultimately understanding and redemption. \\"No one is ever holy without suffering.\\""},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I can't read this book without remembering that it was written during the war, at a time when it really did look like the world might end at any moment.

This book is incredibly beautiful in passages, tragically bleak in others. You won't easily forget it."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I have read Brideshead Revisited two or three times; I saw the PBS serial a couple of times,but I never tire of the fine art of Evelyn Waugh in describing the characters in this novel. Perhaps there are no heroes, but we sympathize with the protagonists Charles Ryder and Julia Marchmain in their struggle to find happines, if not together, then at least on their own. Julia is aristocratic and rich, Charles a talented artist. Charles is an unbeliever and scoffs at the religion of the Marchmain family. In the end, Julia who had lost her faith for a time, finds her faith again and Charles discovers happiness in becoming a believer. The patient reader will find much to like in the spare but beautiful prose of Waugh."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"While this was Waugh's least favourite of his own books, the one that he blamed for exposing him to the trials of fan mail and public recognition, it is in fact, a great and glorious book. Spanning the short adult life of Sebastian Flyte, it is told retrospectively through the eyes of his friend and former lover Charles, who goes on, once youthful experimentation is over, to carry on an equally passionate and hopeless love affair with Sebastian's sister. But in some ways, these themes are not the great story. The larger pictures are of the slackening grip of British aristocracy, the power of love and the power of Faith. Waugh paints a masterpiece of the sweet, desperate years between the wars, at Oxford, in London and Paris, with one generation lost and the next helplessly watching history lurching towards a repetition of the same madness."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"[...]GENERAL SPOILER ALERT: If you've never read Brideshead Revisited, and would like to discover it with no previous knowledge of the plot, I suggest you stop here. Since it was published in 1944, I'm writing with the assumption that I'm the one late to the party and many of you lovers of literary fiction have probably either read it already or are super familiar with the plot. So, if not, stop. Now. You've been warned.Confession time: Until a few years ago, I thought Evelyn Waugh's name was pronounced Eh-vah-lynn Wow, and that he was a she. I wish I were kidding. One of the great epic fails in book snobbery. Regardless, every time I passed the \\"W\\" section at the bookstore or library, I'd see her his titles with their gorgeous cover art...but upon reading the back summary and coming to the words \\"set against the backdrop of World War II,\\" I usually put the book back on the shelf. With few exceptions, I love historical fiction...as long as the book doesn't take place entirely in the trenches. Before you yell, please note that I'm sure my bias has kept me from discovering a great many tomes. I just have a hard time getting into several hundred pages of war and destruction and blood and death and politics and guns and moral turmoil and brotherly bonding/bromance, etc. I know full well that there are many notable works of literature (mostly by dead white dudes) with fabulous plot lines and gorgeous prose (A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls...well, just Hemingway in general, War and Peace, All Quiet on the Western Front), and I'm sure I'll slug through a few of them for the general-betterment-of-self/expansion-of-overall-cultural-literacy at some point...it's just not my favorite.BUT a few months ago, I DVR'd (yes, I still DVR) Brideshead Revisited when it aired on Ovation and fell in love with the story. And when Waugh's name came up again in the Mitford biography I'm reading (he was friends with Nancy Mitford and is said to have taken inspiration from the Mitford kids among other Bright Young Things of the era), I read up on him and decided to add this and Vile Bodies to my 30-before-30 literary bucket list.Brideshead Revisited is, in fact, set in the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the years leading up to World War II, though only the prologue takes us anywhere near the trenches (phew!). Charles Ryder, our narrator, and his unit are stationed at Brideshead, which serves as catalyst for Charles to reflect on how he came to know the house and to tell the story of his two great loves who grew up there: Sebastian and Julia Flyte.I know there's debate as to whether the nature of the deep relationship between Charles and Sebastian had a sexual aspect....in my opinion, Charles' love for Sebastian (and vice versa) was absolutely romantic (see the definition), in terms of their relationship being imbued with their desire for adventure and their idealization of and total dependence on the other, often steeped in a reality exclusively their own. Also, I think they probably had sex at one point. Or at more than one point. Or at least fooled around. It was an era of experimentation (booze! jazz!), and it wasn't super uncommon for young men to experiment that way in boarding school or when away at college, or because they were, in fact, gay or bisexual, etc. (n.b. Tom Mitford, brother of Nancy Mitford et al, for example, is thought to have had at least one homosexual relationship in his youth and according to this Telegraph UK article, Waugh may or may not have been involved at one point with a gentlemen who has been said to have inspired Sebastian). I loved the contrast Waugh was able to strike between the love shared by Charles and Sebastian and the love shared by Charles and Julia. Charles and Sebastian's relationship imploded because, in a way, they preferred to cling to the idealized version of the other (it's hard to live in the reality where the person you feel closest to is an alcoholic with some fairly deep emotional problems. I think, in many ways, Sebastian's flight to Morocco, etc. occurred out of love for Charles, to protect Charles from destructive force he knew he had become. Maybe on some level, Charles understood it as the gift of a unmarred, idyllic past, as he says on page 203 \\"These memories, which are my life--for we possess nothing certainly except the past--were always with me.\\"). Charles and Julia's romance imploded because they failed to move beyond the reality of their situation (i.e. Julia's deeply entrenched Catholic belief system was a tad restrictive, and then there was her nagging insistence upon avoiding eternal damnation...a bit prohibitive to a divorce/second marriage to another divorcee who also happens to be an agnostic). It's a book as much about denial as it is about desire, and how both can be acts of love.My favorite character by far was Cordelia, Sebastian Flyte's young sister, and I died laughing at scene where she talks Catholicism with Charles upon their first meeting:\\"[Cordelia says] 'D'you know, if you weren't an agnostic, I should ask you for five shillings to buy a black god-daughter.'[Charles] 'Nothing will surprise me about your religion.'[Cordelia] 'It's a new thing a missionary priest started last term. You send five bob to some nuns in Africa and they christen a baby and name her after you. I've got six black Cordelias already. Isn't it lovely?' \\"(p. 82)She's so precocious, and fancies herself to be so forward thinking, yet she acts almost as a mirror against which Waugh is able to reflect back everything he saw wrong with the Catholic church at the time (and possibly with religion in general, but given that he and I never discussed the matter, this is purely conjecture), but she's also such a likable character due to her youth and wit. Through Cordelia especially, Waugh shows us how no person is only one thing; that no thing is either solely good or bad.Waugh was such a dynamic and flexible writer. He possessed such a gift for characterization and voice! I wish I had even a fraction of his stylistic dexterity! (Just a fraction! I'm not greedy!) Even at the most tragic moments, Waugh's wit (I can't help noting these observational zingers as evocative of Oscar Wilde at his best in The Picture of Dorian Gray) shines through. For example, when Lord Marchmain is dying, his mistress Cara says this of his condition: \\"His heart; some long word at the heart. He is dying of a long word.\\" (p. 288)Rubric rating: 8.5.

Our narrator, a non-Catholic officer based on the home front in World War II Britain, revisits a mansion he first visited as a young man and reflects back on his close relationship with a Catholic family. A non-Catholic himself, he reports to us about their habits and customs almost as if he were an anthropologist visiting a tribe in the tropical rainforest. It's a great book and, of course, it's been made into a Masterpiece Theatre series years ago. There are many reviews of this work already, so just to illustrate the excellent writing, I will just say that I think the romantic episode on an ocean liner during a storm at sea (her husband is absent; his wife is laid up with seasickness) is the most romantic passage I can think of in literature."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is about a family and their religious beliefs, viewed from without, as every family and faith must be if they are to be viewed at all. The narrator is, by turns, the friend of one sibling and the lover of another, but neither his affection nor his concern can grant him passage to the haunted chambers of the Brideshead mansion or guide him through the tortured relations its corridors resemble. It is a book about belief and religion, grace and wealth, eros and convention, culture and aristocracy--hence, the good and its shadow. Along with Greene's \\"The End of the Affair,\\" this is one of the English-speaking world's classic fictional meditations on the hold religious belief exercises on the human heart, regardless of the passions that pull it in other directions.What sets Waugh apart (along with the likes of Joyce and McCarthy) from other great novelists is the sheer beauty of his prose. Reading the first few pages never fails to move me to tears, and I don't know exactly why. But even the sound of the words in my mind is like the linguistic equivalent of a chocolate truffle, melting before you can savor it. Waugh writes like John Singer Sargent paints--with exquisite attention to every brushstroke--so that's it's not just the cumulative effect of the ideas which moves you, but the words and sentences themselves, as if the profundity of the story somehow overflows its bounds to leak back into every word with which it is told."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Charles Ryder, an English soldier, arrives in the middle of the night at the new home of his troops. They are to be stationed at an old country estate. When Charles awakens the next morning, he is surprised to find that he recognizes the place--it is Brideshead, a place with which he was very familiar during his college days. His best friend's family lived there, and Charles descends into memories of the friendship and the collapse of his friend's family.Sebastian Flyte is unlike anyone Charles has known. He is glamorous and cultured, moody and outrageous. He meets Charles accidentally in their first year at Oxford, and the two become nearly inseparable. Charles is dazzled by his friend and, despite Sebastian's irritation, he ends up becoming close to the rest of the family, too. Sebastian's father is living abroad in scandal with his mistress. Sebastian's mother is at home, clinging to her Roman Catholic faith and worrying about her children. Sebastian's older brother is proper and largely disapproving of Sebastian, but his two sisters love him a great deal.Every member of the family is affected by their Catholic upbringing, and they are fascinated by Charles, who is an atheist.As Sebastian begins to feel smothered by his family, he starts drinking heavily. The more he drinks, the more his family tries to keep him under control, to pull him back to the family fold, and this ends up pushing him even more quickly into alcoholism.In the second part of the book, Charles examines his relationship with Sebastian's sister, Julia, and the two of them observe as the family completely disintegrates.I really liked the intricate examination of the family, and the ways they interacted with each other, and also the ways that they presented themselves in society. I liked Charles and Sebastian's relationship in the first part of the book, and the ways they balanced each other. I also really liked Charles' father and the quiet war they fought when Charles came home from college penniless for his vacation.In the second part of the book, it was much more difficult for me to relate to or to like Charles very much. He'd descended into someone so shallow, who was only interested in his own pleasures and ambitions, and who abandoned his family for little reason. Julia, also, became annoying, especially toward the end when she was rediscovering her faith. The characters, so bright and lively at the beginning of the story, became duller toward the end."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"There is little to add to the excellent reviews on this book. Nearly seventy years after its first publication in 1944 Brideshead Revisited continues to exert its spell over readers. The PBS series that aired during the 1980s was a routine topic at the \\"water cooler.\\" In fact, the office eventually organized group viewing sessions so we could drink while we watched the program. It is not possible to ignore the role that Catholicism plays in this novel, but too much can be made of it as well, reducing the scope and importance of Charles Ryder's recollections. What Brideshead accomplishes at the end of the novel is, in my view, quite remarkable. To be sure, Book II of the novel can seem quite distinct from Book I, at least in that Waugh seems not to have laid the groundwork for the novel's fast moving ending. And yet, there is, throughout Brideshead an emphasis on ritual, at Oxford, at the mansion, in the community and within the family. At the end of the novel, it is ritual that forges ahead of belief -- the ritual of last rites for the family patriarch that seems to pull him to belief, not long after he (Alex) had told the attending priest: \\"I am not in extremis and I have not been a practicing member of your church for twenty-five years.\\" All that past hate did, in the end, turn out to be, as Cara, Lord Marchmain's mistress earlier told us, \\"something in [himself that he hated] (p 103). Whatever one thinks of the outcome, Brideshead Revisited endures, not for the solution to which it points, but for the questions it raises. Thus it remains relevant from WWII to the present."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"If you've never read anything by Waugh before, this is a good place to start. It keeps enough of his humor to be read for enjoyment, but it certainly included other themes--religion, friendship, betrayal (classic soap-opera love stories).But before you read it, you should be aware that Brideshead Revisited is really two books. The first half is about the narrator, Charles Ryder, and his relationship with Sebastian Flyte. After they meet in college (Sebastian gives Charles a hothouse full of flowers), they develop an extremely close, possibly homoerotic relationship. Sebastian introduces Charles to his family, and the whole thing begins to slowly fall apart in chapters that are painful to read.The second half of the book is about Charles' relationship with Sebastian's sister, Julia. It could be said that this is more psychologically accurate than the first half of the book, as all of the characters' flaws are exposed in gory detail. However, it's simply less fun to read. One of the most important characters from the first half, who you will probably love as much as I did, simply disappears. The two halves of the book are very sloppily connected, as Waugh tries to change course too quickly.With the movie coming out soon, it might be a good idea to read this book now. Unlike the TV series, the plot of the movie looks to be significantly changed. Despite it's serious flaws, Brideshead Revisited is worth reading and enjoying on its own merits."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"at this time I have not read the book, I will read it at my earliest convenience.

For the characters of Brideshead Revisited, it is a fishing line:\\"I caught him with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the line.\\"Beginning with a summertime outing in the English countryside, and ending in the darkness of World War II, BR attempts to trace the thread of grace as it leads Charles and the Brideshead family back to the heart of God. What exactly that means the reader will have to discern himself, but the result is a mixture of both the organic and the contrived. But what else would one expect from a divine plan?Evelyn Waugh writes dialogue effortlessly; the characters of Sebastian, Brideshead, Edward Ryder, Julia, Lord Marchmain, Anthony Blanche--all of them speak with an ease that in part is due to their upperclass status but moreso to the skill of Waugh. His ear for voices is remarkable--I never read a line of dialogue that I didn't hear in my head with a distinct, vital voice.If I chose to complain (which I have not), my only issue would be with the topic of divine grace. The few moments that struck me as false were a certain character's guilt-speech concerning the death of Christ, a later moment from the same character on the possibility of living outside of God's grace, and a specific scene of witnessing someone crossing himself which I will not further elaborate on, for the sake of spoilers. At these moments the machinery of grace showed itself, and by this I mean the machinery of the plot. It's the only time the characters seem to do unexpected and unaccountable things, and I felt the story suffered for it. Some will call it grace, and attribute these changes of character to divine power. I will call it Waugh.Finally, Waugh's prose is at times ornamental, but in my estimation, always appropriate to the task and quite beautiful to boot. My favorite bit was Marchmain's monologue near the end, which is a gorgeous blend of prose and poetry. The potentially challenging aspects of this novel are its religious themes and its vocabulary. If one is familiar with British slang and idioms, this will likely pose no problem, but if you're a stranger to phrases like \\"come a cropper\\" and the like, you have been warned. What I found difficult was the usage of architectural terminology I was unfamiliar with. However, I am guessing Waugh uses a rather stock vocabulary of architectural terms, and I simply need to memorize them for future endeavors. Quibbles aside, I really can't recommend this one enough. Five stars."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Often considered Waugh's 'magnum opus,' this novel of epic proportions follows the conflicted Charles Ryder through his involvement with the enchanting Flyte family. After befriending Sebastian Flyte at Oxford, Charles is gradually introduced to his sisters, Julia and Cordelia; his stolid brother, Brideshead; his estranged father, Lord Marchmain; his pious mother, Lady Marchmain; and, most importantly, Brideshead, their grand estate. Over the course of the story, Charles faces varying degrees of propinquity to each member of the family as he becomes a member of the family himself. Through these relationships, he is forced to make choices concerning love, his future, and religion.Almost a character within itself, the topic of religion is constant throughout the novel. The Flyte family's Catholicism, we come to find, is of differing importance to each family member. Charles, however, never quite comes to terms with it, resulting in an inveterate rift between the family and him.I only assign four stars to the novel due to its prolonged nature, even at points of the story that have no consequence to Charles' self-discovery, most particularly the scene in which Charles and Sebastian are thrown in jail."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is not THE FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS AND HOW THEY GREW, but it is close. An outsider, Charles Ryder, (a near orphan), is befriended by a family, Lord and Lady Marchmain and their children, Bridey, Julia, Sebastian, and Cordelia. Of particular importance to the progression of the story are Sebastian and Julia.Published in the United States in 1945, the novel has enduring interest as witnessed by the television mini-series and the movie. A contemporary reviewer noted that Waugh was writing at the top of his form, that the book was mature Waugh. The description of the art noveau style decoration of the chapel at Brideshead Castle is priceless.Waugh uses a bundle of qualities to typify the major characters. That is to say, they stand for this and that, and may be visualised in such and such a way. And, as in so much of Waugh, the reader is shown the characters in action, they speak at great length, exhaustively. There are embedded first-person narratives, that of Charles Ryder in the outer ring, addressing the reader, and Anthony Blanche speaking to Charles at length, for example.The reader need not be concerned that there is nothing funny in the volume under review, because there is. The portrait of Charles Ryder's father endeavoring to diversify Charles's evenings at home during the vacation is one of many instances of merriment. When Charles spends part of the same vacation with Sebastian Flyte, the author describes youth as langorous, generous.Unfortunately the golden days of Charles and Sebastian don't last. Sebastian is sent down from Oxford and Charles goes to seek preparation for his career in the visual arts. When Charles is dismissed from Brideshead by Sebastian's mother he feels that he is entering reality. Charles leaves with an understanding the banishment is to last forever.When his mother, Lady Marchmain, is dying, Charles sets out for Morocco in search of Sebastian. Sebastian is withered by drink. Charles arranges for Sebastian's brother Bridey to give him an allowance. Charles receives a commission to paint the house at Brideshead, his first.Both Sebastian and Julia return to the practice of religion, Catholicism. The return has many consequences to their own lives and the life of Charles.The book is both witty and good."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"As someone very interested in the field of Queer Theory, I was pleasantly surprised to pick up this book and discover such fascinating love relationships in the life of Charlie Ryder. Set between the two World Wars, Brideshead Revisited follows the life of Charlie Ryder and his dealings (and romances) with members of the Flyte family. Waugh has both a beautiful way with words and a scathing, satirical wit. He seems to revere and scorn the British aristocracy. Charlie is in love with the beautiful but highly eccentric/flamboyant Sebastian, and later moves on to the sister who bears an uncanny resemblance to her brother. Though I have never heard the book mentioned in a Queer Theory course, it would certainly be a fitting novel in which to apply ideas of queer performativity etc.Through this book, I have become a big fan of Waugh and look forward to reading more of his many works.For those interested in visual representations of classic novels, there is also a miniseries (available on Netflix) of the same title which actually got the book re-recognized in the early 1980s. It is quite good--Jeremy Irons plays Charlie Ryder in his first screen role ever."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I too was going to buy the Kindle edition , I already have it in book form , and both the new movie and the TV series. But after reading the other comments I will not be getting this version."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This book is marvelous...when it was written it may have been valued for the story of religious convictions and societal conventions coming between a man and a woman who were in love. Today it is more of a fascinating tale of a way of life that is not to be found on any continent, any country, anywhere. I'm especially fascinated with the &quot;roaring twenties&quot; which to me, with my historical detachment, are kind of like the 60's only without the still lingering societal wounds. My first introduction to this story was the amazing &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; adaptation which starred Jeremy Irons and his laconic british-accented narration. To this day I associate everything before the 1940's with the always detached, always calm, always above all capable attitude that came across in the series. Maybe the main reason to read this book today is simple escapism. Maybe you just want to enter a world of easy privilege, if only for an hour or two. Maybe you just want to be reminded that the people that you know, and how they behave, is probably the most important thing in your life. It's nothing to be ashamed of, and Evelyn Waugh accomplishes all of these things admirably."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Waugh's prose is a joy to read but the story itself is dissatisfying. The book begins with an intensely close relationship between the narrator and Sebastian Flyte, and for starters, Sebastian is neither interesting nor likeable. And as much as we are told of the intensity of the friendship and love between these two, it's really something the reader has to accept at face value. It's not \\"powerful,\\" despite several gushing reviews to that effect. Sebastian later becomes an alcoholic, exits the stage for points east, and there never is much of a sense of closure with him. Instead, his sister Julia, a minor character in the early chapters, becomes the love interest, while the most (only?) interesting, intelligent, independent and funny character, Anthony Blanche, flits in and out of the plot at odd intervals. In all, Brideshead Revisited is a stuffy soap opera about a pious upperclass British family, and as such it epitomizes Mark Twain's description of classic literature: a book everyone wants to have read but nobody wants to read."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"The book came unbelievably quickly from America, it is a great book but this old version is perfect as a souvenir. The worn cover gives it a lot of character."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"There are several really good reviews of this book including those by Gary F. Taylor and Mary Whipple, so I'll just comment on the book as a Catholic conversion story. It has been said that \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" reflects in some sense Waugh's own conversion to Catholicism. If that is why you are interested in this book, know that it is a subtle story. On the surface Waugh paints a picture of Catholicism through the Marchmain family that is not very attractive. The Marchmain family is rather split between those who remain devout Catholics and those who are rebelling against it, and for the most part those who are rebelling are painted in the more positive light. That is rather oversimplifying it a bit because the characters are not one dimensional stereotypes. Still, it gives you a general sense of the family dynamics and the surface portrait of Catholicism, and this remains the general tone throughout the book. Don't expect some dramatic conversion to suddenly paint Catholicism as all perfect and rosy and right. It's not to be found. Yet Waugh still manages to somehow give one a sense of the power and importance of faith and grace in each of his character's lives. It is not the same for every character, and it is not a neat tidy package for any of them, yet it seems always to be there. For me, this quote from the book sums it up best:\\"'I caught him with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the thread.'\\"This is a memorable book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"After an unpleasant chance first encounter, protagonist and narrator Charles Ryder, a student at an unnamed Oxford University college (though critics have suggested Waugh used Hertford College as his model; in the television series Charles Ryder wears a St Edmund Hall tie), and Lord Sebastian Flyte, the younger son of an aristocratic family and himself an undergraduate at Christ Church, become friends. Sebastian takes Charles to his family's palatial home, Brideshead Castle, where Charles eventually meets the rest of the Flyte family, including Sebastian's sister, Lady Julia Flyte.During the holiday Charles returns home, where he lives with his father. Scenes between Charles and his father Ned (Edward) provide some of the best-known comic scenes in the novel. During the holiday he is called back to Brideshead after Sebastian incurs a minor injury. Sebastian and Charles spend the remainder of the summer together.Sebastian's family is Catholic, but only first generation: Lord Marchmain, an Anglican, converted to his wife's religion, Roman Catholicism. Religious considerations arise frequently among the family, and Catholicism influences their lives as well as the content of their conversations, all of which surprises Charles, who had always assumed Christianity to be \\"without substance or merit.\\" Charles is also put off religion by Lady Marchmain, Sebastian's mother, a devout Catholic who tries to control others through guilt and manipulation. Sebastian, in some ways a troubled young man, learns to find greater solace in alcohol than in religion, and descends into that habit, drifting away from the family over a two-year period, which occasions Charles' own estrangement from the Flytes. Yet Charles is fated to re-encounter the Flyte family over the years, and eventually forms a relationship with Julia, who by that time is married but separated from the wealthy but uncouth Canadian entrepreneur, Rex Mottram.Charles plans to divorce his own wife -- who has been unfaithful -- so he and Julia can marry. However, motivated by a comment by her brother and by her father's deathbed return to the faith, Julia decides that she can no longer live in sin, and for that reason can no longer contemplate marriage to Charles. Lord Marchmain's reception of the sacrament of Extreme Unction also influences Charles, who had been \\"in search of love in those days\\" when he first met Sebastian, \\"that low door in the wall...which opened on an enclosed and enchanted garden,\\" a metaphor that informs the work on a number of levels. Waugh desired that the book should be about the \\"operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely connected characters.\\"During the Second World War, Ryder, now an army officer after establishing a career as an architectural artist, is billeted at Brideshead, once home to many of his affections. It occurs to him that builders' efforts were not in vain, even when their purposes may appear, for a time, to be frustrated.This is a wonderful, well-written book, about nostalgia for a time that was rapidly disappearing, thrust aside for a much more harsher and more modern existence.The book itself is a beautiful edition, and a lovely experience to read."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Evelyn Waugh's book \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" gives you that feeling of autumnal-university-literature-class heaviness that you crave from time to time. Like that piece of chocolate cake that you shyed away from the other day, it's something that is too dense and too heavy for you to eat hurriedly but something that you want to sit and take time with.There are all of the usual literary forms in this book which employs memories of Post-WWI modernist progressivism framed by the mires of WWII meaninglessness. But Waugh isn't doing this simply for the want of honor and tradition that seem to have been lost to progress and get-'er-done type flunkies, he's (and yes, he is a \\"HE\\") doing it for your soul.Evelyn Waugh was an adult convert to Roman Catholicism, and you can trace both his faith as well the memories of his wrestling against faith in this book. The book uses the protagonist of Charles Ryder to explore the lives and existential nature of the family that resides in the Brideshead mansion. It is a look into human nature as it wrestles with all sorts of things, and especially as it wrestles with faith.The book is one of the many that are lumped into the \\"hound of heaven\\" category. Over and over in the book, we see that no matter how far astray or how morally and ethically objectionable people are - God's grace seeks after them and brings them back with a twitch upon the thread that connects them to God.Although the book isn't overtly Christian, the Christian reader can certainly enjoy a deeper level of significance. The non-Christian can also enjoy the book, especially the look into the Christian life that shows that even Christians aren't ever perfect, nor do they need to be - they know a hound of heaven who is."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is a story of an aristocratic, very Catholic family in Protestant England, and of the narrator, a well to do friend of the family who we meet as he enters Oxford, and leave as a middle aged establishment artist. It is a novel of character, but also of class, religion, and beauty. It is beautifully written, and is moving, sad and sometimes funny. Part of the genius of this novel is that not only do the characters evolve, but your understanding deepens, so that there is a cumulative impact. It is a book in which you cannot always take what the characters, including the narrator, say at face value, not because they are dissimulating, but because they don't have complete insight into themselves. Extending this idea, I would suggest that Catholicism is not quite as dominant an influence as the book seems to suggest, and that disfunctional parenting plays a major role that the narrator (not to be confused with Waugh) is not sufficiently developed as a human being to appreciate."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Although Brideshead Revisted starts out a little dry, this novel's beautiful language and syntax will definitely keep the book in your hands. The story is about a young man, Charles Ryder, and his relationships with the Flyte family. Sebastian Flyte, the younger brother, is Charles' best friend throughout his college days. Sebastian has a whole family full of characters that challenge Charles to re-evaluate his opinions on everything from religion to relationships. I don't think my words can do justice, though, to the words of Evelyn Waugh, his writing is masterful, and I believe you will thoroughly enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"As other reviewers have already mentioned, this book operates at a few different levels.

Can't wait for it to come out in Kindle!"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Evelyn Waugh's BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a flawed masterpiece. It is his only major novel that is not fundamentally a comic novel, as well as his most clearly religious one. In the opinion of many readers - for instance, the great British novelist Henry Green wrote his friend Waugh that he loved the book but did not care for the ending. Famed critic Edmund Wilson felt the same way, as have many, many readers. Charles Ryder's conversion and the not terribly breakup of his and Julia's engagement are not very compelling or convincing. First his intense hostility to Lord Marchmain's taking Last Rites seems to come out of nowhere - at least in its strength and intensity - and then his conversion is even more out of the blue. Waugh had intended the novel to be about Divine Grace, but most readers, including most Christians, find the religious aspects of the book off putting, not least because his theology is unpalatable. Most Catholics that I have talked to find his religious views harsh and un-Christian and Protestants care for them even less. This was my third time to read BRIDESHEAD REVISITED and all three times the ending of the book struck me as hollow and unconvincing.Yet, this is one of my favorite books. How can I love a book so deeply that ends so poorly? There are three reasons. First, Charles Ryder's narrative voice is one of the most splendid in all of literature. His world-weary and defeated telling of the tale is poetic and beautiful, though heartbreaking and unspeakably sad. I would place Charles among the four or five most haunting narrators in all of literature. Second, Waugh's dialogues are exceptionally fine. On a first reading there are dozens of conversations that stick with the reader and get replayed in one's mind over and over. The best in the book are actually not dialogues but monologues by Anthony Blunt, one of the most entrancing supporting characters in fiction. Third, Waugh has created in this book some of the most vividly conceived characters in English literature. All three of these factors merge to create many of the most perfect moments one could hope to experience.All of which makes the ending of the novel even more heartbreaking. As a Catholic convert Waugh wanted to write the Great Catholic Novel for his age. I don't think he succeeded. He made nothing even remotely resembling a case for Catholic belief. Waugh's God - or at least the God projected by the Brideshead set - is hard and implacable and unyielding. But Waugh did manage to created an unforgettable novel of frustrated dreams of youth and self-destruction. Oddly enough, despite the novel beings set among the last days of the English aristocracy and its supplanting by business tycoons - though both feature in the novel as background - it isn't too much about changing class in Britain. But focusing on those elements would have made the book about something other than it was. It was about the individuals belonging to the class rather than the class itself, though the knowledge of what was happening to the class lies like a shadow in the background.The book is also structured around the two romances that Charles has with two members of the Flyte family. It isn't made clear whether Sebastian and Charles have a physical relationship, but their friendship, even if platonic, is clearly romantic. In one way Charles's affair with Julia is merely the consummation of what had started with Sebastian, something that Charles says explicitly to Julia.Had the ending of this book been up to the level of the rest of the book, this might well have been one of the finest English novels ever written. Even as it is, it is a very fine book. I don't think it is Waugh's best novel, even though it contains some of the best things he ever wrote (my vote for his most perfect books would be the Sword of Honour Trilogy, SCOOP, and A HANDFUL OF DUST). And the novel is one of the reasons that Waugh is among my favorite writers. I look forward to reading it for a fourth time.I additionally strongly recommend the exceptionally find BBC miniseries based upon the novel, starring Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder and Anthony Andrews as Sebastian and Laurence Olivier as Lord Marchmain. I honestly believe that it is the single finest production ever made for television and it is pretty much a scene for scene recreation of the novel. It is also the finest version of a novel that I believe has ever been done either for television or film."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Other reviewers have commented on the elements of the plot so I won't do so here.What a great cast of characters! Each profoundly deep and profoundly real. In modern literature and pop cultural depictions, religious characters are usually one dimensional and lack empathy. It's either the 'spiritual' character who is tolerant and affirming of all or the more commonly represented by a close-minded, dogmatic individual. The depictions in Brideshead Revisited are deeper and nuanced. I would say that this book is almost a case study in Cognitive Dissonance - a concept not dwelt on nearly enough by most people. Despite their foibles and sins, the religious characters of the book maintain some semblance of faith and some desire for righteousness. We live in a time where Hypocrisy is the greatest of sins; the prescription being if you can't act out what you believe, change your beliefs. This book puts forward just the opposite solution (though the book is not preachy in the least) - maintain the faith and keep on keeping on."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I thought the reading was a bit difficult at first but then I got into the plot and the characters. I completely fell in love with Sebastien's character and the new movie that's out is was just the icing on the cake for this book."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Waugh has given the modern reader a true as possible glimpse into the English aristocracy of the 20' and 30's. He admits that the novel was semi-auto-biographical, as he writes in 1959:\\"It seemed then that the ancestral seats which were our chief national achievement were doomed to decay and spoliation like the monasteries in the 16th century. So I piled it on rather, with passionate sincerity.\\"These old English mansions and the \`culture' that lived within its walls unfortunately were and are, close to extinction. So for Waugh, he felt passionately compelled to write this book for future generations.Lord Marchmain's patriarchal hold on his family was immense: rules of aristocratic society and the Catholic church's dogmas, at times, contradicted each other, which in turn ruined many lives during that period. This I believe is the essence of the novel, prompting the reader to ponder man-made laws and rules (whether church or state) that do indeed change with the times.Sebastian is my favourite character: eccentric, playful, creative, intelligent and a hopeless alcoholic. Some reader's have suggested that his latent homosexuality, his religious belief's, and the guilt this imposed on his conscience, was the cause, in the end, of his drinking himself to death. This may be true. But as another reviewer has written, all the characters in this novel are terribly complex, and to make such a diagnosis may be too hasty, premature, and needs further discussion.For some modern readers this novel may seem dated or irrelevant. However Waugh gives a little insight into the life and times of a culture that has passed into history.Excellent reading."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Like most great novels, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is about a great many things--not the least of which is the decline of English aristocracy. But at center, Evelyn Waugh's greatest novel (and one of his few non-satirical works) is about religious faith, and how that faith continues to operate in the lives of even those who seem to reject it, and how that faith supports even those who falter badly in it.The story is complex. It is told in the first person by narrator Charles Ryder, who develops a close and possibly homoerotic relationship with artistocrat Sebastian Flyte while the two are students at Oxford. Seduced by the glamor of Flyte's way of life and the beauty of his ancestrial home at Brideshead, Ryder becomes deeply involved with Flyte's family as well--a Roman Catholic family in which the various members either use their religion to manipulate others or actively rebel against it. With the passage of time, Sebastian's drinking expands into alcholism--which appears to be fueled by his guilt at rejecting the church, a rejection which may be based on his own uncertain sexuality. Ryder consequently transfers his affections to Sebastian's sister Julia--but again religion influences their relationship: Julia has made an unfortunate marriage, and although she is willing to engage in an affair with Ryder, she may not be willing to divorce her husband, an act that will cast her completely outside the bounds of her faith.The characters involved in the story are often extremely charming, but they are not necessarily admirable, and the passage of time in the novel nibbles away at their charm in such a way as to expose their flaws; even the narrator, Charles Ryder, gradually emerges as a somewhat second-rate person of dubious integrity. Even so, there remains a strange element of hope in the novel, a sense of God's grace and mercy even in the face of deliberate affront. Poetically written with considerable beauty and a sense of lost innocence that haunts the reader, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a too-often misinterpreted and misunderstood book that demands a thoughtful reading to get down into the marrow of its thematic bones. Powerful, beautiful, memorable--a book to read and enjoy again and again. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is a fairly sizeable novel. It would normally take me about three days with pretty substantial reading time during those days. But there was just something about it, and I made time and read this one pretty much straight through. It is easily one of the most wonderful novels I have ever read.There is so much to like about it. There is sheer joy in reading Waugh's prose as small nuggets of humor and beauty are uncovered throughout. The characters are pretty over-the-top (done on purpose) which makes them entertaining, but the depth of the characters is the truly striking thing. It's usually between the lines, but these characters are changing dramatically throughout, and for the better. I think the theological discussion running throughout the novel is what really makes it rise to true greatness. Waugh's making a compelling argument for a moral universe, and he is revealing what God's grace may look like working in people's lives.Brideshead Revisited is true masterpiece that really cannot be missed by any lover of literature or by any person looking for some meaning out there. It's a joy in every sense of the word. This is one book I'm going to come back to."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Published in 1945, this novel, which Waugh himself sometimes referred to as his \\"magnum opus,\\" was originally entitled \\"Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder.\\" The subtitle is important, as it casts light on the themes--the sacred grace and love from God, especially as interpreted by the Catholic church, vs. the secular or profane love as seen in sex and romantic relationships. The tension between these two views of love--and the concept of \\"sin\\"--underlie all the action which takes place during the twenty years of the novel and its flashbacks.When the novel opens at the end of World War II, Capt. Charles Ryder and his troops, looking for a billet, have just arrived at Brideshead, the now-dilapidated family castle belonging to Lord Marchmain, a place where Charles Ryder stayed for an extended period just after World War I, the home of his best friend from Oxford, Lord Sebastian Flyte. The story of his relationship with Sebastian, a man who has rejected the Catholicism imposed on him by his devout mother, occupies the first part of the book. Sebastian, an odd person who carries his teddy bear Aloysius everywhere he goes, tries to escape his upbringing and religious obligations through alcohol. Charles feels responsible for Sebastian's welfare, and though there is no mention of any homosexual relationship, Charles does say that it is this relationship which first teaches him about the depths of love.The second part begins when Charles separates from the Flytes and his own family and goes to Paris to study painting. An architectural painter, Charles marries and has a family over the next years. A chance meeting on shipboard with Julia, Sebastian's married sister, brings him back into the circle of the Flyte family with all their religious challenges. Three of the four Flyte children have tried to escape their religious backgrounds, and this part of the novel traces the extent to which they have or have not succeeded in finding peace in the secular world. \\"No one is ever holy without suffering,\\" he believes.Dealing with religious and secular love, Heaven and Hell, the concepts of sin and judgment, and the guilt and punishments one imposes on oneself, the novel also illustrates the changes in British society after World War II. The role of the aristocracy is less important, the middle class is rising, and in the aftermath of war, all are searching for values. A full novel with characters who actively search for philosophical or religious meaning while they also search for romantic love, Brideshead Revisited is complex and thoughtfully constructed, an intellectual novel filled with personal and family tragedies--and, some would say, their triumphs. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Anyone considering a purchase of this product should know that it is very heavily abridged. It's difficult to give a realistic assessment of how much has been lost, but to me it sounds as though about half of Waugh's writing has been cut out. Most of the dialogue is there, but the narratives have been omitted. Whole characters, such as Hooper and Charles Ryder's father, have been truncated, leaving the book really an empty shell.I was really disappointed by this product: Nowhere on the CD itself does it say \\"Abridged,\\" nor is it obvious in the product description.

Well-worth reading not once, but many times, to understand the depth of the story itself as well as appreciate Waugh's obvious mastery of language.Also highly recommended is Mortimer's adaptation of the book as a mini-series starring Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Anthony Andrews and Jeremy Irons. It is the definitive Brideshead on film, from the opening lines spoken by Jeremy Irons (as usual, his speaking voice is flawless) to the final scene of Charles in Brideshead chapel during WWII where Charles prays \\"an ancient prayer, newly learned.\\"(There are some reviewers who've given it a low rating based on their dislike of the underlying theme of the book. Evelyn Waugh was a convert to Catholicism and his novel revolves around the characters' wandering away but ultimately back again, to faith: for the Flyte family, it is a return to their heritage (two of the most moving scenes are Lord Marchmain's death-bed conversion and Julia's painful but utterly noble decision), and for Charles Ryder (not \\"Simon\\" as a one-star critic mistakenly called him! Have you read the book, sir?), it is a newly found conviction. Hence, Book III's title \\"A Twitch upon the Thread\\" (quoting Chesterton), the thread referring to the fine, but strong pull of the Catholic faith over these individuals. If this is the book's only 'flaw', as some assert it to be, perhaps this line from a Capra film will help: for those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not, no explanation is possible. Agnostic, atheist or believer, the workings of grace is a mysterious thing.)"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is the first Evelyn Waugh book I have read, on recommendation. 'Brideshead Revisited' is an extremely well-written book that thoroughly tells the story of Charles Ryder, an English officer who is forced to recall the happiest and saddest moments of his life. Through his memories, we learn of the wealthy and eccentric Marchmain family and the formative role they played in the narrator's life.Charles Ryder begins his memoirs when, as a soldier in WWII, he finds himself requisitioning the old manor home of the Marchmain family. He immediately recalls his first encounters with the family - the mysterious and ultra-stylish Sebastian, whom he encounters while at Oxford, a pretentious young man who carries around a stuffed bear and has a propensity to drink. Sebastian is hesitant to introduce Charles to his family, for fear they will charm him so much that he will lose him as a friend for himself. But Charles does meet, and is charmed by, the Marchmain family, ingratiating himself into every aspect of their life. He quickly becomes a mainstay with the family and is called upon in times of great stress - when Sebastian's propensity to drink gets him expelled and causes him to escape his demons by running away. Despite losing his friend, through the years, Charles remains connected with the Marchmains in varying degrees of intimacy.'Brideshead Revisited' is a stylish and well-written saga of one man's journey to discover himself; he seeks out what he desires in others, and at the end of his journey is brought to tears by his remembrances of everything he has lost. The novel is not only a family saga, but also raises deep questions of faith, especially pertaining to Catholicism. As an agnostic, Charles ridicules the Marchmain's devout adherence to a faith system he finds mystical; and in the end, he must lose the Marchmain family because he cannot reconcile himself to their system of beliefs. Charles would rather find his own system of beliefs, exactly what he's been searching for throughout the entire novel, seeking it through school, painting, and relationships, but to no avail."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is a spectacular, beautifully written novel.

She considered it the finest book ever written. While I might quarrel with that hyperbole, I do in fact list it in my own personal top ten. I, too, re-read it, in my case, every few years. And of course I was riveted to the brilliant BBC production starring Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder.Imagine my delight, then, when I found this unabridged reading by Irons himself! My delight was rewarded. Irons' perfect reading of this book opened up a whole new world for me. This time, I heard and felt the absolute poetry of Waugh's words--his ability to take his reader from sultry ... summertime to the slums of the Casbah to a storm at sea that is the perfect metaphor for the turmoil to come. Waugh never wasted a word. Never said more than he had to say. Never helped the reader by sugarcoating the story. And the result was breathtaking.Maybe because I was listening this time rather than reading, I paid much more attention this time to the book's main theme, religion versus humanity. Can one exist without the other? Does one destroy the other? How far can one stray when bound by the \\"invisible thread\\"? Waugh's very personal and moving tale of upper-class Catholics in a Protestant country is a brilliant affirmation of faith, and at the same time, a bitter acknowledgement of the price that faith can exact.I cannot say enough about this recording, which brings all the best of Waugh to the fore even more so than the written word."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is, of course a glorious book, however this Kindle version is full of typographical errors. It needs a serious editing!"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Brideshead Revisited is not for everyone. Evely Waugh focuses on what he thinks is important, and he doesn't particularly care if the reader doesn't agree with him. He is also utterly unapologetic about involving things like sin, morality, and God that are looked down upon by modern critics. That is what makes him great as an author.The true key to this novel is the quote from G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown mysteries that is mentioned. The one where Father Brown talks about bringing someone back by a twitch upon the thread. An invisible thread long enough to let someone go to the ends of the world, and still bring him back. That, of course, is what God does in this novel. As Evelyn Waugh said, this novel is about the operation of Divine Grace upon a disparate group of individuals. And so the alcoholic Sebastian, the self-indulgent Julia, and the agnostic Charles are all brought back to God in the end.It is the effects of time that make this novel so profoundly moving for me. Charles goes for so many years without even thinking of his time at Brideshead, and then one brief meeting with Julia brings it all back to him. And he realizes that nothing he has done in his life since then has been of any real value compared to it. That seems very like life to me, where things you barely noticed or didn't understand later become your most important memories.It is true that Waugh tends to be overly snobbish about the aristocracy in England. We really must wonder if their passing away was such a bad thing. But he still paints a profound picture of England before World War II, as well as giving us unforgettable characters. This is truly a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I first read this book over 30 years ago but wanted to return to it because of the quality of Evelyn Waugh's writing. There is enough detail to get a clear picture of each character, scene and location but it still moves along well and keeps ones interest page to page. I will always remember the prayer, \\"O God, if there is a God, forgive this man his sins, if there is such a thing as sin.\\"I have used that many times with friends and co-workers since it covers a wealth of beliefs or un-beliefs. I highly recommend this work."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"When Charles Ryder arrives at Brideshead after an absence of many years, he loses himself in reminiscences of the once grand home and residence of the intriguing Flyte family. Charles shares the story of his all-encompassing and complex relationship with the Flytes, which germinates with his college relationship with the eldest son, Sebastian, at Oxford. While sharing his opulent college days with Sebastian, the two become connoisseurs of fine food, good conversation, and especially in Sebastian's case, alcohol. Charles becomes unwittingly seduced by the luxurious lifestyle Sebastian leads, and although Sebastian tries to avoid the intrusion of his family into the friendship, Charles becomes enmeshed with them, growing increasingly entangled with their religious proclivities and emotional adversities. Eventually Charles moves past his friendship with Sebastian, who is on a course of self-destruction. Although he tries to leave Sebastian behind, his ties with the stifling family remain strong, and his ardor focuses on more accessible targets. As the glamor and artifice of the Flytes begins to fall away, Charles discovers his own moral awakenings, leaving him to reconcile the differences between himself and the Flytes as well as the similarities.This book is a stunning piece of literature. From the rich language to the captivating story it tells, it is easy to understand why this book remains a classic today. Though the story is arguably about one young man's immersion in a very unique family, there exists, parallel to the plot, the subject of divine grace and the examination of Catholicism as a moral compass which may shape even those who are not of the faith. The book also deals with the nostalgia for the British nobility, the disillusionment at the passage of youth, and speaks specifically about the many forms of love that assail us as human beings throughout life. The remarkable thing about all of this is that it is not done in a heavy-handed and cardboard way. It is not pounded into you with antiquated and stuffy language or sentimental observations that render the story artificially affected. Instead, there is a constant pushing and pulling of ideas, and a honest portrayal of relationships, religion, and youth that is not afraid to show the entire truth, warts and all. Aside from liking this book for the story that it told, I found it was engaging and entertaining in other aspects. The prose was lyrical while still being a little snarky and standoffish, giving it an offbeat charm and a knowing voice. When I had finished reading and closed the book, I found that there was so much more to think about and explore within the world presented to me. I looked back at scenes that were poignant, and was able to see that besides the obvious emotional impact there was a great deal more hiding within the narrative. Later, I found concepts that hadn't initially occurred to me, and I mused about the authors intentions with the direction of the story, and if indeed there was a subtle agenda. The book had a wonderful mood about it as well. The atmosphere was one of somberness, but it was not overwhelmingly dark and depressive. Things seemed to have the perfect gravity, neither too comedic nor too dismal. This is not to say that this was an entirely dark book; there were some perfectly comedic and witty moments, but overall the tone of this book was more serious, lending it the ability to become profound. This may give the perception that this is a deep book. Yes and no. I would say that on one hand it is a very deep book, but it depends entirely on how you read it. If you are reading it for the pleasure of an interesting story, that is what you will get. If on the other hand you are reading it for a deeper meaning, that is there as well. What I find interesting is that these elements exist completely in harmony with each other, while also remaining separate entities.I think the true measure of the success of this book is the fact that, although I have moved on to other books, I still find myself thinking about it. In quiet moments, I find myself plundering the depths of the story, eager to make more connections and relishing the moments and situations I found within the covers. The book had a powerful voice and message, and it was the ability of the author to show, not tell, his message that impressed and amazed me. The mechanics and eloquence of his ideas were equally impressive. Though the author's opinions may not be popular with every reader, and may even be contrary to those who are not particularly religious, the story and the execution are truly brilliant. This book was an exceptional and unexpected prize. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I loved the Masterpiece Theater production of Brideshead Revisited quite a few years ago.

Evelyn Waugh is a treasure; he has the wit of Oscar Wilde and the satiric sense of a Jonathan Swift or an Alexander Pope. Reading \\"Brideshead\\" on a warm summer afternoon on the patio is like going back to a younger and more innocent time, like Charles and Sebastian had.\\" I HAVE been here before,\\" I said; I had been there before; first with Sebastian more than twenty years ago on a cloudless day in June, when the ditches were white with fool's-parsly and meadowsweet and the air heavy with all the scents of summer; it was a day of peculiar splendour, such as our climate affords once or twice a year, when leaf and flower and bird and sun-lit stone and shadow seem all to proclaim the glory of God; and though I had been there so often, in so many moods, it was to that first visit that my heart returned on this, my latest.\\"Sebastian's family is utterly dysfunctional: an anachronism dating back to the landed gentry. His father, from whom he estranged but on whom he depends for money, is a bore. His brother is a poseur. The only normal member of the family is the young girl. Sebastian does what any rational young man might do under the circumstances: he drinks to excess.Charles and Sebastian spend the summer vacations together at Brideshead and on the Continent; reading, painting, exploring the countryside enjoying the languorous enchantment of youth.Much has been made of the novel's religious context: I prefer to think of it as spiritual...a journey from agnosticism to belief. It is also the story of a chaste and platonic love between two romantic young men. It is no more a gay novel than \\"Brokeback\\" was a gay movie: it's about love, in its various and inexplicable permutations... and loss of innocence.\\"Brideshead\\" is a joy to return to year after year.****"},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"There is little new to say of this book other than to mention what an excellent light it sheds on Waugh's other, very different books. Although dismissed by Waugh as the product of Spam and blackouts (wartime privations), Brideshead endures because of its superb structure, characterizations and ultimately heart.

Written during World War II and framed by the conversion of the Brideshead estate into an army camp during the war, the novel depicts the youth and early adulthood of one Charles Ryder. The 40-year-old army captain that the war makes of Ryder recalls the days of his optimistic youth as a close friend of teddy-bear toting Sebastian Flyte, younger son of the Brideshead household and classmate of his at Oxford. Sebastian awakens much in Charles, and it is arguable whether he doesn't awaken more than does his sister Julia, who later becomes Ryder's fiancee.For the 220 or so pages that constitute Part One this book comes off as a splendid (though not aggressively hostile) satire of upper class British society in the 1920s. Especially of the particular damage that the \\"long-suffering\\" Catholic mother can do to her loved ones (I kept thinking, \\"O, the martyrdom!\\" every time Lady Marchmain used one of her patented guilt trips to twist the psychological and spiritual arms of her children--Sebastian most often.) BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is also a powerful \\"lost illusions\\" type of novel, but the particular illusions lost don't seem any more attractive than the reality that replaces them. \\"Henceforth I live in a world of three dimensions--with the aid of my five senses,\\" says Charles, but that seems limiting, doesn't it? It does to Waugh but his answer isn't necessarily any more appealing. Part One is hilarious and promises much. Part Two, sorry to say, does not deliver on that promise. The satire stops and the soap opera begins. Sebastian disappears and Ryder becomes a much less sympathetic character--why he would fall in love with Julia in the first place is hard to fathom.A great problem with this novel is that it seems to place the Catholic religion in an unflattering light to the extent that the reader would think that Waugh himself was anti-Catholic. Think again. He was a convert well before he wrote this book and despite the fact that he DOES present Catholicism as being the last thing anyone would want to fall into, people fall. The fact that they fall into rather than embrace Catholicism sucks away whatever joy might have been left in the novel--I was reminded of the line from Kevin Smith's movie DOGMA, paraphrased here: \\"Catholics don't celebrate their faith, they mourn it.\\"So, in celebration I must say that to call Waugh a fine writer is to sell him far too short. He is a masterful stylist and a brilliant wit who can lift you up and get under your skin. Let him."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Evelyn Waugh's \\"Brideshead, revisited\\" is a masterpiece of twentieth century literature. Spanning a period of twenty years, Waugh paints a most extraordinary picture of idyllic life fraught with undertones of deep sadness. Charles Ryder serves as the incarnate narrator of Waugh's halcyon brush strokes as Ryder emerges as the most critcal character in the book.The women of \\"Brideshead\\" are either self-absorbed or flitty and the men are sillier yet. In fact, the second half of Waugh's work is more important than the first. In the latter half, Charles matures....the only person to do so. It is as if Charles is holding a movie camera throughout as the characters rotate in slow motion. They rarely move forward....just on to other locations. Waugh's greatest contribution is, however, his soft hintings of sexuality. These connections are largely left open to the reader's imagination and are gently manipulated by the feel of a warm breeze, the sight of a flower-filled field or the scent of spring.A question I often asked myself while reading \\"Brideshead\\" was \\"are these people really connecting in any way?\\" My answer was \\"yes\\", but at a distance more relevant to the times and to the country. Charles's denouement was a curtain being pulled down on a dysfunctional family that had little real understanding of how to hold themselves together, but did so, anyway.\\"Brideshead, revisited\\" can be read in a short time but, like an afternoon tea, should be consumed in small sips. The refreshment of Evelyn Waugh's descriptive prose evinces a master mind at work...the author turned painter.

I will admit my mediocre review has something to do with my ignorance of the subject and inability to follow at times. It seems that other reviewers are Waugh fans, which may have made this book more enjoyable. What I'm trying to say with this review is that if you are a Waugh fan, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this book as it sounds like it is a refreshing change of pace. If you are not a Waugh fan, make sure you have a resource (friend who has read it or Cliff's notes) that can help you along the way.It is the story of a young man who falls into a peculiar relationship with another man while at college. They have a strong, deep connection, and Charles (narrator) begins to feel part of Sebastian's family, which is exactly what Sebastian didn't want. Eventually, Sebastian disappears and Charles loses touch with the family. I found part two of the book more enjoyable as it talks about Charles' painting career and his relationship with Julia, Sebastian's sister.I felt that the writing was wonderful at times, but dragged on quite a bit and spoke around things so much it was difficult to understand what was going on. Which is why I'm guessing it may be helpful to have read other things by Waugh before. I didn't find the characters particularly engaging. Nor did I find the discussion of religion particularly enlightening or thoughtful.

Don't know how I made the mistake of picking the wrong item. Sorry for the inconvenience.Described as a poignant story of forbidden love and the loss of innocence set in England prior to the Second World War, Brideshead Revisited in the movie adaptation of the British television series that has had a strong following for years. I can see why so many were disappointed in the adaptation, because there is no way that all the nuances of an 11 episode series can be boiled down into two hours. With that being said, if you have never seen the series, I highly recommend the movie.From first blush, it is a beautiful story, beautiful locations, beautiful costumes and exceptional acting.Brideshead is not an easy story to tell. Told in a different light than the television version, the plotline tells of a triangular love story with a contemporary resonance. The 1920's and 30's were a different time, the Flyte family was all about class and tribalism and all decisions were made around their beliefs and way of behaving in a rich staunchly Catholic family. This family was raised to keep outsiders out and to keep their own secrets buried deep within one's self.Emma Thompson plays the family matriarch that only shows her children attention through her formal relationship with God. The only time that Julia and Sebastian spent time with her was either during church services, which were held in the family chapel or when they were discussing sins.There is no way that that the children can live up to either their mothers standard or Gods, which leads to both of them having to hide their true selves and show that how a family conditions its children, by indoctrinating their relationship with God in such an austere way, will only result in destruction of their internal soul.Brideshead is a character all its own. You cannot escape its draw. It is the one thing that Charles wanted, more than the people in it, but once there, he could not escape it. What is it about a place that will not let you leave?Told through the eyes Charles you see all the beauty and damage within people and places.A truly fascinating journey of tragic love, strong virtues and damaged people."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"The first two thirds of this novel are almost unmatched in Post-War British Literature: witty, insightful, acidly satirical, and, in their own way, powerful. The sense of character and place is especially vivid, and personal and social tensions are brilliantly entwined.The last third is marred by a love interest that is anemic and thoroughly unconvincing. Here the characters and imagery lapse into caricature. Julia's climactic sacrifice is ludicrous, as is a long (and infamous) stream of purple prose.Waugh sought to dramatize the tension between the Sacred and the Profane. But if the Sacred is upheld by a trinity of nostalgia, sentimentality, and reflexive Catholic guilt, lord help us all. Ryder's \\"epiphany\\" is as much a shallow pantomime as his faux-naturalist paintings.The scene in which the \\"hero\\" and his aristocratic friends brutalize striking workers for a lark, is one of the most repulsive in all literature."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Waugh is a great writer!

How about 'misfires'? That's probably more accurate.I am not nearly qualified to give Evelyn Waugh advice on how to write. But I will anyway: Please, Mr. Waugh, stick to cute satire, and leave the romance fiction to the less acute; make the books more mordant than maudlin; model \\"The Loved One\\", which was far better than this tale of loved ones.My main complaint is that Waugh here comes off as little more than a poor man's Oscar Wilde. You have a proliferation of aesthete's epigrams (\\"Oh, Charles, don't be such a tourist. What does it matter when it was built, if it's pretty?\\"), the crypto-homoeroticism (actually, it's not that well hidden at all), and various variations on Dorian Gray's syndrome. But where Wilde's writing revels in its formulas and in it's decadence, Waugh doesn't appear to be having very much fun.The first half begins well enough. Charles Ryder, a cipheric army captain, happens on Brideshead Castle after a lengthy absence. It, and its occupants, defined his youth, and the sight of it forces forward a flood of memories. The remainder of the novel takes place within these memories, Ryder mainly acting as observer of those around him. He is a fine narrator, allowing equal time to the objective and subjective aspects of his memory (i.e., the events as they happened vs. his reactions to said events).While at Oxford, his chief subject is Sebastian Flyte, a charming dipsomaniac. Sebastian is Charles' best and only friend, while being his 'in' to Brideshead. He's an addictively self-destructive character, still in love with his childhood (a teddy-bear named Aloysius goes with him everywhere; he adores his old nanny), which eventually leads to his own undoing. It's typical of the novel that when Sebastian's immature drunkenness rears its ugly head, one of his school chums casually remarks: \\"How boring!\\" Charles' days at Oxford are the novel's high points, as the charming and intriguing people he meets form a peculiar tapestry. It was a true pleasure to read the first hundred or so pages, as Waugh appears on top of his game.Unfortunately, Oxford days are abandoned in the novel's second half, and the narrative flounders under the weight of 'big ideas'. While the residents of Brideshead are no less fascinating than the Oxford boys (as Sebastian accurately says: \\"I'm not going to have you [Charles] get mixed up with my family. They're so madly charming.\\"), the harsh melodrama that ensues got on my nerves. And, ultimately, Waugh never gives his characters anything cohesive to do; episodes drag on much too long, wearing out their welcome long after any relevant point has been made. Take his treatment of Lady Marchmain, Brideshead's matriarch, and a devout Catholic. A side comment by (her daughter) Cordelia epitomizes her mother's character:\\"I sometimes think when people wanted to hate God they hated mummy... She was saintly but she wasn't a saint. No one could really hate a saint, could they? They can't really hate God either. When they want to hate Him and his saints they have to find something like themselves and pretend it's God and hate that.\\"Out of the mouths of babes, no? Cordelia (read: Waugh) crystallizes in that one speech all the problems that religion has brought to the novel's second half. It's typical of the kind of sharp writing Waugh excels at. But the effect is diluted when the argument is repeated, in various forms, ad nauseam. It got to be quite tedious.Charles, at one point, pledges to only live in a world of three-dimensions, that he can experience with his five senses. He soon he finds out that artifice rules the day, especially at Brideshead Castle, and such a world doesn't exist. I'd expected Waugh to pounce all over this idea with his sharp pen and sharper mind. But instead he revels in Charles' overwrought sincerity. Waugh's pointed wit usually punctures holes in stuffy characters such as these, but here he is content to just create them.While in arcadian Oxford, \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" shines, enough that I can offer a marginal recommendation. Once it leaves that idyllic setting, Waugh gets rusty."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I ran across this book by accident following Wikipedia links, since I've never seen the TV series. It's a lush delight, with a slice-of-frozen-time writing style reminiscent of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, except this book gives a 1923-1944 look into the life of a Catholic English aristocratic family to whom the protagonist attaches himself. Evelyn Waugh wrote the book during six months spent living on soybeans after a parachute accident, so said he had a \\"kind of gluttony..for the splendours of the recent past.\\"Since Waugh was a convert to Catholicism, he attempts to subtly proselytize his readers, which is slightly annoying since the characters end up renouncing their illicit romances to pursue lives of celibacy. Still, excellent look into a luxurious lifestyle only now afforded by the most ultra-rich."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Evelyn Waugh's complex 1944 novel \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" defies easy description. On one level, it is the recollections of middle-aged British Army Captain Charles Ryder, whose unit is to be garrisoned at the vacant English estate of Brideshead during the Second World War. This present tense Ryder frames the beginning and ending of the novel. The bulk of the story is inbetween, as a younger Ryder narrates his life before the war, in which he becomes involved with the wealthy Catholic family that owns Brideshead.At university, the young Ryder is befriended by his fascinating fellow student Sebastian, flamboyant, hard-drinking, and probably infatuated with Ryder in a way that Ryder does not quite recognize. They embark on a series of adventures that include an introduction to Sebastian's disfunctional family, the Marchmains. Ryder's relationship with Sebastian, and a later and very different relationship with Sebastian's sister Julia, make him both observer and participant in the family's trials.The plot is a slow-roller, and early on, the reader is apt to be carried along by Waugh's wonderfully delicious prose, alternately funny and sad, describing Britain between the two World Wars. Halfway through, the plot makes a dramatic jump in time and exposition, as Ryder suddenly is married, with children, and a successful but unhappy artist returning from a stint in South America. The novel's themes come together in painful juxposition. Britain is drawn into a second world war that will end the days of empire, while the Marchmain family's Catholic faith seems to both undercut their possibilities of happiness while sustaining them through tragedy. The major players, well-drawn by Waugh, are alike in their imperfect but very real humanity.\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is very highly recommended as a classic novel of an England now gone but once as vivid and fascinating as Evelyn Waugh's undoubted writing gifts can make it."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This is an interesting and at times an entertaining novel of 1900s England. It appears to be somewhat autobiographical. The plot line centers around an aristocratic Catholic family in England. The readers follow the interactions of the narrator with Sebastian Flyte, his sister Julia Flyte, and others. A significant sub-plot is the struggles of flawed humans in various stages of faith. It is a very subtle presentation of the Catholic faith and just belief in God in general. This may not be for everyone, but fans of modern English literature will most likely enjoy it."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"It's surprising to see a relatively serious novel like \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" from Evelyn Waugh, whose reputation as a writer was built on humor. It confronts a difficult theme -- the disintegration of a once-noble British family by two world wars and changes in the social and moral fabric of the first half of the twentieth century. But Waugh handles the material with the aplomb of a natural storyteller and the objectivity of an observer who is wise enough never to become too symphathetic with his characters.\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is narrated in flashback through the voice of a British Army captain named Charles Ryder, who one day in 1943 inadvertently finds himself near an estate called Brideshead which he recognizes as a place he'd first seen twenty years before. His memories take us directly back to 1923 when he was a freshman at Oxford and befriended a fellow student named Lord Sebastian Flyte. Sebastian is pampered, effeminate, and abnormally juvenile; he spends more time drinking than studying and owns a teddy bear. Now, I realize that it's not absurd for a grown man to own a teddy bear, but it is when he frequently refers to the bear by its christened name, treats it as a confidant, and brings it with him on outings. With Sebastian, Charles finds himself moving in a new social circle, illuminated by the even more flamboyantly effeminate and sexually ambiguous Anthony Blanche.Sebastian is secretive about his family but nevertheless takes Charles to visit the family house at Brideshead. Eventually Charles does get to meet Sebastian's sisters Julia and Cordelia, his older brother the Earl of Brideshead, and his (separated) parents, Lord and Lady Marchmain. It's apparent that Sebastian dislikes his family, especially his pious Catholic mother; his excessive drinking is a means to escape his unhappiness. Charles, meanwhile, sort of adopts this family as his own and becomes intimately involved in their affairs; his own father -- his only close living relative -- is somewhat of a doddering old fool and not much good company.Over the following years, the characters grow and develop as all good characters should. Julia marries a budding politician named Rex Mottram, who makes a comically clumsy attempt at conversion to Catholicism before the wedding; Charles becomes an artist and starts an affair with Julia during a stormy Atlantic crossing; the Earl collects matchboxes; Cordelia, the most conscientious of the Flytes, becomes a humanitarian aid worker. Sebastian, who is so central early in the novel, gradually falls out of the picture; years of idleness, apathy, irresponsibility, and debauchery lead him to a miserable existence in northern Africa.There is significance in Charles's chosen profession -- that of an artist who paints architectural portraits of ancient English manors -- because it parallels his role as historian and chronicler of the decadent Flyte family; he gives the impression of a curator proudly showing a portrait of a stately old house or family and saying, \\"This was once a great monument of England.\\" \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is not an outright funny novel like \\"Scoop\\" (although there is an amusing cross-reference to the Beast, the newspaper from \\"Scoop\\"), but it is still filled with Waugh's wry charm and his effortlessly mellifluous prose."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"Brideshead is a gloomy book but a must-read nonetheless. I am sometimes embarassed to say I liked it enough to read it twice and I'm sure that I'll read it again. I read mostly for the story- (not particularly postmodern of me) and for the pleasure of perceiving with some hard intimacy the lives and surroundings of a period and time that is no more and wouldn't have been mine anyway. The Catholic intensity would be meaningless to a younger lapsed soul, but even in my American youth, the religion as destiny- for better or worse- was certainly a part of my parents' top ten issues of life. As such, they were also for the younger me.Waugh's own yearnings for lineage and the rest of inheritance and 'class' are transformed into a good story with details of snobbery and those horridly cold (British upperclass) childhoods. Those children became adults only having born consequences of World War, modernism and legacies of excess- religious and alcoholic. All of those were certainly bedeviling Waugh as much as any of his creations. No doubt the novel was chosen by a smart BBC producer for the very same details that made the book work for me. If you are a reader of Waugh or Nancy Mitford or any of the first half of the 20th century 'greats,' I cannot imagine that you would forego Brideshead- if only because it is certainly more serious, and in that, more silly. Even his lesser literary efforts- and God knows he had plenty of those-reflected his superstardom, his trajectory as one of the most multifaceted authors."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I happen to love English literature (serious and not-so) from the early part of the twentieth century. This book is both wonderful and horrible--it won't be for everyone, but those in sympathy with the period will not feel they have wasted their time reading it.There is no question the first part of the book--the Oxford days--is its strongest, most cohesive part. The later sections lose that early, sharp focus.The prose is truly a thing of beauty--as smooth and silky as foie gras or Belgian chocolate. It makes one long for the days when it wasn't necessary to explain that true martinis are made with gin. But as I turned over the last pages, I realized I despised almost every character in the book--especially those with whom I am sure I was supposed to feel sympathy. I found the narrator to be little more than a crashing snob, although that isn't always a hindrance toward my love for a character. Indeed, the only character I really liked was Anthony Blanche--who was disliked by most of the others, but who was the most insightful and least delusional. Some of the even-more-minor characters are unobjectionable, but that, after all, is damning with faintpraise. In spite of that, I am glad I read it and shall probably re-read it every few years.A must-read for any true Anglophile, but not without its flaws."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"This partial account of the life of the central character, Charles Ryder utilizes the &quot;flashback&quot; technique to show contrast between the barbaric present (1943) and the rich, full life that he had from the period of 1923 to 1939. As he enters the university we initially see Charles as he was taught to be, in reality a somewhat small and boring figure, never having experienced the joys of boyhood, but is given a glimpse of happiness during his tenure at Oxford and beyond, where he is influenced by a fateful encounter with members of an Aristocratic family. Charles discovers his true vocation as an Artist and is accepted as a member of the &quot;smart set&quot; that is a part of the Marchmain family social scene. The tragic aspect centers on the dictum: &quot;life does not always turn out like you planned&quot;. At one point Charles seems on the verge of inheriting the entire Marchmain estate due to his intended marriage with Julia but everything falls apart due to religious convictions, and world events. In Waugh's intent, he wants to show how the structure of society was shaken by World War 1 and completely destroyed by World War 2. When Charles speaks of the era of &quot;Hooperism&quot; he is implying that now an uneducated, somewhat disrespectful class of people were now ruling society and would lead us to a new dark age. When we return to the present in 1943 Charles is forlorn and regretful of all that has transpired, but he comes to accept things as they are having by chance returned to Brideshead in the army encampment and through those memories of the past renews the vigor within himself."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"For some reason the reviews for the audiobook and the novel have been mixed. So, be aware that my review is for the audiobook as read by Jeremy Irons.I listened to this audiobook before I had even seen Jeremy Irons' wonderful performance in the miniseries, so it can't be said that I was influenced by that. I have never been a fan of his. He made his bones in the types of movies I'd never had a desire to see, and I was never too impressed with his performances when he deigned to appear in movies I would watch. I always found him to be a irritating, one-note actor, doing a bad impression of a stereotypically stiff British aristocrat. However, I could listen to his reading of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" over and over and over again.He has set the benchmark here. His skill in differentiating characters ranks with the best, his vocal delivery approaches musical mellifluence, and his dramatic interpretation is perfection itself. Part of it may have to do with the fact that the source material is as near perfect a book as has ever been written; part may have to do with his having gained an understanding of the novel when he played in the miniseries. But Jeremy Irons has a talent of his own that makes this audiobook a thing of beauty and brings the novel to life. If you loved Brideshead Revisited, I believe you'll cherish this audiobook as much as I do."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"The first time I read Brideshead I thought it was only an alcholism story. Waugh did an incredible job of describing what it's like to love someone who is hooked on booze. Charles Ryder is best friends with Lord Sebastion Flyte, a golden young man who has everything but deststroys himself via the bottle. The scenes where Sebastion is happy and the scenes where he's drunk are intense and very realistic. The whole family is touched by his alcoholism and the whole family is hurt by it. Later Charles has a fairly dull romance with Sebastion's sister Julia but it serves to keep him involved in this intresting family so it's tolerable.Later, when I grew up I realized that Brideshead is also about religion, duty, and England. Which ever angle you choose to \\"come at\\" Brideshead doesn't matter. Evelyn Waugh, for all his faults was a dazzling writer and this is an unforgettable tale."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I listened to the audio of this book after having seen the PBS mini-series years ago and I was amazed to find that the principal characters, by my standards, were dispicable. Charles Ryder, in particular, sent me off when he returned from the jungle and described his relationship with his wife and children (one of whom he had never met and whom he showed no interest in meeting). Through these eyes, I re-viewed Julia and her father and found them both contemptible. Although the era was full of elegance and physical beauty, it is not hard to understand its decline in the hands of such morally bankrupt characters."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"The first two-thirds of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is classic Evelyn Waugh, filled with wit and humor, fascinating characters and provocative scenes, and (above all) evocative description and meticulous prose. Waugh continues his tradition of skewering the pretensions and foibles of the aristocracy--although it's true the Oxford scenes are not as over-the-top as in \\"Decline and Fall\\" (Frank Kermode's introduction notes Waugh's acknowledgment of the 'mood of sentimental delusion' which pervades the work).I have the same reservations, however, about the third part of the book as did many of Waugh's contemporaries, including Edmund Wilson and Conor Cruise O'Brien. While the prose never falters and the \\"plot\\" is fascinating to the end, the satire is set aside for a moral, and your appreciation of the book may very well depend on whether you agree with its underlying religious message. To be sure, I really admire this book and continue to recommend it to everyone, but a second reading showcased what for me are shortcomings--flaws that make the work seem slightly less aesthetically pleasing than Waugh's earlier comic novels (particularly \\"Decline and Fall\\" and \\"Handful of Dust\\").Like, say, Flannery O'Connor or Graham Greene, who present their theology in the complexities of the characters' actions and motives, Waugh famously declared that he intended to show the \\"operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely connected characters.\\" Yet, where O'Connor and Greene use their stories to illustrate the subtleties of grace, Waugh seems to be making a case for it--but there are many passages that more convincingly show the operation of authorial, rather than divine, grace. And when he details conversations and debates on secular values and Catholic faith, Waugh can be a little heavy-handed--bordering on didactic. Throughout the dialogue the deck is loaded to demonstrate, for example, that Charles's milquetoast agnosticism pales in comparison to the richness of Catholicism.In fact, the problem with fiction as a vehicle for theological principles is that it can never truly show anything like \\"divine grace\\"; it's necessarily the author who determines what happens to the characters--and why it happens. While Lady Marchmain declares halfway through the book that \\"we must make a Catholic of Charles,\\" and while Julia's near-apostasy and Sebastian's alcoholism interfere with their spiritual salvation, it is ultimately Waugh--not God--who decides their various outcomes. (This dilemma is clearest during a deathbed conversion scene, which tell us everything about the author's hopes and \\"proves\\" nothing about faith. And this episode is based on a real-life occurrence in which, aside from the presence of God, Waugh himself played a coercive role.)This is not to say, however, that Waugh portrays his Catholic characters as saints or their actions as exemplary. Indeed, what saves the novel from becoming a catechism is that Charles, Julia, and Sebastian all are deeply flawed, at times disagreeable people. And, not ironically, the character who (in my mind) is the most lively and lifelike of the bunch is the irrepressible and unapologetic Anthony Blanche. In fact, one might even argue that Blanche's scene-stealing charm is \\"secular grace\\" working its inexorable way on Waugh himself.My comments here focus on only one theme--albeit a central one--in the novel. Most of the book, fortunately, is a comic excursion through a lost age and an elegiac ode to lost youth, as well as a thesis on divine grace. In the final analysis, it's impossible to ignore the beauty of the writing or underestimate the ability of this novel to make one ponder one's own secular or religious beliefs."},{"Title":"Brideshead revisited: The sacred and profane memories of Captain Charles Ryder (The Albatross modern continental library)","review":"I started this basically to escape into some nice, aristocratic british world of the early 20th C.

When I got it home, I found something completely different inside.This is a book about how to implement serious data handling with a serious object oriented programming language.The authors cover all the basic JavaScript language and browser connections in the first 75 pages. They leave out a lot of glitzy tricks that you really need, but you can get those off any web-based tutorial after you really understand the language.Once they leave the basics, they cover genuine oo programming in a serious and educational way. They explain what they are doing, and they explain *WHY* brilliantly. It is an excellently written book and a lot of fun to read.If you are hoping to create a snazzy web-site without much work, you will find this book frustrating. If you want to understand JavaScript to the bone, and learn how to extend it as far as the eye can see, you WILL be able to outdo all the snazzy web-sites when you are done.The book is incredible."},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"This book is a welcome addition for someone who wants to get the most out of JavaScript. It goes beyond cranking out cool applets, and goes into the fundamentals of object oriented programming using JS. If you know and use JavaScript, be prepared to re-learn and considerably extend what you know. Those coming from an O-O background such as C++ should should find a relatively simple transition -- getting used to the quirks of JavaScript and its relationship to HTML will be the main challenge. There is nothing silly about this book even though it is written with wit and style. Also, it's written by a couple of guys who really know what they're talking about and don't have anything to prove to anyone. [e.g., I'm smarter than you (the reader or some other author.)] Essentially, they lay on a major course in object oriented programming using JavaScript for Big Programs -- not little applets. So, if you just want to learn JavaScript for cranking in some cool applets into your HTML, pass on this book, or at least wait until you want to do something more, do it better, and do it with style. A couple of things bothered me about this book, and both could be improved -- but not necessarily by the authors. In part, I should have seen it coming since the book is suggested for a graduate course in computer programming. Being a 'learn-it-on-my-own' programmer, they skipped over a lot of the baby steps. Getting through Chapter 2 took weeks rather than hours. I believe they put too much into Chapter 2 -- Programming with Objects. That chapter needed a better transition for those coming from HTML and/or simple JavaScript. Breezing through a global function that replaced a literal, and then showing how to do it better using a method took me a long time to fully grasp.(And I'm still gasping and grasping.) For a book that is to be in the Trade Market and not the university bookstore (or technical bookstore) needs more examples. Chapter 9 takes the reader 'Beyond JavaScript' and that's all good, but rather than devoting about a third of the book to going beyond anything, I wish there had been more and clearer examples using object oriented programming and JavaScript. A variety of stand-alone examples rather than developing a giant program. A second issue that bothered me is the fact that this book is written for IE (Internet Explorer) only. This is not the authors' fault--it's Netscape's. Since I prefer Netscape Communicator over IE (and a Mac over a Windows PC), I was miffed that I had to use IE 4.5 and not IE 5. If Netscape and AOL adopt the Object Oriented model in their next (Number 5?) version of Navigator, I'll be delighted. Otherwise, I and others will be forced into using IE -- not a fate worse than death, but uncomfortable for those of us who like Net Nav. The appendices are thorough not only in their content but in their Object Oriented arrangement. This is a 5 star quality book with a 1 star ease-of-learning curve. I would recommend it serious only to those who are seriously contemplating spending some serious head time with it or for the pros who know Object Oriented programming and crank out code like candy. It is not a starting point for learning JavaScript. Before picking up this book, really learn JavaScript. Then when you get this book, you learn how little you really know and add humility to your array of sterling qualities. It did for me."},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"Your code can benefit from object-oriented programming even if your language doesn't support it directly. Javascript provides more support for O-O programming than (say) C, although much less than Java.JSO shows you how to write client-side applications in object-oriented Javascript. It leads you through useful examples using the technique, demonstrating that you can do many sophisticated and useful things with this 'scripting' language.For very experienced programmers, this will at times be a slow, but most developers will benefit from the close attention to the code.JSO doubles as a concise introduction and reference to Javascript, covering it better in 80 pages than those bricks in the bookstore do in 1200.The strength of this book is also its weakness. Since it focusses on client-side functionality, its example of client/server Web programming is unrealistically tilted towards providing all functionality on the client. But, given the current state of the art, I can't think of a better way of doing this without spending too much time on server-side issues. Along the same lines, the current incompatibilities among implementations force it to be browser-specific (Internet Explorer).Overall, this is probably the best book on client-side Javascript programming -- as long as you don't care about cross-browser compatibility."},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"Very good book. If your just looking for a JavaScript reference or a source for scripts, this is not the book. The authors take a serious approach to client-side applications using JavaScript and object-oriented code.Others have complained about the examples being too academic but I found them very appropriate for the kinds of things I'd do such as using regular expressions for form validation, binding of html elements to objects, etc., using tree and stack data structures for document parsing... Even if you already use these techniques I found it an effective way to teach the language."},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"This is an important book, that takes the object-oriented aspects of Javascript seriously and will take you there, if you are prepared to think long and hard.

Wow"},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"Indeed, the book does a great job of presenting and using the OO features of JavaScript. Where it fails, though, is in clarity. The authors cram too much info into some of the chapters. I've seen 1200-page books that don't contain this much info. The cost? Clarity! To read their source code you have to have a JS parser installed in your brain: they're fond of putting entire funtions on one line. Some of the code could be candidate for an Obfuscated JS contest. So get another book (like The JavaScript Bible) and learn JavaScript, then get this book and take your time with it. It teaches valuable stuff . . . if you have the will power."},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"This is a great book, and the only one that I've seen that takes the object-oriented aspects of Javascript seriously. As you read the book, you will not only learn Javascript, but many O-O concepts as well. In fact, you'll learn quite a few programming techniques. The reading is slow going (as the previous reviewer pointed out) not because the writing is poor (it's great) but because there is a lot of good material here. In my view there are three kinds of Javascript books: this one, Flanagan's, and all the others. Just buy this one and Flanagan's and you'll be all set!"},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"A book on Javascript objects would seem a challenge, especially when it presumes no prior Javascript knowledge. To do that while also providing meaningful info to interest those experienced in objects, but perhaps new to JS, would be a feat indeed. I feel the authors met both challenges.Where most Javascript books focus more on the use of JS to manipulate web documents, this book gives serious consideration to Javascript as a programming language--and it's strengths as an object-oriented one--first, and as a tool for extending HTML and web pages second. It's an interesting approach, and one that for the most part works.It's a dense book. While 60 pages of a Javascript Dummies book would go by in about an hour, expect to spend a few hours or more reaching the same point here.How much one learns will certainly depend on your background, but I can speak as someone with both mild JS and object knowledge that I learned an awful lot."},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"Not up to par with the normal writings of Wrox Press. This book talks a lot and gives ideas but fails to properly explain the code or the objects. Chapter 6 is an introduction and discussion on a database application but fails to be anything other than an expanded users guide for the app. More time could have been spent explaining how the object structure in the applications is being used. In my opinion the title miss leads you into something that the book really is not. It should be called \\"Ideas for what to do with JavaScript\\"."},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"The main point that the authors attempt to make is that JavaScript can be a powerful and flexible object-oriented programming language. This book is better suited for the classroom than for real-world web development. Out of its 450+ pages, a single 30-page chapter deals with JavaScript in the browser.Since I have several years of C/C++ experience, I bought this book primarily for the object reference table in the appendix. As I began writing real JavaScript applications, however, it became clear that this book was more of a hinderance than a help -- that even the object reference was a watered down version of the Netscape documentation. For instance, the book makes no distinction between read/write and read-only properties. The programmer is left guessing whether his program is failing or the property is not writable.I found that &quot;JavaScript - The Definitive Guide&quot; by O'Reilly &amp; Associates (ISBN 1-56592-392-8) covers browser objects much more thoroughy."},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"I have worked with javascript for some time and wanted to learn to create javascript objects and impliment them into my code.

Cool"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure","review":"I once reviewed Matthew Lewis' 1796 novel \\"The Monk\\" and said that it should be rated \\"R\\". Well, having just had the experience (and it is an experience) of reading John Cleland's 1748-9 novel, \\"Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,\\" everything else just seems like children's literature. Cleland's \\"Memoirs\\" was simultaneously reviled and a best seller, declared obscene and yet continued to be published illegally througout the 18th century. In the aftermath of the public frenzy for and against Samuel Richardson's ultra-famous novels \\"Pamela\\" and \\"Clarissa\\" and Henry Fielding's equally famous responses, \\"Shamela,\\" \\"Joseph Andrews,\\" and \\"Tom Jones,\\" Cleland's novel strikes out into wholly uncharted moral and aesthetic territory.Similarly to Defoe's \\"Moll Flanders,\\" Cleland's novel begins with its heroine, Fanny Hill, an innocent, uneducated country girl, thrown at a very early age into the cruel world of London and forced into a life of prostitution. As an innocent virgin, the madam whose house she live in is saving Fanny for a noble customer whom they expect daily, but learns about sexual commerce by watching other prostitutes in the house. Eloping with a beautiful, wealthy young man named Charles before she engages in any sexual activity, the novel concerns Fanny's sexual awakenings and her life with and without her first love, Charles. The way that the novel refigures fidelity in the relationship between Fanny and Charles is astounding.Cleland's master-stroke, if you will, linguistically, is to write a whole-heartedly pornographic novel and couch everything in such a rich variety of metaphors. Graphic scenarios can be found on almost every page, but there is a marked and remarkable absence of graphic language. Structurally, Cleland's plotting of Fanny Hill's escapades is exquisitely balanced and even-handed. Morally and aesthetically, \\"Memoirs\\" comes straight out of the strain of 18th century moral philosophy associated by turns, with Shaftesbury and David Hume. From Shaftesbury, Cleland takes the idea that aesthetics and morality should be judged on an equal form in works of art. From Hume, he takes the radical stance that vices and luxuries are not inherently evil, and even acceptable when not carried to extremes. Cleland makes judicious use of these structural and philosophical elements in creating one of the strongest and most liberated heroines in English literature.Among other points of interest in the novel, there is the prevalence and even propriety of expressions of feminine desire, agency, power, and control over self and circumstances. Aside from her first entrance into London and her various periods as a kept-mistress, Fanny Hill is educated by the prostitute Phoebe, and the procuress Mrs. Cole to be an independent, self-regulating subject. Related to this is the rather revolutionary notion inferred that sexual education predicates all other sources of knowledge, and is at heart, the basis and foundation of human interaction, at least in the semi-utopic world of the novel.There are so many fascinating things about Cleland's \\"Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,\\" it would take forever to puzzle through them all. All the same, I've only been able myself to think critically about the novel at some distance of remove from reading it. Reading this novel was an interesting, but frustrating, and at times impossible task. It's not a difficult novel to read in terms of prose, but for a 188 page novel, it tends to overwhelm everything else while you're reading it. Like I said, reading \\"Memoirs\\" is an experience - I often had to look at the cover to recall that this is no simple work of pornography, but an acknowledged work of classic literature. By all accounts, a captivating novel. It gets five stars just because it is so amazing and outlandish. Aside from the Marquis de Sade, who belongs properly to the excesses of the Romantic Era, I had no idea that there was anything even remotely like this in the 18th century. To quote that immortal philospher, Stephon Marbury, Cleland's novel is \\"all nude...but tastefully done.\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure","review":"This is a great book for close literary examination.

The theme is the changing culture of the West during the first 25 years or so of the 20th century. Cattlemen and cowboys struggle with new methods and technology. Environmentalism is threatened. Cow country gradually changes ownership, and the stage is set for clashes in vision. Out on the Y-Bench spread, the new owner is a dude who tries to impose European ideas of saddles, livestock husbandry, and range management. Grizzled Bearpaw and the boys take exception to these mandated changes. Humorous confrontations ensue. In another story, two old timers just can't stomach encroaching civilization and head west for California, until real estate developers scare them back to Wyoming. The presentation of the book is more than its content. The many charcoal and pen-and-ink drawings look as rustic and hardened as the weather beaten cowboys, wild horses, and longhorns they portray. The first person narratives of the Westerners are rich with vernacular and colloquialism. The stories are lightweight, but hearfelt. More as written portraits than tales of Western adventure. Will James' work as an illustrator compares favorably with Remington and Russell. The book celebrates his love of the land and the animals, a change of pace for modern readers. ;-)"},{"Title":"Cow Country","review":"I read this book to my daughter every night as I am trying to put her to sleep. These Will James books are really good. The stories in Cow Country are full of action and always seem to have a twist at at the end. Will James does a great job of painting the picture of the old west. He also tries to get you in the mind of his characters. These are great books that should never be passed up!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wisdom of the West, (Fawcett premier book)","review":"Wisdom of the WestI discovered this book by reading Jacques Lacan but I did'nt find this book in the store called \\"Wsmith\\" in Paris, because it was OP ; but I found it on Amazon and it's a pleasure to \\"waste time\\" with Russell, who wrote this philosophical book as rigourously as possible. This book is to find (it's diffucult for French people !) and to read with pleasure."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the West, (Fawcett premier book)","review":"Bertrand Russell (1872- 1970) was a great philosopher and communicator as well as having the common touch in joining protest movements. Although he is remembered for Principia, the most important treatise on logic in the 20th Century, he also wrote and lectured on politics, religion, philosophy and the pursuit of happiness. Wisdom of the West is a handsome 320 page book with plenty of photographs and illustrations that blend into the text. An outstanding feature are diagrams used to convey the essential ideas.This survey of Western philosophy starts from pre-Socratic to early Christianity, Jewish philosophy to Dante, Bacon to Kant, Hegel to Marx and Sartre to Jaspers and ending in Wittgenstein (1889-1951). There is a personal quality in the writing with the author giving his opinions. If you only want one book in your library on the big name philosophers this is the one."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the West, (Fawcett premier book)","review":"Wisdom of the West is Bertrand Russell's second attempt, after A History of Western Philosophy, to write a history of philosophy. It is a very different book from its predecessor, with different strengths and weaknesses. Like that earlier book, its scope is broader than philosophy in the narrow sense of the word, taking in social history, occasionally literature (Homer and Dante are briefly mentioned), and intellectual and scientific developments such as psychoanalysis. The social history is interesting in itself, but readers looking for a focus specifically on philosophy may find it wearying. Russell's discussion of philosophy is adequate or even good when he is talking about the ancient Greeks, but isn't to be fully trusted for later periods. He repeats some common myths or falsehoods about philosophers, for example, that Karl Marx called his philosophy \\"dialectical materialism\\" (the term was applied to Marx's thinking by others, and was never actually used by Marx himself).The chief advantage that Wisdom of the West has over A History of Western Philosophy is that it is shorter and less ambitious. A History of Western Philosophy is nearly 900 pages long; this book is only a little more than 300 pages long, and much of the space of those pages is taken up by pictures of philosophers and (often fascinating and attractive) diagrams meant to illustrate philosophical ideas. Despite the fact that Russell discusses subjects, such as existentialism, that he ignored entirely in his previous work, he tries to do much less here than he did in A History of Western Philosophy. This can only be a good thing, since the less one aims to achieve the less bad the results are if one fails. On those grounds, I consider Wisdom of the West the better of the two books, though I don't think it's better enough to deserve more stars."},{"Title":"Choose Grenada for Your Second Citizenship and Passport","review":"The passport program that this book is about has been suspended, so there isn't a whole lot of point to buying the book anymore.The Associated Press reported on October 12, 2001 that Grenada has suspended its program of allowingforeigners to buy passports, saying the practice was too risky after the terrorist attacks in the United States.\`\`Grenadian passports can end up in the wrong hands and be used for purposes other than for that which they were intended,'' Grenada Finance Minister Anthony Boatswain said.The program drew criticism even before the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon, with some saying the practice allowed criminals to effectively adopt new legal identities for a price.Grenada also recently was placed on an international blacklist of countries considered uncooperative in fighting money laundering.

I think that we did not want to know about the flaws underneath the facades we constructed, though many of us suspected them.This book takes a good, stark look at the arcana of dealing with Japanese businesses. It is a world where appearences are more important than realities, where superficial politeness hides brutal power relationships, and where the correctness of routine is more important than the reasons - strategic or otherwise - behind them. In practical terms, this reveals that what a lot of us thought about Japan in the 1980s was in fact meaningless ritual and blind procedure (following and copying), couched in nice terms (&quot;tatemae&quot;) that so many of us took at face value. The reality underneath, the uglier side of things, is almost invariably truer than the nicer versions. And now that Japan is seen as a beleagered backwater, we have no problem believing the worst.That makes this book VERY valuable. Unfortunately, it is written like an academic business book, which means its style is rather plain, rather than with the vividness of journalism. But that may be my own bias."},{"Title":"Inside the Kaisha: Demystifying Japanese Business Behavior","review":"My 10 years of experience with the Japanese (including 4 different Japanese companies) has provided me with endless cases of dumbfounded bewilderment at Japanese behavior.

Highly egalitarian from the outset, yet its language effectively enforce a caste system based on seniority and acquired social status.

First, though some historians believe that Tamsen Donner kept a journal of her own during her family's 1846-47 trek from Springfield, Illinois to Alder/Prosser Creek and Truckee (now called Donner) Lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains, no such journal has ever been found. The fictional journal that Galloway &quot;re-creates&quot; is quite rich and fascinating--until the families reached the spot in the Sierras where they were forced to winter-over without adequate food supplies. Instead of coming up with more convincing vignettes of his own, Galloway lifts entire scenes from the only known and published diary of a Donner-Camp survivor, that of Patrick Breen (for example, the Donner children toasting bits of the fire-rug and eating them). Second, I found the sexual scenes unnecessary, unsubstantiated, and improbable. There has been no suggestion that I have found in other Donner Party literature that Lewis Keseberg raped Tamsen Donner before he allegedly murdered her. Finally, Galloway's &quot;Tamsen&quot; contains the ONLY references to homosexual relations among teamsters during the great migration to the American West that I have found in Donner literature. Where did Galloway find his information or inspiration for this plot-twist? Criticism aside, &quot;Tamsen&quot; paints a glowing portrait of Tamsen Donner, an incredibly strong and brave woman dedicated to her husband and children. On the basis of Galloway's book, she should be beatified! &quot;Tamsen&quot; stays very true to the chronology of events and gives the reader a real sense of the desperation of the people trapped in the mountains and of the heroic efforts of the men who came to their rescue. The strongest point of David Galloway's novel is that he provides what I have found to be the most plausible explanation I've read yet of how Lewis Keseberg may have disposed of Tamsen Donner's body. Overall, &quot;Tamsen&quot; is an interesting and entertaining book, but it should be read by Donner Party aficianados who already have a basic understanding of the events that happened so that they can recognize the points at which Galloway's account varies from the actual events."},{"Title":"Boating Tips: Better Ways to Float Your Boat: Practical Ways to Improve, Operate and Maintain Your Cruising Boat","review":"If you've been messing around boats most of your life (as I have), or if you're new to boating, this book offers a source of practical, useful information.

Thus, I was excited to read Information Warfare: How to Survive Cyber Attacks, and see what it offered from the information security point of view.However, author Michael Erbschloe seems to imply that readers who will benefit most from his book have a whole country under their command - that is the extremely high level at which it's aimed. People running companies will also benefit from Erbschloe's guidelines. Filled with exciting statistics, such as how many \\"cyberwarriors\\" the US will have by the year 2005 (the answer: triple the current amount), the book provides a fine-grained description of the cyberwarfare of the near future. While its style is reminiscent of an official government document, the book raises issues that might become important in the future, since our reliance on computers is constantly increasing. The book also provides the \\"big picture\\" of information warfare, a taxonomy of infowar strategies and a potential threat landscape with damage evaluation.The most exciting chapter is a description of a fictitious \\"Trillion dollar cyberwar\\" waged by a band of 10 malicious hackers against the world. Combining email viruses, hacking and disclosure of sensitive information with physical attacks on phone company switches and computer installations, the group causes almost a month of trouble, triggering extensive panic, armed conflicts and other doomsday events. This Perl Harbor 2 (PH2) scenario is an example of \\"sustained terrorist information warfare,\\" according to Erbschloe.Information Warfare also sheds light on the motivations of those who become cyberwarriors - or cyberterrorists (the latter are described as \\"curious nerds moving to the dark side\\"). Erbschloe then ponders questions such as \\"Will Americans make good terrorists?\\"Every chapter is concluded by a high-level agenda for action, mostly targeted to government and big business. The book suggests that the best way to prevent future \\"ruinous\\" cyberattacks is to establish a \\"super cyber patrol\\" for the Internet. Another suggestion is that computer users maintain constant battle readiness, a scenario analogous to the Cold War, in order to thwart potential attacks.Overall, Information Warfare satisfied my curiosity on this exciting subject, providing enlightenment on what the future could bring to the field of information warfare."},{"Title":"Information Warfare: How to Survive Cyber Attacks","review":"This analysis of information warfare goes far beyond the writers in the 1990s and it is the first book that digs into the potential economic impact of cyber attacks.

His paintings have not varied in style but his palette his grown progressively more sophisticated.This major volume by Thames and Hudson explores the life of Scully from the 1950s in England to his various studios throughout the world. Not only is the book filled with very fine color reproductions of his work, but it also enters his studios, showing us the artist as personality.The text is by David Carrier and instead of the usual 'point and tell' manner of writing he uses the background of his experience as an art historian and critic to unveil the mysteries of Scully's paintings. This is not unlike the manner in which other writers have approached painters such as Mark Rothko, where the words enhance the appreciation of the wash of color that sweeps through this book. Highly recommended - the finest monograph on this uniquely successful painter. Grady Harp, December 06"},{"Title":"Sean Scully","review":"Beautiful illustrations but all of the text is in French.

The cover page claims that the book covers Java 1.1, but the examples here all use the 1.0 event model. The chapters &quot;Interfacing C/C++ and Java&quot; and &quot;JDBC&quot; contain very little content (but the LARGE fonts used help them to stretch for many pages).In general, the book tries to cover too much.

My hat's off to this author for writing a book that's a good read and good advice, too."},{"Title":"Small Business Solutions for E-Commerce","review":"Here, at last, is a concise introduction to the world of e-commerce for the semi-savvy professional. Terminology, strategic planning, branding, advertising, traffic generation, and, oh yes, technology... every topic budding e-ntrepreneurs need to consider before risking their futures is here presented with clarity and grace. One caveat: those looking for strictly the technical or strictly the business side of e-commerce will find this book lacking. To explain the whole, the author had little choice but to abbreviate some of the parts.Like most titles published by Microsoft Press, this book has a decidedly pro-Redmond feel, with frequent references to bCentral, FrontPage, and other MS products and services (most notably in the section on server platforms... the author would have you believe your only choices are 2000 or NT). However, these product placements do not diminish the flow of the chapters or the value of the advice.Alas, no one book can turn you into a dot-com success story overnight (unless Jeff Bezos' diary is for sale). But this one should certainly help."},{"Title":"Small Business Solutions for E-Commerce","review":"Here's another primer linking small business efforts to e-commerce basics; from building a site and understanding database and transaction processing systems to understanding how to best hire a Web developer. Tips range from marketing a site effectively to making it easy for customers to use, making for an excellent coverage."},{"Title":"Small Business Solutions for E-Commerce","review":"Great advice for anyone who wants to do business online. Well-written by a real expert.

It gives a basic review of math, grammar and language usage that is essential for doing well on the test. Also, there are 2 full practice exams as well as many practices tests throughout each section. After reviewing this book, you will understand the format of the test. You will know that you should ANSWER EACH QUESTION even if you guess. Just knowing this should help you because guess what--most students don't bother with even a basic review before the test. This test is graded on a percentile basis, so your score will depend on how well you do in relation to the other test takers. My son, an average student, studied this book, made a composite score of 89, and was accepted to his school. His two best friends, who are at his level in school, didn't study and weren't accepted. This book made all the difference."},{"Title":"Barron's How to Prepare for Catholic High School Entrance Examinations, Coop Hspt","review":"This book was a big help because it had alot of practice tests for me to do.

Beautiful pictures that looking stunning because of the large size of the book. A small section for used marks, but really worth while if you are interested in Dutch Delftware."},{"Title":"Delftware: Faience Production at Delft","review":"This Rather Large \\"Coffee Table Look\\" Book is actually has many attributes of a good textbook. It provides the reader with a rather detailed and concise history of the Delft potteries. It also contains vivid descriptions of key wares from certain periods and the popular decorative styles. It also has a very helpful area covering the much debated topic of \\"Boerendelftische\\" (peasant Delft). It has many clear and high quality photographs that really show the true colors of the pieces (unlike a great deal of the earlier books which had \\"technicolor\\" pictures). This is a invaluable aid to the serious Delft Collector, who wants to collect/learn more about Delft that just its productions of the 18th century."},{"Title":"The Third Grade Book: Inventive Exercises to Sharpen Skills and Raise Achievement (Basic, Not Boring)","review":"When I first saw this book, I was immediately drawn to it. After looking thorugh it, I realized that it was perfect for my third grade class. I have students that are on various levels and this book allows me to provide reinforcement activities (map skills, graphing, grammar) in many areas for those who need it. The book also contains worksheets that will help me with enrichment activities for some of my students as well. Many times in the mornings when my students are just arriving and getting themselves ready I like to give them a &quot;brain warm-up&quot;, these worksheets are great for things like that. I also found that the worksheets included in this book relate to many topics that we study in class, so I'll also use them when we get to those units. The students also enjoy working on them. I recommend this book for all who are looking for a variety of good supplemental worksheets to use in their classroom."},{"Title":"The Third Grade Book: Inventive Exercises to Sharpen Skills and Raise Achievement (Basic, Not Boring)","review":"FABULOUS VISUALLY AND INTEREST WISE!"},{"Title":"The Mainspring of Human Progress","review":"People take for granted where we are in the span of time, this books makes you understand how we got here and how we are so lucky to have it the way we do in America. One of the greatest economists in the U.S.(Peter Schiff) recommended this book on his website. That is how I learned out about this book. This book is great because it was written through 1960 or so which gives you the history of mankind through that point in time. I would also read Peter Schiff's book to see how we do have it pretty good in America but if we don't change things we could become a 3rd world country."},{"Title":"The Mainspring of Human Progress","review":"A classic in basic economics.

Part Two: The Old World Views, contrasts the fatalistic pagan outlook on life with the Judeo-Christian view of individual freedom and personal responsibility.Part Three: The Revolution, looks at mankind's three attempts to attain individual freedom: the ancient Israelites, the golden age of Islamic civilization, and the American Revolution. Part Four: The Fruits Of Freedom, investigates the results of freedom, including the flowering of inventive genius that followed. It also explores the concepts of hope versus fear, freedom of choice, the dynamic versus the static, the moral versus the material, voluntary co-operation and the lessons of history.The writing style is accessible and engaging and there are interesting quotes by people like Thomas Paine, Fredric Bastiat and Isabel Paterson. In an interesting way, the book illuminates many problems still plaguing the world today and traces them back to the ancient conflict between pagan fatalism and the principles of the Judeo-Christian tradition.Of course there are non-religious philosophies of freedom that are based on reason alone, and the aforementioned Paine was a theist who was opposed to dogmatic religion.

Mr. Weaver easily lays bare the fundementals of freedom. He planly exposes and explains the underlying princpals and common sense for the argument of individual freedom that we all know but can't always verbalize. There was not a single page of this book that I didn't understand and agree with. I wish I had read it years ago. I highly recommend this book to every American. It is my opinion that this book should be required reading for High School Seniors.To paraphrase a few of Mr. Weaver's words: Every man is a free agent accountable only to his creator. Anyone who believes that government has real power either selfishly wants that power for himself or wants someone else to enforce his will for the common good. People only want kings and rulers because they do not want to be responsible for their own well being. Any attempt to give government the responsibilites that properly belong to the individual retards the advancement of personal freedom and true progress.

This book is sarcastic, cynical, pragmatic and untamed -- you will need a supplement text to figure out some parts because Oualline can jumble concepts -- but he usually leaves you enough of a clue to clue in.

If you are looking for a book on how to do object oriented programming, this is not the book for you.

The problem is, that this is the same book with the syntax stuff changed for C++. The author does very little to talk about OO design or what C++ can do for you.

The author's concise explanations offer a great review for somewhat experienced programmers without sounding boring or redundant. For a beginning programmer it may seem too vague, but perhaps C++ isn't the best language to start with. The code examples are excellent and Oualline does a good job of explaining them. I also like his technique of intentionally putting errors in the examples and having the reader look for them. Also, the programming excersizes he has at the end of each chapter are similar to ones I did in my Intro to Programming class and probably fairly standard excersizes.The book loses steam towards the end.

For a long while, I had struggled with spare-time C++ learning from those 1000+ page monster &quot;Teach yourself in 21 days, dummy...&quot; tomes*, only to run out of patience a few chapters (= 100s pages) in. But living up to their reputation, O'Reilly have come thru with a not-for-dummies, concise, clear text. This book not only moved my C++ up the curve, it taught me a lot of things about where my VB was going wrong. The style chapters alone make for essential reading. I have recommended this to all my fellow corporate slave hackers, and although it may be a bit fast paced for an absolute beginner, I would think that most people would be able to follow and benefit from it given a bit of dedication.

It even covers enough to be used for the first part of a second semester course, with coverage of overloading of operators for classes, templates, and modular programming (projects, and makefiles).This book is short enough too that you can actually start learning quickly. Those &quot;Learn C++ in 21 Days&quot; books must expect people to be able to read those books all day long for 21 days, and maintain no employment, or else forget about any kind of social or family life afterwork.It is not a book for those that already know C++, as it says on the back cover.

OK C book. Terrible C++ book.The author's _Practical C Programming_ is OK. As some other reviewer said, it looks like he took the code examples from that book, changed &quot;printf&quot; to &quot;cout&quot;, added a few pages on classes, and sent off the manuscript.Many reviewers here have argued that this is supposed to be an introduction to C++, not an exhaustive tutorial, and so it's OK that the book doesn't cover many advanced topics. I strenuously disagree. As Allen Holub has pointed out, C++ is so full of traps and pitfalls that there's no point in using it unless you are going to make full use of its advanced features. The advanced features *are* the core of the language. So any introduction to C++ must get into inheritance, virtual functions, templates, operator overloading, and the STL as soon as possible.But not only does this book not deal with the features of the language that it should, but the material it *does* deal with is presented in an inexcusably poor way. It's clear that Oualline really doesn't know C++, or he would use inheritance correctly---hell, he would declare main() correctly!Summary: If you try to pick up C++ from this book, you'll do your understanding of the language permanent damage. Far and away the best beginner's book on C++ is Stephen Prata's _C++ Primer Plus_. (Not the similarly titled Stanley Lippman book, which I think is vastly overrated.)

The author does a great job of explaining the relevance of each of the topics. I also think it is good that he talked a lot about style. One of the difficult steps to a beginning programmer is making the jump from short learning exercises where you can get away with sloppy code, to programs that actually do something useful.Anyone who says this book focuses too much on style has never worked on an actual application, has never debugged parts of an actual program, or tried to modify somebody else's code. When it comes to programming languages, there's a difference between knowing how it works, and how to use it. Learning good style is the best way a book can demonstrate how to use the language.Not that this book is just about style, it's just that you could write a book purely about the language itself, and it would be less than 100 pages - the syntax is not the important part. If I need help with syntax, I'll highlight a statement and press F1! :)Also, a book about C++ should NOT be thousands of pages! This book is concise, but not skimpy. It does not include detailed information on some advanced features, however when you're ready for those features you should just read Stroustrup!BTW, I was already familiar with C when I read this book, and with the object oriented concept (through Java), so I can't judge whether it is appropriate for extreme beginners.

I have not read that book, but judging the quality of the code examples in this book, I imagine that he ripped out about 75% of the code examples from that book. So many of his code snippets start with &quot;void main()&quot; that it drove me crazy! He gets it right, sometimes, with &quot;int main (void)&quot;, but he is very inconsistent. The most egregious error, in my opinion, was an example he used to try to explain classes. He tries to use a &quot;class (name)&quot; example as a base class for tax forms!!! What is that? That is clearly not an &quot;is-a&quot; relationship, a term he conspicuously leaves out. The code throughout is not ANSI standard C++, and really needs to be cleaned up.

I think Cardenal has proved (much more ably than Pound) that history can be rendered in this sort of poetry. The eponymous myth of a strait that connects the great oceans, the pursut of which leads many Spaniards to their deaths is only one of poem's conceits. Each of the 25 cantos is self-contained, and each tells a fragment of the story of the rape of the native populations and the rape of the natural wealth of South America. Cardenal is judicious with metaphor, quotes deeply from texts, and editorializes in the best way possible: through careful selection of detail, like any good historian. This is a different read than most modern poetry, even Pound. I can't say it is my favorite sort of free verse, but the form suits Cardenal's aims.Speaking of form, John Lyons gets it spot on, even delivering some line breaks in better places than the original. I know this, because the original Spanish is printed on facing pages with the English. If you are studying Spanish, as I am, this is quite handy, especially since it presents older texts and spellings than are often readily available in direct translation (why I bought it in the first place). The introduction is plenty informative and the book also thoughtfully contains a glossary of places and people that might be unfamiliar to a North American reader such as myself. One need not know any specifically Nicaraguan history, although I do recommend you read a little about Cortez and the conquistadors if this is one of your knowledge gaps.History, poetry; Spanish, English: EL DERECHO DUDOSO/THE DOUBTFUL STRAIT strikes a perfect balance. I am now pursuing the COSMIC CANTICLE (CANTICO COSMICO) translated by Mr. Lyons, and definitely plan to read some of Cardenal's shorter poems, thanks to this.

This is the premature state of an entity; through this one can see the need and a role for a government structure. He begins by defining political power; which is the right of making laws with penalties varying with the nature of transgression. The laws are maintained for the preservation of property; the enrichment of the community and its defense.He determines the need for civil government by expressing the state of society without a government. To maintain harmony; there is a need to maintain equality; this is the state of nature. The chief end for the human species is survival; to attain it we need life, liberty, health and property. These are natural rights that we have in a state of nature before the introduction of civil government, and all people have these rights equally.The Natural State personifies a state of utopia; as it does not account for the realistic issues of violations of this natural state. There are no police, prosecutors or judges in the state of nature as these are all representatives of a government with full political power. In addition to our other rights, we have the rights to enforce the law and judge on our own behalf. We may intervene in cases where our own interests are not directly under threat to help enforce the law of nature. Still, the person who is most likely to enforce the law under these circumstances is the person who has been wronged. The basic principle of justice is that the punishment should be proportionate to the crime. When victims are judging a crime; they likely to judge it of greater severity than an impartial judge. As a result, there will be miscarriages of justice.Slavery: Is the state of being in the absolute or arbitrary power of another. On Locke's definition of slavery there is only one way to become a legitimate slave. In order to do so one must be an unjust aggressor defeated in war. The just victor then has the option to either kill the aggressor or enslave them. Locke tells us that the state of slavery is the continuation of the state of war between a lawful conqueror and a captive, in which the conqueror delays to take the life of the captive, and instead makes use of him; only in this condition is slavery legitimate. Illegitimate slavery is the state in which someone possesses absolute power over someone else without just cause. Locke holds that it is this illegitimate state of slavery which absolute monarchs wish to impose upon their subjects.Property: In evolution of the state of nature to civil government. It is the account of nature and origin of property, which leads to the explanation of why civil government replaces the state of nature. In discussing the origin of private property Locke begins by noting that God gave the earth to all men. Locke holds that we have a property in our own person. And the labor of our body and the work of our hands properly belong to us. The state of evolution for property is hunter/gatherer to agriculture to introduction of money; each development provides more flexibility and removes limitations of trade; creating economical inequality. The inequality may cause quarrels which increases the numbers of violations of the law.The institution of civil government comes about because of the difficulties in the state of nature. Rather clearly, on Locke's view, these difficulties increase with the increase in population, the decrease in available resources, and the advent of economic inequality which results from the introduction of money. These conditions lead to an increase in the number of violations of the natural law. Thus, the inconvenience of having to redress such grievances on one's own behalf become much more acute, since there are significantly more of them. These lead to the introduction of civil government.Social Contract Theory: Locke's argument for the right of the majority is the theoretical ground for the distinction between duty to society and duty to government. When the designated government dissolves, men remain obligated to society acting through majority rule. It is entirely possible for the majority to confer the rule of the community on a king, oligarchs or an assembly. Thus, the social contract is not linked to democracy; still a government must perform the legitimate function of government.Civil Government: The aim of such a legitimate civil government is to preserve, so far as possible, the rights to life, liberty, health and property of its citizens, and to prosecute and punish those of its citizens who violate the rights of others and to pursue the public good even where this may conflict with the rights of individuals. In doing this it provides something unavailable in the state of nature, an impartial judge to determine the severity of the crime, and to set a punishment proportionate to the crime."},{"Title":"Of Civil Government Second Treatise","review":"The importance of this book, first published in 1690, cannot be denied. The book's most famous and controversial idea is that the people have a right to overthrow their government if the government fails consistently in its responsibilities and duties.The book, which lacks an introduction or conclusion, may be challenging for modern readers. Locke's writing covers a wide range of topics; conquest, paternal power (i.e. the power that fathers have over their children), despotical power and his over-arching central concern, property.The main ideas of the book are that government exists by the consent of the governed who found government for the purpose of securing their lives, rights and property. Locke frequently contrasts people who live in a state of nature (i.e. no government; people enjoy considerable personal freedom) and those that live under government. Under Locke's view of the social contract, men give up give up the unlimited freedom they enjoyed in the state of nature so as to secure their life, limb and property more securely under government. There is also some discussion of the idea of separation of powers; what is interesting here is that Locke does not use the traditional formulation (i.e. executive, legislative, and judicial), rather he discusses executive, legislative and \\"federative\\" (by which he means the conduct of self-defense and foreign policy) powers.The type of government that Locke describes more closely resembles the system employed by Britain and Canada, more than the United States. He conceives of a monarch or prince at the top of the government (as in Britain and Canada; the Monarch is the Head of State), with the legislature representing the people (Parliament) and so on. This is not to deny that this book still holds value for Americans, as other reviewers have pointed out.All that said, I would not recommend this particular edition of the book. The lack of introduction to put Locke in his historical context can make the book difficult to understand and some of Locke's 17th century references will simply be skipped over by most readers. However, if you simply want a copy of the book that is plain and plan to quote from it, this edition is quite useful. Each paragraph of the book is numbered allowing a researcher to precisely footnote information."},{"Title":"Of Civil Government Second Treatise","review":"\\"The enjoyment of property that [man] has in this state [the state of nature] is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.\\"Locke is one of the most influential philosophers of all time. In his Second Treatise, Locke lays the foundation for what has become modern western civilization. Locke's arguments are fully developed as he addresses his two greatest adversaries, Sir Robert Filmer and Thomas Hobbes. Though his critique of Filmer's \`Patriarcha' is primarily addressed in the First Treatise and only summed up in the first chapter of the Second Treatise, his ideas of the \`tabula rasa,' refuting the divine right of Kings is the foundation of the essay.Locke also gives a profound critique of Hobbes, as he sets forth the true \`state of nature.' Locke's rational and logical conclusions make his ideas extremely easy to understand. This is a must read, since having a clear understanding of Locke's state of nature, state of war, property, power, political and civil societies, conquest, usurpation, and tyranny are fundamental to understanding the history and politics of America."},{"Title":"Of Civil Government Second Treatise","review":"There\`s at least one major omission in this edition, in the third chapter ('On The State Of War'), and there are probably others as well. With a work this important and succinct, the full text is indispensable."},{"Title":"Of Civil Government Second Treatise","review":"The Second Treatise on Civil Govenment by John Locke is the foundation of the philosophy with which Jefferson, Madison, Franklin and Hamilton read and determined to make a cornerstone of our government. This is a most influential essay in the history of political philosophy.John Locke was an early enlightened thinker and philosopher in England and sought to bring reason and intelligent discussion into civil society. His endeavor to reconstruct the nature and purpose of government, a social contract is proposed. Locke sets out with a purpose, a detailed discussion of how society came to be and the nature of its inception. Locke was associated with powerful scientific minds of the time, one in particular was Robert Boyle.Locke used Natural Law to define his thoughts. The sociopolitical climate of the seventeenth-century England, at that time was in violent civil war, counter-revolution, restoration, deposition of the monarchy and the subsequent Parliamentry rule with the eventual restoration of the monarchy.Locke matured as a social philosopher and wrote &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; (1690) of which the second is most widely read. Locke's dedication to individual liberty, government by consent, the social contract and the right to revolt against governments that endanger the rights of citizens, has made the legacy of Locke. Later read by the Founding Fathers of the United States, Locke's ideas made an important impression and the fight for freedom began.This is an important treatise and should be read by all as the foundation of a government by its citizens consent."},{"Title":"Of Civil Government Second Treatise","review":"This is a great book. Well written. Easy to understand.

I think they never read this book or were confusing him with someone else. This book is short and sweet, and at the same time a cornerstone for what the world has become in most developed countries. Many ideas in this book were revolutionary in his time (in fact Locke would not let it be known he was the author) but are now so commonplace as to be things observed in any developed country without explaining why. At least the economic ideas could be classified as such; but the ideas of the people overthrowing a tyrant due to horrible ruling is equally revolutionary in monarchies and dictatorships today, and even in poorly governed &quot;democracies&quot; today. A must read."},{"Title":"Of Civil Government Second Treatise","review":"This work by John Locke should be read in its entirety. Too often the condensed descriptions of this book make Mr. Locke to seem rather naive. First there is the natural state of humanity before the formation of civil government. Locke does not really try to propound this period or situation as a utopia. He admits that in the natural state there would be strife. Instead what Locke does is formulate how rational beings would exist in a state of nature without a governing authority. In essence Locke formulates commonly consented rules by humans living in proximity. Thus Locke prefigures Frederick Hayek's order without design (seeLaw, Legislation and Liberty, Volume 1: Rules and Order. Locke believed in a God of Reason and demonstrated how reason is the basic means humans can live together in absence of governing authority.Locke uses his basic rational order to demonstrate that humans created the governing authority to protect human life and property. It should be stressed that Locke considers the labor of a person to be his property. Thus slavery and forced labor become a type of robbery.Readers will note that Locke separates the community, which basically consists of people using their informal rules and manners, from the government. Locke demonstrates that government is not a be all but has only certain limited functions in the community.Locke then demonstrates that a ruler who governs for the benefit of himself or for the benefit of a small elite to the detriment of the rest of the citizens of the community is in effect making war on the community and its members. Such a ruler should be overthrown.Locke thus provides the rational for overthrowing absolute monarchs and other tyrants. Locke demonstrates that the totalitarian Nazi, Leninist, and Maoist tyrants have no right to govern since the basic principle is to confiscate the property and people of the community to serve the leadership.Locke, when read in its entirety, is a strong voice for liberty and justice."},{"Title":"Of Civil Government Second Treatise","review":"I love what he said about government, politics and toleration. It's kind of cool how he used the bible to push his point. This work is very influential and has been the modern foundation for many governments. Where would America be without John Locke?

Along with Newton and Boyle he made the modern world what it is today."},{"Title":"Of Civil Government Second Treatise","review":"I thought that this book did a good job of explaining the role of the society and of the government.

Robert Gordon, who comes from Memphis, an hour or two north of where Waters grew up, has written the first extended biography that captures the elusive character of this hugely influential man. Waters' life was changed when self-aggrandising musicologist Alan Lomax drove up the dirt road, parked outside the shack in the middle of cotton fields, and asked for a guitar player he'd heard about. (Lomax leaves his black assistant out of his biography; Gordon restores his place in history.) Waters - already nearly 30, but still ploughing fields - sang some tunes for Lomax, and hearing his voice on an acetate showed him the possibilities that lay beyond the wide, wide horizon of the Delta.Muddy Waters was illiterate, so Gordon - author of It Came From Memphis, a splendid social and musical history which manages to leave out Elvis - had to reconstruct his life story from interviews with his band members (many just before they died), the Chess family, and his children, legitimate and illegitimate. There are many of the latter; Muddy didn't go far without a \\"road wife\\": \\"[he] went through several wives, and always had women on the side, and women on the other side too.\\" Gordon doesn't shy from the irresponsible, self-absorbed side of Muddy, a man who'd cheat on his wife without conscience, but support a musician in trouble just as casually. This is often a dark story, full of guns, violence, hard liquor and loose living. Success brought fame but not wealth to Muddy, thanks to his umbilical, exploitative relationship with Chess Records, a continuation of the \\"furnish\\" support he got from his cotton farmer back in the Delta.This is the work of a Southern storyteller, it's like sitting back on the porch listening to tales tall and true. Gordon evocatively describes the various scenes of Muddy's life: the cotton economy, the early electric blues of Chicago, the endless road trips, the magic of the Chess studios, and the highs and lows of a career that generated more respect than cash. In Chicago, Muddy's \\"South Side house stayed rocking. Phones ringing, meats frying, and greens boiling, the TV broadcasting a baseball game, a shoot-'em-up. Muddy, in black T-shirt and black boxers. And always there was music.\\" In the basement, his ever-changing band practiced chords that never changed, but changed the world. Wasn't that a man. A full-grown man."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Mmephis writer Robert Gordon has written a gem of blues biography of the legendary Muddy Waters tracing his background in the delta through his emergence as the King of the Chicago blues scene in the fifties to the up and down fortunes of his career as musical tastes shifted and as his music reached new audiences until his death almost two decades ago. Gordon intergates materials from the interviews that Muddy did for various specialist publications (like DownBeat, Living Blues) with his own interviews and other material from Muddy's relatives, bandmembers, managers and others for a book that is one of the better recent musical biographies I have read.Muddy and his music is brought to life. Unlike the other Muddy biography, Gordon provides some blood and flesh to Muddy as opposed to rendering him simply as some legendary icon and also brings the music to life along with some thoughtful commentary on the music.Anyone seriously into blues will need to have this.

Muddy Waters (then Muddy Water) was discovered.After establishing a name for himself in the South by way of house parties and juke joints, Muddy headed north to Chicago. Once there, Muddy worked many short-lived jobs by day and hit the clubs at night. He eventually hooked up with Leonard Chess, owner of the prominent blues label Chess Records. At the Chess studios Muddy brought his electric blues to the world with records like Hoochie Coochie Man, Rollin' and Tumblin' and I Just Wanna Make Love to You. His music was reminiscent of the country blues with his bottleneck slide while he wove an urbanely electrified flair. The Delta was always in Muddy, and he never forgot where he came from.Robert Gordon, acclaimed blues musicologist, brings all the pieces of research about Muddy together in a fascinating chronology. The book leans more toward textbook style than to narrative due to the multitude of sources Gordon used, but his asides add an insight that few textbooks are able to render. His most prominent sources come from the oral histories of Muddy's friends, family, and associates. I recommend this book to all lovers of things Muddy and all music lovers. Every guitarist or blues connoisseur should have this book in his or her collection.Reviewed by Candace K"},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Robert Gordon has the subject of a lifetime in telling the tale of an illiterate sharecropper born McKinley Morganfield. Morganfield's story starts with him working sun to sun in the Mississippi cotton fields and playing fish fries with an acoustic box. It eventually ends with Muddy Waters fully electrified on international stages and at the White House (where, according to Calvin Jones, they didn't get paid a dime and were feted with hot dogs). In between are tales of car wrecks, knife fights, dumbheaded attempts at \\"updating\\" his rural sound, royalty ripoffs, hired musicians, fired musicians, and rehired musicians.Waters is definitely a problematic individual - fiercely protective of those who cut the trail in front of him (ie Son House), loyal to the paternalistic systems of Stovall and Chess, yet also rampantly adulterous and unable to protect some of his children from the ravages of heroin and street life.In the best of the oral blues tradition, Gordon has used the words of those who lived and played with Waters, including Marshall Chess, James Cotton, Willie Smith, and Jimmy Rogers, to flesh out the portrait. Their stories are the best part of the book. Everyone in the band drank heavily, everyone carried knives and guns, everybody had a pretty girl waiting on them in the next town. The reminiscences of harpist Paul Oscher are particularly amusing, while the perspective of Muddy's granddaughter Cookie reveals there were definitely two men wearing the same shoes - the decent provider and family man Morganfield and the stage persona and adulterer Muddy Waters.In the end, Gordon succeeds, although the topic is so rich it's almost like shooting fish in a barrel..., \\"Can't be Satisfied\\" does a fine job of recreating the life and times of Muddy Waters."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"From the first line to the last, Robert Gordon transports you back in time....to the birth of a legend, a culture and a way of life.This book is absolute excellence. I very highly recommend it to the deep blues fan as well as the novice."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Gordon did his homework in writing this book, and I was glad to see that he tried to grasp Muddy as a man, not just as a music icon or a stereotypical rags-to-riches story. I feel as though I was given a full look at Muddy Waters, warts and all.The one problem I have with the book is the writing style. The endless grand similes were brutal; I found myself wincing at some of them. I suppose the self-indulgent, flowery style fits the idea of writing about an artistic subject, but the similes seemed like a crutch. \\"Show, don't tell\\" is one of a writer's best adages. Grand similes, to me, scream \\"shortcut.\\" Like a rusty dagger thrust between two ribs, then twisted so that the oxidized edge of the blade could be felt grabbing flesh and grinding against moist bone, it bugged me.That one criticism aside, I, as an amateur historian, author, and blues musician, applaud Mr. Gordon's efforts and highly recommend that you read this book to understand one of the key people in American music."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"A very nice book, written with obvious care. Nice and informative, great pictures and a great and extensive note section in the back (don't skip over that). A great story of a man that introduced so many and so much into his music. Read it and listen."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"&quot;Can't Be Satisfied&quot; is a great book about one of the greatest blues men who ever lived. Author Robert Gordon lays out in brilliant and well-researched detail the life and times of Muddy Waters, from his early days on the Stovall, MS plantation and his first &quot;recording session&quot; for Alan Lomax and the Library of Congress, to his rise as the progenator of Chicago blues, to his final days and passing in 1983 and how his life shaped those of virtually everyone close to him. Gordon, in rare interviews with Waters' family members, friends and close associates, also lets the reader into the life of a blues man of Waters' stature at that time: constant touring, heavy drinking and smoking, womanizing, the out-of-wedlock children that he fathered, and how it all affected him personally, professionally and financially. In short, this book honestly tells the story of Muddy Waters the Chicago Blues icon, the player, the man, the human being.This is a must-read for any blues fan."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"This book is a must for any blues fan. It tells the story of one of the great masters of the blues Muddy Waters and how he and other Chicago blues greats like Howling Wolf and Little Walter changed the direction of contempory music forever. It is well told and not only outlines his brilliant musical career but also also his relationships with the Chess brother, his women and some of his children. A great book."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Combining life history with a social history of Chicago's blues scene of the late 1940s through early 80s, Gordon's book is a highly readable and carefully documented biography. He uses a great variety of published and unpublished sources as well as his own interviews with Muddy's family members, friends, and fellow musicians to provide an excellent understanding of Muddy Waters' contributions to Chicago's blues scene. Because this is a biography, the focus is necessarily on Waters' influences on other musicians. These contributions are important as the guitarist, singer, and songwriter had a huge impact on the music. Gordon demonstrates how some of the major influence that Muddy Waters had on the blues was through an indirect route -- via England. He vividly demonstrates how the music of Muddy Waters was a major inspiration for the British Blues-Rock music of the 1960s, showing, in turn, how this affected Muddy Waters' own career. This is an important part of the story, and its emphasis is very relevant to Muddy Waters' life history. However, I would have liked a bit more discussion of Muddy Waters' relationship to other blues players throughout his career. This information can be gleaned out of a reading of other blues musicians' biographies, so it's not necessarily a major problem with this fine book. In fact, the way this book sparks the reader's curiousity about other Chicago players may be another strength to this well-told story."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"If you are into the blues, its history and development, you will really find many parts of this biography interesting. The author has done an impressive amount of research for the book; hence, it is long on documentation, with many added notes which reinforce further the facts on Muddy Waters. Mr. Gordon --several places in the book-- did an outstanding job of \\"setting the social scene\\" during which events were happening. He was so good at it, I wanted far more, and less information on the details behind recording sessions and road trips, etc., which for me got exceedingly tedious; there was tons of it. Muddy Waters was an African-American musician who, in my opinion, was a product of his time and place. This biography is the story of the blues coming into Chicago, and then, what happened in Chicago. About the man himself outside of his music, he was terribly flawed. A man, a black man, who is even vaguely respectful of women, does not operate like Muddy Waters did. What forces drove him to such extremes of sexual adventurism? He hurt many, many people, and it is scary to think how many children he fathered who remain unknown. I don't believe a biographer should go overboard in psychoanalyzing their subjects, but some effort should be made when their behavior is so outside the pale as Waters was."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"How can one document the life of someone who spent the first 30+ years of his life as a poor, peasant cotton farmer? It's not easy to get a good biography on such an individual, but blues fans and historians have for years been tracking down information on the life of Muddy Waters for decades, and in this book that information is compiled in a well written, informative biography.This book explores Muddy's life on the plantation, his early interest in music, his love life, his family life, his desire to become a famous blues musician, his travels, his successes and his failures.The author is blunt. Obviously an admirer of Muddy Waters, the author does not hide the more shameful behavior of the great musician. Coming out of this book, I admire Muddy Waters as a musician and band leader. As a friend, a father, a husband, a person he is a disappointment."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"This book is a fantastic look at the life and times of McKinley Morganfield, aka Muddy Waters. Gordon has apparently left no stones unturned in his search to find the true history and life of one of the forefathers of American blues.Morganfield's early life in the segregated south is well-chronicled, along with his rise as a local musician and his contacts with other legends.The examination of his work in putting Chicago blues on the map is exceptional, including the focus on several of the formative albums.Waters' personal life was a blues song; many wives, many mistresses, many kids, and yet Gordon makes no apology for nor makes any judgements of the man. That's up for you to decide.In any case, the book was riveting, and the thoughts and recollections of so many former bandmates and other giants in the blues world make this book a real gem."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Muddy Waters' tale makes for a bittersweet read as many biographies of our musical heroes can be. Robert Gordon reveals Muddy as a man in all his glory and foibles, strengths and weaknesses. Mostly, it firmly places Muddy in the pantheon of the great blues artists of all time."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Mr. Gordon's bio of Chicago Blues icon Muddy Waters (given name McKinley Morganfield) is a good narrative of a fascinating life that, unfortunately, falls short of the work the man deserved. Gordon fails to explore, and barely mentions, the impact of Waters' commercial success on the racial climate of the 60s & 70s.The index is very weak, omitting several topics that appear in the text.Gordon's work is entertaining, but serves mainly to demonstrate that a solid, scholarly biography of the great bluesman still remains to be written."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"An admiring though shallow and poorly written account of a unique American genius. Though salted with several good anecdotes, Gordon's book mostly relies on the research and interviews of others and ultimately does little to explain McKinley Morganfield's life and times. For a writer who presumes to account for the life of a musician, Gordon's descriptions of various Waters recordings are especially poor. Far far better is his video documentary of the same name. One suspects the book is the assembled notes of that project."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"The Mississippi River Delta and it's diasporallinks, form Muscle Shoals to the music of my mind, hasargurbly been considered the starting point for theBlues. As such, black American music from Jazz,Rhythm &amp; Blues, or Popular renderings, and from thesubtle undercurrents of Rock, all owe quite a bit tothe esthetics and influence of Muddy Waters. Nowcomes veteran Musicologist Robert Gordon to giveinsight and add flavor to the argument that's beingdebated from Stovall, Mississippi (Waters'birthplace), to the south side of Chicago (where mostof his greatest claim to fame is documented),concerning who is really the progenitor of thislifestyle. Mr. Roberts makes good on his claim byproducing a well documented case by not onlyshowcasing this former sharecropper and legendarybluesman, but giving equal billing to the many sidemenand adjunct circumstances that feed into the legend.Fans inquisitive about historical content concerninghow the blues originated, and the progressive life ofMuddy Waters won't be disappointed. Will others havethe patience and perseverance to whether the 379 pagesin this biographical masterpiece?I've even asked questions about comparisons toother music mediums myself. How can such music rootedin impoverished environments, once denigrated anddismissed by white society become big business ripefor exploitation? Musicians, painters, and artistsfrom all walks of life cite how the blues haveinfluenced them...and without reproach, giving MuddyWaters credit. To get the gist and understand whythis music was, and is so important to many, Iensconsed myself in a listening room with severalvintage and quasi-current Muddy Water's compilations.I wanted to experience and somehow relive the harrow,harangue, and humbleness of hurt as it's delivered bythis man and his engaging entourage. This book, alongwith the aforementioned eased any doubts I may havehad, but more importantly, it justified the author'slaborious narrative juxtaposed with extensivefootnotes offering a plethora of interesting facts andfascinating stories about the augmented blues scene.Nonetheless, the portrait of this man is framedindelibly as an icon, capturing the haunting hubris ofthe music and revealing a culture and subculture thatnot only capitulated Muddy to stardom...but gavecredence to why the blues is so rich and colorful.For no other reason than to give credit where it'sdue, reading this book will do nothing to dispellnotions that within the African American music lore,we do have someone who have said that &quot;there's a lotof feel good about felling bad&quot;. The waters are NOTmuddled when words are spoken so eloquently by the manthat started it all!

Written very well, really felt like i got to know muddy waters. Quality built hardback with beautiful dust jacket."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"This book is well written and an interesting read, even though I struggled getting through the details of the early years.It was interesting to read about all of the great bluesmen that were influenced by Muddy Waters and actually played in his band, such as Jimmy Rogers, Little Walter, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, James Cotton, Junior Wells, and many others. It was heartbreaking to read how many of these pioneers of the blues actually died pretty young and penniless, screwed over by the record companies. It is especially heartbreaking when you consider the millions of dollars the rich and spoiled rock stars of the 70s and beyond have made from the songs and blood, sweat, and tears of these early bluesmen.I have not read other books about Muddy Waters so I cannot compare this book to any others. I can tell you that I found it well organized and interesting most of the time. The book cleared up some of my misperceptions and knowledge gaps about Muddy Waters.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"I have just finished reading Robert Gordon's well researched book on Muddy Waters. It is both very well written with almost poetic insights to his subject and importantly is very thoroughly researched - the Notes chapter at the back is as good a read as the book itself and every quote in the book's text is referenced and for some expanded apon. The book provides the evidence to justify why Clapton, Richards etc rank Muddy as their #1 influence, and puts the story in words that are a joy to read. A brilliant book that details the life of the linch-pin who connects the blues past to today's, and probably tomorrow's music."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"The book gives some insight into Muddy's personality as well as ample facts about his career. Appended materials include reviews of every release plus extensive notes from interviews. As a long time fan of Muddy Waters, I never knew he was illiterate and largely unaware of his impact on the music world. Apparently he regarded performing his music as strictly business, and he often allowed himself to be manipulated by others. Still, he created Chicago blues and left behind some great music. Racism probably kept him from being a super star in his own time, but he introduced lots of us white kids to a new type of music with much more appeal than the usual top twenty."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"I don't think I liked this book as well as I did \\"Moanin at Midnight\\" the Howlin Wolf story but it's still a very good book and a nice companion piece to Wolf's book. You really can't talk about Wolf or the other great blues musicians without mentioning the great Muddy Waters. Get this book you'll like it."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Robert Gordon had done a good job in reconstructing the life of McKinley Morganfield (BKA Muddy Waters). This is not an esay task, as Muddy had no education and could not write his memoirs. Thus we have remaining a few videos, plenty of recordings, and a handful of interviews. But there are a lot of surviving friends and family members, so Gordon has made good use of them in telling the tale of Mr. Morganfield."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Robert Gordon's account of Muddy's life encompasses the entire spectrum of a great bluesman's struggles and successes from birth to his death in 1983. The additional notes at the back of the book are great reading and I enjoyed the time I spent learning of Muddy Waters' life.However....there are two major mistakes in the picture subtitles. One identifies Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones as Mick Taylor. Mick had quit the band years before the 1978 photo was taken. Another photo showing Muddy and Son Sims in 1943 identifies the guitar that Muddy is holding as a National steel guitar, when it is obviously a wood bodied resonator, not a steel bodied guitar. If Mr. Gordon is this free and loose with his checking of the facts on the pictures, it leaves me in doubt as to the quality of his research on all the other data in the book."},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"This book only added to my love for Muddy. It helped me understand many of his lyrics and vices.After reading this book you'll be compelled to listen to one of his albums.Buy it!"},{"Title":"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters","review":"Wow, what a ride! How do you review a book dedicated to a legend without being biased towards the legend? Seems like a hard task to try to be impartial to the literary word.I was not even three years old when Muddy Waters was pronounced dead, and until recently wasn't even aware of his gigantic contribution to the Blues, Rock and Roll, and the music world overall. Robert Gordon has done an astonishing work bringing Muddy Waters back to life and contributing to his immortality.\\"Can't Be Satisfied, The Life and Times of Muddy Waters\\", is not a simple biography. This book is a close-to-the-heart companion of understanding the true identity of the Blues. Chapter after chapter we follow Muddy Waters from his bootlegging, and cotton-picking days in the Mississippi Delta, to his grandiose sessions in London's prestigious concert halls. Parallel to Muddy's development Gordon tracks the revolution that changed the American musical scene for good.Most of Muddy's character and struggle shines through his music. His music is his autobiography. Yet, Muddy was a man of a few words. So, for all of us who \\"can't be satisfied\\", this book is a must.I can only imagine the incredible amount of research and hard work that has gone into piecing together a detailed narrative of Muddy's remarkable life. Through hundreds of interviews and accounts this book will take anyone on an incredible romantic ride, hell, let's call it \\"The American Dream\\" ride. This \\"rags to riches\\" classic story starts in the dirty and filthy delta, and works itself up the Mississippi river. Muddy fights his way north with his guitar slide and amazingly deep voice. From Clarksdale, Mississippi, to Beale Street, Memphis, from Memphis to St. Louis, from St. Louis to Chicago's Southside Maxwell Street. From Chicago Muddy set out to take over the world and become a household name from Seattle, Washington to Denmark.If you are reading this review you probably know all these facts. However, if you want to know the whole story from the mouths of the people who grew up or grew old with Muddy you must read this book. This is the story told from the people who played with Muddy in dingy fish-fry joints, rode together cross-country in their pimped out Cadillacs, drank more booze than fraternity sophomores, and made love to more women that you have ever seen on MTV and BET videos combined.If you read carefully enough, you will be able to hear the music come through from the story. Muddy's dominating guitar slide, Little Walter's harmonica vibrations, and Otis Span's soul-penetrating piano blues, are the soundtrack for the ages. This is the story about \\"feeling good about feeling bad\\"."},{"Title":"Metaphors of Identity: A Culture-Communication Dialogue (S U N Y Series in Human Communication Processes) (Suny Series in the Sociology of Work)","review":"METAPHORS OF IDENTITY crosses and combines disciplines to examine the nature of identity in human society.

So I was introduced to this remarkable book called The Tao of Pooh. Now 4 years later I still reread this book completely at least twice a year. The author makes Taoism so completely understandable that I have gone on to read many of the other Taoist classics. While I agree that some of his criticisms may be a bit harsh,(especally in The Te of Piglet)his objections to those issues are certainly kinder and gentler than the Puritains, who burned women at the stake for nothing more than political gain. This is not the authors point however. The author is trying to explain the basic roots of The Way and I for one think he succeded. It is well written, intelegent, and thought provoking. One could not ask for a better primer for Taoist thought."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Benjamin Hoff made many of the concepts of Taoism simple for me as an American. On page 4, the author explains the concept of _Tao_ and writes, \\"...the harmony that naturally existed between heaven and earth could be found by anyone at any time...earth was in essence a reflection of heaven, run by the same laws-not by the laws of men. These laws affected not only the spinning of distant planets, but also the activities of birds in the forest and fish in the sea. According to Lao-tse, the more man interfered with the natural balance produced and governed by universal laws, the further away the harmony retreated into the distance. The more forcing, the more trouble.\\" Even from my own Judeo-Christian tradition, it certainly makes sense to me to not fight against these universal laws (although I would disagree with a Taoist what these laws are and how these laws are learned). He then went on to explain that according to Taoism, these laws must be experienced rather than taught academically.Using Winnie the Pooh (_P'u_?) as an example, the author goes on to explain the concept of _P'u_: \\"natural, simple, plain, honest.\\" Throughout the dialog of this book, Pooh is used as a positive example of Taoist virtues and other characters (Tigger, the Owl, Rabbit, etc.) reflect the failures of other philosophies. Benjamin Hoff describes a character named \\"Bisy Backson\\" that hurries around fighting against the _Tao_. The author writes, \\"Rabbit didn't know what a Backson was in spite of the fact he is one.\\" In several places, the author seems needlessly judgmental. Benjamin Hoff writes, \\"Looking back a few years, we see that the first Bisy Backsons in this part of the world, the Puritans, practically worked themselves to death in the fields without getting much of anything in return for their efforts.\\" In places, I found myself offended when the author disparaged cultures other than the Taoists."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The Tao of Pooh is one of the books that I can sincerely describe as &quot;changing my life.&quot;It provides an excellent description of Taoist philosophy, with a sense of humor and fun.

This is one of the most original novels I have read and it was a quick read. I already have it's companion called the Te of Piglet waiting to be read.

This one of the few inspirational books that I really enjoyed and I recommended it to everyone whether you are 10 or 110.5/5 StarsMust Read"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Would you like to have an understanding of the basics of Taoism? In the past have you browsed through the books on Taoism in Waterstones, read a few lines which made no sense at all and promplty returned the book on the shelf? Did you go as far as to actually purchase Lao-tzu's Tao Te Ching only to have it sitting on your shelf as an ornament, occasionally picked up, a few lines read and then promptly put back in-situ (maybe I'll read it another time)? But there is something inside you of course that wants to know more about Taoism, you have a deep rooted feeling that it will be good for you, almost as if your higher self is pushing you towards it. Well all is fine, you have been going with the flow recently, taking life as it comes and finding things a lot easier, and you have ended up here reading these reviews. You will notice that everyone has given 5 stars, of course they have, this is a delightful book. This is where you will get your first understanding of the principles of Taoism, of going with the flow, of the uncarved block, etc. The principles of Taoism here are put simply (which is always better). Gone are the abstract quotes (now what do they mean by this?). It's a delightful read, with the help of our friends from the 100 Acre Wood (even Eeyore has something important to teach us), wonderfully written by the sincere and genuine Benjamin Hoff. This isn't a guy who is in this for the money, he loves his Taoism, he loves his Pooh, and wants more people to benefit from the ancient chinese teachings. You so often read claims of books that will 'change your life' but they never really do. Well this one might, probably in a gentle subtle way to begin with (which is always better). You must be on your spiritual path to be considering buying this book. Should you buy it? Well, what does your intuition say?"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I read this book more than once and I loaned it to someone n kant remember who so I'm lookin for a new one. I have the Te of Piglet but have yet to read it but I will once I get my Tao of Pooh again. It really is a great book. Perfect gift for any1 of any age. I may order a few kopies to give as gifts...

It's one of those books that you reread over and over because the advice is so pure, sensible, and hits you a different way each time depending on what is going on in your life at the time. It's an entertaining read. It's written using the characters of Winnie the Pooh to illustrate what could be difficult to understand concepts. As a result, it's very easy to grasp. You don't feel assaulted, guilty or resistant either. I mean, it's Pooh! :) I highly recommend it for anyone doing soul searching or who just wants to understand life a bit better. I've given this book away as a gift over and over again. It's just one of those books that speaks to many people."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"It was so refreshing to recieve this package without delay.

THE TAO OF POOH actually explores the Tao and its finer points in a simple and delightful way.

Very creative, and a fine introduction to the teachings of Lao Tzu. Of benefit to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book is truly heart warming. Whether you are interested in Taoism or just a little introspection, this book can help you to have a good time."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"As someone who has always loved Winnie the Pooh, and who has a deep interest in Eastern philosophy, this book was one I'd looked forward to reading. It didn't disappoint. I loved the technique he used of having the characters ask him questions. It was fun, and it kept me engaged in the book The author explained Taoism in a way that was charming, easy to understand, and not at all dry, as some philosophical works can be. I feel that I have a better understanding of Taoism, and I am now eager to read more about it. What's interesting is that I have a four year old niece who loves Winnie the Pooh, and when we watch the cartoon together, I also now have new, grown-up insight into it, which makes it more fun for me too!The book is quick - in fact, I found it a bit too short - and easy to read. I admit, it could've been a bit more in-depth. I'm sure critics who say this is a very superficial examination of Taoism are probably right. However, I don't know that this criticism is particularly important. I think Hoffman's purpose was simply to whet the reader's appetite so that they'd be motivated to do more study of Taoist philosophy. If I'm correct in this belief, he was successful, at least in my case."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"As a lover of the Winnie the Pooh stories, I was intrigued by the idea of using the characters to teach Taoism, something that may be a little difficult for people who have never heard of it to understand at first. A friend loaned me the book, and I had to buy a copy of it for myself later! Besides teaching Taoism, the reader begins to see how the beloved characters reflect who we are. Suddenly, Christopher Robin seems to be wise indeed to have chosen such wonderful friends. In my house, we have already determined that I am a Pooh (although with a strange Tigger streak at times) and my husband is definitely Eeyore. Any adult who has ever lost him or herself in the Hundred Acre Wood and not wanted to come back should read this book."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I have read the tao te ching, and this book perfectly mirrors the largest message in lao tzu's work. Things work out on their own, and it's mostly our meddling that cause them to go wrong. To do this one has to be simple, and not worry about things constantly. I know that the whole idea of simplicity being a virtue might set some intellectuals on edge, I can understand this. Our society is not overly accepting of thinkers, therefor it makes us rather defensive. But this book does not condone stupidity in any sense of the word. In fact, the character of pooh is very interesting in the fact that while he does not know many things, he draws very logical conclusions using the information he has available to him. I consider stupidity to be the act of willfully ignoring the world around us, and it seems so do Lao Tzu and Benjamim Hoff.Throughout &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; Hoff uses the pooh stories as examples of how Taosim works, while his narrative more clearly explains the characters and what type of people they represent. I think the best example of this is the Pit story. When Pooh, Rabbit, and Piglet are lost in the woods Pooh notices that they keep on coming back to the same pit whe they try to find home. Thus he concludes that if they try to find the pit, the will end up back at their houses. A perfectly logical conlusion based on the evidence at hand. I thought it was one of the best examples of Taoist principles I have ever read.&quot;The tao of Pooh&quot; made me see the winnie the pooh books in an entirely different light, as philosopical texts in themselves. Taoism seems to overlap with many of the values i hold anyway, so I suppose I am a Taoist. Both the religion and this book reassert a sense of optimism about the physical world which is very lacking in nearly every other major religion, and much of our literature. It is simple yet prfound, truly a Taoist text in every sense."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This set of two books is more than a little...schizophrenic. &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; rates about an 8 on my scale; it's a fun little read...but a little bit troubling.Why troubling? For the most part, it's a cogent and simple analogy between very basic Taoism and the characters of A.A. Milne's Pooh books. &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; is a serene and peaceful pool with hints of some very ugly things lurking just below the surface. The most egregious example is his confused mishmash of pop (un)history of Thanksgiving welded to a bland not-so-New Age conception of the American Indians as peaceful gentle folk living in effortless harmony with the ecology and each other. But he can be forgiven that--he's making a point and he's a little rushed. But still...troubling.In &quot;The Te of Piglet&quot;, those things erupt out like pus from a boil. Mister Hoff has an ideological ax to grind with this one, and the problem is, it's a very dull and, at times, painfully stupid one. The title is a beginning clue--he's starting off with a much more strained analogy, but surely he can pull it off, right? Wrong. Like its predecessor, &quot;The Te of Piglet&quot; contains interludes starring our favorite characters from the Hundred Acre Wood. In the first book, these interludes were a nice grounding point and integrated in. In this one, however, they're superfluous and simply don't sound anywhere near as accurate a rendition of the characters. They seem rushed--Mr. Hoff is in a hurry to get back to his inept didactic half-wit ranting, and it shows. Notable gems of the type: America in the time of JFK was in an &quot;enlightened era&quot; (hee), and the microwave oven is a &quot;Perversion of Nature&quot; (because Radiation is Bad, No Matter What).Ideological axes to grind can be highly entertaining--if they're well done. Ben Hoff's is simply inept and idiotic by turns. Individually, &quot;Tao of Pooh&quot; rates about an 8. &quot;Te of Piglet&quot; receives a 2. I have to go below the strictly precise mean simply because the latter leaves such a sour taste that the former is tainted by association--and the knowledge that its author is, in so many ways, a self-stated hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"One could really take this book as a mixed bag of lessons. In a way, Hoff completely accidentally sets himself up as the ideal example of the opposite of a Taoist viewpoint. His portrayals of Winnie the Pooh as a simple, loving, accepting and calm creature are fairly on the mark. Though a tad simplistic, Pooh is accurately depicted as following several key Taoist virtues that are quite fundemental to such philosophy. At the same time, however, Hoff seems to scream for attention to his \\"higher learning\\" and aesceticism. Seeming to view himself a some type of guru on the subject, he makes a few jabs at Western learning in a painfully typical knee-jerk counterculturism manner. Many authors and artists in the past have attempted to seem profound simply by lashing out at anything conventional. After all, counterintuitive means profound, right? Unfortunately, no. In his rather selfrighteous, condemning, and finger-pointing manner, Hoff inadvertently deepens the lessons of the book. In his pretension, he deepens the contrast of the tranquil and nonjudgemental Pooh, setting him up as all the more admirable and showing just what sort of \\"more enlightened and at peace than thou\\" thinking this peaceful way of life stands against."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book is a gift in every way. It is remarkably suffused with the sweet, gentle spirit of its namesake, along with the infectious enthusiasm of its author. A true original, and a joy to read."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"It's just over half an inch thick, and just slightly bigger than pocket sized. If you can fit the entirety, or even a decent beginning of an explanation of the entirety of any philosophy or religion into a volume that sized... without cheating by using rice paper and microscopic print.. well, congratulations, I guess. I'm no scholar.It's a surface treatment, and an ok one at that. But most people won't come here for serious expository source material on the intricacies of Eastern mysticism. It's a playful, and simple reminder to most readers that life isn't the overbearingly complicated and ponderous thing that we're all told about. Yes, it involves Taoism. Yes, it involves Pooh. Yes, it bounces around, and it's an easy read. But it makes some valid points worth thinking about, and it'll leave most folks staring off into space for a while when they get done.Maybe it's not \\"serious\\" scholarly work. But it's a wonderful departure point for anyone who's a little too caught up in the frenzy of what life is supposed to be... whatever that is. It's hard enough to untangle the mess of the human mind without adding complication to the process by having to pore over a voluminous, verbose, and sometimes vacuous expository volume. Hard enough to figure yourself out as it is, without having to figure out what someone else is saying, too. So have a seat in your favorite chair, relax, unwind, and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The Tao of Pooh is a book about Taoism. It takes Winnie the Pooh, and his friends and uses them to describe and explain a few eastern religions. Mostly it centers on Taoism but it also talks about Buddhism, and Confucianism.Winnie the Pooh (Taoism) is without knowledge to cloud his mind and making things too complicated so he can find solutions that help him in the way he needs them to. He is not clever like Rabbit, who can cause quickly formed and misconceived intentions, he could conceive a solution but since he would have conceived it so quickly he doesn't have time to think if that was what he really wanted to do or if that was right. He isn't over-thought like Owl (Confucianism) which is to make him feel a boundary, to make him feel superior and higher than others, since he is being clouded by knowledge, he can't see the answer for what its good for, only how he can put him self above the others with that answer. Also there is Eeyore who is seeing a negative side to everything, never seeing for what its good for. Clouded by the negatives he can't see what he can use to help him.I really liked the Tao of Pooh. It showed me a lot about eastern religion. I think that being a Taoist for a day could help everyone relax and feel the natural flow of things.

I read it after I had done a school project on Taoism, so I had a slight clue as to what I was reading about, but I really wish I had found this book when I was doing the project!

As a child, I would read Winnie the Pooh, but I never at all knew the vast knowledge that was sitting right under my nose. My search for the perfect book explaining Taoism stops at &quot;The Tao of Pooh.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"These books are westernized nonsense that present a view of Taoism that bears very little resemblence to real Taoism (the traditions practiced in China for over 20 centuries). These books are a pure marketing scheme and amount to cultural colonialization (or cultural theft). If you want to learn more about real Taoism, try searching for books that are published by university presses - not the discount bin at Walden Books. For more on this topic, read some publications and presentations by Dr. Russell Kirkland and check his sources for other great works that are accurate treatments of real Taoism.I gave these books at least one star because they have introduced many in the West to Taoism (including myself) and, thus, they have served a good purpose. However, do not read these books and think you understand Taoism. You will need to take what you have read, empty your cup, and start over. Search for academic treatments of Taoism (not commercial). As well, if you are really interested in practicing Taoism, you should shop around for a good Tai Chi or Qijong instructor (sifu). Try to find one that really emphasizes the spiritual side of the martial arts.NOTE: These books fall into the same category as the translation of the Tao Te Ching by Stephen Mitchell. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRANSLATION. It is written by a poet who does not even speak/read Chinese and is so chopped up and poorly translated that it retains virtually none of the original meaning. There is a good translation out there by Gia Fu Feng and Jane English."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Hoff's general premise is that Winnie-the-Pooh is a wonderful embodiment of some of the fundamental principles of taoism. If he limited himself to that discussion, the book would have been a much better read - he really does do a nice job of developing that theme.Unfortunately, Mr. Hoff's un-tsaoist ego attempts to get in the way, especially, when he attempts to give direct &quot;life lessons&quot; to his readers (as opposed to allowing his readers to draw them from the anecdotes he desribes). Mr. Hoff at that point begins to evince a &quot;more buddhist, and thus cooler, than thou&quot; attitude in these portions of the book, and in the process reveals a lot of judgmentalism and close-mindedness. A minor example that I happen to recall: at some length, he belittles people who are devoted to exercise as being driven by some sort of vanity-driven compulsion. That may be true in some cases, but Hoff illustrates no ability to comprehend that some people may enjoy the act of running, or walking, or biking, or whatever, simply for itself (something the tao favors). If we all were truly at peace with ourselves, I guess we'd be attempting to package our personal spirituality for material gain like Hoff."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend that swears by it because it helped him through a difficult time in his life. I lost interest after the first couple of pages but forced myself to finish it. The author simplifies Taoist thought to the point that it is in line with any philosophy or religion. If you follow the golden rule and listen to your instincts, congratulations, you&#8217;re a Taoist. He makes his points by insulting every character from Winnie the Pooh, except for the great Pooh of course, and almost every profession. He needed to spend more time explaining the principles of Taoism and less time trying to explain what it is not. It is not a good introduction to Taoist thought, it just made me want to find a book that is. That is not to mention the bad writing style and confusing analogies. Interesting topic with potential but in the hands of a bad writer it turned to crap."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"\`The Tao of Pooh', a fascinating synthesis of Eastern philosophy and Western children's literature, is done largely in conversational style between Benjamin Hoff, erstwhile writer, photographer and musician with a penchant for forests and bears. Thus, Pooh makes a natural philosophical companion. But, more than a companion, Pooh is, for Hoff, the very embodiment of the Tao.\`It's about how to stay happy and calm under all circumstances!' I yelled.'Have you read it?' asked Pooh.This is two-way book: to explain Taoism through Winnie-the-Pooh, and to explain Winnie-the-Pooh (not always an easy task itself) through Taoism. Taoism, more academically, is a religion indigenous to China, built upon teachings primarily of Lao-tzu, with significant influence from Buddha and K'ung Fu-tse. It is in the teachings of harmony and emptiness and being of Lao-tzu, however, that Taoism draws its meaning, believing that earth is a reflection of heaven, and that the world \`is not a setter of traps but a teacher of valuable lessons.'As with many religions, this one took various guises: philosophic, monastic, structural, folk. But through them all, the imperceptible Tao, the essence of being, essentially undescribable, shapes the universe continually out of chaos, with a yin and yang alteration of perpetual transformation, in which nothing remains eternal save the Tao.This makes Pooh a perfect example and exemplar. \`For the written character P'u, the typical Chinese dictionary will give a definition of 'natural, simple, plain, honest.' P'u is composed of two separate characters combined: the first, the 'radical' or root-meaning one, is that for tree or wood; the second, the 'phonetic' or sound-giving one, is the character for dense growth or thicket.'Through semantic changes, perfectly in keeping with the Tao, we find that Pooh, or P'u, is actually a tree in the thicket, or a wood not cut, or finally, an Uncarved Block. And this, of course, is what pure being is.Pooh, in his journey through the Tao, with the Tao, of the Tao (it is a hard one to nail down, isn't it?) encounters many. This includes Eeyore, the terminally morose, who represents Knowledge for the sake of Complaining about Something. It also includes Owl, the Western successor of the 'Confucianist Dedicated Scholar', who believes he has all truth as his possession, and studies Knowledge for the Sake of Knowledge (even if it isn't always the best knowledge). \`You can't help respecting anybody who can spell TUESDAY, even if he doesn't spell it right; but spelling isn't everything. There are days when spelling Tuesday simply doesn't count.'Of course, all of the knowledge of the Owl, accompanied by the variable helpfulness of Rabbit who cannot stop activity in favour of just being something, couldn't figure out what had become of Christopher Robin, who left the Very Clear Note on his door:GON OUTBACKSONBISYBACKSONWho or what is a Backson? Backsons are those people trying to outrun their shadows and their footprints, not realising that to stand still and rest in the shade defeats the power of both. And of course, the Bisy Backson is never at a standstill. And of course, one cannot experience the Tao, be the Tao, know the Tao (well, you get the Tao) if one is perpetually on the run.The Bisy Backson is alwaysGONE OUTBACK SOONBUSYBACK SOONor, maybe GONE SOON. Anywhere. Anywhere he hasn't been. Anywhere but where he is. Of course, the idea of not going anywhere is abhorrent to him, and there is no concept of being able to do nothing.Nothingness frees the mind. Nothing works like nothing. For there is nothing to distract you. Nothing to get in the way. Nothing to hinder you. Nothing means anything.Now, read that last sentence again, carefully.Nothing means anything.Any thing is by definition itself, but when it is no thing, it can become potentially any thing.'Oh, I see,' said Pooh.Wisdom lies in the way of Pooh, who shirks the busy-ness of Rabbit, the intellectual hubris of Owl, and the doom-saying of Eeyore. Pooh simply is, and enjoys being who he is. Pooh is a Master, who knows the Way. Learn from him. Learn to be with him."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This elegant and well-written volume by Benjamin Hoff, along with its sequel &quot;The Te of Piglet&quot;, is perhaps one of the finest pieces of writing about Taoism in the West. Having just read and enjoyed the original Pooh stories by A.A. Milne, I became intrigued by this book and obtained it. As soon as I opened it I could not find a good point to lay it down. I kept reading and reading until I finished it in a single day. The book was so pleasurable, so well-written, and so intriguing. I kept thinking and imagining all the different concepts of Taoism that this book introduces me to. &quot;Wu Wei&quot; or effortless action; living in harmony with nature; Nowhere and Nothing; the importance of the present; the extreme alienation we in the West create for ourselves by being constantly busy. These are all important issues that relate to my life personally, and I feel I have gained something from reading this book, in addition to spending an enjoyable time reading it.Those who didn't like this book for some reason are missing the point. The &quot;Tao of Pooh&quot; was never meant to be the definite treatise on Taoism, or the dispassionate comparison of East and West. As a matter of fact, this book is classified under &quot;Humor&quot;. In fact, it is this humor of pooh which lends itself so aptly to introducing Taoism. Since reading this book, I became interested in reading the other book by John Tyerman Williams called &quot;Pooh &amp; the Philosophers&quot;. What a disaster that turned out to be! See, the defining character of Pooh is that he never really takes himself seriously, which is perfectly in line with the attitude of major Taoist philosophers. Yet Western philosophy thinks of itself as a serious subject, an attitude that is quite un-Pooh-ish, so I don't know what on earth Williams was thinking in using Pooh to illustrate Western philosophy. Anyways, don't buy William's book, buy this! If you like Pooh and feel intrigued with Eastern Philosophy, you will find a pleasurable reading in this masterpiece that was the first to recognize this beautiful match."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book is the perfect book to introduce anyone to eastern philosophy; particularly Taoism. Hoff's use of A.A. Milne's characters as a backdrop is excellent and lucid without being overly simple. Further if you already enjoy eastern philosophy you will be amazed at how accurately Hoff explains Taoism through everyone' favorite yellow bear."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I found this book to be a great beginner's guide to understanding the concepts of Taoism. While the Tao Te Ching can be quite abstract to someone new to The Way, Benjamin Hoff's book gives clear examples using, of all people, Pooh. The lovable bear turns out to be the perfect centerpiece of Taoist thought and action.Skeptical still? Read this book and find yourself opened to the simplicity and natural beauty of all that is Tao."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I picked up this book because it seemed so charming. The author took the stories and characters of A.A. Milne and juxtaposed them with the Taoist teachings of people such as Lao Tzu.Pooh as western Taoist starts off interestingly enough but halfway through it I came to the realization that it was making me want to just read the actual Milne, who was frankly probably a genius writer. Those were great books with great characters, each with their own type of intelligence.Then about two thirds through the book, it just becomes insulting. The author is against pretty much anything useful. Rather than believing in the give and take of Ying and Yang (or any other name it may go under) he's against intellectuals who are secretly foolish for trying to figure anything about the world, against people who work hard and care about their jobs or contributions (again that's just foolish), people who enjoy sports or exercise...heck he's against leaving your house or caring about the rest of the world. I understand the idea behind the Busy Backson rant, but is there no middle ground at all?The idea of the Indian American culture being superior to that of the almighty Puritans is used as an example, which could be built upon in several interesting ways, but instead the author chooses to illustrate how everything that came after was just silliness without supplying a single idea about how it could be done better...yet useful.At one point he actually uses the example of (paraphrasing here) turning on the T.V. news to hear \\"\`Thirty thousand people were killed today when five jumbo airliners collided over downtown Lose Angeles\\" *click* Stop worrying about everything and go about life. Listen to the birds chirp, they will tell you more about the world.\\" ---wait, we shouldn't care about thirty thousand humans being killed in a horrific accident?I am in no way an expert on Taoism, but unless everyone who IS finds that idea posing as a representation of their philosophy to be offensive, I want nothing to do with it. It isn't enlightened to go around hating everything while doing nothing. And I'm sure the author realizes this since he spends so much time writing best=selling books."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book is simply magnificent. I've been reading the Tao for years and never had I made the correlation of Pooh and Taoism. From the start you see how Hoff ties in Pooh to the ancient chinese philosophy, and having Pooh as a living and breathing character in the book helps. Pooh injects his simple nature and gentle humor into everything which is just so.. well, Taoist.I found myself entralled by how wonderful and charming Hoff made the book. He made it's reading an enjoyable process.Now for those of you who are new to Taoism or having trouble with its principle nature this will be a helpful book. I read some of the reviews of those who didn't understand the book or perhaps Taoism in general. Western minds often think too hard about everything. If you can relax and simply accept the book and its message as it is presented you should see its beauty.Taoism is like the sky is blue and the grass is green, it is simple and amazing and Pooh makes a great representative to deliver its teachings."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"A nice introduction to eastern philosophy and a good read for those seeking wisdom. In a modern society filled with superficial standards, noise polution and electronic everythings, this book is a welcome break that may just affect the ways you think and react.

This book introduced me to Tao in a very joyful kind of way, and it gave me a better opinion of Winnie too: his not really dumb at all, he's just happy, and that's what Taoism is all about."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I don't normally feel the urge to write reviews but this book has made me rethink my attitude towards life.

I lend out my copy to people and never see it again. It is the best book I've ever read and it helps me to focus myself. I already possesed some of the principles of Tao in my life when I first read the book several years ago, I just never knew the name of it and I'd studied Taoism before. Hoff combines Pooh and his world with Taoism in ways that make me wonder why I couldn't have seen it myself! When I want other people to read the book,and they are skeptical of the impact it has, I let them read the Foreword and tell them that it will brighten their day...the actual book will change their life. And after they read both, they wholeheartedly agree and refuse to return my copy! Buy this book and read it and you'll wonder why it took you so long to find it. I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I found the book to be very entertaining at the start, but it got old and it isn't even a very big book. Muddled thinking leads to muddled conclusions. For example: Hoff praises the simple mindedness of Pooh and uses an illustration of someone who is rational and purposeful getting into a car wreck because he is that way, when my experience has been that simpleminded Pooh-type people cause most car wrecks. I wouln't buy it. Check it out from your library first."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The concept is nifty, but, alas, in the implementation, this book seems only able to exalt the Tao by denigrating other paths of wisdom.

It is a short read, under 160 pages, and explains the major tenants of Taoism. I found it a solid book, and gave me some things to reconsider in life. Well worth the few bucks."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"These are stories I read many years ago and then introduced them to my grandson who is 32.

(1 of 2 is The Art of War) The Tao of Pooh takes the overly complicated world and makes it simple. Conceptually, they are one in the same book, yet from 2 totally different perspectives.

After reading - and understanding ;-) - The Art of War, I suggest diving into The Tao of Pooh, 2 of 2 in best books I've ever read.The Art of War"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The Tao of Pooh was incredibly influential on who I am now. The book breaks down the basic concepts of Taoism into easy to understand terms and explains them using stories from the Pooh series. Even if you aren't a Taoist (I'm not), this book can teach you plenty about how to be content with the world as it is. If life is stressing you out, this book may be able to help. The Te of Piglet isn't as golden as the other, seems less heartfelt. It is worth giving a read though as well!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This is most definitely not a kids book.

In fact, disarming in its simplicity, Pooh's way of living is able to transcend the limitations of human mind in understanding being.So Pooh turns out to be the greatest Taoist master that contemporary history has ever known, and immersing yourself in the lovely stories portraying it and its little friends as the protagonists, you will understand why.There's not so much to add, all I can say is: read it.Order it now, before it becomes unavailable, and if you're lucky enough to see more than just a fairy tale in it, you'll also start seeing your own daily under a different light...

Knowledge, enlightenment and understanding of the world and its ways as a whole are key to The Way. With Pooh at his side and Owl, Eeyore, Tigger, Piglet and Roo lending a hand, Hoff explores the fundamental simplicity of Taoism and how many parallels there are between the tales of the 100 Acre Wood and The Way.I found the book delightful: non-threatening, enlightening and an easy read. In times of trouble and stress I find myself dipping into its pages for relaxation and security. It is one of the best and most re-read books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"After reading this 158 page book filled with old friends of my childhood; Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, Pooh and other western world friends, six times for my school required reading, I regret to inform that this story does not uphold the Taosim aspect of this book. I believe it was a good idea for Benjamin Hoff to write a novella based on A.A. Milne's childhood stories of Winnie the Pooh, but I was let down on how he explained Taoism. In his attempt to explain this teaching of China, he managed to insult many other lifestyles and ways of living. In this book I learned that people should basically meditate all day long and not live in houses, not use cars, and not partake in activities that many people of the world are involved in such as jogging or eating at a fast food place once in a while. I was also enlightened by the fact that basically things happen to Pooh for no reason whatsoever, and also that everything proved by modern science is false and can basically be interpreted as &quot;We don't know&quot;. There were some rich teachings of Taosim in the Tao of Pooh, such as the painting of the Vinegar Testers and how that related to Bhuddism, Taoism, and Confucianism, but overall I think Benjamin Hoff should have left the book to that instead of showing how the other practices in life are inferior the Taosim. In my opinion, Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, Pooh, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Roo and Tigger are representatives of the various people in the world and their different backgrounds and personalities, and we should all repect and learn from each other inspite of our various walks of life, instead of believing that one school of thought, Taoism, is more superior than other beliefs, which is the feeling Benjamin Hoff imposed on me when I read the Tao of Pooh. I think I'll stick to my wise and knowledgeable Uncle Alan for information on Taosim."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This text arrived in more than adequate time.I recommend this text to spiritual practitioners as a base text, and children.Along with its Brother text The Te of Piglet."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This elegant and well-written volume by Benjamin Hoff, along with its sequel aeThe Te of Piglet, is perhaps one of the finest pieces of writing about Taoism in the West. Having just read and enjoyed the original Pooh stories by A.A. Milne, I became intrigued by this book and obtained it. As soon as I opened it I could not find a good point to lay it down. I kept reading and reading until I finished it in a single day. The book was so pleasurable, so well-written, and so intriguing. I kept thinking and imagining all the different concepts of Taoism that this book introduces me to. aeWu Wei or effortless action; living in harmony with nature; Nowhere and Nothing; the importance of the present; the extreme alienation we in the West create for ourselves by being constantly busy. These are all important issues that relate to my life personally, and I feel I have gained something from reading this book, in addition to spending an enjoyable time reading it.Those who didn(tm)t like this book for some reason are missing the point. The aeTao of Pooh was never meant to be the definite treatise on Taoism, or the dispassionate comparison of East and West. As a matter of fact, this book is classified under aeHumor. In fact, it is this humor of pooh which lends itself so aptly to introducing Taoism. Since reading this book, I became interested in reading the other book by John Tyerman Williams called aePooh & the Philosophers. What a disaster that turned out to be! See, the defining character of Pooh is that he never really takes himself seriously, which is perfectly in line with the attitude of major Taoist philosophers. Yet Western philosophy thinks of itself as a serious subject, an attitude that is quite un-Pooh-ish, so I don(tm)t know what on earth Williams was thinking in using Pooh to illustrate Western philosophy. Anyways, don(tm)t buy William(tm)s book, buy this! If you like Pooh and feel intrigued with Eastern Philosophy, you will find a pleasurable reading in this masterpiece that was the first to recognize this beautiful match."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"If you only read two books this year, this and \\"The Te of Piglet\\" should be those."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"It's always worth slowing down and taking the time to read the Tao of Pooh.

It is one of those books that has helped me to realize that &quot;philosophy&quot; and truth seeking is not really as complicated and mind-bending as we often think. Mr. Hoff has done the Western world an honor by making not only Eastern thought more accessible to many who thought such things were too lofty or &quot;distant,&quot; but also by making the world of Pooh a part of adult life (I loved Pooh as a child and am glad to have him back as a reading companion!). Most significantly, &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; has been largely responsible for the freeing of my thoughts from decades of backwards and damaging philosophies and religious beliefs that, I now discover, were slowly destroying me emotionally, physically, and socially.

It is true that this book doesn't go too deep into philosophy, and I respect that. Because, it's not a book about philosophy--it's a book about life. The philosophy contained in the Tao of Pooh is directly applicable to everyday life and reflects real life.There are great references and stories in the Tao of Pooh. I was delighted to learn about The Vinegar Tasters, though I still can't find a scroll of it to hang on my wall, and of Master Li who lived an extraordinary number of years."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Hoff uses Pooh Bear and all of the other characters from Winnie the Pooh to ease a seeker into understanding Buddhism, Taoism and the general balance of the universe, a little bit better. This book was different from many other books on Buddhism/Taoism, in that it is playful and imaginative, rather than concrete and absorbed in discipline and standards. I think that this is a great read for anybody interested in the Asian religions, who also can appreciate the cute, yet meaningful metaphors that Hoff offers within this book."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"You don't have to be Chinese to be Taoist. In fact, you don't even have to be human. You could be a teddy bear, and do just fine. Upon reading this book, I found that I had always been Taoist and not known what to call it. The simple yet powerful explanations of the basic Taoist principles in this book are absolutely invaluable. Taoism, after all, should come naturally. Simplicity is it's key, and so this book captures it perfectly. Playful and juvenile to some, maybe, but brilliant and wise to those who truly understand the ideas within. Actually, is there any difference between the former and the latter?"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I have decided that this book is a must gift for anyone and everyone you care about. It opens all readers up to the simplicity and joy of living. It helps you realize how much stress and energy, we put into things that aren't entirely important. Meanwhile we allow the joys of life to go fleeting by everyday. A true treasure."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This is a very good book. Not only does it explain in a, for a western, clear way what Taoism really is, it also does it in a funny way. This book is better than The Te of Piglet, for although good (worth a 3,5) it is a bit messy, which is not the case in The Tao of Puh. Hoff made the book very easy to understand by writing it in the way he did. I personally read The Tao of Puh to relax and feel at ease. It has been to this point very useful and effectiv. And because it is a humorous book one can read it over and over again, I've read it twice during the last month and I am going to read it again soon. The Te of Piglet , as I said, is a good book, but it lacks the same humor as the first one had. It's has a feel of being to hastily made and rushes from thing to thing. The explanations are lenghty and a bit unclear. But as a sequel it is not so bad and a good book to read."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"makes simple the philosophy of taoism in an easy to read simple yet thought provoking assemblance of ideas. makes one think and put things into proper perspective"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"It was a very enlightening book, placing a new prospective on living. Pooh is an inspiration, and taoism has captured my interest."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Let me begin my review by saying that I have made significant contributions to the Hoff children college fund ... I have bought eight copies of this wonderful book for friends over the years.One of the lovely expositions of Taoist thought is the section on the print &quot;The Vinegar Tasters,&quot; and there are many others. One of the problems of accessing 'that which cannot be described' is that ordinary langage is simply not capable of expressing the inexpressible---so we must approach an understanding of the material obliquely; or better, far better, by direct experience.This Hoff manages to do, eruditely and wittily. If &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; moved only one person to a serious contemplation of the Tao, Benjamin Hoff could be pleased. But to reinterpret the Tao, accurately and humorously---all the while pulling on the emotional landscape of a happy childhood spent with the Pooh series---is simply masterful. As an author, this is one of those books I wish fervently that I had written ...Recommended for all."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I don't know, nor do I pretend to know, the intricate workings of Taoism. But then, I didn't set out to write a book. I'm merely writing a book review.Benjamin Hoff, regardless of his knowing the intricate workings of Taoism, comes off as pretending. At the very least, he talks the talk but fails to walk the walk. How can I say that, given my self-announced lack of knowledge? Hoff explains, quite clearly, one of the tenets of Taoism is to accept things precisely as they are. He then goes on to reject the other Pooh characters as they are. Instead, he proceeds to disparage them for not having the simplicity of Pooh. Likewise, he starts his book by doing the same of other religions.The book reads like it was originally written to be a Taoism for Dummies book. By adding Pooh, the book becomes much more than that for Hoff. The book is annoying at times, having parables that sometimes work, other times not; occasionally coming from random space and not speaking to the point at hand. The author assumes we just GET it. But isn't the point of the book to explain, to make clear what might not be obvious to those not immersed in the subject matter already? It's hard to believe this is anything but a book for beginners. As such, he should treat the reader as such. Other times the points are illustrated well with the Pooh stories.The book is too judgmental and critical of those not accepting The Way, which is in direct conflict with another of the tenets of the book - Cottleston Pie, for those who have read it. This lack of acceptance is bothersome. Overall, I guess things are NOT what they are, in the mind of Benjamin Hoff. Additionally, Pooh is often times omniscient and judgmental, qualities I would never imagine to label the cute little guy.Many of the ideas expressed in this book embody things I currently believe. The text often reinforces those beliefs, other times expands upon them. However, as mentioned above, it makes me wonder at the style of the message delivered. On one hand, it's probably a good intro to the subject matter, regardless of your religious & philosophical beliefs. On the other hand, the book can't be taken too seriously due to the blatant hacking at the philosophies and beliefs of others. Still, the core of the book does entail a much ideology that helps get a person through everyday life. So it's probably well worth the read if you take the good and ignore the bad."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Personally, I enjoy learning. I study the human psyche. I read a lot about the how people face the question of, \\"who am I?\\" \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" by Benjamin Hoff provides a view into answering this question, however, I found the use of the Pooh story to describe the Tao and life to be a little deep. As I worked through the pages sometimes I struggled to make the connection and to learn, but then I recognized the simplicity of the message and was able to grasp the author's intent. My roller coaster experience in reading this book went from deep reflective, intellectual investigation, to internalizing the simple messages of the Tao, to a conclusion of \\"what did I get from this read?\\" On the one hand, during the read I said to myself, \\"I will need to re-read this book, or chapters\\", then again, despite my apetite for learning, I wondered if I wanted to work that hard to get the message. Judge for yourself if you can gain the simplicity of the book's message for life."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The \\"collectors box\\" that this set came in was extremely cheap, hardly felt like the collectors piece that I wanted to put on my shelves, but it's a good book to have, and I'll keep this copy around until I can find a boxed copy to be proud of.

It makes me wonder if the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh was a student of Taoism. An excellent analysis of Pooh as a expounder of Tao.

The Dao, or The Way, is ultimately unknowable. We can try to figure it out, but Lao Tzu even said that we will never truly understand it. The Dao is something we can't really know, but we try to interpret, so our puny little minds can somewhat attempt to grasp it. When Lao Tzu speaks about getting back to nature, the author of the Tao of Pooh interprets a regression. I see it as a purer state of being. This isn't a book for little kids. It's a book for adults who want to have a fun way to be introduced to a complex idea. For those of you who don't understand it, be the water. Water is not the vessel that holds it, but merely mimicks the shape. It is, yet it isn't. It flows where it may, and yet can wear away granite. Just be the water. It's alot less stressful."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book suits those with an interest in philosophy or Taoism in particular who also like a nice, easy read from time to time. There will always be those who dislike having such a serious subject equated with something so childlike, and yet that is what Taoism is all about--the childlike way of viewing the world, accepting reality for what it is rather than trying to force it to be what we want it to be.For those new to Taoism, it opens the door to a different way of viewing the world. To those not so new to it, it's a refreshing, fun take on the subject. This book is intended to explain the basic concepts of the philosophy. For those looking for an analytical or in-depth book on the subject, you need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"When I first heard of this book I thought it sounded ridiculous.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book will change your life, if you let the message in. No forcefeeding here like in a lot of philosophy work, just simple pleasureable reading. The beauty of Mr. Hoff's work here is that he explains a somewhat obscure set of ideas with little of the \\"facts\\" we are used to as Americans, using simple characters that we all know and love. Think about it... why do we love Pooh so much? He is clumbsy, doesn't keep good track of time, he eats too much, he doesn't seem very smart,..but...we still love him. This book helps explain why and as I said, if you listen, you will find that you view the world in a whole new way after reading this. You will look for and attach yourself to the \\"Pooh's\\" of the world because they have it right!If you are looking for a book that will open your eyes to a new way of seeing the work, click on the buy button.

But all in all it's a very worthwhile read; I've read it twice and have recommended it to several friends/family."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The Tao of Pooh/CassettesBenjamin Hoffextremely devistated that the cd have been stopped, can you please find me an audio cd of this"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The book THE TAO OF POOH by Benjamin Hoff is a Taoist perspective of the much beloved story of Winnie the Pooh. Hoff explains that the Tao is \\"The Way\\", a way of living. In each of the chapters there is a new small adventure in the Hundred Acre Wood. Each chapter is like a day in the life of Pooh, complete with life lessons that offer the reader a different understanding of how to approach situations that we encounter in life. The book is focused on Pooh, his way of life, and how he sees the world.The author makes his book easy to understand and relate to by using the simple characters from A.A. Milne's stories as a source of lessons on life from a Taoist perspective. You get to know the characters and their perspective and you can then make a personal connection with them by thinking about how you might approach situations in life in a similar, or perhaps different way.Most people think that Pooh is for little kids, but in actuality, this book applies the story of Pooh's adventures to the Tao and shows how Pooh's life is a perfect way to learn the Taoist philosophy. The author also shows how the other characters in the story do not represent the Tao. For example, Eeyore is always complaining: \\"Good morning, Pooh Bear, said Eeyore gloomily. If it is a good morning, which I doubt.\\" Rabbit is brainy but not smart; Piglet is often scared and fearful; Owl knows a lot, but keeps to himself and learns from books more than from life. Pooh, on the other hand, has many points of view, is quite humble, and sees life through a very simple, yet profound perspective. He is more interested in being himself than in making a big deal about who he is and what he does.One weakness of this book is that as he is explaining some about Taoism, the author tries to compare the Tao to Buddhism. In his attempt to do this, he talks about Buddhism in a sort of negative way, stating that, \\"To Buddha, life on earth was bitter, filled with attachments and desires that led to suffering...a revolving wheel of pain for all creatures.\\" Hoff doesn't represent Buddhism fairly in this statement, as it doesn't really capture the bigger picture of what Buddhism is about and therefore doesn't give the reader an accurate comparison of these philosophies. Another weakness of the book is that you can only take Winnie the Pooh so far, as a source of life's lessons, and then it sort of runs out of juice.Overall, though, instead of a dry and boring approach to learning about Taoist philosophy, this book teaches it through reflecting on the fun and often entertaining adventures of these familiar and loveable characters. Hoff teaches about Taoism by using the philosophy as a lens for looking at life, as we reflect on the different ways each character in Pooh's world approaches the situations they find themselves in and the meaning they make of their experiences. He points out that each character sees life differently, depending on who they are and their unique perspective. He encourages us to embrace the \\"Pooh Way,\\" of effortless, egoless, simplicity."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Lately, I have been really interested and fascinated about the whole philosophy of Taoism. I have become very intrigued with the reading of the short stories and trying to find the meaning of each one. Living a life of simplicity and harmony has really appealled to me lately.I came across this book and decided to give it a read. As I continue to learn about Taoism and all the great insights and wisdom that you can derive from Taoism I needed something that would speak to me on a level that made sense. I believed this book did the job.I found the book interesting and engaging. Using Winnie the Pooh I was to begin to construct a basic understanding of Taoism.I am currently reading some more books on Taoism and trying to find ways to incorporate more of the beliefs into my way of life. This book was a great entry point for me to begin my learning journey.There were some poems that I really liked, but in the end I wrote down a few quotes that stuck out to me.** Knowledge and Experience do not necessarily speak the same language.****....isn't knowledge that comes from experience more valuable than knowledge that doesn't****one disease, long life; no disease, short life****easiest way to get rid of a minus is to cahnge it into a plus****Tao does not do, but nothing is not done.****flow like water, reflect like a mirro, respond like an echo**Great stuff right there.

The book really helps you see situations from a really wonderful perspective & presents you with positive perspectives! A great book for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Benjamin Hoff uses Winnie the Pooh to teach Taoist principles. The book is a quick and easy read, as I am sure the author intended as way to reflect his subject matter. Tao or \\"the Way\\" has always been a somewhat mysterious and inaccessible philosophy for me. Perhaps that's the result of my over-westernized mind. Whenever I read a treatise on the Tao, I am always left with the feeling that I have only touched the surface of the teaching and that I would need to enroll in a some long term course before I get it. This book leaves me with the same feeling. I did, however, glean some important teachings, like how one must try to stick to his own nature, how it's better to go with the flow than to be hyperorganized, and how our culture's acquisitiveness has resulted in mindless consumerism and the threat to our planet's viability. I was also impressed by the teaching on Tai Chi, where practitioners do not confront force with force but use deflection and evasive tactics to overcome their enemy, a technique that should be used more often in other areas of life. So, maybe I did get more than I expected. In any case, it's fun and comforting to have Winnie the Pooh and his character friends on the journey to learning the Tao. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I've always loved Winnie the Pooh, ...so I browsed around in the book store and ran across this book. When I opened it, I couldn't put it down. Who would have ever thought that inside a sweet children's story could be so much depth? Benjamin Hoff is a genious. He takes me down a river of patient thought. You'll love this, no matter where you are in life. A \\"have to read it at least once\\" book."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Taken as intended this book is a delightful view of Taoism but to do this one must disregard the authors attitude that Western Science and such things are futile."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I liked this book. It made me feel peaceful while I was reading it. However, I feel that Hoff's sometimes biting comments toward other people's views broke the peacefulness of the reading at times. For example, while he describes the Way as something that everyone must find in his or her own way, he openly criticizes Confucianists and Puritans. Although the traditional Taoist approach is that following set guidelines will likely steer you away from the Way, perhaps for some people, living within guidelines of Confucianism or Puritanism is their Way. Whether it truly is or not, I felt that Hoff could have shown more respect for others' points of view at times. Nevertheless, I think this book is well worth reading, especially for someone new to the ideas of Taoism. If you are looking for a similar feeling of peacefulness while reading, try reading Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"For those of you who are curious about this book and may be turned off by some of the \\"negative\\" comments, allow me to offer my humble opinion. I think that those people who did not like this book or felt it did not explain taoism, just really don't get the point. Taoism most certainly isn't something you seek and seek and then get frustrated at not finding, then angry, and then seek and seek. Taoism seen especially through Pooh's eyes and actions (or should I say \\"inactions\\") comes so near the mark to beginning to understand this ancient philosophy of harmonious existence on earth with the earth, and the duality of all things. I highly recommend this book for that open minded, non-judgemental, person open to the concept that indeed anything is possible...too many of us are so grounded in what we \\"absolutely know to be fact\\", when in reality anything in this universe is truly possible. Please explore this book on your path. I also highly recommend the companion book to this, The Te of Piglet, which delves ever more into taoism."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I respectfully disagree with Penny - this is the greatest explanation of the unexplainable that I have ever seen.

One of my good friend told me that life is just like a bubble of beer. You have to stop and enjoy the smell. After reading this book, I've realized that I have been studying absent-mindedly. Only for the scholarly career. Let take a deep breath and live for today's jouissance."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"For those of you who, like me, are interested in philososphy but find most philosophical writings boring and overly complicated, this is the book for you. Hoff explains Taoism through the adventures of Whinnie the Pooh. If you've ever read any of A.A. Milne's novels, the style of this book should be familiar. As Hoff writes about Whinnie the Pooh and his Taoist attitude towards life, Pooh and Piglet comment on his writing and ask him questions. So how is Pooh an example of Taoism? Because he is simple-minded and unconditionally happy. Pooh lives a life of harmony because he never frets or hesitates. He simply goes with the flow, and that is what Taoism teaches. This book is a happy retreat to childhood combined with philisophical teachings that only an adult could understand. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"As a professional Taoist Arts instructor for over thirty years, I can only stand back and gaze in awe at this little book, wondering exactly WHERE Mr. Hoff received his inspiration from.Like most wonderful things in life, this piece of literature is simplicity itself. Lao Tzu himself, the \\"Old Man\\" of Taoism and the (debated) author of the centuries-old \\"Tao Te Ching\\" couldn't have done better.I picked up a copy of \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" when it first came out in the early 80's, having no great expectations of its content or wisdom. Taoists HAVE no expectations. :>)I read the entire book in one sitting. And wanted more.Never have I come across a more accessible introduction to the philosophy of Taoism; indeed, I strongly suggest this book to all of my students and patients as a wonderful beginners guide to the realm of the Tao. It's a non-threatening, non-preachy book filled with wisdom beyond measure.My only complaint? I've had to buy several more copies to replace the ones I've worn out..."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Everyone I know loved pooh as a kid. He was ever-happy, ever-satisfied, and ever-peaceful. With the exception of the occasional honey-related fiasco, he seemed to know a thing or two about living. However, as we get older, watching and reading about Pooh and his friends becomes frustrating. Why is your life so simple, Pooh? This world we live in is so hectic, and if we don't periodically step back and breathe, we begin to think that this is how life is supposed to be. When people tell me to relax, or not worry, or spout off clich&eacute;s like \\"whatever happens will happen\\", I can tend to get really mad. How dare you say that?!? Do you know everything I have to get done today? What I usually don't realize, and what they may not realize, is that they are really preaching some of the ancient and wise tenets of Taoism. What I'm really looking for, I suppose, is the formula for a good life. Like most people, I spend a lot of my time trying to find it in work, possessions, getting into college, what have you... But as Pooh teaches through The Tao of Pooh, happiness and contentment lie right in front of me.The Tao of Pooh approaches the wisdom and (sometimes) backwards philosophy involved in Taoism using understandable scenarios involving Pooh and his pals in the hundred acre wood. For example, Pooh and his friends wander around the forest looking for his home but keep arriving at the same sinkhole, and not his house. He then decides that if they look for the sinkhole, they will surely arrive at his house. This story was meant to show the futility of seeking something out, because what is meant to come to you will.Each character in The Tao of Pooh represents a frame of mind addressed in Taoism. Eeyore is supposed to characterize giving up, and giving in to suffering and misfortune. From what I've read about the book, this is a poke at Buddhism's \\"life is suffering.\\" The rabbit and the owl represent the over-intellectuals. Owl seeks out knowledge for the sake of knowledge, of being able to look wise. While they seek to analyze and comprehend everything they do and see, they show the supposed flaws of the rigid analysis and thought process preached in Confucianism. I think the point of their characters is that we're not supposed to understand everything, so we shouldn't try. Although wise, his wisdom extends only to his mind and not to his heart where it counts. In contrast to these characters, Pooh has a rich heart and a life of happiness, because he takes the good with the bad, doesn't struggle to grasp every confusing aspect of life, and knows that above all \\"life is good\\".There is nothing in this book that we've never heard before. However, they're all things that, as people tied to a clock and a palm pilot, we quickly brush off if they're not well stated. The thing that makes this book rather incredible is the way it drives the ideas home using a character we are all comfortable with. The anecdotes in this book are captivating and very effective at showing us the things that make life worth living. This world would be a much better place to live in if everyone followed Pooh's lead - just slowed down and realized how great life truly is."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I've read this book a couple of times and I always enjoy it. I think it provides a good introduction to Taoist philosophy (I haven't read much other Taoist philosophy so take that for what it's worth). I like how bits of Winnie-the-Pooh are used to provide examples and illustrate abstract concepts. I agree with many of the basic ideas of the book. But reading it always leaves me vaguely unsatisfied. While much of what the author says makes sense, it isn't easy to apply it to daily life. I would describe two of the main axioms of the book as &quot;go with the flow&quot; and &quot;be true to yourself.&quot; These are both sound pieces of advice but what do they really mean? What am I supposed to do with that? When I read the book I find myself nodding and agreeing but as soon as I put it down the words kind of evaporate. There just isn't enough substance to apply it to my life. Or maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it yet. Nobody said it was easy."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Mr. Hoff, in quoting &quot;The Vinegar Tasters&quot;, may have misunderstood Buddhism. As a Buddhist, with some experience, I have never looked at the Universe as a 'setter of traps' nor am I embittered by life on earth. Just saddened. More likely, we are the generators of illusion and are working out our karma. Buddhism is more in accord with finding the lessons of our lives in our karma and taking responsibility. We do not turn away from the 'dust of the world'. We wipe it from our eyes.Other than the above, I find joyful calm in its reading."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"First I have to address the 1 star reviews... were you reading the same book? How did you get all this negitivity from a simple book? Hoff isn't knocking anyone, if you read the book there's a whole section dedicated to the feeling that everyone has a place in life. The \\"Owls\\" The \\"Tiggers\\" The \\"Rabbits\\" ect... he's not saying that these are bad qualities just that too much \\"Rabbit\\" or too much \\"Eeyore\\" can be bad. It seems to me the people who gave this book a one star are exactly the people who this author is trying to get across too, it's your own pre judgements that don't allow you to enjoy this book.That being said this is a wonderful book, I've always been a huge Pooh fan and I've always used these characters to discribe people. Everyone knows a \\"Eeyore\\" and a \\"Owl\\" and so on, and in some regards everyone has a \\"Piglet\\" part of them or a \\"Tigger\\" That's all this book is saying, the sooner you realize it the better. Hoff isn't saying if your a \\"Owl\\" change because you won't ever be happy. He's saying the sooner you know who you are and accept you for you, the happier you'll be. The sooner you can \\"Let go\\" of the things that we all get wrapped up in, the happier you'll be. It's a shame when people can't see that."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Somebody has to bash this book and I guess it's going to be me. Now get this straight before I saw anything: I like Pooh and I like Taoism. I don't attack the subject matter of this book. However, I attack the style, misrepresentation of religions (other than Taoism), and the misrepresentation of Pooh in this book.Although I can see this book was intended for young adults, I find the style condescending, as if Hoff thinks he's speaking to the uneducated masses waiting for enlightenment. There is definitely the feel of being taught by a teacher in elementary school as one reads this book. Furthermore, while some might find the childishness of Hoff &quot;delightful&quot;, I found it nothing of the sort. I thought the book was boring and tedious. I don't know why people enjoy this book when there are real philosophy books out there, like the wonderful &quot;Zen and Art of Motorcyle Maintenence&quot;.Most disturbing about this book was its misrepresentation of other religions and its general condemnation of non-Taoist thought. For a young-adults book, I've never seen pages so loaded with mind-narrowing prejudice! His treatment of Buddhism and Confucianism are ludicrous and disturbingly inaccurate. I'll leave it to the reader to find the obvious discrepencies between Hoff's imaginary philosophies and the real philosophies he attempts to describe. Further, I've never felt so insulted by a book as this; his virtually says that all scholars are fools. Does everyone passively accept that being enlightened requires ignorance? I sure as heck don't!Finally, Pooh was the unfortunate mascot Hoff manipulated to give credibility to his views. Hoff would ask a question to Pooh and Pooh would respond by condemning certain schools of thought. The real Pooh would never do that! Pooh is a simple and non-offensive character who gets along with the world because of both of these qualities. In short, I was morally offended by this book many consider to be a classic, and I think Hoff should have learned some lessons from childrens' books with good messages before he wrote this loaded polemic."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Benjamin Hoff's job comparing the lovable characters of the One Hundred Acre Woods to Taoism may be a stretch to some, but I found it delightful and very helpful. First of all, I taught Ancient History including the great world religions to sixth graders (roughly 11-12 year olds). I took some examples from the book and its theme and integrated them into my teaching on China and Taoism. The concepts in many of the great eastern religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, etc. can be hard for many in the West to grasp, not to mention adolescents just being introduced to them. The comparisons in this book really allowed my students to absorb the overall theme of Taoism.The two comparisons I love that Hoff gives:1) How the Taoist tastes vinegar and unlike the rest, enjoys it because he realizes that everything in life is not sweet (Balance).2) I also taught a character education class and this theme was particularly helpful: you should seek to live everyday of your life like you are about to open a present. That anticipation and excitement should be driving forces in your life. No matter how bad your day/ week/ month is there should always be a \\"present\\" to look forward to on your calendar. And when that event is over, there should be something else to keep in your mind; a new, exciting anticipation. It is a never ending cycle.You don't have to be a Taoist to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This is a good introduction to Taoism, and describes many aspects of Taoist philosophy very well. My major problem with this book was the arrogant, very non-Taoist attitude taken by the author in his writing. He seems quite proud to be imparting his knowledge upon the ungifted masses. If you can get past that, you will find it an interesting, worthwhile book. For a better introduction, try Eva Wong's translation of The Seven Taoist Masters."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I like what I read or I hate it. Simple as that. Well, This book was annoying in several ways, yet my affection for Winnie The Pooh bouyed my rating of the book, and my interest in Eastern philosophy. I was apalled by Hoff's constant bashing at \\"intellectuals\\" and veiled ranting. I was also annoyed at Hoff's bashing of other faiths as essentially being \\"Wrong\\". A true Taoist wouldn't beat someone over the head about how \\"wrong\\" their Way is because it happens to be structured and staid. That may just be the natural-flowing Way for them. It's a so-so introduction to Taoism, so I'd recommendTao: The Watercourse Wayby Alan Watts and a nice translation of the Tao Te Ching. Put the two together and you'll grok it better than Hoff ever will.Then Again, you can read Hoff's books with an open mind....and as a preacher I once knew said \\"Eat the meat, and leave the bones\\"."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I was searching for a basic introduction to Tao, and being a Pooh lover from way back thought that this would be a good place to start. While I learned some of what I was searching for - the focus on nature and simplicity - there was a recurring tone of negativity that bothered me to the point that I couldn't enjoy the book. What troubled me is this: Hoff repeatedly illustrates the virtues of his chosen philosophy/religion by denigrating other religions.I'm not much of a fan of &quot;organized religion&quot;, so the thought of criticizing other religions doesn't upset me per se: it's just that I find no place for it in a book like this. This should be about the uplifting, enlightening spiritual values of Tao. The recurring stabs at what he obviously views as competing philosophies struck a very discordant tone. I couldn't get past this to enjoy the educational elements of the book."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"When trying to teach Taoism in a Western classroom, foreign words and concepts, as well as scholarly language, often hinder me. Many students, and myself, get bogged down in what the author says rather than explore what Taoism is. This book is a helpful tool.It is a quick read.

Benjamin Hoff's book reminded me of the important things in life- the simple things- and how much time was wasted on the little unimportant parts. I didn't read a lot of Pooh when I was a kid, but it isn't necessary to fully enjoy this book. To this day, I pull it out whenever I need a reminder to breathe and to just enjoy the day to day of life.

First, AA Milne was the first book I remember looking for in the school library, as a child. My \\"inner child\\" (which is mostly in control of the outer adult, anyway) rejoiced in an excuse to revisit 100 Acre Wood. Second, as a missionary in China (and later author of a book on \\"How Jesus fulfills the Chinese Culture\\"), I also learned to love Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi, and learn from them. Third, however, while as Hoff correctly points out, there's a little of each these characters in each of us, the owl usually emerges in me when I start critiquing books.By and large, this is a pleasant and successful introduction to philosophical Taoism. Sometimes it's confusing which are the bits Pooh said in Milne, and which are the bits Hoff added -- even though the font is different -- but then, Hoff's Pooh sometimes sounds quite different from Milne's Pooh. Sometimes he even comes across as overly clever, which is not in character.When I asked young people in China, I found that more seemed to admire Confucius than Lao Zi. Let me devote the rest of my review to explaining that, in light of Hoff's depiction of both.If Pooh disses Owl, you can't blame him because (1) He's a stuffed animal; (2) It's funny; and (3) Hoff is critiquing archeotypes, not individuals. When Zhuang Zi disses Confucius, the second two excuses also apply: there's a bit of sectarian edge, but it's more Saturday Night Live than Inquisition. When Hoff steps out of character to diss \\"dissicated\\" intellectual types, there's a bit of humor, but it's harder to draw the line between fair critique and cheap shot.The truth is, lots of \\"owls\\" are reasonable people. Confucius was one: he loved music, took disciples hiking, and admitted when he didn't know something. And lots of \\"Poohs\\" can't tell their heads from the hole in a honey jar, making them not cute and wise, but common, ignorant gluttons.But this is a critique of Taoism in general, not just Hoff, and certainly not Pooh. This is why Taoism was never \\"the Way\\" in China. There was a reaction, often a healthy one, to the Lao-Zhuang philosophy. It's the weakness of early Taoist philosophy -- reflected by Hoff's over-generalizations and over-simplicities -- that it did not make the difference clear. Folk Taoism ran off in one diametrically different direction -- as Hoff appears not to know, but probably does -- and Buddhists and Confucius' more proper and stuffy disciples (who often did live down to the caricature) in another. Each had its up side and its down side. Imagine Pooh singing and philosophizing cheerfully at the still-warm grave of Piglet: that's Zhuang Zi, at one point.The world would be poorer without Pooh, and much poorer without the aphorisms of Lao Zi and the stories of Zhuang Zi. They don't make a full philosophy of life, but they do make part of one; and Hoff's little book is a good, sometimes flawed and sometimes too accurate, but often fun, introduction."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I found this to be a simply delightful read.

It wasn't so much the book that caught my eye, it was more Mr. LeMay's review. His review was very well written, I will give him that, but what his apparent bashing of the book seems to be as a result of his offense he has taken to it.

But then again that's just my opinion and he is entitled to the same right to express his but people shouldn't really take him seriously. This book is wonderful for some one looking for inner peace as opposed to an attempt to liberate and widen the horizons of toddlers."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book was in excellent shape and we received it before christmas.

What makes this set so remarkable is Hoff's way of taking complex (yet at the same time, simple)tdaoist doctrines and applying them to everyday occurrances. This adheres to the tdaoist tradition of illustrating seemingly contradictory concepts through parables and examples. It is the use of Winnie, though, that makes the book entirely readable. Even if you are not familiar with the animals in the &quot;Hundred Acre Woods&quot;, you will quickly ascertain each characters place in the grand scheme of the tdao. In comparison the to the tdaoism &quot;bible&quot;, titled the _Tdao Tdeh Ching_, Hoff's work brings to light the entirety of Taoism without becoming either longwinded or overly basic. In conclusion, the _Tao of Pooh/ Te of Piglet_ is a excellent book that illustrates the Tdaoist philosophy in a humorous and whimsical sort of way. Even if you are not looking to adopt a faith, reading this book will enrich you life...."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I've been through this book a few times now. I admit that Pooh seems a good Taoist, if I remember my theology classes right. I will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time. Where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator's tone.Mr. Hoff's contrasts between Taoist and Judeo-Christian approaches to life invariably give the air of self-satisfaction one so often finds in Western converts to Eastern religion. It is this pall of smug (apologies to Trey Parker and Matt Stone) that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn.I'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation, were it not for the tone."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"It's a really great book"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Benjamin Hoff creatively explains the principles of Taoism through Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, and Christopher.

In this case, the inch represents the Internet and Rob's review is the heal in your face. His tactless and myopic tirade would make anyone of sound mind want to vomit shards of glass (especially his little jewel about kung-pao chicken, which by the way ISN'T Chinese). Way to go triumphant, two-dimensional Western ideology! When it comes to stereotyping, it definitely takes the cake.This book, by no means, tries to bash or villanize Wester culture. Hoff just calls it as he sees it, which doesn't make it romanticized rants. What this book tries to accomplish is to get the reader to acknowledge the importance of simplicity, an idea lost and distorted in our ever-growing megalomanic society. As Mies van der Rohe put it: Less is more! Hoff doesn't try to widen the schism between science and spirituality, but instead finds the middle ground in which both are dependent upon each other and ultimately complement one another. Regardless of what is and what isn't on your reading list, find some room and make time for this book. It's no Dostoevski, but I'm sure you'll find something in it that'll catch your fancy, so long as you read it with an open mind set."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"In this book, you learn some things.

It helps you understand things on a level that you could definitely (unless you are wise already, like me (har!))not normally. And another great thing (there are about 5,468)about this book is that it doesn't try to force anything on you, doesn't try to convert you to anything, etc. It't just a vault of hidden wisdom in the last place you'd expect."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Winnie the pooh has got to be the safest &quot;person&quot; to identify with that the world has to offer. Not only is pooh a taoist master, but he also embodies the healthiest Freudian super ego I have ever seen. As to the reviewer below commenting about the vinegar tasters, it sums up exactly my inability to embrace buddhism. The ideal of buddism is to be happy, but they leverage a reflex mechanism in the human brain to do it, by looking at horrors of the world, as does christianity, as does the ancient aztecs with their live human sacrafice. It does work, but Pooh is just so much more direct for those people who have the temperment for looking at the world without a filter like identifying with perceptions of suffering. Pooh is just happy because he IS happy. He doesn't need the psychological transformations offered by other religions. So I just want to give him a big hug, not for being a paradigm of anything, but for being a cute cuddly pooh bear who is always there with his childlike, taoist simplicity."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"On simplicity and wisdom and how they go hand in hand"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Almost everyone will agree that this is THE beginners book on Taoism.

Some adults may find it hard to get through the conversations with Pooh and his friends. I really enjoyed the ancient antidocts and was less enthused with the Pooh conversations.

I am sickened by the thought that people might read it and think this actually has anything to do with Taoism.After reading this book, one concludes that Taoism means being intolerant, looking down on other people and other ways of living, and judging people. Which, of course, is about as far from Taoism as one can get. Benjamin Hoff writes about what happens when you try to fit round pegs in square holes, yet this is exactly what HE does. He doesn't accept Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Tigger and Owl as they are, instead he describes Owl as \`the dried-up Western descendant of the Confucianist Dedicated Scholar' (not the only place in the book where he bashes Confucius and his followers) and \`one who studies Knowledge for the sake of Knowledge, and who keeps what he learns to himself or to his own small group, writing pompous and pretentious papers that no one else can understand, rather than working for the Enlightenment of others'. Sounds like accepting everyone as they are, doesn't it?I wanted to give this book two stars - for being another reason to re-read \`Winnie-the-Pooh' and for the few popular quotations of Eastern thinkers. However, the author's attempts to write in the simple, yet brilliant style of Milne and failing miserably really is the last straw.Therefore, instead of reading about \`Nearsighted Science' etc., just go and re-read \`Winnie-the-Pooh'. You'll understand Taoism a hundred times better by doing that (or doing nothing special at all) than by reading \`The Tao Of Pooh'."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This boxed set is a lovely excursion into the world of Pooh and the Tao.

I had that humanities class and all, but it never really sunk in while Iwas sitting in the lecture hall behind some giggling freshman. These amazingly simplebooks have taught me the secrets of life and happiness. Well, not really, but they doteach you the way to get through life without life getting to you. Better than the StressBall and less expensive than a trip to a swanky health spa, it has been helpful to me. Hoffexplains Taoism through beloved characters from the Winnie-the-Pooh stories by A.A.Milne. Yes, that's right, Pooh. I know it sounds weird, but it really works. These booksare very charming, funny, and witty. I now understand Taoist philosophy (I think), Pooh,and Piglet better. I'm sure some Eastern philosophers are annoyed (or rolling over in theirgraves) at these books, but, hey, it's the only way Americans are every gonna understandit at all!http://pilot.msu.edu/user/trescami/newage.html"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin Hoff is undoubtedly an interesting and alluring book with its method of introducing an Eastern sect of philosophy in a way that even children could understand the authors supposed ingenious way of incorporating the lovable childhood characters of A.A. Milne: Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and the others. Yet within the first few minutes of reading, I quickly realized that this is absolutely not the jovial bedtime reading to entertain the kids and enlighten the curious western layman. This book is an abhorrent misrepresentation of both its parties and is an insult to every thinking man or woman who reads this utterly contemptible book. Whatever ignoble purpose this former janitor turned professional tree trimmer turned bestseller author set out to illustrate, he failed spectacularly. As far as my intellect and critical thinking abilities can discern (abilities that the author admonishes and reprimands and rather blatantly lacks himself, this book is his justification for a life of lethargy and torpidity and is disturbingly rewarded for this pathetic biopic with forty-nine weeks on the New York Times best-seller list and is, most disgracingly of all, a required reading book for collegiate Eastern Philosophy 101 and Introduction to Comparative Religion courses.Hoff opens his quaint little book with Pooh asking an innocent question about what the author is writing as Pooh \\"...climbs on to the writing table.\\" As the author attempt to sate the reader's likely purpose for buying the book, to read a cute story with the famed anthropomorphic bear and is yet \\"sophisticated and educational.\\" Immediately upon turning the page I begin to grow wary when Pooh explains what the book is about and utters \\"...without ever accumulating any amount of intellectual knowledge or losing his simpleminded sort of happiness...\\" Albeit suspect, I am forcibly intrigued and fly through the \\"simpleminded\\" prose that is devoid of intellectual knowledge as I was forewarned. His analysis of The Vinegar Tasters is repugnant and appallingly ignorant and Hoff demonstrates his misconstrued views that will torment even those readers with the most rudimentary knowledge of the three main Eastern Religions: Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. The bias and false assertions are blatant and discredit the author about his credibility as one knowledgeable enough to write a book teaching Eastern Philosophical concepts. The art scroll is hardly definite in its interpretation and in this case it is not even apparent to my eye on which one is Lao-tse, the happiest one. At the most intrinsic level Confucianism, is the idea that humans are teachable and able to develop and are encouraged to cultivate a personal pursuit of moral perfection and a to observe humaneness. In essence, Confucianism is perfectionism treated with religious fervor or a sort of optimistic humanism. Although according to Hoff's description, the Confuscists emphasized a \\"sour,\\" pessimistic philosophy characterized by an obsessive reverence for the past and worship of their demigod Emperor who interpreted heaven's demands on their insignificant earth. He goes onto condemn the Confuscists obsessive attention for precision and accuracy. He even begins his assault on this philosophy with the opening prepositional phrase \\"Under Confucianism...\\" as if it was some oppressive archaic totalitarian fascist theocracy. His ignorance and intolerance does not stop there. His description of the Buddha is equally spiteful and even more obscene. Describing the Buddha as one whose bitter outlook on the world \\"...interrupted by the bitter wind of everyday existence.\\" One must recognizes that to encapsulate the twenty five thousand year old tranquil philosophy of Siddhartha is such a deplorable calumny that a flagrant bias cannot go without being addressed. The Buddha teaches for inner truth, peace of mind and a heightened sensitivity for compassion for humanity as part of nature. The audacity of Hoff continues as he portrays the Taoist founder Lao-tse's as a man of happy serenity; whilst this may and likely be true it bodes equally true for the Confusius and Buddha as well.Distaste for science is the hidden agenda for Hoff in his book and it lies within the beginning of the passage on page twenty-four . He is introducing Pooh to Owl in one his living metaphors. Owl is represented by Confucius and they are portrayed as the scholars whom he describes as \\"...busy ants spoiling the picnic of life, rushing back and forth to pick up the bits and pieces dropped from above...\\" In essence, scientists and their fields. He continues on and says that \\"...deeper and broader matters are beyond its limited reach...\\" His barrage of inflammatory remarks at the intellectual and academic world of scientific inquiry appear ad nauseam throughout its pages. Hoff criticizes scientists as mindless drones (or for a more savage description, I will quote directly \\"[an] incomplete and unbalanced creature...rather helpless and disorganized in his daily life.\\") who lead shallow lives with no true feeling of joy and peace. He is irrefutably wrong with this loathsome generalization as scientists and scholars are typically philosophers as their core motivation for leading these \\"dreary\\" lives is a deeply insatiable desire to understand the inner workings of our universe. Their day job may consist of the tedious workings of the \\"how's\\" but the reason they are there is for the \\"why's.\\" Hoff's pseudo-Taoism is obsessed with the \\"is\\" and is dogmatic in mission to stop questioning, which bears an uncanny resemblance to Catholic church of the 17th century instead of the wisdom of Eastern thought. Hard feelings and Hoff's own insecurities are alluded to when he makes the deplorable statement on the scientific community saying they are the ones \\"who keep what he learns to himself or to his own small group, writing pompous and pretentious papers that no one else can understand, rather than working for the enlightenment of others.\\" In the foreword, he briefly mentions how when he proposed his idea for the book to the much maligned scholars, they labeled it as preposterous. At this point the true reason for writing this book is discernible underneath his gibberish that the book is written solely to justify his own insecurities and to express utter contempt for the scholarly community that rejected him. Hoff's philosophy is one of lethargy and sheer laziness which he makes himself feel arrogantly and distressingly confident by labeling it under the guise of Taoism.His filthy misguided rhetoric is continuous throughout the entire book as each Pooh character is taken down in a horrible misrepresentation. Overall, this was one of the most appalling works I have read and is an injustice to all free thinkers and an insult to true Taoists and most inexcusable of all, the defiling of the lovable Pooh"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This is a well written, easily read book that provides and introduction and explanation of the general tenets of Tao through 5 main characters and the circumstances they are confronted with. Metaphor and real-life analysis and observation of how we live and think, and how Taoism can be applied to our perspectives and daily lives, if we want it to. Selection from the writings of Tao Te Ching, and other Taoist thinkers to the book's characters and stituations help explain the meanings for the neophyte.The significant influence of Puritanism on our past and present U.S. history is also delved into. The Puritan influence has always been with us and I am convinced it always will be.The American work week gets longer every year, according to studies, and we have less and less time for the good things in life: family, friends, introspection, personal growth, and even pursuing hobbies. We are constantly running from one place to another, both literally and figuratively, in search of--something. Fulfillment, happiness, or what have you. We try to buy it, acquire it, reach out to it.

According to him, the majority of the time we want to be efficient Rabbit or learned Owl.But is this really what we want? Or are we merely conforming to society and the prestige marked behind these characteristics?Us IB kids are stereotypically known for always being on the run- running but never knowing where we're going half the time. This is really not far from the truth. In this generation, the focus for all high-achieving high school students is usually to enter a prestigious college. But the probelm is, most of us never have any idea what we want from our lives let alone what major to decide on. This book is so relevant because it takes the time to bring up all the choices that most of us are making so lightly or beliving we have none.In The Tao of Pooh, Pooh emerges as the unlikely hero and truly the wisest of them all. It has given me a new outlook on the world and the meaning of our actions and choices.Another little bonus is a raise in optimism. =]"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Those who want to learn specifically about Taoism probably will not learn much from this book. I feel as though the author should re-title the book \\"Poohism\\". There is much more material gathered from \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" stories than from actual Taoism. I do not think that the author's views reflect those of Taoism and the author injects some negative views which sometimes detract from his presentation. Despite this problem, it is still a cool book.I have been reading this book to get insight into life. So far, it has been pretty effective. The author offered some harsh criticism of academic people, like myself. After some self-examination, I realized that most of the criticism was well deserved. Also, during conversations with others, I would actually cite examples from this book. I would say something like...\\"The Tao of Pooh says 'blah blah blah...etc', therefore you should try to make amends with your roommate\\". It has been useful to me. The irony is that this book actually predicted that I would cite things from books and offer these things to others in a pedagogical manner.

This book still possesses the positive & happy charms that delighted me long ago! I appreciate how Hoff illustrates Taoism through Winnie the Pooh anecdotes... some of the Pooh moments so heartwarmingly illustrate life's everyday beauty that I find myself getting misty w/ emotion appreciating everyday beauty. I must agree w/ previous viewers, though, in objecting to the book's portrayal of Buddhists as bitter sufferers, I subscribe to much Buddhist thought & feels this in an inaccurate & unfair portrayal. And as other reviewers mentioned, I think the book's points could have been made without insulting scientists, busy people, other religions, etc. But in the spirit of the book, I see past these aspects to take in all the good that remains.

I was intrigued by the concept that Winnie the Pooh could teach people academic concepts. It seemed like such a cute novel idea. I wasn't certain if I even took the idea seriously, but after reading the book not only have I learned about the basic concepts of Taoism, but I was taken for a joyous ride.What was amazing about this book is that it teaches you the principles of Taoism by stating full well it will not be a book of stuffy academic knowledge. Instead Pooh and his friends interrupt the book and you read about their adventures and tales that highlight some of the major concepts of Taoism. It's written in such a fluid way that the reader can not really know when the author stops talking and when the beloved characters of Piglet, Pooh, Eeyore and others take over.The book does not aim to be pretentious or horde this philosophy as the only correct philosophy. Instead, we're introduced to Taoism shown how the concepts work in all of our lives-especially Pooh and friends, and told that understanding certain jargon isn't essential to being a Taoist expert. As long as we practice the concepts and ideals we are living a Taoist lifestyle.The book is a wonderful mixture of simplicity and wisdom. The fact that Hoff is able to replicate Pooh's voice perfectly only adds to the enchanting aspect of this book. This should be a must read for anyone interested in Taoism, without being bogged down with extra information and those who want to enjoy the simple joys of life."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Recommended for everyone, a lighthearted look at the Tao and a simpler way of living through the eyes of my favorite bear.

Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"In \\"The Tao of Pooh\\", Benjamin Hoff uses the personalities of the characters in A. A. Milne's tales to illustrate Taoism alongside some competing worldviews.The characters can divided into 3 categories of personality and philosophy: Rabbit/Owl, Eeyore, and Pooh.Rabbit quickly develops and executes clever action plans that don't capture the essence of a given situation and usually go awry. Similar to Rabbit in terms of being too clever by half, Owl pontificates and analyzes and never actually does anything. Eeyore is also clever in his own way, but interprets everything negatively and is bitter and ineffectual. Whereas Pooh ambles along without the brains of the others, but with a stout heart, and muddles through to contentment.Rabbit/Owl together embody logical analysis, clever planning, and ceaseless but largely misdirected hard work. The aim of all their analysis and effort is to exert maximum control over outcomes by actively 'understanding' and intervening in every situation. In the Eastern tradition, this approach corresponds to Confucianism, a very rigid and circumscribed approach to achieving harmony. In the Western tradition, the Rabbit/Owl approach seems very familiar, as the general attempt to organize and control our physical and social environments with logical tools and techniques is integral to the Western experience. The Rabbit/Owl approach regrets the past and worries about the future.Eeyore represents knowing resignation. The aim of this hopelessness, and the ensuing lack of commitment and activity, is to shield oneself emotionally from the risk and reality of failure. In the Eastern tradition, this approach corresponds to Buddhism, which counsels that our world is illusion and suffering, and the best response is to actively disengage from it all. In the Western tradition, the Eeyore approach can be construed as loosely analogous to the easy cynicism and disengagement of the many people who are alienated by the overbearing and omnipresent Rabbit/Owl aspects of society. The Eeyore approach sees endless failure in the past and inevitable failure in the future.Pooh, on the other hand, embodies warm-hearted, inclusive, and spirited enjoyment of what's happening in the moment. He unconsciously embodies the fact that we cannot control the infinitely complex interplay of forces and events out there, so the healthiest response to this overwhelming reality is to be true to our inner nature and in so doing, accept being part of the great flow of things. In the Eastern tradition, Pooh's approach is Taoist. He does not worry about the past. He does not worry about the future. He simply is himself, now, enthusiastically. He is simply honest and true to his friends and to his own nature. To Pooh, 'things are as they are', and do not need constant worry, analysis, self-doubt, and striving, unlike the flustered Confucian-Rabbits. But at the same time, he is quite engaged in the world, unlike the fatalistic Buddhist-Eeyores. When he wants hunny, he goes about getting it, quite tenaciously at times. When he wants to help a drowning Roo or Eeyore, he rushes to save them with whatever's handy. And so on.\\"The Tao of Pooh\\" is overall a charming read. Hoff does a good job of maintaining the whimsical tone of the original Pooh tales, painlessly conveying some fairly abstruse concepts about the nature of reality and perception.To be fair, it should be noted that there's a bit of apocalyptic sermonizing at the very end, to the effect that the Owls and Rabbits of the world will destroy everything if we don't learn a better way to be. Also some readers will construe Hoff's periodic mild teasing of the Rabbit/Owl way as irritating intolerance, hypocritically un-Taoist. Personally, I do not take his teasing that way at all; Taoist hermits probably did not show much deference to the great Confucian bureaucrats of their day! To me, these are minor and forgivable blemishes in a book that otherwise has a deft, light touch, though not as light as the childlike wisdom of the Way that it hopes to explain."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book is cute, and I enjoyed many parts of it, but....He wrote the book from a western-Philisophical stand point but he gleened items from religious/folk Taoism as it suited his needs. This is not a useful approach, as I am CERTAIN that he and most all of the fans of this book would reject religous/ folk Taoism.It is not that you cannot find use in folk Taoism... but the way that he presented \\"his\\" Taoism as a *total religion* quite was misleading. Perhaps he is just hoping that the American readers will be to azy to research Taoism any further *shrug*But he made a huge mistake in presenting all things classified as \\"taoist\\" as being infalliable and all other things... not.He often criticised other religions, but, having opened up the folk-Taoist \\"can of worms\\" he opened Taoism to a scrutiny in which it would fare no better than any other doctrine (mind you that Taoism has been around for thousands of years, and it is no fault to Taoism that it has picked up \\"[stuff]\\" along the way.... however Hoff used examples that I would put in the \\"[stuff]\\" catagory).Hoff spoke of being \\"playful\\" and tried to be playful, but I found much of that to be forced, or trite in the least. There were many bitter and non-playful parts to the book as well.He \\"playfully\\" mocked and degraded 90% of the residents on planet earth in one way or the other. I actually found the book to be rather severe!In presenting it as a doctrine with a set of beliefs and folk-stories, Taoism gains the same problems as any other religion.Although he repeatedly denounces dogma, he makes a dogma of Taoism.I also didn't get to pooh/Taoism parallel except in the most superficial sense... the actual Winnie the Pooh stories include Pooh doing some quite un-Taoist things. He does have Tao-spirit though, I admit. :)"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This is a well written, easily read book that provides an introduction and explanation of the general tenets of Tao through 5 main characters and the circumstances they are confronted with. Metaphor and real-life analysis and observation of how we live and think, and how Taoism can be applied to our perspectives and daily lives, if we want it to. Selection from the writings of Tao Te Ching, and other Taoist thinkers to the books characters and stituations help explain the meanings for the neophyte.The significant influence of Puritanism on our past and present U.S. history is also delved into. The Puritan influence has always been with us and I am convinced it always will be.The American work week gets longer every year, according to studies, and we have less and less time for the good things in life: family, friends, introspection, personal growth, and even pursuing hobbies. We are constantly running from one place to another, both literally and figuratively, in search of--something. Fulfillment, happiness, or what have you. We try to buy it, acquire it, reach out to it. But it's right in front of our faces--we just have to allow ourselves to see it."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I love this book. I bought it so long ago the pages are yellowing.

The author, Benjamin Hoff, tells this story with three differnent views. It holds stories of Taoism ways, excerpts from Pooh stories by A.A. Milne and him sitting and talking to Pooh himself.My favorite parts of this book were any that included the original Pooh stories. I felt I was able to get closer to the characters. I also liked when I was able to piece together how the ways of Tao and Pooh fit. One more thing I liked was the fact that this book made me think about things in a differnt perspective.Unless you'd like to get a headache I wouldn't recommened this book to you. The game of toss between the stories will boggle your brain. It goes from classic A.A. Milne stories to Taoist lengends to the author talking with Pooh himself. If you want to learn a thing about Taoism compared to the lovable Winnie the Pooh you should read it. Overall though I would stay away from this book if possible, you might regret it."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Leave it to a Westerner to dumb-down Daoism. It can happen in the East without our help.This is a cute book and could have been a fun read if I didn't understand philosophical Daoism.Let me say that I'm glad that folks love Winnie and company. I do too. I think the characters are great but Daoism doesn't describe them or their lot.The problem with oversimplification is that it ignores and perhaps disparages, deeper values to be realized.Modern Western process philosophy has been coming around to the value of Daoism's ontology and metaphysics for years now, and to reduce these values to Winnie the Pooh is not helpful.I apologize if this offends anybody but just as we tend to make God and/or Jesus sound too much like Santa Claus, the referents are so much more than our fundamentalist beliefs of them."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The Tao of Pooh brought out many emotions from me. Most of them were argumentative and the rest were indifferent. What made me mad was that the author was too idealistic. He mentions something like we should just let things happen and they will get done. Well in my American society, things don't just happen by them selves and things don't just fall into place. It takes a lot of work to make things work and more work to make things work right. In addition, this book is very one sided. It would have been more effective if Benjamin Hoff found some way to relate Poohs Tao way of life to that of another animated character that follows, Confucianism, and/or Buddhism.Targeted Readers: People interested in philosophy, Tao way of thinking, people against and for an idealistic society."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Please, please buy 'The Way of Zen' by Allan Watts and 'The House at Pooh Corner' by A.A. Milne, rather than this book. Hoff does great injustice to both Zen and Pooh in this trivialization of the artless and the sublime. Only the kind of people who think a five-star haut cuisine meal is a rip-off because you could get more at McDonald's for the same money could possible think this a good book. Zen is not explicable (see Watts' book) and Milne (re: Pooh) is inimitible. These observations are doubly true in the case of someone, like Hoff, who has a severely restricted vocabulary, no facility with the language and a complete lack of respect for his subject matter. Please, please DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Apparently, Taoism is about lazy, bitter Westerners superficially embracing Eastern mysticism in order to boost their own egos - and then cashing in on a beloved childhood icon to make a quick buck.Hoff does a reasonable job of using actual quotations from Pooh to illustrate various simple points, but his depiction of Taoism ends up being a collection of empty mantras that have no relationship to real life, where people frequently have both aspirations and problems. Do you want to work towards a career where you can make a difference for people? Hoff's answer is \\"don't strive - just be\\". Upset about global inequality and mass starvation? \\"Cottlestone Pie\\".Hoff blatantly misreads Pooh to tell us that knowledge and science bring nothing but trouble - as he puts it, discovering things only leads to more questions, so what's the point? He even rants against jogging and tennis. Better to remain ignorant and immobile - although complaining bitterly seems to be an acceptable activity."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I don't know if it's a flaw in Taoism or in Hoff's logic, but he preaches the importance of appreciating things as they are and not struggling against them, while ignoring the fact that the nature of humanity is to change things. Humans struggle to become (or at least appear) other than what they are, and this involves changing the self and the things around oneself. Hoff foolishly ignores this and reduces humanity to the level of fish that are trying in vain to whistle."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"While I'll concede that this book gives a nifty introduction to the tenets of Taoism by means of the extended Pooh analogy, the manner in which the author achieves this is downright dogmatic. You can't read a full page without him openly denouncing other belief systems, and his overly contemptuous attitude towards intellectualism is alarming. He portrays anybody who values the beauty of complexity or academics as a close-minded, arrogant bookworm, and grossly misrepresents the followers of various religions/faiths. Hoff definitely borders on the fanatical here, using far-reaching comparisons to make his offensive points, many of which don't even align with the true characteristics of Taoism. Jumping to conclusions and articulating uneducated descriptions regarding many aspects of contemporary culture and scholarship, I'm certain that Hoff has Lao Tzu turning over in his grave at his downright hateful quasi-environmentalist commentary. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"To see the behavior and mindset of Winnie the Pooh as representative of the Great Way is one thing; \\"just as he is,\\" as one might say, even though as a fictional character Pooh is a secondary representation of sentient being-in-reality. That is to say, he exists only in our imagination as a construction of language but does not exist in the real world. He is an illusion; yet he can serve as an imagined role model of sentience, perhaps even of enlightenment if we choose to dream him as such.But one should not confuse unenlightened ignorance with the sentience of non-duality no matter how childlike Pooh appears in his textual innocence. In fact, the very comparison jumps the track from The Tao into the trap of duality just as we all do here. I suppose we can excuse Benjamin Hoff as being \\"a finger pointing at the moon\\" despite that this allegorical attempt never gets the honey jar off its nose.In the initial chapters, Hoff's treatment of science lacks a clear understanding of how capable many scientists are of simply observing natural phenomena, sometimes even in a Taoist or Zen Buddhist way. Einstein even described Buddhism, related to Taoism, as the perfect way of the scientist. Hoff was in his early 30s when he wrote this book and I wonder what he would say about science now that he is in his 50s with more maturity and skilled practice in the true art of living simply and \\"polishing the mirror\\" of his mind. In fact, any cognitive therapist or self-explored practitioner of meditation, whether Taoist or otherwise, can easily recognize the fallacies of \\"gross generalization\\" and \\"minimization\\" that he dualistically applies while erroneously committing science to the pejorative categories he falsely constructs somewhere in his own fogged mirror. As a practitioner of Zen, I found this ironic -- that he criticized science and scientists alike -- in fact he seemed to criticize all scholars and/or \\"thinkers\\" -- for being uselessly enthralled to their own narrowly labeled \\"categories\\" when in fact he was committing the very same egregiously unenlightened thinking errors with his own projected, biased, dualistic and overly simplistic categories.This is not to say that the scientist never misses the forest for the trees -- which seemed to be his point. But in making it, he appeared in denial of the trees while condescendingly instructing the learned on the forest -- a mistake made by many a novice in the art of becoming effectively and truely aware.At first I suspected he, like so many others, was unwittingly revealing himself a phony -- a tree trimmer by trade who seemed unconsciously jealous of scientists for their degrees, \\"knowledge\\" and learning. Certainly Emanuel Kant would be laughing his ass off. Of Kant's five recognized epistemological methods for knowing truth -- Tenacity, Authority, Experience, Reason and Science -- the young Benjamin Hoff seems to have fallen into the traps of the lower levels of \\"knowing\\" -- Tenacity, Authority and (unfortunately, unenlightened) Experience -- without recognizing that each of the five should be integrated, each supporting the others, and used as *tools* in coming to \\"Right Thinking\\" in the Great Universal \\"Way.\\"Poor Pooh! He is mistaken for one of the Holy Ones, a person of compassion and wisdom, a sentient being given to countless ways of loving kindness, a Bodhisattva, when in fact, if Pooh were real, he is being exploited and abused in the allegory crammed cerebral cortex of Been-Jamin' Hoff in Taoist drag.This book is for beginners written by a beginner. Watch out for traps! Old Lao-tzu should have slapped this student with his staff right into the river alongside Eyore.....\\"just as he is.\\""},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I actually thought this was going to be a good book, but came away feeling depressed at how pitiful an attempt this was to describe an eastern philosophy. No doubt, the book has sold purely on its hook of having the famous little bear, Pooh, on it's cover. Nevertheless, the only handful of passages that made the whole endeavor worthwhile in this little waste of time came from other passages taken out of REAL books such as Tae Te Ching. Otherwise, the author here is one of those hippie types who, by his own admission, likes to lay about on the floor. Must be nice while the rest of us go to work to earn money to buy cute little books with Winnie the Pooh on the cover.Whatever."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The author of this book mentions early that it would be very hard to combine the teachings of the Tao with Winnie the Pooh. He said that his colleges said it was crazy and too dificult. Well, it was. Winnie the Pooh plays no role in this book besides mentioning several times how much honey he likes. So the author continues to explain the signifance of Tao and in between injects a pooh who is looking for honey or has some irrelevant conversation with Piglet. In conclusion, if you want to find out about Taoism, don't read this book."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Sometimes just for kicks I enjoy reading the extremes of what people have to say about books I've read. I usually look at the 5 stars then proceed to read the 1 stars. I just found it very odd that one of my favorite books was criticized the way it was. I'm not saying its bad to complain, lots of people do, Taoism as well as many other concepts came to be because of disagreements over how things were being perceived and managed; for if people were truly truly accepting and agreed with everything, then Lao Tse would never have had the desire to teach us.The most basic complaint is how Mr. Hoff butchered the views of Taoism by criticizing western philosophy; which is strongly and firmly dependent on capitalism, personal gain, and over stimulation. What is ironic is how Taoism was born in the very similar society that shared those common views. Another ironic twist is in the actual commenting of all the negatives in this book. Mr. Hoff describes that there are many people who ONLY LOOK AT THE NEGATIVES (eeyore-complex), while never appreciating the positives of what they are. All fundamental principles of Tao has been carved into this book with examples taken and provided by famous scholars in this book.The other ironic thing I found can be traced to an example within the \\"Te of Piglet.\\" There is mention of how a man had something stolen from him, he sees a boy who looks and talks exactly like a thief, so he assumes it was the boy. The man found that stolen item and the next day he sees the same boy who looks and talks exactly like a boy; while in neither of those days the actions of the boy changed. In comparison, the book has been read by countless of people with pooh-like and piglet-like positivity, and yet, this same book (with no changes in the words mind you) was read by people with negativity having a tigger-like personality of expecting too much and not getting what they wanted.Apparently, people love nit-picking. \\"I like SOME concepts of Taoism\\" \\"I agree with SOME parts of the book\\". I just feel the some of the comments were lies. \\"I like Tao, I like Pooh.. but this book destroyed it.\\" Well, I like Tao, I like Pooh, and I think this book enables it.The main emphasis is that we DON'T live in a Taoist-like society because we ignore all the good things about what Tao can teach us. He mentioned in the very end of Tao of Pooh, \\"within each of us there is an Owl, a Rabbit, and Eeyore, and a Pooh. For too long we have chosen the way of Owl and Rabbit. Now, like Eeyore, we complain about the results. But that accomplishes nothing. If we are smart, we will choose the way of Pooh. As if from far away, it calls to us from the voice of a child's mind.\\" But of course the people who bash this book will never read that far, because their inner owls and inner rabbits are impatiently looking and focusing on the downsides of a book that was made to show how Taoism can cope with the negativity that can surround most of us.As a side note, I don't feel it was Mr. Hoff's intention to make fun of any of the characters. He used the characters as symbols to help explain the principles of Tao by over exaggerating their personalities. Eeyore doesn't really think everyone is dumb, nor does he down grade anyone but himself; yet there are people out there who do. Rabbit is not someone who is ignorant about facts and is impatient as he is perceived in the Winnie the Pooh books, but in this, he is a symbol for the people out there who are. Like-wise for owl and everyone else.All I'm saying is that we generally focus on the most unimportant parts in society, even if they are important to us, it is okay to accept it. But sometimes we have to breathe in, stop doing what we are doing once in a while, and flow like a pebble in an ocean. If you can't come to terms with that from reading the first chapter of this book, then Taoism is not for you."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"If you want to share the fundamental experience of the Tao, Winnie the Pooh lives it."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book is based around the idea that A.

While that text features the famous disclaimer, that it offers little insight to traditional Zen practice, it will no more help you grasp the mechanics of Motorbikes. Similar points have been made by my spiritual advisors over here in Japan about this book, but what the hey?This is one of those rare books that make you see the world in a different way (and how many of those have you read since you were nine?), if it inspires people to gain a little more insight into the Dao, the Way, then so much the better. But at the very least, it will make you treat people in a different, more thoughtful way.

Nothing to do is not what it seems. This quiet, open space is the place to find that bear of small brain but big heart. As the fox says in The Little Prince, \\"Here is my secret, a very simple secret. It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eyes.\\" Winnie the Pooh, as interpreted by Benjamin Hoff, would agree that the Tao (way) can only be found in what Yeats calls the \\"deep heart's core.\\"As children we all started with a good heart, but somewhere along the way we became confused with too much to do and too little time. But the heart knows that we have all the time there is in the eternal present. We need to discover, as ee cummings says, how \\"To be nobody but 'ourself' in a world that is night and day trying to make 'us' just like everybody else.\\" Nothing to do will give us a chance find ourself and to experience with this discovery the \\"peace which passes all undertanding.\\"Our first tendency will be to begin thinking of the right answer, like owl, or to start immediately doing something, like rabbit. We need to turn off the thinking and doing machine, which is the foundation of our Western Culture, and instead, practice leaving things alone, that is doing nothing, as Lao-tse would recommend in The Tao Te Ching, tne basis for Hoff's The Tao of Pooh.In Hermann Hesse's great little book, Siddhartha, only at the end of his life, sitting by the river, doing nothing but listening quietly to the river flowing by him as he sat on the grass, did Siddharth finally attain enlightenment and an understanding of himself and his place in the world.On our own vacation on a warm summer's day with the Tao of Pooh in hand, perhaps we will begin to listen quietly to \\"the sound of lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore\\" as we discover what is in our deep heart's core."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The one message I got from this book was, basically, &quot;anyone can be a taoist if they're stupid&quot;, a message which would grate on the nerves of many intelligent people studying Taoism - and any other philosophical/religous movements. The author seems to take pride in stating - through the character of Pooh - &quot;I am not very clever, ergo I'm a lot closer to the uncarved block than you are&quot;. Spare us! There's a difference between &quot;not being interested in knowledge&quot; and &quot;being stupid&quot;. This book appears not to know the difference.For someone who knows nothing of Taoism, there may be some interesting thoughts in here, but I fear it may leave them with the impression that the only prerequisite for being a taoist is being fick."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I will echo some other sentiments that at first this book was quite entertaining, and I blazed a trail through the first 50 pages. Then, I put the book down. This book basically is a walking hypocrisy. Let me give some examples:The author calls science meaningless by implying it brings no \\"real\\" understanding to the world and that technical terms are invented to hide our lack of \\"real\\" knowledge. Yet, if you were to visit the author's website, then you'd see an entire section dedicated to his love of high-performance automobiles. He freely uses terms like engineered along with technical jargon that I doubt he understand completely to describe his passion. A little hypocritical to write a book bashing people who are scholars only to have a passion for automobile technology, don't you think? To bash people for not understanding every single detail and saying that studies using an electron microscope will get us nowhere when you have a love for objects created by intense research in materials science? Where does he think technology comes from? A little materialistic, too, no?Second, it's bizarre to me that he bashes science for having technical terminology and \\"Abstract Philosophers\\" for \\"...coming up with meaningless answers,\\" when his solution is to \\"recognize Inner Nature\\" and work with \\"Things as They Are\\". Talk about painting with broad brushstrokes. It reminds me of Deepak Chopra saying, \\"Consciousness is a superposition of states.\\" I know what each of those words is supposed to mean, but together it's a bunch of gobblety-gook. Hoff is essentially saying: ignore people who use technical terms and abstract ideas to pass as knowledgeable, what you need to do is find your Inner Nature, that'll do it. What?Lastly, he criticizes book-based learning quite often, emphasizing direct experience. Yet, his entire life is based on writing and photography. Why would you partake in industries that are the antithesis of direct experience? He makes money off of books and photographs, yet openly says that it'd be better to learn from experience directly. Seems like a sellout. Does Taoism say anything about selling out?To take a page from Holden Caufield, I think this man is a phony, a big fat phony. I can understand having a different point of view - if the guy lived like a hermit or some such, then that's respectable. If he were a hermit, I'd say: He walks the talk. This man doesn't. He bashes things that he deliberately uses, enjoys, and profits from consistently throughout The Tao of Pooh. Would you listen to a preacher who doesn't pray? If not, I probably wouldn't take too much of what's in these pages seriously."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I love this book! I have read it 3 times already.

I tend to recommend this to anyone I can!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I was introduced to this book a couple of years ago - had seen it on the shelf of the bookstore for years, thought about buying it and never did... and then I received it as a gift.Without question, it's one of the best books I've read. It's not for its literary flow, academic presentation, entertaining style, or subject matter that I love this little book. I love it because it's a calm, smooth blend of all of the above.The book does an outstanding job of presenting and explaining the basic tenets of Taoism. I laughed out loud several times over the experiences of poor Eeyore (oh, how I can relate!). If you'd like a quick dissertation of different philosophical views and personality styles, The Tao of Pooh does so through the showcasing of Pooh and his friends.I'm not sure who Mr. Hoff's target audience was, but this is a book for young and old alike... all will gain something from reading through the book.In fact, Mr. Hoff penned this book so well it stirred my desires to read once again Milne's classic title The Adventures of Pooh with a new light and perception.This is an excellent title to add to your permanent library, whether you embrace Taoism or not. Its message of peace and tolerance is one that all faiths can understand and embrace - and well they should.Can't recommend this one highly enough."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"A nice introduction to eastern philosophy and a good read for those seeking wisdom.

Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"When we were covering Taoism in my World Religions class, I suddenly recalled the Tao of Pooh book my sister-in-law gave me the year I planned to end it all, back in 1995/96. I read it once, was comforted by it, and forgot it all. Years later, after reading Taoism, I instantly felt a light bulb flash in my head... &quot;Oh, so that's what it's all about!&quot; This cute book combines the Taoist philosophy in conjunction with Pooh's interractions with his friends, with Christopher Robin being the kind but serious teacher who tries to teach Pooh about what he represents--Taoism.In contrasting Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, Confucius is described as a sour-faced man, Buddha as one with a bitter expression, but Lao-Tse being the smiling one. Basically, the laws that govern the heavens are the same one that govern earth and man, and that if we go with the flow, we'll be in harmony.The concepts of wu-wei is also explained. Wu-wei means &quot;not doing&quot; but of doing nothing against the natural flow. Here, it's called the Pooh Way, because Pooh has a &quot;mind that merely sees what's in front of it, and follows the nature of things.&quot; In other words, put the round peg in the round hole, the square peg in the square one.The characters who make up Pooh's friends demonstrate the flaw of knowledge and cleverness, and I was fascinated and sobered by this because their personalities reflect me, and I realize the bad side in knowing too much.Dig this: Owl, the modern equivalent of a Confusionist, Dessicated Scholar, is described as someone who gains Knowledge for Knowledge's sake, or for the sake of appearing wise. A bit harsh because that's me to some extent. Rabbit is described as someone who gains Knowledge for the sake of appearing Clever, and I had to wince, because to my shame, I fully admit that's also me to some extent. And Eeyore is someone who gains Knowledge for the sake of Complaining. Given my political stance, yes, me too again. And as Pooh says in response to Owl having a brain, &quot;I suppose that that's why he never understands anything.&quot; Maybe that's my problem too.But Pooh, the lucky bear, may not have much of a brain, but he embodies the Simplicity of the Uncarved Block, the Taoist equivalent of John Locke's tabula rasa (blank slate). Basically, Pooh can't describe the Uncarved Block, he just IS it. &quot;That's the nature of the Uncarved Block.&quot;And he's got the right idea in not being a Bisy Backson, or (Busy Back Soon), you know, rush-rush-rush. I wonder why we don't have an American equivalent of a French sidewalk cafe or Chinese teahouse. Now that I'm getting on, maybe I value the message of &quot;You're important. Relax and enjoy yourself.&quot;A cute book on the explanations of Taoism, and how maybe simplicity, wisdom (as opposed to knowledge) and contentment is the best way to go. But it makes me wish that I was a tabula rasa or an Uncarved Block once again. Oh, just to be, not to know or be clever, but just to be."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"People. It is a beautiful spring day today. The sun is shining, a warm breeze is caressing, the clouds are puffy cotton, the squirrels are scurrying and the birds are chirping. (Which is o.k. as long as they don't fly overhead!). Your Metamorpho decided to take his pen and pad to the ol' babbling brook to get into the reflective mood to write this next review. I sat down against an old oak tree and started to write. However, it was so peaceful I started to doze off. In the middle of envisioning Sondra the Seerest doing her latest belly dance, I felt a furry hand tugging at my white linen cuff.\\"Wake up Mr. Metamorpho, wake up!\\" a voice said. I blinked my eyes open to find Pooh there, face full of honey.\\"Oh it's you Pooh,\\" I said with surprise. \\"Funny you should be here. I was just going to write about you.\\"\\"You were?\\" he said with eyes wide open. \\"Why?\\"\\"Well, because I'm here writing a review of Benjamin Hoff's book called 'The Tao of Pooh', which is about you.\\"\\"It is?\\" he asked. \\"Wow!\\"\\"No, Tao Pooh\\", I corrected.\\"What is Tao Mr. Metamorpho?\\" he asked with a puzzled look.\\"Well, I think it is one of the great teachings of China. A philosopy of sorts. Mr. Hoff equates this with how you are. An uncarved block, as he puts it.\\"\\"He thinks I'm a blockhead?\\" Pooh said, as a lone tear started to form.\\"No no Pooh. Even though you are a bear of simple brain, Mr. Hoff explains that you are not stupid, but representative of the simplicity one needs to lead a calm and natural life. Go with the flow, if you will.\\"\\"That sounds better,\\" he smiled.\\"Sure does. The concept of Tao is very interesting, but, essentially the belief is that there is constant evolution in the world. In other words, there is a natural balance in nature and the universe. It is the concept that total harmony will be achieved by letting things be, to run their own course, if you will.\\"\\"I ran a course once, along with Kanga and Roo,\\" he said smiling.\\"Well, it's not exactly like that,\\" I said. \\"You see Pooh, he believes in yin and yang. Two energies that, although opposite, are complimentary and needed for harmony. This applies to many facets of life.\\"\\"Maybe I should ask owl,\\" he said.\\"Well, you could,\\" I said. \\"But he makes a distinction here between knowledge and true wisdom. The answers don't lie in a book per se, they just are, within yourself, if you are aware of the interconnectivity of all things in the universe.\\"\\"You mean I am?\\" he said with surprise.\\"Mr. Hoff seems to thinks so. And I wouldn't apply this to any of your friends. Rabbit never slows himself down long enough to recognize the simple pleasures of life,\\" I said. \\"Eeyore, well, you know Eeyore, he brays over things he can't control. And Piglet, although very small, is uncertain and afraid to take action.\\"\\"I'm hungry. Do you have a jar of honey with you?\\" he asked.\\"No, but I have this,\\" and I handed him a honey graham cracker. \\"There is much more to this philosophy, but the main thing is that the only constant in the universe is change. If you war against it you will only produce unnatural and artificial results, which could produce much unhappiness because it goes against the natural rythmn and flow of life.\\"\\"I don't think I am unhappy Mr. Metamorpho,\\" he said.\\"No Pooh, you aren't,\\" I smiled. \\"You are a living, breathing, stuffed example of Tao.\\"\\"Well, Mr. Metamorpho, I'm not stuffed yet. No honey, huh?\\"\\"No, Pooh. But, I have no doubt that you will find it. Tao provides beary nice things for those who follow the path.\\"\\"Thanks Mr. Metamorpho. Speaking of path, I should go find Christopher Robin. He should be home about now,\\" he said and then sauntered off.And people, if you have read this so far, you will know I will take full advantage of the deus ex machina (a popular method in Greece) to tell you that when I woke up, I remembered this meeting word for word, and wrote it here for your amazement.

I was disappointed, however, when the book began heavily criticizing other philosophies, specifically those personified by Rabbit, Eeyore, and Owl. I don't see Taoism as being that intolerant, or unable to see the wisdom and logic of other theories. I think this would have been a much better book if it had focused on what Taoism *is,* instead of what it is *not.*"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I was recently introduced to taoism through the music of John Cage. The book is written as if for a child, but the terminology and philosophy put forth is far to introspective and mature for young children to handle. It is a gentle lesson on life and priority management. The author explains taoist beliefs though a conversation with Pooh and Piglet and the rest of them, as well as through short stories about their adventures. The book comes across astonishingly light for such seemingly serious subject matter. Large text and simple illustrations only add to the book's levity, but at the end, you're left feeling peaceful and refreshed. &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; is ripe for repeat readings, whenever you feel like you need to relax. While Eeeore frets...and Piglet hesitates...and Rabbit calculates...and owl pontificates...Pooh just is."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"It's all so simple when you reduce it to the level of Pooh.It's often hard to understand the nuances of religions and philosophies other than one's own. For many people, the beliefs and rituals of faraway lands -- or even of the folks next door -- are a jumble of mixed-up oddities. But understanding a people's system of faith is vital to understanding the people.In the case of the Eastern philosophy known as Taoism, Winnie the Pooh is here to help.\\"The Tao of Pooh\\" boils the Taoist faith down into simple truths, each using Pooh and his friends to explain them in easy, bite-sized pieces. Some of the examples are original to author Benjamin Hoff's book, while others are lifted directly from the original text by A.A. Milne.Passages from \\"The House at Pooh Corner\\" blend surprisingly well with the tenets of Chinese philosophy, including religious maxims and excerpts from the writings of Chuang-tse. The result is a charming explanation of faith that even Pooh -- a notorious bear of little Brain -- can understand, particularly since he exemplifies the Taoist way so perfectly.Those around him -- Owl, Rabbit, Eeyore, Tigger and of course Piglet -- are less serene in their activities in the Hundred Acre Wood. Hoff handily explains why they do not fit the Taoist mold, and how Pooh would have handled similar situations. As he explains on the back cover of the book, \\"While Eeyore frets, and Piglet hesitates, and Rabbit calculates, and Owl pontificates, Pooh just is.\\" There, a lesson learned and you haven't even opened it yet. You'll learn more when Hoff explains the Taoist concept of P'u, the Uncarved Block, and the many facets of Cottleston Pie.At the same time, Hoff avoids diminishing his message by dumbing it down. While much of the slim book is written in the childlike prose of a Pooh story, it is still surprisingly deep, thought-provoking and grown-up at its root. By book's end, readers should have a fairly solid understanding of basic Taoist principles and how they relate to contemporary life."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Benjamin Hoff has taken an intricate and complex philosophy and distilled it to its essence in the delightful Tao of Pooh. This is much easier to read and understand than the I Ching (Book of Changes) or the Tao ti Ching (Book of the Way.) With Pooh as your guide, Hoff clearly articulates the lessons and tenets of the Tao (&quot;the Way&quot;).Taoism, a Chinese peasant religion and philosophy, was founded by Lao Tzu in the 5th century BC. Essentially it urges its followers not to resist the natural ebb and flow of life - after all, nature will always win, so why waste the energy? Hoff, using Pooh and the other characters of the Hundred Acre Wood, illustrate how &quot;the Way&quot; is practiced in day-to-day situations.Yet there is more to this wonderful little book than an elucidation of Taoism in practice. Hoff takes neither himself or his subject too seriously, often times having &quot;conversations&quot; with Pooh who, in his almost child-like simplicity, both emphasizes and embodies living &quot;the Way&quot;.This is no children's book - but it is fun to read for its message, its messenger and its content. I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"I was holed up in a hospital bed when I recieved this book. A friend thought that I was wallowing in self pity and wanted me to get a grip so this is what she brought me. The Tao of Pooh incorporates the teachings of Taoism and the great Lao Tzu who believed that people should be able to look at things and appreciated the beauty of its being and note the positives. Pooh bear and his friends make light of the Tao teachings by explaining simplicity, happiness, relaxation, and just not worrying or being overly concerned about trivial matters. Pooh is the perfect creature to explain this because he is just a simple bear who is laid back and gentle. Pooh does not worry about matters but just lets life flow and is grateful for his honey and his friends. Taoism reflects on the way to an understanding of concious simplicity and peace. Its a way to joy and mindfulness which is the ultimate keys to living well. This book is such a nice read since it includes picture of the characters to highlight points, and its narrator explains things simply since after all its the child like pooh who is the student. It really eased my mind and I have since tried to use some of these teachings in my life."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Seems like a contradiction right? So are some parts of Hoff's book. I must note that other reviewers have pointed this out. Hoff explains, quite clearly (thankfully) that one of the tenets of Taoism is to accept things precisely as they are...and then, as another reviewer says, he doesn't accept the other Pooh characters for what they are, instead disparaging them for not having the simplicity of Pooh.Ultimately, as one who is uninitiated into Taoist philosophy, I would suggest this book if for no other reason than to acquaint oneself with its basic philosophies, which Hoff does explain clearly. One warning is that, sometimes his forays into conversation w/Pooh, and his story anecdotes are less than clear, and he assumes the reader immediately understood. Sometimes I felt going off into the world of Pooh was unneeded at a certain point, though at other points it was valid and well-constructed. Additionally, I would read this book as though walking onto a floor w/a \\"Careful\\" sign on it...this book is unnecessarily judgmental of others, and I feel that by feeling that way about others, one avoids the nothingness and simplicity Hoff says the Taoist seeks. Judging others adds confusion to life, the very same confusion Hoff wants us to avoid by being as simple as Pooh. So I say: read this book, and use it as a spur to further readings in Taoism if it interests you, but don't take it as a textbook of Taoist thought. Many of Hoff's explanations are good, and the quotes from actual Taoists and other Chinese thinkers are excellent, but do not take the judgmental road implied by this book.I think it's worth noting that on the back of the book, where the genre is usually listed in small print near the ISBN, The Tao of Pooh is listed as a humor book. So read this book w/that in mind. It is a good intro to Taoism, but ultimately, it is not a book of Taoist philosophy, and is more like a book of metaphysics that utilizes Taoism. It is worth mentioning that several Taoist ideas (about the harmony of the heavens and earth) are not strictly Taoist, which to me says, not that the Taoists were not unique, but that they have hit on some sort of truth. Hoff's book can help the average person in their daily life, through the basics of Tao. Hoff's book will not make one a true follower of Taoism, in my opinion. However, for most, the former is enough, and the latter is unimportant, and that is fine. This book operates both as a good pique of the imagination leading to further studies into Taoism, or as simply a book which reminds us of the beauty in the simplicity of life...all in the unassuming world of Winnie-the Pooh. So for that, the book has merit, even if its unnecessary judgmental nature is obnoxious.3.75 stars"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"great book.

The book is well written and I feel that by using our favorite characters, whom many of us have loved and grown up with; together with their own characteriatics, makes the principles easy to understand and shows the way to how we can implement what is being taught.I believe, we can all see ourselves in one or more of the characters and although some may not be happy to see ourselves mirrored in such a way, that too is part of our growth as well; and what I believe the book is trying to teach us. We can all become \\"Pooh like\\". To find our way, to become quiet and still and to become more child like in our outlook of life.

There's a lot more to it than that! :)Actually, in this particular case, the Taoist thoughts and ideas that are presented have very little to do with religion and very much to do with how to live a Nice Easygoing Life. Taoism, you see, is at once a religion, a philosophy, a set of folk tales, and also just kind of a guide for living from day to day in a manner that lets you &quot;go with the flow&quot;.So whether you're a Christian, Muslim, Jew, Buddhist, Hindu, animist, or whatever else, this book isn't going to be heresy. It's not going to get you excommunicated and it's not even going to challenge your faith. What it *will* probably do is make you stop, think, and say to yourself &quot;hey, a Little Smackerel of something Tasty would be nice, and flowing through life would be a lot easier if I were like a stream flowing around a rock.&quot;For me, I found it actually helped to renew and refresh my faith in God.

I recommend this book to all lovers of the Tao."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Went right to the \\"marketplace\\" for this purchase.Great Seller Fast Shipping, Perfect as Described.Thanks!!!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This one of my favorite books and came in record time! I would order it this way every time. David"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"(Note, this review discusses only the first book.)The idea of the book is to explain Taoist principles by using characters, setting and events from \\"Winnie the Pooh.\\" My first problem with the book is the intended audience is unclear, because a child is not serious and deep enough to understand such deep sayings and I felt bit awkward thinking about Disney Company's, for lack of a better term \\"cash cow\\" in my early teen years. However, in all honesty, I am horrible example for my age group because I am an easily disoriented person. Despite all I just said, for what it tries to do, it does a good job. Case and point, I now understand Taoist beliefs. Despite what I am about to say, you have to respect anything that does a good job, but it seems to have a few value a judgments I don't agree with.A picture called \\"The Three Vinegar Tasters\\" is supposed to represent three similar belief sets (Buddhism, Confucius and Taoist) attitudes towards life (according to the author). It seems immoral to have other teachings unhappy (tasting the vinegar symbolizing life as bitter and sour.) I personally think Hoff and the artist of \\"The Three Vinegar Tasters\\" misunderstood the first of the Buddhist noble truths. They see Buddha as a bitter person. I think what Siddhartha meant when said \\"life is suffering\\" was life is full of suffering and you can't always get what you want, which similar to message I got from the book and the Tao te Ching which is \\"things are the way they are.\\" And I am not the only one who thinks the first noble truth is being misunderstood. A Buddhist practitioner I interviewed for a school project thinks so too. Thus, I think it would wrong to call Siddhartha \\"bitter\\" since both Taoists and Buddhists principles give me the same general message. Also, it seems a bit inhumane to criticize a person, rather than their teachings, who was born sixth centuries before current era, since the connotations of the word \\"bitter\\" characterize Siddhartha in a negative way. Though, in all honesty, I'm probably not the best source in the world, since I was only studying Buddhism for a month and I have no knowledge of Taoism other then the book and the Tao Te Ching.Throughout the book, I kept on wondering what does the author have against \\"book smart\\" scholars. For example, saying that they are smart to the point of uselessness and not noticing what matters. Another part he said when scientists say \\"instinct\\" it means \\"they don't know,\\" which is not true in the slightest. Instinct is what we are naturally programmed to do because we didn't have instinct, we would be dead. Hoff goes on to say that it doesn't matter that we don't know and goes on to explain a principle. I do not want to spoil the book nor misrepresent it, so I will let it go at that.The way Hoff explains Taoism through Winnie the Pooh is by having himself talk about the principles with Winnie the Pooh characters and having them represent different life styles. For the most part it works, but the way he has inserted himself into the stories it seems egotistical because he is using an entertainment goldmine. Overall, the book is good, the only reason I bad mouthed it is that if I only talked about the good parts, I would have nothing to talk about and I'm a critic."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Excellent choice! Book was a gift to my teenage son. Prompted many a philosophical discussion!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Simply put, this book is excellent. It is simple and concise, and it keeps you reading. I also think it does a great job giving you the basics of Taoist thought."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"It is true that Hoff seems to display a certain \\"dislike\\" or \\"bias\\" against things that go against his vision of the Tao, but overall, this is a wonderful, enjoyable book that gets across in a rather easy and simple manner some ideas central to Taoism, especially when it uses quotes from the Tao Te Ching in explaining Pooh's actions.In fact, I have used several quotes from the book in a compilation of useful Taoist guides towards the right Path:Simple Tao:http://www.blueboard.com/tao/"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"When I first heard about this book, I thought the guy who told me about it was being funny. He said that a book on Taoism, explained via Winnie the Pooh had changed his life. I laughed, but decided to get it anyways.This book turned out to be way better than I had imagined. In a way it seems contrary to common sense, but in all the best ways. It challenged me to re-think how I thought of myself and life.The more I read about Taoism, the more impressed I get with anyone who is able to explain it in an intelligible form. Benjamin Hoff did an amazing job, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone. So much so that I have already bought 3 books for family and friends already.The best description I have seen of Taosim so far, and all with a cuddly little teddy bear... Um...

The ants were sealed inside and were starting to eat the book."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"When I was at school, we were made to read a book called \\"The Dark is Rising\\". I thought that was the worst book I'd ever read, and it held it's title for a long time (I'm 27 now) - but compared to the Tao of Pooh it shines like a glimmering beacon of success in the puss filled mire of Hoff's seemingly limitless inadequacy as a writer.Unfortunately, Amazon.com won't allow me to put less than one star, but given the choice I'd rate this book in minus figures.What I'm going to suggest though, is that if you are an intelligent person, please do read this book so that you may contribute along with me in diminishing the completely unjustified acclaim it holds.At the end of this book, I understand very little about Taoism, as I would hope that it is vastly more interesting and holds less prejudice and small-mindedness as Hoff suggests. If anything, the book is far more representational of facist and racist views. To suggest that knowledgeable people, or people who strive to gain knowledge are stupid in their quest, is quite frankly ludicrous.The book is basically saying, if you're thick and stupid and have limited room for thought, if you only look for simple things because you're too incompetent to strive to achieve, then you'll be happy. Sorry, not convinced. Are there people who agree with me here, or am I unique, [...] - thanks!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Hurrah for Western Civilization, the predominant culture-set on the planet!Benjamin Hoff allows his Neo-Luddite hate speech to infiltrate his otherwise half-witted diatribe against academia, work, and progress. (How is it that most &quot;progressives&quot; I've met feel a need to romanticize about a *past* that never existed?) While saying that conservatives, scholars, and people who *do* rather than pontificate, are WRONG, this joker talks about the gentle Chinese and all their contributions to society.How can one, logically, bemoan the fate of Tibet while praising the Chinese for their cultural sensitivity? How can one, logically, complain about the ecology in the US in contrast to China (Maybe Chinese industrial waste is just culturally superior to ours?). We have protesters here in the US. We just don't run them over with military hardware. Those culturally sensitive Chinese are just GREAT!This is not to say that the Chinese are bad. How can a civilization that brought us Kung Pao Chicken be all *that* bad? Let us, however, be fair. Eastern Civilizations have been every bit as cruel as Western ones. Hoff would do well to learn that, worldwide, people have been miserable t@rds to each other for ages. He complains about a culture that allows dissent; I suspect that this disdain stays with him all the way to the bank. If he were to be critical *of* China *in* China, he may well find that his royalty checks would be found under &quot;Contraband Property&quot; and that *he* would be found under a tank.If you want to find out about Taoism read a book on Taoism. If you want to read frantic rants about Western culture, Hoff's books may be for you."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Winnie the Pooh is too stupid to be stressed out. He is obviously fry-brained from doing massive quantities of drugs in the 60's, which the author neglects to mention. So if you want to be like Pooh, smoke up.

So I did and am very glad.It's very very funny with a lot of insights and wisdom. It carried on the same sense of humor of the original author of Winnie the Pooh, A. A. Milne.It might be better if you read Winnie the Pooh before starting with this book so that you have an overall idea and get the sense of the style, the unique characters, and the humor in the original story.

If you are the kind of person who goes gung-ho into something, you shouldn't read this book, because it is only half the truth. But if you have a good balance with the other half, this is a great book to help you relax your mind and free yourself from counterproductive struggling against the way things are.The Taoist philosophers were not, in general, very successful people. Taoism tells us a lot about being content, and tells us nothing about accomplishing goals. Both skills are important.I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on what works and what doesn't. The perspectives Hoff presents in this very readable little book are, without a doubt, highly effective in producing contentment and relaxation. The skill of taking those perspectives when you need to is a valuable skill. This book can help show the way. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"This book became popular not only because of Pooh or Tao, but because of the explaination of the \\"3 Vinegar Tasters\\" scroll painting in the book. Before this book became popular this famous painting was unknown, and because of this book, people know what it is.(...)That is the painting described in the book and as you can clearly see, one of the good points of this book was explaining the three main philosophies of Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism in China.I recommend that readers visit the site that details the relationship between Taoism and the other philosophies and see how Tao of Pooh fits Taoism in there."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"My religion professor assigned this book as an introduction to Daoism, but I doubt that I ever would have read it in its entirety if I was reading it outside of a class.

I think, the truth is found when one ceases to look for it. Pooh never looked for it and it seems to have found him.

It's also a great gift idea. After you read this book, you'll see the simple truths that make life so very special. Each character in the book brings a diiferent perspective of life.

However, I think that if you would like to learn about Taoism, you'd be better off reading a blurb off of a website. As for using the Winnie the Pooh characters to emphasize, illustrate and entertain, well, it just didn't work. In Hoff's \\"take\\" on Taoism, he tactlessly insults and irritates the average person living in Western Civilization who has any goals or aspirations in life. There are some very nice beliefs in Taoism, such as the development of divine virtues (which is not, of course, unique to Taoism but is shared by almost all religions), such as compassion and caring. However, being an ancient philosophy, many of the concepts and ideas have outdated themselves for today's society. Even so, it is difficult to fully appreciate the peacefulness and simplicity of this philosophy with so many jabs thrown by Hoff along the way. Poor Pooh!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"The contempt the author repeatedly expressed for both science and education made this book inappropriate for my young boys, ages 4 and 6. The author used the cute characters to mask his contempt for many of the things I value in my life, and you perhaps value in yours.I read this book at night to my 4 and 6 year olds. My four year old had chosen to read The Book of Pooh four times in a row. I had used his interest in Pooh to help him learn other things, like math and drawing. I saw this book as a way to introduce some big philosophical concepts.This may very well be an introduction to Tao, I don't know. If \\"The Way\\" means basically \\"To Criticize\\" then this is it. The author's point seems to be \\"Be Like Pooh.\\" The problem is, he cannot do it himself. If the author acted more like Pooh, his book would not be so objectionable to my children. Can you imagine Pooh criticizing at all?When the author started talking about science as pointless and silly, my 6 year old (who was sitting in) asked what was wrong with science? He wants to be a scientist. And when the author went on on a tirade about academics and school and even (ironically) books, I was shocked. My boys are both in classes of some sort, and they don't know what to do with the author's low opinion of school.There were many of these gems of knowledge. One other one I remember is that exercise is worthless. Better he says to just lay on the grass. No kidding. My kids are very active (as is Pooh) and I hope they are active their whole lives. The advice in this book is questionable at best, and totally inappropriate for children. If you are an adult, have failed at school, and sit on a couch all day, then this book will provide you with a justification.The author is a Talk Radio DJ, in the disguise as a mystic, putting on a puppet show starring Pooh. He hijacks a childhood hero to vent his frustration at a failed college career. Underneath his \\"be simple, like Pooh\\" message is a great deal of anger and frustration that bubble to the surface in ill-chosen exaggerations about \\"narrow minded science\\" and \\"irrelevant academia\\" and joggers. Did he not get tenure at Cal Tech, or something? While he derides science as pointless study, one wonders if he drives a car, takes medicine, prints his books on printing presses, travels by some other means than his feet, in short... does he benefit from science? If so, the word \\"hypocrite\\" springs to mind.We never finished the book. My four year old, who is FAR more Pooh-like than the author, simply knew that something wasn't right, and would actually pick another book and read it silently while I read this book aloud. He had never done that before, or since, and it was his Pooh way of telling me that this guy wasn't appropriate. So when my six year old asked, \\"How can he be against books - when he wrote one?\\" we stopped. The boy had a point. Any author of a book who derides authors and readers of books for being too academic is clearly a fool.The author does not have the inner peace and sense of fun and play that Pooh possesses. Instead, he parades these cute characters about and (from time to time) sneers hate-filled generalizations about things he chooses not to respect. I hear his second book is the same, but worse. If that is \\"The Way\\" then count me out."},{"Title":"The Tao of Pooh","review":"Surprisingly wordy given the topic. Cute drawings though and I like the idea of it more than the book.

He celebrates the Torah, and particularly the aggadic portions of the Babylonian Talmud, as a source of creativity and inspiration for secular and religious alike and hopes, through his teaching, to bring it to a wider audience. In Elon's view, only free-thinking Jews, grounded in but not controlled by their traditions, can have the creativity to be their own gods, to find uniquely Jewish solutions to the problems that beset Israel and Jewish culture more generally.\\"From Jerusalem to the Edge of Heaven\\" is not so much an attempt to persuade anyone that Elon is correct, as it is an attempt to persuade that such a thing is possible and to provide a vision of what a free-thinking Jewish creativity might look like. The beginning and end of the book are a pastiche of autobiographical sketches, speeches given by Elon while teaching Talmud to secular Israelis, and Elon's imaginative diary of reserve duty in Gaza. These sections (some of which are more successful than others) provide context for the book's longest section, an extended fantasia, based on Talmudic stories, on what it means to live a life of learning and creativity. This seems to me an utterly original and mostly convincing understanding of the sages of the Talmud, with modern implications that are only hinted at in Elon's brief book.Elon assumes some basic familiarity with Zionist leaders and ideas and with Talmudic aggadah, but he is writing for educated lay people, not scholars. His argument is mostly easy to follow, although I found it repetitive in a few spots. The style is poetic and idiosyncratic, but easy to read once you get into it.

I not only couldn't put it down I had to buy the book just to figure out the book, the boat, the characters and much, much more. I must say I am very impressed with the book. It is surprisingly well written which I later discovered the reason is that Mr. Reynolds is an English teacher and took 20 years to research this book and to write it in great detail. I, of course, didn't let that stop me and continued reading. I gave it a 4 overall because I couldn't justify a five right off. It just seemed wordy and I don't like that in a book. However, as I read more and more of the book I discovered it wasn't wordy at all, it was simply using a lot of adjectives to help describe the aharacters and develop the characters. I believe this Author is going places. As ha grows and matures he will develop a style (like Tom Clancey) of his own and each book will get better and better.

Hopefully he'll be around long enough to teach my kids so I can tell them about all the wild things he did in our class, because with Mr. Steve Reynolds having a sense of humor and personality as big and unpredictable as his voice, i'm definitely not ever going to forget it."},{"Title":"I Want to Change, But I Don't Know How","review":"A poor self image, trapped by repressions from my childhood, failed relationships, therapy, unsuccessful attempts to save my marriage and finally a devastating separation. My life was being destroyed. I knew something had to change but, I had no idea I was the problem and that I was holding all the answers. I did not like who I was or what I was doing to others. Loving myself was a foreign concept. The exercise in front of the mirror was a very emotional experience that started the process of bringing down walls. As I read on I gained an understanding of past behavior and how these patterns had been the root of my problems. I realized I had spent my life feeling depressed, lonely and sorry for myself. It's no wonder my wife started distancing herself from me. I still have a long road ahead of me but now I know that I can break away from what and who I was. When I find myself slipping back I listen to my 'inner selves' and frequently ask, where did that come, and 'we' talk. I haven't felt this good about myself in my entire life. My wife has noticed a change, we are still separated, and seeing the same therapist. We have 22 years of damagae to repair. Your book is my roadmap to a destination I have been searching out for my entire adult life. You have given us hope. Thank you."},{"Title":"I Want to Change, But I Don't Know How","review":"The suggestions, techniques, and growth-tasks in this book are exceptional. The book has changed my life, and would change it even more if I was willing to let it. You know that saying about how \\"when the student is ready...\\" ? If you're ready, this book is a damn good teacher. Here's the downside: the two writers are very different, and one is sarcastic, overly-aggressive, and a big turn-off. The other is reasonable and presents his views in a neutral manner. It's impossible to tell which writer is which, but the one who writes the scenes with dialogue should back off. Aside from that, I can say that I'm no fan of self-help books, but I am a fan of this one. It's insightful, powerful, and effective."},{"Title":"I Want to Change, But I Don't Know How","review":"I read this book back in the 80's and still remember its concepts. One of the ideas that stood out to me is that you don't have to be what you have been told you are or even what you think you are. We have many choices but they have been limited by focusing on one way of being. This usually starts in childhood when parents see us one way and the image grows until we believe that's what we are. The book has some great techniques to get you moving if you feel you're stuck in the same old pattern. The authors speak in a very honest, forthright manner and their words seem to jump from the page. This book gets you in touch with feelings and gets you moving. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"I Want to Change, But I Don't Know How","review":"Never have I read or listened to a better self help book.

Published by Time-Life books in the 1960s, this series portrays the many aspects of the natural world. Despite its age, The Sea is a good, basic introduction to oceanography. Topics covered include the history of oceanography, the sea floor, waves, tides, currents, life in the sea, and how humans have used and will likely use the sea for food, energy, and minerals. As with other books in this series, there are many illustrations which supplement the reading. The chapter on sharks was especially fascinating. An appendix of important dates in ocean exploration is included. If you want a highly readable, non-technical book on the ocean then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Sea (Nature Library)","review":"Pictures of many things most of us will never see in real life in our lifetime."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"Shipped earlier than promised and in good shape.

The focus of Sugar Street is more on the younger generation of characters -- the children of Yasin and Khadija and others. So the characters that you grew attached to in the first two novels, like the authoritarian family patriarch, take more of a supporting role in this one. That's disappointing. I felt like these new, younger characters were just thrust into the spotlight, and I was supposed to care about them automatically. And of course, it just doesn't work that way. I also felt like the political situation in Egypt received too much attention in this book, and that took away from character development and interpersonal relationships. All in all, Sugar Street was the least interesting of the three. I was glad when I finished it."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"This was the least well-done book of the trilogy. It took me a long time to formulate into words my disappointment in this work. Mahfouz had great representation of everything that has happened in the recent history of Egypt, at the time when everything changed, with one family having a communist, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, *and* a man who advances up the ladder of increasing bureaucracy. Mahfouz continues to write vividly, with extremely real characters, that you believe, and that you are present with, within their heads. But the veiled references to homosexuality were unnecessary and distracting from the plot. And the book was too slice of life. The ending was far too sudden, incomplete, and unfulfilling. And in the end, this book, and this trilogy, becomes a writing of depression, sadness, and how lives are destroyed, lacking in hope, lacking in joy, lacking in truth.One man, on patriarch, sets his family down the road of despair through his relentless despotism. He even warps their brains into thinking that what he does is a good thing, and his hypocrisy a virtue. This could be a great book in teaching the lesson of how we choose generational sins for our family- but it doesn't seem to actually try to teach this. This is the result of the work of the patriarch, but there is no foil to present for hope for the family. The only successful individual is the grandchild engaged in homosexuality who succeeds at bureaucracy. There is no redemption. The book becomes the anti-Dickens, a world without possibilities. And this is the greatest value of the book, perhaps- showing us the Egyptian culture, strangling it's citizens in red tape.Great Expectations (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"Glad I took the recommendations from this site and read it.I cannot really add any more to this tip."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"Sugar Street is a graceful finale to the Cairo Trilogy. I think the Kirkus Review above gives away too much of the plot. I'm glad I didn't visit this page until having finished the book!I strongly recommend reading the first two books before this one. If you skip directly to Sugar Street, you miss out on all the history which gives added meaning to the events in the final volume."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"This is the third book of the trilogy by this renowned Egyptian author. Originally written in Arabic in the late 1950s, many of his works have been translated into English. I'm very glad about this because his unique perspective is an important one, especially now, when everybody and his brother had an opinion about what is going on in the Middle East. These books were written way before Muslims were perceived as a threat, and male dominance in families was an unquestioned way of life. We see the politics of the time through the eyes of one family. And so we learn about the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s in Egypt through the eyes of very specific people.Even though the author has a tendency to be a bit flowery and wordy for my taste, I found it perfectly all right in this book. Specifically, in this and his other books, he gets into the thought processes of the character named Kamal, who he has followed from childhood to adulthood. In the first book he is a child looking at the world with wide-eyed wonder; in the second book we see him in love; and in this last book we meet him as a bachelor schoolteacher observing the world around him. The patriarch of the family, his father, is aging and so are all the other members of the family. There are births, deaths, tragedies and romances all told against the background of a changing world.Reading this series of books somehow seemed to make me part of this family. I felt their joys and sorrows on a person-to-person level. It didn't matter that the world they lived in was different from mine. They came alive for me and I found myself thinking about them as I went about my day. Now that the series is finished, I will miss them.This last book is perhaps the saddest. I would have liked the story to be happier. But this is the story the author told. I cannot change that. However, I do know that the time I spent reading this book left me richer."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"Sugar Street is the continuing saga of the Al Jawad family, yet the book is more tinged with a feeling of despair, seeing as the familiar characters have all grown old, Aisha grown older still, and Ahmad confined to bed. However, it gives a sense of closure, and there is no reading Palace Walk and Palace of Desire without reading Sugar Street."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"I was sceptical because of the price of the book but it came in great condition. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"If you enjoyed &quot;Palace Walk,&quot; and even &quot;Palace of Desire,&quot; you will have to agree that this book is disapointing. It is shorter than the others (notably so) and with far less to say. The family falls into such a decline in this story as to lack believability. Mahfouz's treatment of one of his characters -- Aisha -- the youngest daughter of the family and considered very beautiful -- is unbelievably harsh. Happily for us, it is nearly impossible for a real life person to have a life as tragic as Aisha's. Her tragedy makes absolutely no sense and ruins the book for me, making me wonder whether Mahfouz might be some sort of mysogynist. No one else has a really great life to contrast either. My advice: Read &quot;Palace Walk&quot; and then move on to something else."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"the story portraits the husband as a god and the wife is his forever subsevient wife. Boring ."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"This is the third book in the Cairo Trilogy Series. By all means, do NOT try to read this book without having read Palace Walk or Palace of Desire FIRST--it would be like tuning in to a movie in the last half hour.This book opens with the father and his wife in old age, in their 60's, their children in middle age, and the younger (third) generation entering their 20's. It continues the interesting saga. The book finishes shortly after both the father and his wife eventually die of old age.This entire series is SLOW DRAMA (warning for those who like &quot;action&quot;), but one of the BEST pieces of literature I have ever read in my life. I have lived in the Middle East for 11 years, and this entire series REALLY shows the Middle Eastern culture and way of thinking."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"Even some of the very best long novels or series rush somewhat disconcertingly towards a conclusion as though the writer is trying to tie up loose ends speedily and get on with life or the next project. But in Mahfouz's trilogy, the pace is perfectly matched to the time period. In Sugar Street, we are plunged into rapid social changes in Egypt during the thirties and the war -- tremendous upheavals in family structure, in women's roles, in politics, and not surprisingly in the lives of the characters. Someone wrote in these reviews that at least some of the characters suffered in unlikely ways. But this reviewer is probably not a surviver of a typhoid epidemic, or World War II, nor yet experiencing the delights and the disappointments of age. In my view, the Cairo Trilogy is a gem, and Sugar Street is a real pleasure. I may have to turn around and reread all three books before I can reshelve them."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"The conclusion and final disintegration of the formerly powerful patriarchal family. Brings one through the third generation of tradegy, loss, and spiritual transformation and leaves almost every individual in misery. I enjoyed the first and final books in this trilogy and feel I came away with a better understanding of the conflicting forces at work in Egypt as well as the impact of culture and morality on individual actions and spirituality."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"This is the last installment of the Cairo trilogy, a saga spanning several generations of a family in Egypt during the first decades of the 20th century. Of the three books \\"Sugar Street\\" is the most political with the pace moving very quickly, there are time periods of about a year and more between most chapters.After an intimate look into a Cairo family's life in Book 1 and Kamal's total stagnation in Book 2, caught between feeling and tradition versus rational thought and science, here there is much action in the outer world and larger political life. The three grandsons grow to maturity in a time when Egypt is breaking free of colonialism. One is a member of Muslim radical fundamentalist brotherhood, another a communist and the other, well...he too has followed his own path away from family tradition.The Cairo trilogy and especially Book 3, Sugar Street can offer a great deal of insight into how attitudes in the Mid-East have been shaped."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. Being a muslim and an arab, I could identify with the characters and their dilemmas. I think that it would be of great benefit to the reader if they had a background knowledge of Egypt and Islam in general. The author assumes that the reader is from the Middle East, therefore he does not explain the significance of some of the words. All in all, Sugar Street is an excellent book that deserved its Noble Prize."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"I do consulting in the refining and petrochemical industries and have, as a result, struck up several friendships with Arabs and Arab-Americans working in those facilities. Once I asked several acquaintances if there were are well-regarded Arab writers with good English translations available that could help me as an American better understand the modern Arab experience and worldview. Several recommended The Cairo trilogy (Palace Walk, Palace of Desire, Sugar Street) by Naguib Mahfouz. It covers a time period that would provide an excellent overview into 20th century Arab experience both politically and socially, especially vis-&agrave;-vis Arab/Western interaction. It is a family saga and therefore provides a good view of modern Arab family life and the affects modernization has had on it. It's urban setting and action would be more familiar to Americans than a more rural tale. The books are written from a genuinely Arabic sensibility language-wise-a sensibility not overly degraded by translation. And, finally, it would be a \\"less difficult\\" introduction to Arabic culture than other possibilities.It should be noted that \\"less difficult\\" is not that same as \\"easy\\" or \\"easier\\". This marks an important distinction, one underscored by these books. Arabic language, society and sensibilities are colored much more by nuances and multiple permutations on a few basic themes than is true in Western society.Naguib Mahfouz is a Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian novelist who adeptly and adroitly captures these nuances and evokes a genuine feel for-if not true understanding of-their intrinsic roots within the Arabic weltanschauung.Clearly, based on the reviews to date for this book, there are many who have difficulty with this dynamic. These are the folks who probably are unable to split hairs and see the distinction between \\"less difficult\\" and \\"easier\\". If you are that sort of person I have to say quite honestly that you are going to be both frustrated and bored by this book or any of the series.If you are the sort who relishes a challenge, truly wants to try to get a feel for and understand Arabic social and political views and don't mind putting a bit of effort into that undertaking, you will find reading any or all of these books a rewarding experience indeed."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"In the third part of \\"The Cairo Trilogy\\", life of the Abd al-Jawad family goes on. Amina's body now withered, her hair white, ill health and grief having altered her considerably. Her diligence and her capacity for running the household are now gone. She no longer pays attention to her home except for the services to her husband al-Sayyid Ahmad, once a vigorous man in full swing. He now suffers from high blood pressure and he had to give up many of the pleasures of life - drinks, women and good food. In fact, many months before dying, he is completely bedridden, a particularly humiliating situation for a man with such a strong ego.Here Mr Mahfouz casts a compassionate glance at the irony of life which makes elderly people become utterly dependant on others, as they used to be when they were infants. For Kamal, now thirty-six, it is sad to see his family age, all the more since he refuses to get married and thus spends a lot of time aloof and lonely. Aiming at becoming a true intellectual, Kamal often collides with doubt and struggles with instincts and passions and is becoming \\"an emotionally crippled recluse\\". He often broods about his youth, his love for Ada and the eternal loss of the enchanting past.But there are also reasons to rejoice as the younger generation takes over and ascends in society. Marriages take place, careers are planned. Mr Mahfouz splendidly portrays this cycle of life in which the old generation gives way to the boisterous and cheerful young one. This is shown in the moving final scene when Kamal and his brother Yasin enter a store where the former buys several items for his daughter's baby while the latter buys a black necktie he will need when the mournful day of his mother's death arrives..."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"This is the last book of the Cairo Tilogy,which should stand along side of Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga.As with any work that is squarely founded upon an extensive exposure and understanding of the human nature that is found throughout the world, the reader will find an Egyptian writer who sympathetically and deftly presents a family from the middle east, faced with the same problems that plagued English families throughout the victorian era and later.Throw in the problems of occupation by the British to further complicate a father's problems with educating and marrying his sons, and insurinng the happiness of his daughters through marriage to fiscally sound and loving men from backgrounds similar to his family's, and the reader will realize we're all the same the world over. I was sorry to reach the end of the last book, and I'm jealous of anyone who is about to read the Cairo Trilogy for the first time."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"This trilogy starts out somewhat difficult...a bit stilted...then develops into interesting characters living thru an interesting era. This book, the last of the trilogy, is every bit as good as the first two."},{"Title":"Sugar Street (The Cairo Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"Here is Mahfouz's great finale to his classic Cairo Trilogy, an under-the-radar series that, perhaps due to its origins, is not as well known as other major works but is every bit as searching and distinguished. Here the war-torn Cairo of WWII in Palace of Desire is more subdued, at a dubious peace with the British but still rife with underground political intrigue. The al-Jawad family is growing older, and the younger generation is coming into their own and the story's forefront. Like the previous two novels, this is a very humane book, short on action and plot twists but full of numerous moments of perception, with deep philosophical undertones throughout. Here they are mostly of aging and regret, and there is a somber tone always in the book's atmosphere. What works best in this book is the character of Kamal, lovestruck in the previous book but here wiser and resolute yet profoundly melancholy. His siblings are not as filled-out here; Yasin winds down with a tolerant wife, Khadija is a rather one-note motherly figure, and poor Aisha lives a life filled with pervasive grief. The younger generation gives the book a bit of hope though, yet through this ray of light lies the book's primary weakness. Khadija and Yasin's children were difficult for me to differentiate, and as characters were not written with the same sharpness that the al-Jawad kids were. Also the timeline here seemed to move at a noticeably quicker pace than in the previous two books, making it difficult to keep tabs on everyone's age and making their growing infirmities come as a bit of a shock. In any case it is a must for fans of the previous two books, and the ending itself is subtle and first-rate."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Good and Easy Cookbook","review":"Did June Cleaver have this cookbook? I can just imagine Beaver Cleaver eating a cereal concoction recipe found in this book. The book just oozes 50s domesticity and it's all for real. The book was printed in the early 50s and reflects traditional gender roles as much as it does with America's growing fascination with convienience foods. Actually many of the recipes are usable today. I use one for a kind of quickie stroganoff that is quite tasty. Still, there are alot of carbs and fats in this book. How about deep fried corn mush for breakfast? Anyway, I was able to buy this book quite cheaply to replace one my mother had which was rapidly disintegrating. It's a fun look back at a society which really no longer exists save for \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" reruns. The recipes, too, are still usable.

The strategies are independently constructed, so if you are busy you don't have to read the whole book in consecutive sittings.Thanks to the condensed writing, it is easy to remember the strategies.

ON ANOTHER NOTE, MAKE NO MISTAKE ROMANCE LOVERS, THIS IS A HOT ROMANCE. MASON AND ELLIE SIZZLE TOGETHER. OVERALL, THIS BOOK GIVES THE READER A MEANINGFUL STORY, A HOT ROMANCE, AND HEROES THAT OVERCOME ALL ODDS."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"I loved the first book...Chase was so kind and loving and sexy--and here comes Mason...with more than enough problems and was never nice just to be nice. I think he had too many problems...either make him a drinker or make him damaged from his divorce but the fact that he had both was a downer...which made Ellie even more a downer...she should have been stronger, and more deserving of a better guy--just cause she is the heavy sister means she has to learn to deal with someone elses issues because shes got her own. I was annoyed. Wanted to like it...but didnt.Im hoping story 3 is better!"},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the first book which, despite being somewhat formulaic and predictable, kept my attention the entire time. This one, however, did not.The main problem for me were the two leads, whom I found almost too incompatible. I never really understood why they were in love and didn't feel like I was on the journey with them, but rather like it was being forced down my throat. Although I liked Ellie, the heroine, I found her way too naive, making some of her comments and some moments between the two unrealistic. Halfway through the book, I was ready for it to end and only kept reading because I'd already downloaded it on my kindle and didn't have anything better to do."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"I have to say, after devouring the first installment of the Stepp Sisters trilogy, I was really looking forward to this novel, especially considering how wonderful and supporting the romantic leads were in the first book. Instead it was merely okay in my opinion but not particularly romantic. It felt slightly awkward and overly dramatic and just a little too much of a stretch in the dreams do come true tale. It is a standalone read, however I would recommend reading the first book, Getting What You Want, for the continuity since the trilogy overall is enchanting.Ellie Stepp, the pudgy, nerdy librarian is the only sister growing up in Millbrook Maine who decided to stay in her hometown to care for her grandmother. She's rather an invisible staple in the town and typically completely overlooked in the romance department. So it's no wonder that at the wedding of her sister Abby and Chase, the best man, captain of the football team in highschool, current town mayor, and Ellie's childhood hero, Mason Sweet, is sending her the attraction signals. As an almost 30 year old virgin, she can't believe that someone like Mason could be attracted to her, but when she finds her beloved library in jeopardy of being closed, she seeks Mason's help to rally to her cause. Mason, who has been in a downward spiral for the last two years after his divorce has become best friends with alcohol. His work and popularity is starting to suffer from it which sends him to drink even more. When Ellie approaches him late one night to help her save the library funding from being given to a new football field, he drunkenly propositions her to sleep with him in exchange for his help. Ellie is at first appalled by his proposal but ultimately craving the adventure and being the hopeless romantic that she is, she decides she may never get another chance like this again and accepts his proposal. The only problem is after the hangover has worn off, Mason can't believe he actually said what he said to sweet Ellie and takes the offer back, only to have Ellie convince him it's what she wants. As they embark on their affair, Mason becomes more and more enamored with Ellie, but Ellie, insecure in their secret relationship, starts to see a deeper darker issue with Mason and there's seems to be nothing she can do to help him.This book is just as entertaining as the first book, but misses the mark in the romance department. Ellie and Mason have a much greater and darker challenge with Mason's alcoholism and Ellie's insecurity, and end up hurting one another just as much as they help. Mason's obsession and Ellie's actions are somewhat over the top and rather uncharacteristic for these two, but the bottom line is they're both good people who don't end up having their act together like I was anticipating after reading the first book. Still, it was an enjoyable read and sets up the scene early on for what takes place in the third and final installment. Although the typos in the kindle edition were still there, it was not as excessive as in the first book which led to less distractions."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"This book was the least favorite of the trilogy, mostly because I felt like the author didn't show us enough of \\"why\\" Ellie and Mason fell in love.Ellie claims to have been in love with Mason since high school (or maybe it was even middle school) yet in all those years (she is about 30) she has never really gotten to know him on a personal level. So I ask, how could she really be in love with him? Could she have a crush on him for all those years? Yes, certainly. But to claim she was in love with him without actually really knowing him...that bothered me a bit.Even once their relationship begins, the author never really shows them doing anything together but having sex. From our viewpoint, their whole relationship is sexual. In her first book in the trilogy, you got to see Abby and Chase get to know each other; she gave them a basis for falling in love. With Ellie and Mason, their relationship felt like it was missing something for me.And Mason was kind of a jerk. Yes, I know, that was mostly because of his drinking, but again, with him acting that way, I just don't see why Ellie would have fallen in love with him.I pushed most of the shortcomings aside while reading the book and still enjoyed it overall, but given the glowing reviews I read about it, and the potential I thought it had, I was expecting much more and the book fell short.Overall it's an enjoyable read but not as good as book 1 and nowhere near as good as book 3.A note on Kindle formatting: There were assorted typos, though not nearly as many as were in the kindle version of book 1."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"This is the second book of a 3 book series. They are all very good reads, but this is probably the one that I remember the most. The story revolves around Ellie, a small town librarian and Mason, former high school popular kid and current town mayor. Ellie has always had a crush on Mason, but has never acted on it because of her own personal insecurities. Due to circumstances, she finds herself involved with Mason who is battling his own set of problems. Due to the nature of his job, he prefers to keep the affair secret, Ellie agrees because she loves him. But will both of their issues come between them? You will have to read to find out... This story seemed so real, the issues in Mason and Ellie were issues regular people had, making the story very believable. It takes you through a wide range of emotion from happiness, anger, frustration to sadness.The ending was so good I was crying and smiling at the same time! I just wished the book wouldn't have ended so soon! This trilogy is worth reading!"},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"This book is the best of the trilogy, but they're all pretty good. I liked the realism of Mason's character and his first denial and then battle with alcoholism. I especially liked the way Ellie stood up to him and asked him to seek help.Ellie is endearing on her own too. In some ways I would've liked to see her end up with her assistant in the library. He treated her decently compared to Mason's exploitive treatment."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"I wish that Kathy Love writes more books like this one. What a story! I could not put it down for few hours. Just great!"},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"Ellie is a somewhat shy, definitely chubby and arguably dull librarian in small-town Middlebrook, Maine. She grew up as a bit of an outsider, but always had a crush on gorgeous, hometown hero Mason Sweet, who's now the town's mayor. Ellie's gotten real used to being attracted to him, just like she's gotten used to telling herself she's too chunky for any guy to be interested in her.So, imagine her surprise when, at her sister's wedding reception, Mason very obviously flirts with her! Rather than being thrilled, she's baffled. She had to be mistaken...right? Flash-forward a few days--Ellie has just discovered that a local \\"good ole boy\\" wants to get the town council to siphon money from the library to pay for a new football field. In a panic, Ellie goes to Mason to ask for his help to convince the council members that the library's worth saving.Mason's a little surprised when Ellie shows up at his house, but he can't deny that he's been thinking about her constantly since the wedding--and his thoughts haven't exactly been the lily-white variety. Thing is, he's also a little drunk, so when the tempting little librarian comes pleading for his help, he makes a request of his own: Ellie in his bed in exchange for his help.Thus, we enter into the fast-paced, well-written world of Kathy Love's \\"Wanting What You Get.\\" I'll admit that I love a good slow build to a story, but Kathy Love doesn't waste any time with preamble here; within four or five pages, you're well-ensconced in the story, Mason's already giving into his newfound attraction to Ellie--while Ellie's busy pinching herself to make sure she's not dreaming.This is the romance genre at its finest, in my opinion. What I absolutely love is that Kathy Love knows good dialogue; it's snappy, witty, and cleanly delivered. That dialogue brings the characters to life just as much as her well-delivered internal dialogue. What Love delivers is a unique turn of phrase and \\"voice\\" that comes right off the page and curls up in your lap like a favorite cat. :)In terms of the plot: the crux of the matter is that Mason had a horrible marriage and has decided he's not relationship material. The only problem is that he can't seem to get Ellie out of his head, so even after he backs out of the \\"sleep with me to get my vote\\" deal, he STILL wants her. Trying for chivalrous, he keeps turning Ellie down--even though she says she's fine with a one-night stand or a casual (i.e., only sexual) relationship, he knows she's too sweet for that.Still, after resisting for a while, they finally fall into bed together with the agreement that their relationship--or lack thereof--will be their little secret.Okay, fine...but once Mason starts having feelings for Ellie, he's too afraid (or something) to come right out and say he wants to be in a relationship with her, so he just beats around the bush--all while drinking everything in sight. Oh, yeah...this leading man has a drinking problem.As my friends would say, this is \\"straight up, real stuff.\\"Anyway, I wasn't quite able to figure out why, after Ellie has made it clear that she'd be interested in anything he has to offer, he's STILL afraid to just tell her he wants to be with her, but it made for some nice, tense moments, so I won't complain.***SPOILER ALERT***The one real gripe I had was Ellie's pregnancy at the end of novel. I totally saw the coming from the first mention of her being overly tired (I mean, really, I'd be a bad romance reader if I hadn't picked up on those clues). The problem I have with it is that it really served no purpose in the plot; if the pregnancy had been a catalyst for either Ellie taking a stand to get Mason to stop drinking OR if that pregnancy had been why Mason actually DID stop drinking, then fine. But, really, it was almost a periphery aspect of the plot, which bothered me a bit.[END OF SPOILER ALERT]In terms of Kathy Love's writing style, I love how fast-paced the story is, and the fact that it's packed with heroine/hero one-on-one time. She tends to skip the nitty-gritty of the love scenes, which is fine with me because there's a lot of chemistry between these two. BUT she also tends to skip over the most tense moments in the story (i.e., arguments, etc) and jumps forward a few hours/days/weeks/even months later. I really didn't mind that for most of the story, but near the end, I found myself wanting \\"more\\"--more interaction/discussion/arguing between Ellie and Mason. And, actually, the last chapter or two just seemed a bit rushed. Almost everything is solved in retrospect, meaning we're brought into the story months down the line and either Ellie or Mason would think back about how things were \\"fixed\\" during that time period. Yeah...not exactly conducive to, what's the word, emotional closure as a reader. :)I must admit, though, that at the end, I felt let down, not because of the book's ending, but because of the way it ended. Ellie and Mason spent a good half of the chapter apart, then, on the last two pages, get together and everything's honky-dorey. I'm not one for a chapter-long make-up session, but between the pregnancy and Mason's drinking issues, they still had A LOT to talk about.All in all though, it was a great, fun read that I finished in about a day-and-a-half simply because I was genuinely interested (dare I say excited?) about seeing these two finally get together."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"I simply enjoyed this book beyond measure.

I was not disappointed!From the first page, it is evident that this is not your typical romance novel, nor are Ellie Stepp and Mason Sweet your typical heroine and hero. Both characters are real and identifiable. It is easy to empathize and connect with them on a deep level, which makes the read even more enjoyable.Despite its scandalous beginnings (Mason offers to back Ellie politically if she agrees to sleep with him.), their relationship is actually very sweet and very touching. Both grow and change in positive ways from having known and loved each other, and the odds working against the success of the pairing make the happy ending downright blissful. This is definitely a must read for any contemporary romance fan."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"Wow! Ms. Love is a genius at weaving tales of hometown romance.

She has always had a crush on Mason, ever since he saved her from bullies in their childhoods.Mason is now the mayor of their small town, and wants to have an affair with Ellie. And here is where the story has problems. Mason is an alcholic, with all the alcoholic's problems of lying, unreliablilty, maipulating, and rationalizing. By the middle of the book, I was hoping Ellie would see through this self-serving drunk and kick him to the curb. By the time his redemption occurred, it was too late for me, and I still hoped Ellie would kick him to the curb. After all the emotional abuse she put up with from his, she still took him back at the end. I regretted it. She had been so badly hurt and mistreated by him, I felt like I would have if she'd been my sister, or my girlfriend living through that hell, and would have just been shaking my head in despair at her taking him back. This was supposed to be a \\"happy ever after\\" ending, but it didn't feel like it, to me. It felt to me that Ellie had just made the same wrong choice at the end, that she'd made all through the book. Maybe if she'd taken a year or more to to decide if he was worth it or not, at the end. Maybe if she'd realized earlier how toxic the relaiztionship was, and broken it off. Maybe if he hadn't been such a miserable jerk all through the book. This book, to me, was simply degredaton after degredation to Ellie, and I was hoping she would be strong enough to end the abuse. By the time she said \\"enough\\", like Mason's redemption, it was too late, and when she took him back, I was yelling \\"don't do it!\\"I'm glad I started this series with the first book; had I started with this one, I'd never have read any more in the series. As it is, I'm glad I read the first one, glad to be done with this one, and am having doubts about the third one."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"I made it to the last 100 pages asking myself,\\"What is wrong with this woman?\\" It led me to research codependancy on the internet. This is the first of the 3 Stepp Sisters books I've read, but I plan to read the other 2. From the reviews I've read, I suspect they may address the same problem. I haven't found a good definition of what codependent means. I always had a vague notion that it was someone who encouraged bad habits in others. In this book, Ellie goes to great pains to avoid seeing her lover's alcoholism. So, though I haven't found a good definition, I suspect these books may offer an excellent illustration. I wonder if that was Ms, Love's intent. I'm pretty sure Mason will get help for his addiction. I'll be curious to see if the sisters get help for theirs by the time the series ends."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"Loved this book.

This only made the read more entertaining.Ellie Stepp is not perfect, at least not in her opinion. She's a little chubby, a little short, and a librarian. Could she be a sadder stereotype? She is living in her small Maine hometown and life is good, at least by Ellie standards. It could be better but...than at her sisters wedding reception the unthinkable happens...Mason Sweet the object of her childhood love, and Millbrook's very handsome mayor flirts with her...on purpose!! Her, Ellie Stepp. Something must be wrong. Way wrong. But actually everything is very right. At least it will be once she manages to get her act together. Than she finds out that one of the towns leading citizens wants a new football field at the libraries expense. Ellie screws up her courage and asks Mayor Sweet to help her. He will...but it's going to cost her...Mason can't believe that he is seeing Ellie in a whole new light. She is beautiful, giving, and warms him like no one else has in a long time. When she comes to him for help, he makes a rather indecent proposal...and is floored when she agrees! Well, he can handle this...no problem. Right? Well, it won't be an easy relationship given that it must be kept secret from the town and Ellie's sister. But than nothing worth having ever comes easy right?Ellie and Mason are wonderfully real characters. Ellie has more issues than vogue magazine when it comes to security and self-confidence.

Now, Ellie is the town librarian and Mason is the town mayor. When Ellie discovers that the city council might cut the library budget in order to fund a new high school football field, she asks Mason for his help preventing it. Mason tells Ellie that he'll help her, if she sleeps with him. To his surprise, Ellie accepts his proposition. She has always had a crush on Mason and sees this as a way to finally live out her fantasies. They end up having an affair, which Ellie agrees to keep secret at Mason's request. Naturally, the fact that Mason refuses to acknowledge their relationship in public, does little for Ellie's self-esteem.Mason has a secret of his own, he has a big drinking problem (although he certainly doesn't see it as a problem). It's very, very difficult for an author to write an alcoholic hero and still make him likable to the reader. Yet, this author managed to pull it off. I was very impressed by that.What I wasn't impressed about was the fact that his drinking problem was so obvious and yet, both the heroine and the hero took *forever* to figure it out. Then later in the book, there is another situation (I won't tell what it is so that I don't spoil it for anyone) that again is very obvious, but the hero and heroine are totally oblivious to it. As a result, frankly, I questioned their intelligence at several points during the book. I spent way too much time waiting for them to wake and face facts, and that irritated me.

I rate how much I like books on how long it takes me to read them, and this one took me 2 hours. Ellie was an amazing woman who wasn't exactly perfect but she was real, and since I am sick of thin, beautiful, waifs she was a nice departure of the mainstream. But the character I really loved was Mason. You don't get many books were the hero is perfect on the outside but is really not perfect on the inside. He has a real problem(alcoholism) and he was depicted acurratly, and not like some guy who sweeps his problem under the rug.

We meet both characters in the first book and now it is their turn. I really really liked Ellie. She was cute. Mason was real. I liked how we really got into their heads. I liked how the author made the characters get into their own heads. It is so much more real and makes it easier to go with the story and feel like you are right there.This story has two \\"real\\" people with real problems that we can all identify with. It is also about choices and the paths in life and what can happen when the right choices are not made. It covers the highs and lows of life. It also shows us Abby and Chase again, whom I love and we get to see a little more of Marty, the third sister and third story.

I'd wanted to savour it over tea during the Christmas holidays but instead I was instantly sucked into Mason and Ellie's world and didn't emerge until a few hours later - story finished.Love has created a novel that transcends modern romance fiction and stands apart from the formulaic standards. The reader is treated to passion, romance and angst without the distractions (verbosity, boring plots or excessive setting descriptions) that assail many readers. Almost immediately you fall in love with the heroine - identifying with her struggle for self-worth and her inability to see herself as the world sees her. You're at once cheering her on while you take stock of your own self-esteem. Ellie Stepp is not the ugly Stepp sister, but the reality of every woman inside, at one time or another.The object of Ellie's affection and obsession is so well- realized that he breaks the mold of romantic hero.This novel stands alone as the most honest and passionate story I've read that is sold under the canopy of romantic fiction. It clips along at an exciting pace without ever missing a beat.I found myself laughing and crying and caring about the characters as if they were old friends falling in love. And if there is any bit of voyeurism in you, you'll be pleasantly surprised about every intimate moment Kathy Love's characters share...The printed word leaps off the page filling your imagination with a completely satifying vision of this exciting relationship from beginning to end.I highly recommend it as a great escape..."},{"Title":"Wanting What You Get (Stepp Sisters, Book 2)","review":"If I could give a rating of 3.5 stars I would feel \\"right\\" about my rating.

It lacks sources, there are neither footnotes nor a bibliography at the end so one can only guess where does he get his info from. This is particularly troubling when one finds bold assertions such as when the author states that there was no hunger among the Aztecs and the Incas before Columbus (Chapter 7). The second major problems is that there's no serious effort at an in-depth analysis of what food represents in human society, the writer consistently prefers to tell amusing stories rather than engage in serious scientific enquiry.

A good guide through history of food for food scientists, researchers and food safety people."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"Writer Tierney Smith gave Blue Melody an insightful review in Goldmine magazine, July 25, 2003--When Lee Underwood met an aspiring singer/songwriter named Tim Buckley in Greenwich Village in 1966, the latter had already secured a contract with Elektra Records and seemed well on his way to a promising musical career. In the end, commercial success proved elusive, though Buckley did achieve an impressive cult-level status.Underwood was Buckley's lead guitarist for seven years, and together they formed a bond so close that Buckley once said of their friendship, \\"We didn't have sex, but we were married.\\" Still, the author, who interviewed Buckley's family members, bandmates and friends for this project, insists that he's not \\"blinded by friendship\\" and can maintain his objectivity toward the man he calls \\"one of the most interesting, complex and stimulating persons I ever met.\\"Given Underwood's flair for insightful analysis (of both Buckley himself and the music in question) and his wonderfully descriptive prose - he brings the fast-paced world of New York and the colorful kaleidoscope of Venice, Calif., to life with a vividness that feels almost cinematic in scope - Buckley could hardly have asked for a more eloquent writer to tell his story.Underwood paints a portrait of a \\"brilliantly funny\\" man who disdained the banal conversation of more conventional minds, an intellectual who seemed to find a kindred spirit in the author, who introduced Buckley to the poetry of Western mystics such as William Blake and Rainer Maria Rilke and discussed with him the poetry of Dylan Thomas and Delmore Schwartz.Buckley, who channeled his musical and literary influences into his art, possessed a musical intelligence that found him rejecting the notion of, in the author's words, \\"concocting commercially formulated decorations to flatter audience preconceptions.\\" Instead, through his songs, writes Underwood, Buckley gave us \\"the core of his life, the soul of his being, a cry of love from the heart.\\"Life was carefree in those early days, recalls Underwood, \\"full of hope and possibilities wide open for the taking,\\" yet Buckley's inner conflicts were never far below the surface and, in the author's view, had their roots in an unsupportive father, a World War II veteran and ex-paratrooper whose growing mental instability made him \\"a volatile presence who left a huge emotional emptiness in Tim's life.\\" The late senior Buckley, a self-described \\"loner\\" who viewed society as hostile to artists in general, derided his son's artistic ambitions even as he harbored similar unrealized dreams of his own. He counts among the fascinating cast of supporting characters found in these pages.In a book that strongly focuses on Buckley's music, there is effusive praise for a man whose desire for exploring new musical directions took him further from the more mainstream work of his early folk-rock leanings to the realm of the avant-garde with 1970's Starsailor. Buckley's choices alienated both his fans and his critics, but, as Underwood writes, Buckley courageously stuck to his guns. \\"When he had to walk in dark isolation because of his choices, he went ahead and walked in dark isolation, sometimes for years on end.\\"The author also takes to task Buckley's critics who \\"think [Buckley] should have catered to their tastes instead of aspiring to realize his own visionary explorations in new musical domains.\\" One can sense Underwood's frustration all these years later toward an audience who, rather than rejecting Buckley's work, \\"could have felt respected, challenged and astonished\\" by his increasingly more adventurous output. \\"Buckley gave them diamonds,\\" sums up the author, \\"the crowd wanted pebbles.\\"Buckley's growing unhappiness and self-doubt in the wake of the failure of his more ambitious work lends Buckley's story a certain poignancy. His return to a more conventional song structure in 1972's Greetings From L.A. seemed almost an admission of defeat. As Buckley's wife Judy saw it, he was \\"happy doing it, but there was so much more he had to offer that nobody wanted.\\" In Underwood's view, Buckley's more commercially acceptable fare was motivated by a desire to continue recording and even then he brought as much \\"grace, style, passion and creative imagination\\" to the process as he could.Underwood's exploration of Buckley's death on June 19, 1975, at the age of 28 of a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol (in which he is careful to point out that Buckley was not a regular heroin user) is presented in the same insightful, clear-eye manner that he brings to the whole of Buckley'' creative efforts in this deeply penetrating book."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"Lee Underwood's memoir of his years with the amazing Tim Buckley is one of the most heartfelt paeans to friendship and creativity I've ever read - and one of the most honest. Underwood tackles his subject with eyes - and heart - wide open, and the result not only clears up a lot of the mystery that still surrounds Tim's life, but also celebrates the wonderful legacy that remains. As Underwood states in the final chapter, Tim's life can teach us some valuable lessons. \`Our span is but a fleeting moment. Death is arbitrary and absolutely democratic. Young or old, the QUANTITY of time doesn't matter...Only quality matters...Let us transform the shining mystery of our lives into art...He did. So can we.'Buckley was an astonishingly gifted artist - his music always challenged his listeners, dared them to follow him in his dance, celebrating life itself - with all of its joys and sorrows, highs and lows, darkness and light. Those who took that challenge have been rewarded with the shining light that was Tim Buckley - those who abandoned him whenever he took a direction that was too demanding or too painful for them to follow turned their attentions to \`easier' music. What a shame.Underwood was Buckley's lead guitar player on most of his recordings - and above all, he was Tim's friend. He was along for the ride - he was the eyewitness to so many of the singer's peaks and valleys. He opened Tim's eyes and mind to new, stimulating influences - and he watched Tim take them into his mind, heart and hand and run like the wind with them, transforming things he learned and assimilated into new ideas, new tools for his own artistic vision. Along the way, various painful elements from Tim's life reared their heads - as they do for all of us - and Lee was there to witness that as well, trying his best to help his friend through them. Those pains are laid bare in this book - and it's not an easy read, but it's comforting in its truthfulness. Lee has had his share of pains as well - and the hard road he walked working through them is detailed here as well.As dark as some parts of Buckley's life were, in the end I think they were overwhelmed by the brilliance that shone from him. Anyone who has ever been blessed to hear him - either in person or on his recordings - knows what I mean. It's a brilliance that can be heard and felt - and it can illuminate the life of anyone who will simply let it in.One of the most fascinating aspects - for me - of this document is the psychological path. The author relates events from time to time that literally jumped off the page at me. I just read Arthur Janov's THE NEW PRIMAL SCREAM for the first time a few months ago - and several things in Lee's account resonated within me. Sure enough, he mentions Janov in more than one place - and refers to psychotherapy on multiple occasions as one of the practices that helped him through some tough times, dealing with issues that won't simply \`go away'. I can't help but wonder how Tim's story would have turned out differently if he had been able to avail himself of some of the same assistance - Underwood recommended it to him, but it sometimes takes an individual a while to make the decision to take a trip down that street.Tim Buckley had the courage and vision to live his life, his art to the fullest - and Lee Underwood has shown the courage to write about Tim's life in a way that shines with the same honesty with which Tim pursued his music (or perhaps surrendered to it). This book is an amazing experience - any fan of Tim Buckley's music should be grateful to Lee Underwood for sharing it with us."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"The title should have been Tim Buckley Remembered; Or I Got a Lot Of Pussy in The 60's and You Didn't.....Mr. Underwood's tale of Tim Buckley's rise and fall is pretty good; however, his cheap shots at Larry Beckett take away from his tome. There is a whiff of \\"I was a genius and helped create Tim Buckley\\" sprinkled throughout the book. Frankly, Mr. Underwood was a very hit-or-miss guitarist. Sometimes good, sometimes great(mostly in a live setting) and sometimes horrible. As to his \\"inventing\\" certain guitar techniques, I think his ego may have got the best of him. I will give him this though; Tim Buckley is one of music's most fascinating \\"shoulda-beens\\". Some of the music that he wrote stands up with any of his 60's contemporaries and a large chunk of it is better. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to investigate Buckley's music/story; however, a grain of salt should be taken when reading it....."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"We raised a lot of hell back then...No one could dance through a melody the way Lee did with his guitar ...he did it again with his words.

You will feel it."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"Lee Underwood's \\"Blue Melody\\" is an inspired, revealing memoir that could only have been written by someone in close proximity to a beautiful and tragic human life - the artist as fragile human being and as historical event. A unique artist and deeply sensitive witness to life, person, music and culture, Underwood digs deep into memory, impression, music and detail to construct a book on the iconic Tim Buckley, a singer and musical explorer who, the tastes of the listener aside, dug deeper into the human soul and the possibilities of musical expression than most of the more famous legends of \\"pop\\" culture.For a brief overview of Buckley the artist, try reading my review of his Goodbye and Hello; otherwise, Blue Melody is the perfect portrait of the man, his music and his legacy. It is not quite a biography, though it tells a great deal about his early life, his relationships and the arc of his career; it also offers some deeply insightful speculations into the psychological forces that shaped a life of extraordinary openness, love and beauty, and simultaneous self-destruction, interpersonal excess, instability and alienation. From his unique perspective as Tim's best friend and faithful musical colorist (he is a fine and unusual guitarist/pianist himself), Underwood illuminates the often inscrutable paths that Buckley took from one musical inspiration to another. He charts the transformations and distortions in Buckley's personal life that must be seen as the tragic price of living as an acutely sensitive and powerful antenna to the world and to the soul - he comes across as a man barely able to hang onto his relentless need to explore and transform, his desperation to summon and then cast off skins and shells as though ghosts of an untenable life. He felt too much, perceived and responded from within with too much intensity for a sustainable life; as Underwood suggests, through all the pain, it was as though Buckley knew he needed to write and record as much as possible before his time ran out.Underwood was there with Buckley through most of his albums, through the richness of the New York and California music scenes of the late sixties, and was party and partner in the most wildly creative and diverse period of Buckley's career, as well as co-traveler along the real and figurative roads that took them around the world, between gigs and albums. His writing style is romantic and evocative, but he displays an unstinting clarity and willingness to analyze. A mature writer unafraid of ambiguity and emotional overflow, he offers the rhapsodic sense of a time and a place alongside the irony born of reflection upon blunt facts and an acute awareness of the dark side - a darkness he experienced first hand, both with Buckley, and, revealingly, in painful separation from his friend.This is a memoir, first and foremost, but it will please lovers of the biographical form, fans of Tim Buckley and students of the American history of the sixties and seventies. It will surely appeal to students of the creative personality who will appreciate a portrait of the quintessential tortured genius whose flame burned out at an age when most flames are still rising.Recommended without reservation. Now go buy some Tim Buckley CD's, and certainly buy the book."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"I can't praise this book enough. It's a gift to any Tim Buckley fan from Tim's personal and professional friend, Lee Underwood. It's poignant, honest, revealing, and answered many of my questions regarding Tim. This is Tim's story. This is Lee's story. For Mr. Underwood, I'm sure this work was cathartic on so many levels. Nothing is sugar-coated, nothing is romanticized regarding him or Tim. It's so real, so real. He has poured out personal memories, both dark and light, and has served them to his readers, one moment in a beautiful jeweled goblet, and in the next-- a blood and tear stained napkin. Lee didn't dictate this story to a ghost writer, he wrote this himself. The delivery is brilliant. Underwood has a gift of words and a succinct way to deliver them. I laughed. I cried.

You will miss Tim even more when you are finished with it."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"BLUE MELODY is a biography of musician Tim Buckley by his long-time lead guitarist Lee Underwood, who worked with Buckley from before this recording of his first album in 1966 to his tragic death in 1975. Underwood not only knew Buckley intimately and can share many stories of his life, but he also appreciated him selflessly and at times the book approaches hagiography.While the strongest part of Underwood's biography is Buckley's folk period, up until around 1969, I was happy to see him dedicate a great deal of space to the era of STARSAILOR, which Buckley--as well as many fans--considered his masterpiece. Underwood discusses the impact of the album on the music world and concert-goers, and speaks about the musical innovations of that superlative album. The work is divided into two sections, in which the first--the bulk of the book--charts Buckley's life, and the second recounts the circumstances of his death and lasting impact.This book has a lot of problems. For one, it appears to be a vanity-press offering with little professional editing. Underwood's writing is cliched and repetitious, with the same handful of positive adjectives (\\"beautiful\\", \\"sensitive\\", \\"immaculate\\") used to describe every person he liked. His biggest failing, however, is that he often gets so lost in his memories that Tim Buckley is left beside and the reader wades through Underwood's fond recollections of his own personal life, with all its drug use and illicit road sex.The last chapter of the book concerns Jeff Buckley, and Underwood swings between lightly praising him and harshly criticizing him as an unappreciative son and a man of limited talent and even more limited acheivement. I found this last section incoherent and quite unfair, for there are many people who are fans of both Tim and Jeff without feeling that the father's career was betrayed by the son's.BLUE MELODY is a poorly-written and edited recollection that is only for diehard fans of Tim Buckley. I would encourage those looking to know something about the all-too-brief life of this great artist to turn to David Browne's biography of Tim and Jeff DREAM BROTHER."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"Lee Underwood's \\"Blue Melody\\"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Rememberedis a painstaking and highly personal recollection of singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, one of the most enigmatic musicians to emerge during the 1960s. Told from Underwood's singular perspective as Buckley's longtime sideman and collaborator, this heartfelt effort offers unique insights into the life, character, and creative processes of a gifted and staunchly independent artist. Blessed with a voice of exceptional range and rich tonality, Tim Buckley boldly crossed traditional boundaries to give us some of the most beautiful and stirring music of his era. While perhaps overly, if inescapably, subjective, Underwood has nevertheless presented a deservedly reverent narrative of the all too brief career of this talented but ultimately self-destructive personality."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone familiar with Tim's music. To get the most out of the book, you should be intimately familiar with the majority of it, if not all.

I think that any music enthousiast can enjoy this, whether they appreciate Tim's music or not. There is more that music here, it just goes beyond that. Thanks to Lee and Tim for these moments."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"Tim Buckley was a musician from the 1960s and 70s whose life ended tragically at the age of 28 by a heroin overdose. His style was hard to label; he was influenced by a plethora of people, musically by names such as Dylan Thomas and Nat King Cole and literarily by Lorca and Rilke. He refused to be tied down, making CDs as diverse as his folk oriented first album Tim Buckley, his somewhat psychedelic and strange Lorca, and the sexy dance-music album Greetings from LA.Lee Underwood was Buckley's guitarist and best friend for many years. He experienced countless moments with Buckley and brings memories into this book. His personal relationship with Buckley allows for greater insight into the man as a person and not just as an artist. On the downside, it also makes him incredibly biased, and Underwood is often quite redundant about Buckley's talents. In addition, as many of the stories are based on memories, the book is only vaguely chronological. It also includes a lot of information about Underwood himself, such as his relationships with women and his bout with alcoholism.Perhaps the biggest hindrance to the book is the fact that most of Buckley's lyrics were unable to be published. Coupled with the inaccessibility of many of Buckley's albums, the reader could feel a bit lost for some references.The book is supplemented by a few interview transcripts, a discography, a bibliography, and an index.Many people know Tim Buckley simply as the father of Jeff Buckley; this is how I came to find this book. There are many similarities between the two, some of them are discussed in the text, but it is obvious that the two were very different people. If one finds it difficult to separate the two, this book would be an excellent source.Even if one does not like Tim Buckley's music, it is easy to respect his musical views and ideas. He was an intelligent man, a gifted artist, and a fascinating musical figure."},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"I picked this book up as soon as it was released, and read it completely soon after, I couldn't put it down.

The info gained is stuff you *won't read anywhere else, and his poem to Tim is moving (yes this guy can write some beautiful poetry too) BUY IT!Thanks so much for writing the book Mr.Underwood!!Daniel"},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"For those of you who love the work of Tim Buckley, Blue Melody is the final song written on the most important album of all, and the essential companion to your treasured collection of Buckley's music.In this book, Tim is remembered with love, honesty and respect for his short, but creatively magnificent life. Author Lee Underwood, Tim's lead guitarist and obviously the closest of friends, was a huge part of that life with his own place amongst the shadows and light surrounding Tim. As both a friend and a conceptual helper, Underwood's knowledge and support played an important role in Tim's extraordinary creative evolution.Blue Melody pulls no punches about the often destructive and hedonistic lifestyle Tim and others led, but that is part of its addictive charm. It is truly the evocation of an age now sadly past, which many of us tragically missed out on.This is no conventional biography by any means. Most biographies are read from beginning to end and put to one side, sometimes forever. Blue Melody will be dipped into again and again, for a Buckley fact, for the emotions behind a song, for insights regarding the creative process, or the desire to open one's imagination and relive the sights, the sounds, and the lifestyles of the musical age surrounding Tim and his fellow artists.In Blue Melody, Underwood has created a tapestry of colours for us to enjoy whenever we need to. It is a book that is written with music infusing every word, and packed with the sort of aesthetic and psychological insights this reader wanted to know. He is remembering Buckley not only as a witness of events in Buckley's life, but as a close friend writing with the wisdom of age and the passage of time. He now has the ability to view Tim as a subtle influence on generations of musician since, like a stone cast in the water, whose circles ripple ever outward getting larger as they travel. Buckley was a true original, and a musician well ahead of his time creatively.One would hope that some time in the future, a similar close and loving friend will write a Blue Melody for Jeff Buckley, a young man who had only just begun to travel in his father's footsteps. Underwood's chapter about Jeff was far more real, fair, balanced, and true than anything else I have heard, read or seen about this man.This book will always live with my music collection, and there will never come a time when I will not want to dip into it for something to think about. It's that sort of treasure!"},{"Title":"Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Remembered","review":"As a biographer, I read countless books centered on people of fame.&quot;Blue Melody&quot; stands as one of the most fascinating,beautifully written, honest portrayals of friendship I have ever read.

The trading firm of Bent and St. Vrain had built it in 1833 above the present site of Pueblo, Colorado, where Fountain Creek empties into the Arkansas River. It rose from the prairie like an adobe castle reminiscent of feudal Europe. It stood both as a guardian of U.S. expansionism and American capitalism. Built by the brothers Bent--William, Charles, and George--and their partners, Ceran and Marceline St. Vrain, by 1846 the fort had for more than a decade held undisputed sway over the economic and social institutions of the vast northern territory then under the nominal suzerainty of the republic of Mexico. More than a frontier trading post, Bent's Fort--Fort William as some called it--served as a crossroads of the West where travelers met to trade news and goods, replenish stores, recuperate from their experiences on the trail, and prepare mentally for the ardors of what followed.A 137 by 178 foot roughly rectangular structure constructed of adobe four-feet thick and standing fifteen feet high, the fort was a bastion built to withstand any siege that might come. Two turretlike towers at opposite corners of the stockade stood thirty feet high and ranged ten feet wide, loopholed for gunners and topped by artillery, ensuring that any enemy had a disadvantage. Inside, the trading firm of Bent and St. Vrain that owned the fort had attempted to make it entirely self-sufficient. It had living quarters, storerooms, warehouses, a smithy and wainwright shop, an ice house, and recreation facilities that included a billiards room. The owners kept as many as 150 men employed there much of the year and Indians and trappers often wintered within easy distance of the comforts the fort provided.In \\"Ritual Ground\\" Douglas C. Comer, an archeologist with the U.S. National Park Service, has written something of a history of the fort and an analysis of its place in the Santa Fe and Native American trade of the region. Indeed, it is essentially a meditation on the meaning of ritual in the interactions of diverse cultures and in some cases a meditation on meaning. He views the fort as a vehicle for the introduction of \\"modernity\\" into the region and the peoples that lived there in the first half of the nineteenth century. In a challenging and sometimes difficult analysis, Comer presents a compelling case for the significance of the fort and the ritual of trade and what it signified for the incorporation of the American Southwest into the United States in 1846. He argues that ritual was central to the trade that took place between the Americans and the Cheyenne and Arapaho, not just in the context of beads, mirrors, and other items that had more ceremonial than practical use, but also in utilitarian items such as weapons and tools. Comer's analysis is best when he deals with these specific trade items.Comer emphasizes socio- and ethno-history in \\"Ritual Ground,\\" taking a post-modern perspective that draws on the work on Michel Foucault and others. The ritual interactions between the various groups coming together at Bent's Old Fort serve as the core of his analysis. Equally important, Comer discusses the present-day reconstruction of the fort--it had been destroyed by fire/explosion in 1849--and the reenactment of rituals there that seek to mythologize the past in a way acceptable to modern society. For instance, one group of Mormons actively works to gain representation in the historical life of the fort, despite slim evidence that there was any involvement. In so doing, they create a past more to their liking.\\"Ritual Ground\\" is a challenging but somewhat inaccessible work. If you are seeking a good narrative of the history of this episode in the history of the Southwest, no better work exists than David Lavender's \\"Bent's Fort\\" (University of Nebraska Press, 1972 rep. of 1954 ed.), although it is now somewhat outdated. If you are seeking a deep analysis of the significance of the fort for the development of the Southwest and the role of post-modern analysis in illuminating it, then this is a valuable work."},{"Title":"Ritual Ground: Bent's Old Fort, World Formation, and the Annexation of the Southwest","review":"This book is all over the place, now, then, what if, how do you feel, alignment of the stars, ....I actually thought this was going to be a historical account of Bents Fort with perhaps a new angle.Seems, the angle is way to steep for me.

It is a celebration of life!"},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"At one point in this sad autobiography the author states, \\"We are foolish, those of us who think we can escape the traps of aging.\\" In Mr. Debaggio's case he found himself caught in one of those traps when he was 57 years old. Healthy and robust, with an optimistic look to the future he one day is told that he is a victim of early onset Alzheimer's disease. The author, who is a talented writer of books on gardening, decides to write a book describing his gradual mental deterioration.Losing My Mind shifts back and forth between comments on his present condition, excerpts from medical articles, and reminiscences on his past life. This is not an inspirational book. Mr. DeBaggio is depressed, frightened, and filled with despair over his future. Fortunately his writing skills are still intact enough that he can fluently describe his descent into the abyss.It is not the author alone who suffers. His wife is grief stricken that she is going to gradually lose her life's companion, and she feels totally frustrated in knowing that she can do nothing to help him. His grow son shares her grief, and also worries that he will eventually suffer the same illness.Increasingly he has to hunt for words to express himself. He raises herbs for a living, and begins to forget their names. He goes to a store to operate a copying machine, and finds he can't figure out how to operate this rather simple device. Writing this book helps him to hold on to our world. He spends a lot of time reminiscing about his childhood, because those memories still are clear in his mind.Mr. DeBaggio has received, as he puts it, a death sentence, and that thought remains constantly in mind. He courageously tackles each day one by one, but knows he is fighting a losing battle. I am an older person who has a deteriorating condition that gradually causes me increasing pain, so I have a glimmer of what he is going through. What will our status be next month, next year? It is interesting that he mentions that dealing with his diagnosis is one thing, but dealing with some of his well-wishers is often more difficult. There are the people who suggest that if he would just take some sort of sea weed or herbal medicine he would be restored to normal. Folks like that mean well, but their suggestions show a total lack of understanding of the forces at work in his physical condition, and, in a sense, diminish the seriousness of the problem (I've experienced the same thing).This book is remarkable. It gives us a view of the problems, thoughts and torment that are part of an Alzheimer's sufferer's life. It is anything but a joyous book. It is one that points out how close we live to the threat of ultimate disaster."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"If you or a love one is struggling with Alzheimer's Disease this is a must read.

It is an extremely accurate presentation of how alzheimer's slowly robs an individual of their ability to think and reason and how that impacts on the immediate family and caregivers. This review is based on my observations of my mother-in-laws progress through the disease and her passing in 1994. The final two years of her life was spent in a alzheimer's ward where she no longer recognized her own family. My wife was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers in 2002, but with proper medical follow-up and new medications the alzheimers progress was significantly slowed. \\"Losing My Mind\\" was a great help in knowing what to expect and how to react."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"This was the earliest, I believe, of the first-person accounts of Alzheimer's: a book triggered by a series of interviews with DeBaggio on National Public Radio, interviews which alerted millions of people to the anguish of early-onset Alzheimer's.The subject is inherently gripping: how does someone whose mind is dissolving--whose hippocampus is turning into gorgonzola, as one sympathetic reviewer describes his own condition--gather his wits enough to write a coherent book? Primarily, in DeBaggio's case, by relying on his mostly-intact memory of his youth and middle years, before dementia set in. (Also, to lesser effect, by inserting numerous long quotations from a Progress Report on Alzheimer's from the National Institute on Aging.)DeBaggio has grown forgetful, as of the writing of this book, but is still much in control of his faculties. He can write, and write clearly, and wants to tell his story before he dies. His diagnosis, he explains, grabbed him by the throat: he'd been given a death sentence. But \\"A few days later I realized good might come of this. After forty years of pussyfooting with words, I finally had a story of hell to tell.\\"And stories of hell make for compelling books. Not all DeBaggio's reminiscences light up the page, and the long academic quotations sometimes break up the flow. But I perk up at this candid admission: \\"I have enjoyed my life but I have a nagging feeling I have not had much fun. I never slept around and got drunk; instead I read and got politicized.\\" He looks back on his youth and sees that \\"struggle and hard work sapped love of life. There is no gaiety in me now, if there ever was. I am as boring as the flat cornfields of Iowa that surround the little down of Eldora where I was born.\\"When he writes like that, in the most personal way, he's not boring at all, but alive and tender, a man with a hell of story."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"This was very poetic; lots of feelings revealed.

It can happen to Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Christians, Muslims, males and females, rich and poor. It has not spared ex-presidents.

My own CRS has caused me to become unable to view complicated movies such as &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Godsford Park&quot; or multilayered television such as &quot;West Wing&quot; or &quot;CSI.&quot; Similarly, the ability to complete reading a book more than 3 or 4 pages at a time has departed, never to return. But, like when I received &quot;The Forgetting&quot; by Shenk, I was able to read this 207 page saga, cover to cover, in less than a single 24 hour time span, aka &quot;one day&quot;. My window of clarity, which happens less than once a quarter, gave me the grace to assimilate deBaggio's message, just as I was able to do before I became an Emeritus Professor in 1993.The writing by DeBaggio is superb, his poetry shines on every page! And he has been blessed with outsanding collaborators and editors who polished his rough diamond into the superb blue white gem which &quot;Losing My Mind&quot; is. De Baggio does NOT record a descent to madness, but rather an ascent into a Mount Carmel of shining sanity, despite his testimony to the contrary. The literature of ALZ is overwhelmed with desciptions, diagnoses,and understandings for/of the saintly Caregivers and facilitators who guide our descent into a Dante inferno. BUT, there is next to nothing wherein the person diagnosed with Alzheimer's tells us what is going on inside their crania. &quot;Speaking with Alzheimer's&quot; and &quot;Into the Labyrinth [out-of-print]&quot; are two other exceptions.Once we are diagnosed, it is as if we no longer are sentient human beings, capable of intellectual cognition. Our ability to convery our intelligence and meanings to others does deteriorate rapidly, particulary with aphasia, but the human entity is still there and functioning even though the ability to respond has vanished: i.e. a CRSer hears and understands all that is said in his/her presence, even though the ALZer cannot communicate that understanding.Inspired by DeBaggio, I, too, have commenced a Journal of sorts, with the hope of telling others exactly what my sensations are as my hippocampus turns into Gorgonzola. {In my own situation, I have rewired my brain to eliminate frustration over a lack of word recall, and working memory recall, with the help of positive reinforcement, Qi Gong Nirvana state deep meditation, Vitamin B6, B12,E, and Aricet. Thus I have forced a window of clarity to write this critique, and DeBaggio has given this clinically diagnosed unipolar Depressive and CRSer hope that he can aid others before I am unable to lift my head or swallow. Like DeBaggio, the light at the end of my tunnel is an ALZ locomotive, at full speed, headed towards my demise, yet like him, I hope I can locate an agent, collaborator, and editor, so that my own Pilgrim's Progress will be a gift to my seven children and eleven grandchildren, {I include Andrew!}, when the words jumble and chaos reigns supreme, as it already has commenced.Thank you very much Thomas, for your Augustinian &quot;Confession!&quot; I wish all of us fellow travelors, a &quot;Safe Return.&quot;"},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"There is nothing so sad as to see a person who was once consumed with a passion for life, abundant with wisdom and intellect, active, alert and filled with a wealth of personal stories, overcome with Alzheimer's.

Unless, you personally know someone with the disease, it is difficult to understand how it affects one's social life, their loss of verbal communication skills and their thought process. Debaggio gives reader an inside view and clearer understanding from a patient's perspective of what it is like to live with this devastating disease on a daily basis. The author's courage and strength in the face of adversity will touch readers to their very core.

Along with these two themes, Mr. DeBaggio inserts clippings from his own research on the disease in every few pages.This is a great read for anyone who would like to venture into the mind of someone suffering from Alzheimer's. But be warned, the book does not contain any sparks of hope or messages of positive thinking.

There's something about the thought of no longer being in control on the &quot;inside&quot; that is far more frightening than losing control on the &quot;outside.&quot;In *Losing My Mind,* Thomas Debaggio has voiced those fears for us. One of this book's many merits is that he never tries to softpedal the horror of what's happening to him. In this regard, his memoir is very much reminiscent of &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie.* He describes the personal feeling of disintegration and hopelessness, telling us, himself, and his wife that at times all he wants is to be hugged--the whimper of a lost and frightened child. He also describes the incredible burden that his illness places on his wife and son; they, after all, will have to deal with the condition long after Thomas is no longer present. But the book is also a testament to the human spirit and spirituality. The very fact that Debaggio can write such a moving tale while in the grips of a reason-destroying illness, and still find wonder and beauty and joy and humor in life is well worth pondering. His memoir will make readers appreciate life and loved ones."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"I just finished this book and it gave me a better understanding of what my Mother is going through. She won't talk about it but this book gave me the best insiders look at her life with Alzheimer's. I now understand her moods, her fears, her anger. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's family member has been diagnoised with Alzheimer's. Also, what was extremely great was all the medical terms and current discoveries in treatment. Your local M.D. often can't recommend or give you a contact to join a support group. The medical community by large needs to get with the program as well as the State and Federal government. More and more folks will be diagnoised with Alzheimer's because we are all living longer. They, the politicians need to deal with it like we the family members and care givers, and victums! Thank You."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"By all accounts it is an insidious disease. Four million Americans and counting are its victims. There are no survivors and it strikes as early as 27 and as late as 80. Until now precious few first-hand accounts of its relentless, irreversible, maddening progression have been available in other than clinical texts or coping guides for families.Debaggio, an accomplished writer and highly successful independent businessman was, at age 57 in 1999, in the prime of his life.During a routine visit to his physician he answered the question,\\"Is there anything you want to tell me?\\" with a casual remark that he was \\"...having trouble remembering things that are basic to my work, things I have known and now can't remember.\\"The result was a devastating diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer's and a remarkable effort by a writer to document his experiences and provide a first-hand account that is both therapeutic to DeBaggio and of immeasurable comfort to individuals and families experiencing the symptoms of this hideous disease.In a refreshingly readable, narrative style DeBaggio provides the reader with a personal record of his illnesses progression while weaving his recollections of his life prior to the diagnosis with his medical records and excerpts from leading medical journals that results in a three-part story that is unforgettable.The end result is a multi-dimensional account of what he calls \\"...a man dying in slow motion.\\" It is the story of frightening memory loss and the realization that you can no longer drive or perform simple routine tasks that have comprised your daily work habits for over twenty-five years. His story of being unable to operate the cash register at his world-renowned herb and vegetable business is poignant and illustrative of the power of the disease.His description, after having been a writer for most of his life, of the impact of Alzheimer's is especially telling: \\"I have only a few seconds to capture a thought before it disappears from my mind. Scraps of ideas flit like birds. This is the worst thing to happen to a writer.\\"While the book contains understandable fear, rage, frustration and pity at the inevitable progress of the disease, there are also doses of hope and love and understanding that are of much comfort to those with the disease and their families and friends. In the end his message of love, both for and of his family and friends is of inestimable value and hope for four million souls and counting.This is an extraordinary book. It is a rare, intimate, coherent look at Alzheimer's disease by a talented writer that managed to reduce to paper the lessons learned about the loss of memory and its tragic consequences.My father-in-law recently died of this disease. The book has been of immeasurable help in understanding his struggle."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"It is a provocative memoir of a man who courageously sharing with the world some of its last moment of having a memory or human's most important asset that defined us all in this world. This book provides a glimpse of the Alzheimer's dim world besides exposing human's natural reaction of disbelief, denial, anger, fear and misery when unexpectedly been granted to such fate. The author is very open in revealing his raw emotion and perception on what he's going through and what lies ahead of him and the impact of such ailment to his loved one. The narrative is beautifully written with piercing essence; the thought and feeling expressed is real and very affecting to any soul who realise that as aging is never an option there's always possibility that we or someone we loved would be destined to such ending fate. Tragic if it happened too early. It taught the importance to make the most of every passing moment in life and to fight till the end of what's left of sanity. This book is worth reading, and gives a clearer understanding about the illness. Even though the description of the author's suffering is heartbreaking but his fighting spirit should be commendable. The humanity that he believe and fight shines and touches me through the words written.I wish him all the best, and to his loved one may all the good memories stay alive even though he may reside in his own world one day. Well, nothing is more important than having a memory thus it should be cherished as far as we still live."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"This book recounts the downward decline of the mental state of an Alzheimer's sufferer. At the age of 57, DeBaggio was a successful businessman who ran a plant nursery out of his home. Some annoying problems recalling scientific details of his plants led him to ask his doctor if there might be something wrong with his brain. He consulted with a neurologist who subjected him to a battery of tests, which all pointed to early onset Alzheimer's. In this book, DeBaggio describes his diagnosis, treatment, and losses of mental acuity. One aspect of Alzheimer's is that memories from childhood return with new vividness, so interwoven in this story are the memoirs of DeBaggio's life, from the meeting of his parents to his birth, childhood, and earlier career as a journalist. Juxtaposed with these details are descriptions of his present mental state, his meetings with doctors and struggles with daily tasks, as well as lengthy informative quotations about Alzheimer's research.The prose floats from one time period to another, repeating itself often with slight variations. But instead of being tedious, this comes across as being an extremely honest portrayal of a person with failing memory who is struggling to communicate. DeBaggio's life story in itself is fascinating and very well-told. The insights the book provides on what it is like to live with Alzheimer's are most informative and riveting."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"Intimate this book is indeed, and heartbreaking in its Alzheimer's-inspired eclecticism. DeBaggio gathers snippets about the disease from medical journals and mixes them with his own perceptions from the inside of a brain gone bad.At times, I admit to feeling frustrated with his \\"wallowing\\" -- repeating over and over the gloomiest sorts of thoughts about his imminent death. Much more affecting, in my opinion, were his insights into the role of memory in forming our human minds, and how tenuous our life becomes when memory is no longer reliable.For anyone dealing with the early stages of this disease, this book is a treasure -- uplifting and thought-provoking. Limited by its very nature, it cannot show much of what lies beyond the short \\"early dementia\\" period DeBaggio is capable of cataloguing. But beyond that, as DeBaggio says, we must all embark on our own journey, our own struggle with words and our own grapplings with memory.Even for someone like myself who is, thank God, not coping with Alzheimer's, this is that rare book that offers readers a chance to hold the author's hand as he is unwillingly tugged along the first few steps of one of the most hellish of human journeys."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"I feel privileged to be one of the first to review Tom's book, even though I've not yet finished reading it - it hurts to read it. Almost 20 years ago, after my mother died, I wanted to plant an herb garden. It was Tom's writing I discovered, and when I subsequently learned he, too, lived in Virginia and owned a retail herb business, my husband and I visited him. He was wonderful, and took the time to explain about the various herbs I purchased that day, especially the rosemary plants he was so proud of.A few weeks later, my rosemary plants had brown tips, so I wrote to Tom. He wrote back and explained what was wrong, and sent me some information on herbs. I caught a love of gardening, especially of herbs, from Tom. When my husband and I recently purchased some rural property, the first thing I thought was \\"Oh, I have to visit Tom for some herbs.\\"It was shortly after that that I learned of Tom's Alzheimer's, and I was heartbroken for him and his family. He is truly a remarkable man, and the writing of this book is proof of that. It is an important book, but having met him and been the beneficiary of his kindness, quite difficult to read. I wish him and his family all the best."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"I found Mr. Debaggio's book to be a very honest, raw and from the heart look at Alzheimer's Disease from the inside.

This book is a must for caregivers as well as health care professionals."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"There have been many books on caring for Alzheimer's patients, but this autobiography comes from a man who discovers early on that he has Alzheimer's in its worst form.

Some may find DeBaggio's anguish a bit excessive, but to me it was a genuine expression of his emotion, not buffered by what is 'proper'."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"While this book was informative and gave important and current facts about Alzheimer's research, I found myself thinking there was no \\"wow\\" factor in this book. The author, Thomas DiBaggio, talks about an uneventful past and repeats over and over that he is having difficulty writing the novel, but there was only one point in the book where I was actually captivated by his own thoughts. The most enjoyable part was reading about the current research. The book may have been more interesting if it had been attempted in the later stages of Alzheimer's because, at this stage in his disease, this book made DiBaggio seem like a depressed man, with a mild memory impairment. I do commend him though for attempting to write this novel during this difficult time in his life, I just felt that his writing was not entirely captivating."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"I'm also in the minority of readers who found this book not good. I don't have Alzheimer's but I was interested in reading the book as my father dealt with dementia in the last few years of his life. The author prefaces his book by stating that he has three narrative threads--the clinical commentary, his memories, and his present day--but the pacing and weaving of the three threads is average at best. I guess this is what the mind of a demented person is supposed to be like but from the perspective of a non-demented reader, I didn't think it made for good reading."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"I'm in the minority...I was disappointed in this book. It feels almost cruel to write a negative review because the author is admirably open and sincere, and his suffering is profound. But he seems to suffer from untreated depression as well as from Alzheimers. His unremitting anger and despair make his experiences (and ours as readers) even sadder than they need to be. I kept wishing he would take the energy he was using to write the book and put it into being more open with his family, or finding a therapist or a hospice-type program that would provide him and his family with ongoing support. Altogether a sad and moving book, but also a frustrating one."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"I do not wish to minimize the true suffering of this author who offers a firsthand account of living with Alzheimer's disease. However, I dare say that he does not represent the views of most people with Alzheimer's disease. Throughout the book, he paints the darkest possible picture of the disease and offers virtually no hope to people with the disease or those families and friends who provide care. Is there not more to life than memory and thinking? A few others who have written firsthand accounts of Alzheimer's and many others who have spoken about living with it have discovered YES! Although the author mentions his social circle including his wife and son, it's almost in passing. He characterizes his experience as a terrible and lonely hell. Must it be this private and sad agony at every moment of every day as he suggests?? It would be interesting to hear the views of his family and friends as they struggle to come to terms with brain impairments and his dismal view of the world. Unfortunately, the author offers little insight into his social resources and it seems clear that his internal resources are nearly depeleted. If you risk reading this book, take a Prozac tablet first. I wish the author would do the same to help him live his life to the fullest. I see nothing positive in this depressing story."},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","review":"I agree with a couple of the other reviewers in that it is hard to condemn this book since the author has an incurable disease. However, I find his endless harping on his mental condition and just how black everything is to take away from the other excellent material in the book - quotes from various other sources about the disease and its ramifications.He implies that this is the worst disease anyone could ever get. I think of Parkinson's (and Michael J. Fox), being paralyzed (and Christopher Reeve), muscular dystrophy and MS - and how all of those worsen over time. I also think about acceptance and taking action as the two people mentioned above have done. The action I see this author taking is to constantly dwell on his own decline. This is not a book I can recommend to others with the same affliction unless you can use it as a springboard to act in a different manner."},{"Title":"The Hundred Years War (A Capricorn giant)","review":"I found this gem by accident and can't put it down.The author focuses alot on economic causes of the war(or wars)yet is careful to distance himself from a \\"Marxian\\" interpretation.Therefore he comes off more as a \\"Beardian\\".There is a good chapter on the English wool market and its European markets and competitors.He also says that the succession to the numerous European thrones(along with the \\"fringe benefits\\") were not the sole reason for these Wars. Then he goes on to a detailed explanation of how these succesions pretty much pushed the already tense situation into conflict.There is also a good breakdown on the different territories and their claims of rulership, so detailed in fact that it becomes confusing in a good way.(You realize this is a really complex affair.)Just the area of the present day Netherland seems a morass not to mention the French area.Also there is a good chapter about the Anglo-Scottish conflict and its bearing on the Hundred Years War.Alot of books on this subject don't even mention the Scots whose allies were the French.The maps in this book however are not real good.Also included are the negotiations by the dual/papacy on behalf of the French and English.The popes hoped to avoid war and bring a just peace,instead they only made the situation worse with both sides claiming papal justification and the popes giving an impotent sigh realizing noone listens to him anyways.Oh well plenty of wealth and concubines to tide them over, in between arguments over who was the \\"real pope\\".!Have we the stirrings of the Reformation here?The popes during this period want all sides to stop fighting and unite for a crusade against the Ottomans.The battles of the Hundred Years wars are deliberately downplayed because the author obviously feels they were overall not that significant to the period(unless of course you were killed or maimed at one).He spends more time talking about the effects of \\"the plagues\\"(Black Death and the numerous Flu strains) than he does about the Battle of Crecy and Poitier combined.He portrays the war as a dynastic squabble between 2 European-French-Anglo families,that being Plantagenet vs. Valois.He also gives a good description of the numerous,\\"sword for hire\\",\\"Routiers\\" or mercenary armies who really kept this conflict going.He summarizes the Valois and Plantagenet families as dynasties whose ambitions monstrously exceeded their ability to finance the conflict.One of the main reasons for the length of the conflict was due to the ever-changing Burgundian alliance,one year favoring the English and the next favoring the French.Also a good deal of pagespace is devoted to the French speaking ruler Charles the VI who was completely incompetent suffering from some type of disease that caused costly mental lapses.(The author points out that the English king Henry IV,who was Charles' grandson,suffered from the same type ailment.)Charles was unable to negotiate a Franco-Burgundian alliance and as a result the Burgundians received a better deal,at least under Charles reign,from the English.There were 2 major French victories toward the latter part of the war that are hardly mentioned in other works.At Formigny the English were decisively beaten,and the table had turned on the English at least interms of expense.English taxation of Burgundy and other continental areas actually did more harm to English arms than battle itself.As for Joan of Arc she receives a whole chapter and the author tries to downplay her role.However by giving her a whole chapter in a book that scarcely mentions Agincourt or Poitier, you have to ask if she didn't have alot more influence than she is sometimes granted in other works. By the way,if you like the movie the Messenger,you should read the chapters on Joan and Charles VII in this book because it will give you a different view of Charles \\"abandonment\\" of Joan at a critical stage in the reconquest.In the movie Charles comes off as a sleazy double dealer but in this work he seems to be one of her biggest supporters."},{"Title":"The Hundred Years War (A Capricorn giant)","review":"My son loves history very much and specifically asked for this book for christmas, it came in a timely manner and he has enjoyed it very much.It has been a very good resource for him in his hundred year war studies.

Children was as interesting as the rest of the Quartet, and I was pleased to know what happens to the characters, and it's great to know that Ender will live on--through a life that he created. Cycles, cycles, cycles."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"It was an interesting read. I thought it was a little toospiritual at times but in the end a satisfying book. It is obviouslynot the last of this series - far too many loose ends and mysteries unsolved."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"As hard as Card may have tried, the charm of the earlier books in the series is still out of his reach. The book is simply lacking. Card abandoned his usual pacing and wrote a book that feels completely rushed. Any part of the book could have been so much more. Even the superscience Card adds into the plot cannot make up for bad characterization, lack of description, and poor logic."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind is an excellent read. The plotline is intense, the interpersonal-relationships are complex, and the characters are realistic. Card answers all the questions he brought up in the first three books (which, in my opinion, were better). My only complaint is that some of Card's spiritualism can get pretty bizarre at times. The bit about auia's struck me as unrealistic. But as a whole, Children of the Mind is definately a worthy choice."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"&quot;Children of the Mind,&quot; the long-awaited final installment of Card's wonderful Ender Series, is the best of the lot. I was never much of an SF fan before reading &quot;Ender's Game&quot; two years ago, and now Card has ruined me: I can't read any other SF novels without thinking how shallow they are compared to these four.COTM finishes the series better than anyone could have hoped. My greatest fear, going into this book, was that Card would finish off his character in a fiery battle with the Lusitania Fleet, as many other so-called SF writers would have. However, Ender dies in a perfectly natural way at the completion of his mission (to restore the buggers). I felt that the deepest, most moving character was the ansible-being, Jane. She moved me with her deep compassion for Ender and his new family.To those who have panned this book in their reviews: What were you thinking?! Everyone should read this book. Of course it's not a stand-alone novel, that was never Card's intention! Perhaps those used to &quot;normal&quot; (read:awful and shallow) SF might not like this book; they should read some real literature then come back to COTM. They will find that only Card's work stands up to that of such great modern authors as Doyle, O'Brian, and Gibbons."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"With a typical series, the first book is the best and then the series loses steam as you read more books. But with the Ender series, it just keeps getting better! Children of the Mind is a great piece of fiction, with a great plot, good character development and the style that only Card can do. I couldn't put it down. The only tragedy of this book that it is the last of the series and that there will be no more stories of Ender the Xenocide, Speaker for the Dead, and one of the greatest characters ever created"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying. The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about. The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it. Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets. Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS. The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind. I couldn't take the dialogue anymore. That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species.If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The series is awesome! I love Ender, Bean, and the others. I found Card's approach to childrens' grasp of world affairs intriguing. I've reread the series a few times and each time caught a new detail I missed about the relationships, conflicts and ideas on what it would be like if children fought the battles. Side point: just read a book by S.G. Rainbolt \\"Dear Sun, I Am Real\\" and he dedicated it to Orson Scott Card. He too used the approach of genius kids running things. I find that subject inexhaustible but delightful to read. Take a look. I recommend both."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"OSC is one of the best writers in the US today. In fact I will go so far as to say he is second only to Stephen King.This book is not a stand-alone book, it is a sequal to Ender's Game. I read this book around 1996. I heard about Ender's Shadow a month or two ago and have recently finished the series. I have read all of the Ender and Shadow series and will continue to do so as long as they keep being written.If you are not familiar with OSC, he is also the author/playright of the Abyss! Ender's Game is planned to be made into a movie by WB and the producer of a Perfect Storm.This book is about Ender's life off-planet after having saved the world. This book is very philosophical and has less action. It is a not as fast paced as Ender's Game. I would say more about the book, but I hate people giving away any information about books and movies so I won't."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I have read all four books of the Ender series in rapid-fire succession. Let me qualify that -- I have completed the first three books in the series and I am almost finished with &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;. But because life is short and I have other things to read, I am not going to finish it. In &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, Card loses control of his subject matter. There are too many subplots, too many weird happenings, and too little restraint in Card's imagination for the story to be either coherent or reasonable. Even Fantasy writing must adhere to the disciplines of the craft. &quot;Ender's Game&quot; was a disciplined effort marked by a lean prose style. &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; became denser in its presentation, but Card displayed generosity of spirit and compassion for wounded individuals and families. He touches upon some sensitive subjects (adultery, alcoholism, spousal abuse, and deception) that scar real families in real life. His treatment of religion is balanced and interesting and he resists the knee-jerk reaction of many contemporary writers to bash the Catholic Church. &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; is the high-point in the series. Things start to unravel a bit in &quot;Xenocide&quot; as Card attempts to weave multiple subplots (the 'piggies', the deadly descolada virus, the 'buggers', &quot;Jane&quot;, and the 'Godspoken' of the planet Path}. Still, there are some real insights into the human heart here that are compelling and Card's compassion for individuals is still central to the book. In &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; things get chaotic and, ultimately, very, very boring. Ender literally 'births' children of the mind who are his real bother and sister as they were in their youth. He does this while traveling in the 'Outside'. But are they really his brother and sister or are they really him? Meanwhile 'Jane' the sentient, omniscient being is really Ender too -- sort of. And the fate of piggies, the buggers, the descolada virus, the Planet Luistania, indeed the entire universe is in the balance. But we have a Polynesian holy man, a Chinese philosopher, and thinking trees who used to animals all working on the problem. Card has a real challenge to tie this all together. I appreciate his compassion, but he just went one book too far."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I couldn't wait for the paperback edition, this series is so good, I bought it in hardcover edition as soon as it came out.

You need to know the plot of at least &quot;Xenocide&quot; to understand &quot;Children of the Mind.&quot; Therefore you must have read &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; to understand &quot;Xenocide&quot;. You don't have to read &quot;Ender's Game&quot; to understand &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; but it would sure help and it is the best book in the series by far, and the best I have ever read.Assuming that you have read the other three then you would definitely want to read the last one. You don't have to rush out to the stores and buy the 25.00 hardcover, though, because it wasn't as astonishingly brilliant as &quot;Ender's Game&quot; but it is still a good read.The books seems to flow well until you notice that it doesn't really go anywhere. It gives you a conclusion but the problem with the ending is that it is rather limp.Unless this book is going to be followed by another one the ending is weak.Even with these weaknesses the quality writing of Orson Scott Card shines through to present an enjoyable, but not completely on par with the other Ender's Series books."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"With Ender's game, Card told us the story of a little boy whose games and personal problems touched all of humanity. Speaker for the Dead showed the games and the personal problems of the adult Ender, and now, with Children of the Mind, we see how once again they take on all-encompassing consequences.The story takes us from the planet Lusitania to all ends fof the hundred worlds, as Peter and Wang-mu seek to save not only the citizens of the planet, but also Jane, the brainchild of Ender and the buggers, and one of the three beings to which the title refers.The Characters they meet are wonderful. Card, known for characterization, does a brillant job of that, and also of forming the worlds that created them. This was a delightful peek at all sorts of Minds, and those thoughts which are thier true children."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I guess that _Ender's Game_ and _Speaker for the Dead_ are tough acts to follow, but I can't help feeling let down by this book. The first half, published as _Xenocide_, was quirky but full of ideas and characterization. This one gets bogged down with the weirdness of the young Valentine and Peter, and gets caught up in mysticism while trying to postulate a physical basis for the soul. More to the point, it really doesn't tie up all the loose ends and provide closure. If anything, it ends with an obvious lead-off to a next novel, which is odd since this is supposed to be the final one.All in all, I was annoyed and unsatisfied, not so much because it was an awful book -- Card is still Card -- but because it fell short of what it needed to be. If you've read the first three, you'll want to read this one, but maybe you should contain your enthusiasm and wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The fourth and final installment of the Ender saga continues where Xenocide left off. Lusitania is in imminent danger of destruction by the Lusitania Fleet, dispatched by Starways Congress 20 years earlier. The inhabitants of Lusitania, humans, piggies, and buggers alike, are busily boarding spacecraft and leaving to colonize other, far-off worlds in a last ditch effort to save their respective species.Meanwhile, Ender, through his offspring, Peter and Val, created in Ender's trip &quot;outside&quot; at the end of Xenocide, traverse The Hundred Worlds as they try to influence the thinking of Starways Congress to withdraw the Fleet and prevent a Second Xenocide. All the while, Ender himself lies weak and ill back on Lusitania in the company of his wife and sister. Unable to sustain itself as three entities, Ender's soul searches for a single manifestation. But which one?Jane as well, having been discovered and considered a &quot;virulent program&quot;, confronts the concept of &quot;death&quot; in human terms after &quot;living&quot; for 3000 years. She too must find a manifestation if she is to continue.A brash, young Fleet commander makes for a suspenseful ending.This book is an ABSOLUTE read for those that have completed the first three. If, however, you are just discovering Ender, the beloved boy-general, be certain to start with Ender's Game and read all four in chronological order. You won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind is a very good book. It gets into the nitty gritty emotions and feelings of the characters. A lot of the action is internalized. The book is also extremely philosophical. It discusses a lot of deep and lofty things. It is definitley a must read if you've read the others, but don't expect to pick it up and read it as a stand-alone book"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"From the best sci-fi author of this time we have the conclusion to one of the best series ever written.If you thought what Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin had to go through before was tough, wait until you see what transpires in Children of the mind! New characters help this aging star, and with the problems Lusitania faces they need everything they can get. When the book was finished, I flipped it over and began again"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I havnt finished this book yet but so far it seems that it is a good book however its hard to follow."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Nice conclusion to the series. Not so suitable as stand alone book, but as final capter of the set very satisfying. At the same time it is a real and interesting full storyline, not just a drawn out conclusion to fill the number of pages as planned. Very much liked the &#34;Jane&#34; storyline as added. Gives the story line an interesting new aspect which keps you interested."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I will read anything that Orson Scott Card writes.

Ender gets his rest, someone speaks for him at last, and life continues on."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I can't believe I have lived most of my life without reading Card. I thoroughly enjoy his writing - the stories and the philosophical discussions, and some historical teachings mixed in. Excellent series - recommend highly."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Orson Scott Card has a vivid imagination and an uncanny understanding of human nature. I enjoyed every minute of the book, and hated to put it down for eating, sleeping and working."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The science goes a little too fast for me, but the story line holds true. The family re-creation possibility makes it fun to contemplate."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Great story of how Ender once again figures out how to save the world and set up a new series of books."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I found this ending the best to the entire ender quartet, apart from Ender's Game, which really can't be compared to it. Why? Becacuse Ender's Game is a different type of book to the other 3 in the series. Ender's Game is really a pure science fiction book, whereas the others always dab slightly into philosophy. I found Children of the Mind absolutely wonderful as a suitable ending the the Ender series. The only flaw I think that is valid is the fact that occasionally, scenes are abruptly changed just as the story gets to a climax. This was rather dis-orientating, in my opinion"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This last book in Ender's saga was the weakest because it was just that; the last. Facing the daunting task of wrapping up all the loose ends of the story in a neat package, OSC does not achieve the level of suspense and drama that he does earlier in the series.Also, much of the story is very theoretical, and less convincing overall than the others.But despite its flaws, this book must be read by anyone who knows Ender, for we must know what happens. The ending of the novel is really quite nice, even touching, if we know and love the characters.And come on, if you've read the first three novels, it's hard not to love these characters, for they are some of the more intriguing and endearing characters in the genre of sci-fi. Read Children of the Mind, if only to see what happens in the end to Ender and Valentine."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I think Ender's Game could have ended after the end of that first book. I trudged through Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide and just wanted to finish the whole series. I was pleasently suprized with Children of the Mind. I was really interested if and how Jane would be saved, how the Fleet would have been stopped and so forth. This book I'd rank as #2, right after Ender's Game but the entire series is an existance in one's mind in itself."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Even after all the time spent reading the previous 3 books in the series I was a bit apprehensive when I bought this book. To be totally honest it was better than I expected. It was sad to see the end of the Ender series but the four books that there were, are some of the best literary works of this century. Still, you need to read the previous books before reading this one to get the gist of the story but once you take the time to do that, you will enjoy it thouroughly."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"As some people would say that this book wasn't entertaining, I would have to agree- to a certain extent. Although I thought this book was tedious in some places, such as Xenocide, this did have many enthralling parts in it and I think that the things that happened to the characters in this book makes it worth reading. I did find the book slow in some parts but very entertaining on the whole. I gave it four stars because I am judging it against Ender's Game, and it didn't measure up to the overall depth to Ender's Game."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This was a great climax to the best sci-fi series ever. I have only one real complaint, and that is that the series had to end at all. This book was typical Card, with a fast beginning, and a mind boggling ending. Though I did enjoy the other books in this series more, this was still a great book. Most authors can only dream that one of their series can be as invigorating and imaginative as this one."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"&quot;Ender's Game&quot;, like so many others who have written here, is my all-time fave sci-fi book. Obviously, most of us have caught up to the fact that Card was determined to &quot;right&quot; the capsized-ship of morality. Card was successful in this book, but his success came at the expense of our fave character Ender. I don't agree that Ender's childhood decisions based on self-preservation were selfish signs of cowardice. The constant chatter between the piggy trees and buggers was sorta irritating at the end. Personally, I would've liked to see Ender return to earth with his family and swim in that lake he and val floated on way back when."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Orson Scott Card does a fine job of finishing the career of Ender Wiggins. This book has all of the action and fast paced story telling of Ender's Game and the philosophical content of Speaker of the Dead and Xenocide. I finished it in two days of intense reading as I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I like this book, but I felt that Card is going through a middle life crisis and is searching for the meaning of life. He should get back to the real sci-fi of old."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I thought that this book was very kewl. I am 16 and have loved all of Orson Scott Cards books since 6th grade when I first read &quot;Ender's Game&quot;. I have read the whole series many times and find them just as exciting.( I mut say that I did think that &quot;Speaker For The Dead&quot; was a little dreary."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Having read and loved the first three books in the Ender series, there was no way I was going to miss this entry. Like so many others, though, I am of split mind about the finale (and how appropriate, given the schizophrenic existence of its lead characters Ender-Peter and Val-Jane). While \\"Children of the Mind\\" does contain Card's trademark wit and while the last 100 pages kick into high gear, the final installment, on its own, is as unsatisfying as it is pleasing.One of the major problems is Card's ill-considered decision to publish \\"Xenocide\\" and \\"Children of the Mind\\" as two books rather than one cohesive unit; the fourth entry seems more an epilogue to the series--a 350-page denouement--than the climax it should have been. Card admits he originally planned the two books as one work, and this admission resonates like an apology. Well over a third of \\"Children of the Mind\\" summarizes what happened in previous volumes, and another third is riddled with endless conversations on political and metaphysical topics, many of which the characters already debated at length in \\"Xenocide.\\" Only in the last 100 pages does Card finally abandon the themes that were presented more thoroughly (and competently) in the earlier books and turn his attention to resolving the many loose ends. In sum, Card would have been much wiser to have written a unified 600-page book rather than 900 needlessly repetitive pages.The second problem is that Card's philosophical ruminations often steer awfully close to quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo. The entire section set on Pacifica, a planet governed by Samoans, feels particularly incongruous. (Peter and Wang-mu wonder aloud--twice--what they are doing on this particular world, a question that is never really fully addressed.) True--some of the philosophical questions are fascinating, but there's very little that wasn't already said better and more succinctly in \\"Xenocide,\\" and the dialogue is often excruciatingly shallow. Take this conversation between Valentine and Novinha, which reads in part:\\"You didn't really need him anymore.\\" \\"He never needed me.\\" \\"He needed you desperately,\\" said Valentine. \\"He needed you so much he gave up Jane for you.\\" \\"No,\\" said Novinha, \\"He needed my need for him. He needed to feel like he was providing for me, protecting me.\\" \\"But you don't need his providence or his protection anymore.\\"I wish I could tell you this bit of dizzying dialogue is an exception, but there are similar angst-ridden conversations between Miro and Val, Peter and Wang-mu--in short, between any two characters who feel the need to explain to each other their raison d'etre. In the earlier books, Card allowed metaphysical questions to arise as much from the actions of the characters and the development of the plot as from the dialogue; in \\"Children of the Mind,\\" everyone seems to be in post-Freudian interplanetary counseling.Yet the book is not a wholesale disaster; and I particularly enjoyed the page-turning final resolution, even though it relies on a melodramatic sleight of hand. If the last third of \\"Children of the Mind\\" were merged with a pared-down version of \\"Xenocide,\\" the whole would probably have been equal to the excellence of the first two books in the Ender series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"About halfway through \\"Children of the Mind\\" I realized that I hated it. With a passion. Anything that evokes so much passion can't be worthless. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars. If you loved the first three books as much as I did, you may similarly feel a strong emotion when you read this one. It's not exactly boring. I just felt like I was in another universe trying to understand what in the world Card was doing.Why do I hate it so much? Because the characters are all varying degrees of unsympathetic, and all of the major action surrounds Card's weird new mysticism, rather than the intense ethical dilemmas of the previous books. This book is like the opposite of the other books and I couldn't understand why. No one is rational, no one is wise, no one has any empathy at all. The spirit of Ender Wiggin doesn't exist in this book.No, Ender isn't really present in this book. Card would like you to believe that he is, in the form of Peter and Valentine, Ender's \\"children of the mind\\", but I found those characters frustrating and unbelievable and not at all like any side of Ender. Interestingly, they could be viable characters on their own, but Card insists on treating them as if they are not real people and we should not care what happens to them (especially Young Valentine who is subjected to extreme emotional torture but we're not supposed to care about her feelings, she's just an \\"empty vessel\\").No strong characters rise up to replace the absence of Ender. Card tries, with Miro (who becomes loathsome in my opinion)and Peter (all the fun sociopathy drained out of him). With the exception of Wang-Mu, all of the female characters come off looking really bad. You'll wonder why Ender married Novinha, as awful, self-centered and destructive as she is. You'll wonder why you didn't realize (Old) Valentine was such a self-righteous prig before. You'll wonder when Jane became so extraordinarily selfish and annoying.Far too much time is spent on the planet Pacifica, a planet apparently inhabited by self-righteous and rude religious nuts. The chief one being a holy man who doesn't \\"believe in ceremony\\" yet insists any roof he eats under be burned because he is oh so holy. And did I tell you that we are supposed to love these Pacifican nuts? That they are supposedly so wise and above everyone else that main characters are reduced to tears and supplication?If you want to know how the situation with the Lusitanian fleet is resolved and what happens to Ender and the gang, then go ahead and read this book. I thought everything that happened was backwards and wrong but hey, that's just me."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"\\"Children of the Mind\\" is the final book in Orson Scott Card's Ender Quartet. It picks up right where \\"Xenocide\\" left off, and is the logical conclusion to Ender's story, wrapping things up in a satisfying enough manner.Like the books that preceded it, \\"Children of the Mind\\" is largely character driven, and this is certainly one of its strengths. Few of the characters are explored in excrutiating detail, but Card gives us just enough of a glimpse into their lives and personalities to give the reader the feeling that we know these people.While the book is certainly satisfying in that it ties up all the threads woven in the previous books, I feel that it is the weakest of the series. I'm not sure that much would have been lost if it had simply been compressed and included as the final chapters to \\"Xenocide\\". That said, if you are a fan of the series, and particularly if you have read \\"Xenocide\\", then \\"Children of the Mind\\" is a must read."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"In classic Card style, Card breaks off completely from the story that he has been telling for the past 3 books to unburden his soul and really spell out in blatant terms his opinions on life, the universe, and everything else. This book completes the Ender Saga in a rather roundabout way, really not dealing with Ender in any way/shape/form. Instead it goes on to tell the story of Ender's evil brother Peter who was born out of Ender's fear and his pairing with a servant girl who beleives in serving her god. This book is so philisophical I think Card is overshooting his audience a bit. For those who enjoyed the series as a story, they will not find any joy in this book at all, as it really is a weak storyline. For those that were taking the depper route they too will feel cheated as Card underestimates their intelligence and blatantly explains the story he is trying to share with everyone in a rather direct manner.If you have read the first 3 books then you will want to read this one to enjoy the end of the story, but if you have not read an Ender's book before, this is not the place to start."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This is an awful book and (luckily) the last in the Ender Quartet.Ender Wiggin plays almost no part in it at all, and instead his \`children' are central. Ender is dying and because of a quantum-physics crap-fest nightmare with a super-computer named Jane (who has taken him \`In' and \`Out' of space time, allowing for faster than light travel), his personality is split between three people.The story follows a plethora of characters, none of whom the reader has any reason to care about. They are all two dimensional and completely unbelievable. In the midst of interstellar warfare and dramatic tension, they leap constantly into long diatribes and dialogues whereby they psycho-analyze themselves, their traveling companions, Ender Wiggin, and the moral complications of the situations they have found themselves in. There is no subtlety. There is no action. There are only malformed characters and a convoluted plot that leaves you wishing all three species would be annihilated.Not recommended. Read 'Enders Game' and stop there."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I agree with what reviewer Webster says, and add the following.Ender's Game is no doubt a classic sf novel, and one I enjoyed all over again 25 years after I first read it. The second and third novels follow logically, maintain the forward momentum of the plot, and increase the emotional depth.But Children of the Mind was a real disappointment. It reads as an afterthought, beginning with the fact that, unlike the books in the Ender \\"trilogy\\", it assumes you've read the first three -- and recently. Each of the other three could stand on its own; this one can't.Also, it's way too talky. Card seems here to have given up *showing* and just decided to *tell* everything he wanted to say.Finally, it seems to me this book breaks the golden rule of sf: assume one element contrary to nature as we know it, and trace the logical consequences. When Jane starts popping people in and out of places, Card's just playing God, and it ceases to be interesting.In the Afterword, Card says he's trying to write mature American fiction, and maybe even mature Mormon fiction, but this ain't it."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"It seems almost like two different people wrote Ender's Game and Children of the Mind. Ender's Game was brilliant ... Children of the Mind was just dull, melodramatic, and overextended. Ender himself all but disappeared in this last book, even before literally crumbling to dust 2/3 of the way through the book. I couldn't really buy into all of this one-Ender/three-bodies business, and the love interests of all the main characters seemed awfully forced. The \\"looming\\" Lusitania Fleet seemed like an afterthought as the characters launched into long winded philosophies on aiua and dealing with the three Enders. It's almost like Card tried to make a large scale, Dune-type epic out of this series but changed course with this last book. The idea of aiua connecting us all together was interesting (very reminiscent of neo-Confucian ideas about the structure of the universe), but it just wasn't enough to carry the book.I think Card's biggest mistake with the whole series was aging Ender so quickly and reducing his role to meaningless cameo appearances. The tragic young Ender of Ender's Game--the Ender that won our hearts and imaginations--and the middle-aged Ender of the later books were like complete strangers. Maybe if the books had developed around Ender's growth as a person and Card had allowed Ender himself a more active role the conclusion would've been more satisfying. But sadly, by the end of the book, I just couldn't bring myself to care anymore. Ender was dead, the characters were all dull and the wild plotlines just seemed to spiral out of control. I believe that development of characters and the depth of a book's environment/setting is absolutely crucial and the difference between great science fiction and average material. Children of the Mind really is not that bad of a book. But coming from Card, knowing he can do better ... it was a disappointment.The good news is that after this book, the Ender's series returns back to its roots, back to the time when Ender was in Battle School. While the next books in the series might not be as \\"deep\\" as this one, they are much more emotionally engaging. Regardless of how you felt about how the Speaker-Xenocide-Children trilogy ended up, if you liked Ender's Game (hey, who didn't?) continue on in this series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I never thought I would say this about a book in this series, but I hate this book. I was absolutely disappointed with the way Card chose to resolve his story. I'll give him license since he may do what he will with his story, but I feel so bitter about this ending to such a magnificent saga that I can't recommend this to anybody that isn't dying of curiousity at the end of \\"Xenocide\\".And to those who believe you fit in this category, I'm sorry for the feelings you will like possess upon completion. I honestly feel the same unrest now as I did when I finished \\"Xenocide\\". I hope everyday that Card will come to his senses and revise his plot here to be more logical, less rushed, more conclusive (which some may argue with), and more fulfilling to a character of such quality as Ender Wiggin."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I highly recommend NOT reading this book, which managed to diminish the magic of Ender's Game for me. Stop at Xenocide, which was pretty good, and skip straight to Ender's Shadow, which is VERY good. This book is exceedingly disjointed, makes way too much of the Valentine/Peter dichotomy, and is boring, boring, boring. Where I couldn't put the other Ender books down, I had to really struggle to finish this one. And then wished I hadn't."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Card shows again that he has a unique talent for developing complex problems with answers that only cause other problems...a situation more like real life than most novels. However, he shows this strength of his is almost a weakness here, as he seeks to find a final resolution to the Ender series.This one feels a little too metaphysical. This idea about the aiuas has taken over a good series. Most of the first half of the novel is Val and Peter struggling with being half-people; struggling to find their identity, if they have one. Then it all becomes lovesick mush; is this a romance novel? Ender loves Novinha, Wang-mu loves Peter but will she be enough? Miro loves Val and Jane, but doesn't know if he can love them as one person. Yeesh.The final resolution is okay, but not quite satisfying, and though Xenocide was plenty long, this idea doesn't feel like it justified a whole book. Card feels like he's filling space a lot of the time. And trying to figure out how to end a series of strong books. It's a tough challenge; he almost rises to it.His afterword -- an essay about the function of literature within culture -- is worth reading and thinking about.And I have to say it again -- who came up with these book covers? They have nothing to do with the book and look terrible. What is that thing?A sample passage:\\"But the point is to go on, isn't it? To connect with the future?\\"\\"That's one part, yes,\\" said Olhado. \\"But part of the purpose of it is now, is the moment. And part of it is the web of connections. Links from soul to soul. If the purpose of life was just to continue into the future, then none of it would have meaning, because it would be all anticipation and preparation. There's fruition, Grego. There's the happiness we've already had. The happiness of each moment. The end of our lives, even if there's no forward continuation, no progeny at all, the end of our lives doesn't erase the beginning.\\"If you would like to argue about this book with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"First there was \\"Ender's Game\\", then \\"Speaker of the Dead\\", both Hugo winners, and now this great book that unravels and reweaves Ender's life and surrounding events and situations. This book is fantastic and I eagerly added it to other great books ranging from the Old School of science-fiction like \\"Foundation trilogy\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" to cyberpunk like \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Cryptonomicon\\", and \\"Darkeye: Cyber Hunter\\". Get it!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The people I know who've read the book seem rather split; some felt it was rushed or contrived, while others felt it was a spectacular payoff with many welcome, unexpected twists. Count me part of the latter group.CHILDREN OF THE MIND successfully marries the breakneck pace of the original Ender novel with the slower, more developed storytelling of SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD and XENOCIDE. I felt Card rather ingeniously connected many (if not all) of the loose threads in ways not only unexpected but clever (and I surmise he'd had the threads sorted out all along). All characters achieved satisfying closure, and it featured some of the more inventive action sequences I'd read in some time. Ignore the naysayers and dive in. A fine read."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I finished reading this book today, and i knew i had to write a review for it somewhere. It has to be my favorite book(or at least one of them). This is an exciting and complicated book at all standards. Contrary to the beleif of many people, it is not that strange. It continues the same storyline as Xenocide, as it was supposed to be actually in it. The main storyline of Children of the Mind are the attemps at the prevention of the Lusitania fleet from destroying Lusitania by the citizens of Lusitania. Many things have happened since Xenocide: Faster than light, and in fact, instantaneous travel has finally been invented. Ender has transported his aiua into several other people, forcing him to have to control the bodies of him, young Valentine, adn Peter. And Jane is about to be sht down. As Ender and his family try to save Jane and the citizens of Lusitania, Si Wang mu and Peter are looking into manipulating the Starways Congress. Another exciting discovery is also made: the makers of the descolada virus. I highly suggest this book for any age level."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Strictly speaking, this book is really Xenocide, Part II. Xenocide ended fairly arbitrarily, and this book begins where Xenocide takes off.Having said that, this book slipped terribly in storyline, and I had a difficult time staying interested. It continues the themes of finding the origins of the descolada virus and if it's possible to communicate with it, saving Jane's life, and intercepting the fleet.Ender is barely a character in this story, and without trying to give too much away, he is more or less dispensed of halfway through the book. Again, credibility is stretched to the max as Peter and a young Valentine Wiggin are essentially reincarnated out of Ender's memories, and they are large players in this story. You also have ugly characters spending all their time yelling at each other (exemplified by Quara and Miro, as well as the others in that dysfunctional family).I do not mind that this story is not action based; Speaker for the Dead is very philosophical, and is a strong story. Additionally, I read lots of other philosophical works. What I object to is the outright preaching, and a story that is so bizarre it doesn't even make an attempt to be realistic, rather it's a tool for OSC to subject us to his various beliefs.Ender's Game and SFTD are both amazing books. However, the series goes down hill from there. I would recommend stopping at that point; buy Xenocide and Children only if you can find them used or at a library. There's too many other good books out there to read to waste your time on this diatribe."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I admit it. I liked Ender's Game. Unfortunately I didn't like Children of the Mind. I read enough science fiction that confusing me with abstract concepts is pretty tough, but this book rose to the challenge and far exceeded it. Writing was good, characters where good, even some of the story was good, but whenever they started talking about switching bodies and the aiua I felt like I was swimming in a sea of confusion."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"A subplot of this last book is that Ender, having overlived his usefulness, finds himself slowly wasting away into a bland, lifeless shadow of his once radiant self. A better analogy for this book there will never be.My first regrets about having bought Children came about page 25, when I realised that the dialog up to that point had consistd entirely of whining and bickering. I wish I could find some redeeming quality to the last chapter in Ender's life, but I can't.Rest in peace Ender Wiggin"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The Ender series was one of the best I've read. This book was a big dissapointment. The characters were weak and the plot wouldn't challenge an eight year old's imagination. If youplan on buying this book, don't worry about the money you are wasting. Worry about the time you waste in reading it. ******In terms of plot, I submit that It would have made sense if Jane's auira was transferred to the D. VIRUS. That would have had more of a potential for a real plot and at the same time the d. virus problem would have been taken care of."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I have read the whole ender series, but with a strange sequence which may have affected the way I view the different books in the series. The first book I have read was the Shadow of the Hegemon, thanks to a tourist that had left it in the library of a hotel in Skiathos island. This book got me hooked, but it confused me also as I didn't know if I should start reading the next books or the previous ones.The general pattern in the whole series is:The beginning book is Ender's Game. Then we have two subcategories, one the Shadow series (which, with the exception of the first book, take place on earth and are more within military strategy) and one the Ender series (which take place in space and are more into new sci-fi ideas). Shadow series probably can be read from everyone, while I guess that the Ender series (especially from Speaker for the Dead onwards) would be read mainly from sci-fi fans.Below are my comments for the books of the series, in the order I have read them and a marking (10 is the highest mark):Shadow of the Hegemon: The first book I have read, and which I could not leave from my hands. I finished it in 2 days. It was fast paced action, very smart plot and after reading it I believed that Orson Scot Card (OSC) has invented/re-invented a new genre of literature. That of military strategy and adventure combined with brilliance/mind games and hidden portions of romance. Such books always existed but this seemed to be THE book. It was like the way Dan Brown re-invented books with trivials and puzzles, together with fast paced adventure. I strongly recommend it to everybody that likes such type of books. (mark: 10)Shadow puppets: The sequel to the above. I found it interesting but somehow boring as the above story developed little and the focus was on the characters (maybe too much focus so that it seemed to me that it was slightly mumbling jumbling. Strategy, brilliance and adventure seemed to be very low here. I would not recommend it for anybody to read it in isolate, unfortunately you have to read it if you want to go to the next book. I really believe that OSC made a mistake here (deliberately or not) as this book should have been told in 50-60 pages and be included in the previous or the next book. (mark: 6 but you will read it because you will want to read Shadow of the Giant)Shadow of the Giant: (see below)Ender's game: A really great book to read, probably the best of the series, however, as I had read its sequels first, when I reached the 80% of this book, I had predicted the end. However, it's at the highest standards of sci-fi, military strategy, adventure, brilliant mind games and very good depth in the human aspect of the characters. In comparison to the shadow series, it is more \\"space\\" sci-fi, while shadow series have much lesser sci-fi elements and are more down to earth. (mark: 10)Speaker for the dead: Another great book, but different style. Less adventure, more human aspect, more maturity. Brilliance yes, but not military, sci-fi yes (some great ideas) but not spaceship style. (Mark: 9)Xenocide: A good sequel of the previous novel. In certain points more brilliant, in other sections more boring, however is again a very good sci-fi book. The only flaw in these series (Speker for the dead, Xenocide, Children of the mind) is the idea behind one of the alien species described which I found outrageously extreme, however if you ignore it becomes first class reading. (Mark: 9)Children of the mind: I think that OSC has wrapped up his case pretty badly in that one. It's a fair book except the fact that I felt that OSC mumbles jumbles for one third of the novel not having decided how to end it. In other critiques I have found it described as nice approach to moral dilemmas, however, moral dilemma is when you describe it once and make your choice, while here the dilemma is repeated and repeated... I felt like I was watching a movie worth 10 oscars and the end did not worth to be included even in a cheap video movie. And again, many open ends at the end (for possible sequels). (Mark: 7 but you will read it as you will be hooked from the previous ones).Ender's shadow: Having read Enders Game and Shadow of the Hegemon, I found this book probably the best of the series, which of course is my subjective preference. I could characterize it as probably the best book I have read ever! Not to repeat myself, it has all that Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Game have, and even more...(Mark: the absolute 10).Shadow of the Giant: When I read shadow puppets, I said, \\"that's it, OSC has lost either his talent or his appetite for good writing...\\", so I was pretty unwilling to read it. Fortunately I decided to, as it proved to be a good one, were I believe that OSC has nicely wrapped up his story, with two small flaws.* The one is described below (its end needed to be slightly more complete) and,* The other is the fact that although he describes certain smart battles, he does not focus enough on them as it seems that he is in a hurry to wrap all things up. It had all elements to become a masterpiece but it ended up being a good to read book (Mark: 9)In general, both series have three categories of good stuff:1) Some great sci-fi ideas (battle room, battle games, fantasy game, ansible, aia, Jane, in/out travel, raman varelse etc)2) Great military strategy, mind games etc combined with adventure3) In certain books, depth of characters, moral dilemmas etcAnd two main bad stuff:1) Mumbling jumbling in certain books which was completely unnecessary (either OSC wanted just to produce and sell another title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how the story will continue-see last book of Ender series).2) One of the alien species described in the Ender series was so too outrageous even for sci-fi that made it look ridiculous. The idea behind it was brilliant in sci-fi terms, but he could try a different living organism...Finally, OSC has left open ends in both series (probably for next sequels), however I believe that there are two things missing. a) the story of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, told in a metaphorical manner so it means much for humanity. b) In ancient theatre, a story should end in a way that brings \\"katharsis\\" to the story, and the souls of the readers. I believe that the end of the shadow of the giant may be smart for commercial purposes but it was very unfair to the reader as it did not bring full \\"katharsis\\"."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Card is one of my favorite authors. The only reason he's not my declared favorite is just because I haven't read everything by him yet. The Ender series stands as my favorite serious sci-fi series; I hold that Card serves up the perfect formula of adventure, levity, technical science, technically skilled writing, and just plain fun. The second half of the Ender series is noticeably more self-indulgent than the first. It seems stuck in that twilight zone where it might have been better if it were shorter, but everything seems to be vital to the storyline!While not as gripping as the previous installments, I found the continued development of Ender and his doppelgangers satisfying, but I would have liked more about Novinha (though I can always refer back to Speaker) and some of the others. Card's ideas are still fresh and engaging; I thought the ending was well-done (after all, how DO you end such a stellar series? The pressure was immense and he came through), and furthermore, Card had the intelligence to know when to quit - to know when the story is over and not try to drag it out forever just to make more money. My hat's off to him - this was a great series, the ending is exemplary; not too long, not too short. And now it's on to Ender's Shadow."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"If you have't read the Ender's series, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If you have read the other three books, drop what you are doing, buy it, and read it. Hey, what are you doing reading this review, just buy it already! On a serious note, this book was fabulously written. My only wish is that it had focused more on Ender and his involvement in everything. However, his 'children' filled in quite well. The character development was fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed the play between each and every one of them. I could feel the emotions and pains of them all. In three words... just buy it."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The Ender Saga, which began with two of the greatest novelsin all of science fiction literature, wobbles to a close inthis anemic volume. As Mr. Card's ego grows (read theembarrassing afterword in which he concludes that he is oneof the few great writers in America today) his writing withers.Perhaps he is spending too much time in his virtual &quot;town&quot; onAOL. Certainly the writing has the rushed, abbreviated toneof an e-mail post, and what he passes off as wit in this booksounds less like Wilde or Coward, and more like it came froma chat room."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Essentially, this novel is a continuation of \\"Xenocide,\\" with all of the flaws of that novel rehashed yet again. \\"Children of the Mind\\" is talky and implausible, in the sense that it becomes increasingly harder to suspend one's sense of disbelief as the book continues. By this time, readers want some resolution of the plot threads began earlier in this series. However, instead of resolution, what we get is a setup for yet another sequel. If you have read up to \\"Xenocide,\\" of course you will read this as well, but it is doubtful you will like it."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I finished this one about ten minutes ago. It was the best book I have ever read, by far. After I read Speaker for the Dead, that was my favorite, Xenocide dissapointed me a little, not as bad as I thought it was gonna be(based on what some of my friends told me) but still dissapointing. Children of the Mind is the best book in this Quartet, but it is also good that it is the last.Having just finished this book, I still have the feeling it gave me on me. I was deeply touched by Valentine's memories as Ender as just a baby...smiling and laughing just at the simplest things. If only life could be so simple.It deeply saddens me to think that Ender is gone. His Aiua lived on, but his same thoughts, same experiences, same body, same _person_ are all gone. It's fiction, but once you read it, it becomes real to you. I was very surprised to see that the reviews here on Amazon were actually quite low. After finishing, I came here expecting to read praises upon praises for this wonderful book, but alas, the response was lukewarm. Not only that, but this book did not make the bestseller list...probably because many abandoned this series after Card wrote the dissapointing Xenocide.In a way, I almost wish I had stopped with Ender's Game. I'm almost mad at myself for not. But once you read Speaker the whole thing draws you in, and won't let go. While Ender's game provided finality, Speaker and Xenocide did not, and forced you to keep reading. It's a weird feeling really, and one I cannot explain very well. Probably because I wouldn't have this sorrow for Ender right now, and that he had to die. But in the end it was inevitable. Anyway, read this book.It's just such a shame Card had to follow it up with a ridiculous and completely irrelevant afterword."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"While this book didn't quite live up to Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, it surpassed Xenocide and I quite enjoyed it. It continues about where Xenocide left off, with Ender's mind/force thing or whatever now controlling second incarnations of his beloved older sister, Valentine, and Peter, his long dead older brother as well as himself. While Ender tries to join his wife in the convent place she fled to, Peter travels with a young chinese servent girl, Wang Mu, and they try to manipulate the Star Ways Congress into calling off the fleet sent to destroy Lusitania. In the meantime, Miro and &quot;Young Val&quot; work to try to save Jane, the dying computer intelligence that is the only thing that allows intelligent species faster than light travel. Anyway, the plot is incredibly complicated, so I won't even try to explain it all, but rest assured that this series is worth reading. The one thing that really annoyed me about this book in particular was something that several other reviewers have commented on as well. Not only does Ender's choice to remain with his wife no matter what &quot;bore him to death&quot; but it is also implied that all relationships are like that! I find that offensive! Anyway, before I get off on a rant I'll just say that this is a great series, if you ignore a lot of implied sexism, which I certainly hope bothers some of you as much as it does me. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I loved book one. I loved book 2 even more. Book 3 was once again -- great. What happened? This one started out slow and just got worse. I kept reading, expecting an improvement that just did not come. If you loved the first 3, do yourself a favor and stop there. Try Pastwatch!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Mr. Card has not allowed script development work for his and Rhino Pictures' &quot;Ender's Game&quot; to detract from his effort at effectively concluding the Ender Saga with &quot;Children of the Mind.&quot; A long time ago, it seems, I casually picked up &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; doing so solely because of the awards it had won. By the time I had read it, &quot;Speaker for the Dead,&quot; and &quot;Xenocide,&quot; I had learned what Card knew all along. That he manuevers us through this future world, but he did not create it, nor the ethical dillemas that reside therein. That world, those issues, those decisions lie within all of us, waiting to be known, to be expressed, to be brought forth. It was with that fervent desire to know more of myself, really, that I snatched up &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; from its place in Borders at the World Trade Center.I found the novel to be imbued with the same sense of enlightenment through struggle that possessed the first three novels. Although Young Val and Peter, Outside creations of Ender, were never fully developed as entities, Card uses that as a dramatic device, bringing along aspects of those two as the plot drives along, allowing us to witness the subtle levels of newfound awareness the each character goes through. For these reasons and many more, Card appears to be a genius. I wish I was close enough to him to be listed in the acknowledgements, for then I would be privy to the only part of the stories I am missing; their creation."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ok, I just started on this book...but I noticed several ERRORS immediately!!!! FIRST: It says Jane will \\"die\\" once all the networked computers of the hundred worlds is turned off. WRONG! in Xenocide it says Jane WILL LIVE even without the computers, but she will be mentally crippled. SECOND: It says there are dozens of FTL starships now in use. HOW CAN THAT BE? In Xenocide it was clearly established that Jane can only take a ship OUTSIDE and back INSIDE IF...IF either Ender or the duplicate Peter or the duplicate Val were inside it! So how can there be \\"dozens of FTL starships in operation\\"???!!!!!! Ender has vowed never to go OUTSIDE again. That leaves the duplicates of Peter and Val. So how is it that suddenly dozens of FTL starships are in use????? What is Orson Scott Card thinking? Has he forgotten what he wrote in Xenocide?"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Like the Dune and Foundation series, the Ender book series suffers from drawn out sequels. This book, which finally sums up what should have been summed up in Speaker for the Dead (two books prior), does not capture the imagination or hold the reader's attention as well as the first book in the series. In fact, this book, along with Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide actually does a great disservice to Ender's Game.The book is not too bad though. It finally solves the riddles of the four species (Jane, Piggies, Desaloda, and the Buggers), and moves along at a much better pace than the two previous books. Though the ending is relatively weak, at least the reader won't have to endure more conflicts and problems that Card seems to add on almost page by page. It also tends to stray away from family, philosophical, and religious rants and goes back to the story at hand.If you've read the three previous books, you should definitely finish the series and pick up this book. However, if you're just starting out, start with Ender's Game, and end right there."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender is such a strong and sensitive character that this finale book seems to do his saga little justice.The story picks-up exactly where \\"Xenocide\\" left off and finally gives readers a sense of resolution to the mystery of the descolada and the fate of Lusitania. However, \\"Children of the Mind\\" is a sorry part 2 to \\"Xenocide.\\" \\"Xenocide\\" was far superior and was much more interesting than this book. The sorry thing is that if you want to know what happens to Ender, Jane, Young Val and the others you have to read this book.The focus seems to be mostly on Wang-mu and Peter Wiggin which feels rushed and not nearly as well thought-out as the preceding books. There are also some sad (and fairly pathetic) moments with Ender that I found disappointing. Orson Scott Card also missed the boat on a lot of his facts and grossly misinterpreted many Polynesian words, Japanese customs, and American history. There is also no depth to the characters and it feels all too much like a Hollywood screenplay and less like a ground-breaking scifi story. The plot itself is much too cliche (right down to the fairy tale happy ending). \\"Children of the Mind\\" offers nothing impressive or new to readers.The entire first half of this book had me wondering if this was even the same author I had learned to love. I found myself on several occassions wondering, \\"who wrote this garbage?\\" The quality of this book's story is much less than I would have expected from Card. After the first half, the story does improve slightly but it is only a whisper of my expectations. Sadly, I rate this book my least favorite of the entire Ender Saga."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"It's sad to see the Ender saga fizzle away in ever-increasing complexities and meta-physics which are not substitutes for new concepts and plot directions. Sometimes when you have painted yourself into a corner it's better to jump out a window and forget the little bit that is left to tidy up. I feel that it is at least two books (&quot;Children&quot; and &quot;Shadow&quot;) past the point that this series should have been left to stand on its undoubted early merit."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I am what you call a hardcore die-hard fan of Card. I came across Ender's Game when I was barely 12 and since then I've read it over 50 times, memorizing it the way people memorize the Bible. Indeed, with the book in the drawer next to my bed, it became my holy book. The Speaker turned out to be different but in a very nice way. Interesting plot, wonderful characters, again something new and exciting. Xenocide disappointed me a bit on a general note but it's still an OK book.Children of the Mind, however, is way too abstract. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind abstract fiction but it was way too hard for me to proceed all the concepts in the new book. I could call it -digressing-. Coming into existence of Young Val, Peter and eventually Jane was a little but too much.I asked myself why I did not like this book. Is it because Ender died? Definitely not, I actually found that appealing in a way. Is it because it involves characters who shouldn't have been there in the first place? Probably not. I think the bottomline is that I expected Ender and the rest of the known characters to end up in a completely different way. I could say that the story is taken a step too further from the place that I would have enjoyed to see it. The world of the Children of the Mind is not at all the world of Ender's Game which I loved or even the world of the Speaker. It has grown far beyond that and it kind of felt like... felt like an -alien- world, one I couldn't associate myself with as a reader and as said above, a hardcore Ender fan.I found myself skipping and skipping passages and waiting to see what will happen rather than being interested in HOW that's bound to happen. I still don't regret getting the book because it's a conclusion of the Ender saga, of the character, my hero for the last 12 years. Every story should have an end and I'm glad that the Children was written and reached my hands."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Really nice device! Card can find a way to beat all the odds and get out of any situation. So it applies for the philotic connection. What else can I say except that it rings true?In this book there is the religious layer, in which, Catholicism is the main target in opposition to something we can't totally figure as Pantheism. This is largely analyzed with interesting elements.Card plays with politics and how politicians use religion to further their own interests which is a nice critic on human history. Religious sci fi has been very little exploited so it has a freshness to it in fact. So I do think the story has a lot of merits.Not to give up too much of the plot: there is a definite change in Ender. A liberation that I really disliked a little, because he was what he was for all the had to do and go through. Nonetheless, it lets open a big space for more to come.If you read the three previous books you will have to do this one too. If you haven't read any of the series before, it's better left alone."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"A super condensed summary of the previous three books (spoilers):Ender's Game: Ender goes to battle school and destroys the buggers through a computer simulation - nutshell. Story centers intently on Ender, whereas the latter storylines do not.Speaker for the Dead (SFTD): Ender writes The Hegemon and The Hive Queen and goes around the universe \\"speaking\\" for those who have died over the course of 3000 relative years (light speed travel). The Descolada virus is introduced as well as the Pequeninos. The Hive Queen is given a home. Ender finds Novinha, his later wife who lives on the Lusitania colony. All hell breaks loose with the Starways Congress and the Lusitanian fleet thinking the Descolada is going to destroy humanity. Jane is introduced. Tons of things happen in Speaker for the Dead. This was my favorite and IMHO the best overall book by far.Xenocide: Thirty years have passed as the Lusitanian fleet approaches (this occurs over the course of 2.5 books!). Jane is able to create instantaneous travel and go \\"Outside.\\" Ender's soul gets split into three people (very difficult to explain). Ender remains, but two new people are created Outside, with Ender's will and memory of them as their own - Peter Wiggin at 20 years old and a young version of Valentine Wiggin at 13 years old. The Descolada virus is replaced by a non-lethal version.Children of the Mind:This book starts off quite literally a few minutes after Xenocide ended. The Lusitanian fleet is still coming, which was known about since about halfway through SFTD. It's been some 800 pages since this was first mentioned and they still don't have a solution. Young Peter and Si-Wang Mu (from Path) go and try to infiltrate those who most influence the Starways Congress. That is essentially the main storyline. Yes, they're still trying to keep Jane from dying by transporting her \\"aiua\\" or soul into either Peter or Young Val. But, the absurd thing is the time dilation that keeps occurring with the writing. In Ender's Game, Card would occasionally have a year or two pass in the course of a paragraph which was fine because nothing was happening worth mentioning. However, the last 100 pages of Xenocide and at least the first half of Children of the Mind encompass what is likely less than two weeks. What's bothersome is everything is just being rehashed and rehashed.At almost 200 pages in it seemed like quite literally nothing happened other than Ender going into his coma.It's clear that Card's writing had run out of gas because all of the major or interesting events took place at the end of the third book. My proposal would be to split Xenocide into two books as opposed to calling Children of the Mind a fourth book. It really isn't. Not to mention Xenocide is almost 600 pages, so it would have been easy. The beginnings of the chapters are excerpts from Han Qing Jao's: God Whispers as opposed to the usual very pertinent conversations which were separate from Ender and his entourage. If you don't remember, Wang Mu was Qing Jao's secret maid until Qing Jao lost her mind right after Path was freed from the OCD. It's almost depressing reading this because you get the sense that he just was tacking this one on and it could have easily been compressed into about 50 - 100 pages. The actual prose is more romantic than before, but the complexity of the storyline regresses because the big problem (saving all the sentient species) has already been resolved. This was mentioned multiple times in the book. Now, the only real task is to prevent Lusitania from being blown up by the M.D. device.When I got to the end of the book, there was a sense that Card himself might have realized that he didn't' split the books correctly. The Fleet was essentially the background event (it was a 30 year trip in real-time) that was supposed to be the climactic finish but it was just this short one chapter disappointment. Would I recommend this book? Yes, but only because you feel the need to find out what happens. As a standalone, it would be quite impossible to understand by itself and you'd be missing almost nothing by just reading the cliff notes. A considerable amount of vernacular is produced in the Card universe, not to mention the history between the characters. Were I to rate the books in descending order of quality and readability:Speaker for the DeadEnder's GameXenocideChildren of the Mind"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"As usual, Card delivers with great writing and relatable characters. But the plot of Children of the Mind was just a little too out there for me to take it seriously.This book is hardly about Ender AT ALL. Or, it is if you count the fact that his soul divided and made two new characters, which were really old characters, one of which is still alive, so there are really two of them, only... well, it got pretty wierd. All the conciousness-swapping made the book rather unrealistic. I did, however, enjoy the God-Whisperings of Gloriously Bright.In short, this was a good book with a far-fetched plot. The ending was very solid, though-- and the book was a definite page-turner."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender's Game and Speaker were fabulous books. This book is not as good.Honestly, I recommend skipping it and going onto the Ender's Shadow series, which is excellent."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"After reading Xenocide, which I thought was a bit boring for lack of action and was really just a book on fictional philosophy, I didn't really have high hopes for this book. I was very pleased to find that this book contained more of the old Card I was used to reading. The story line reaches a desperate climax as the death of Jane and the destruction of Lusitainia seem inevitable and yet are prevented by the resourcefullness of three (four counting Jane) species working together for the first time in the Enderverse. This book contains some very interesting ideas about life, love, and happiness by exploring the inner thoughts of all sorts of people from Ender himself to his puppet-like creations, Young Valentine and Peter. The characters in this book are easy to fall in love with and bring the reader through many human emotions. Children of the Mind provides good and solid closure to the Ender saga for everything except the Descoladores. I wouldn't mind reading something about the future of the united races of Humans, Buggers, and Piggies and their relationship with the creaters of the descolada virus."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite authors, and many of his books have become touchstones in my life. Children of the Mind, however, is not one of those books. After Xenocide, I really feel that Card had told all the stories about Ender and the gang that could well be told. And, as the others reviewers have mentioned, the odd return of Peter and young Valentine is just plain weird. I really think this whole book could've had 80% of its plot and action gutted and been made into three chapters at the end of Xenocide. The ideas expressed here are too far flung and don't feel like a natural or meaningful completion of the story that began when Ender won his way into Battle School. Moreover, I feel that Children of the Mind marks the point at which Card's powers of creation begin to decline.Having said all of that, Card's worst books are still better than most people's best ones. As a standalone, this book is still pretty strong. But I found that I was happier with my mental idea of the Ender series before I read this book. If you'd read the first three, you too might be happier to just leave the loose ends dangling and imagine what might have been yourself."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I reviewed this book back in 1997, and a lot has happened since then, I think you'll agree. I've enjoyed re-reading and reviewing Card's books through the prism of 9-11, since it provides an interesting perspective. I like Card for his generally positive view of humanity, but 9-11 forced me to reconsider whether he was being positive or Pollyannish. Let's take a fresh look at CotM in that spirit.One of the interesting features of CotM is the exploration of the philosophy of \\"Necessarianism,\\" a belief structure positing that one should resist attacking an enemy up to a certain point, then make a devestating response. Interesting parallels to today, as the U.S. ramps up to blow Saddam to smithereens. But note that the Necessarians were *wrong* in CotM. They were willing to commit xenocide (twice or three times over) without allowing full contemplation of the alternatives. By extension, Card may argue that the U.S. is wrong today.I've also criticized Card for turning cultures into cartoons, and pointed out in another review that his \\"Somoa\\" in this book is particularly stereotyped and egregious. Does he do this for convenience? Lack of research? Or to not write a 1000-page book? Probably this last one. I trust Card to do right by the subjects he writes about. But it's annoying nontheless. Are we turning cultures into cartoons post 9-11? Maybe.Notice the dialecticalism (I assume that's a word) throughout the book? It contrasts to post 9-11 American attitudes, exemplified by Bush, that are what the French would call \\"Manichean.\\" Manicheanism (again, is that a word?) is incompatible with a dialectic form of argument, since the latter necessarily includes a synthesis. In CotM, the characters use dialectic argument to work their way through tough moral issues; could Bush be missing something by thinking in strictly black-and-white, good-vs-evil terms?Finally, I noted in my earlier review that Card's review of literature in his postscript was extremely interesting and informative. Card essentially argues that if a culture is self-referential, it has an established level of maturity and purpose. Using this standard in a broader context, post 9-11 I have witnessed a maturation of American culture unlike anything I would have imagined. The fact that other countries' peoples or elites think poorly of our \\"war on terror\\" is considered inconsequential to just about everyone except the New York Times editorial board -- and even they are coming around. I wonder how Card would write his postrscript now? Maybe we'll find out in a later book.One other thing. I can sympathize with the people who felt that Card went off the reservation with this book. Its tone, if not its structure, is very different even from \\"Xenocide.\\" I personally don't like Card's tendency to turn people into supemen in order to resolve plot conflicts. But the book is highly entertaining, logically consistent and thought-provoking. Very much worth the read."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Surprising how much fun these books are...this one offers a little more to bite into. Enjoy the read and get the whole series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite books from the Ender Saga. I literally could not put this one down."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This novel, the fourth in the Ender's Game series, is just as exceptional as the other three. Unlike many other authors, the series just gets even better with each novel. And this is just a truly wonderfully strange tale. One to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender's Game entertained me, Speaker for the Dead educated me, Xenocide enthralled me, and finally Children of the Mind absolutely immersed me. I think by far this book beholds the best character development out of all of the books. Establishing great characters from Xenocide, you truly get to know, feel, and grow with the focused characters in the fourth book as they develop relationships both brutally and beautifully, confront the final fears that the series has built up to while also producing an amazing end to the Ender Wiggin Saga. The many sides of the tale are so well intertwined, that connecting with the characters and their emotions become so much more easier than what Card did previously. All the profound touches on religion and culture are all here, fantastically written by Card yet again. If the first three books have kept you enraptured, do yourself a favor and finish the amazing saga with Children of the Mind."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This book is necessary because it gives you the conclusion to Ender's life, you definitely want to know what happens in his last days. But don't expect the read to be very similar to the other 3 books in the series. There's more inactivity. There's some asian history and philosophy. Being a student of science and never having had a deep interest in the liberal arts, I was only kept attentive to those philosophical discussions because I'm asian; others might find those parts boring.Overall it's still a great book, like all others in the Ender's Game series. You're left feeling disappointed that it's the end and there is no more to read about Ender, because reading the series was an experience."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Aftet the first three books in the Ender series, this book was simply a disappointment. It does not come close to living up to the standard set by those three books.I wish the series had ended with Xenocide, as this book is not worthy of the series, and Xenocide did not really leave more than one point that really needed to be resolved. That should have been done in the Xenocide, and we would not have had to suffer through this book. The manner in which the author brings back Peter and Valentine in this book, as well as the explanation of instantaneous travel through the stars just make the whole thing ridiculous.I gave this three stars only because of the characters involved and the story begun in better books. If you've read the other books in the series, you'll probably want to read this for closure, but prepare to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"It would be fair to say that this review of \\"Children of the Mind\\" encompasses the final portion of its predecessor, \\"Xenocide\\", as well. \\"Children of the Mind\\" is the final episode in the 4-book Ender's 'Quartet' that began with \\"Ender's Game\\" (though, it's not he final book in the Ender's series. There a additional books to tell more about this universe from alternate points of view). For the most part this four part 'magnum opus' by author Orson Scott Card is a fabulous science-fiction/personal drama saga. The legendary book \\"Ender's Game\\" more than lived up to the hype and was a winner of the two most prestigious science-fiction writing awards: Hugo and Nebula Awards. It's sequel, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", was a dramatically different, but equally affecting continuation of the story of Ender Wiggin. It, too, won the Hugo and Nebula Awards. The third story in this cycle, \\"Xenocide\\", was closer in tone to \\"Speaker...\\" and dealt the consequences of the actions taken in \\"Speaker...\\". For most of the book \\"Xenocide\\" was as compelling as \\"Speaker...\\" and seemed to be driving towards an exhilarating conclusion. Unfortunately, Card took a dramatically unexpected turn in attempting to resolve the issues. On the very surface, it seemed like a fascinating premise. But, as Card delved more deeply into the explanations of this solution, the concept got murkier and more convoluted. The concept of going \`out' of the physical universe and being \`pulled back in' at any location with no time loss seemed to be metaphysical and existential in its fleshed-out form.This problem plagues \\"Children of the Mind\\" because its whole story is based upon the concluding events in \\"Xenocide\\". Card's attempt find some deep and great meaning to everything sacrifices the very elements that made \\"Ender's Game\\", \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", and most of \\"Xenocide\\" such fine literature: it does deal with the depth of the characterization that powered the other stories. So expertly crafted in the earlier novels, the characters in \\"Children of the Mind\\" seem nothing more than two-dimensional caricatures of their earlier renderings.That being said, the reason \\"Children of the Mind\\" still merits a positive review is because it does wrap up the \`Ender's Quartet' in a satisfying manner and doesn't resort to any cheap gimmicks to bring about the resolutions. It's an above average novel that just seems very disappointing when compared to its predecessors."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I think this book was an original ending to an original saga. It is not the best of the four(of course Ender's game is,) but it does leave the series feeling complete in an original and exciting way. I completely enjoyed the series and highly recomend them all to my friends and also to you. I give the quartet +1 .....5 STARS ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I am truly astounded by Orson Scott Card's novel &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;. The novel can be thought of as a literary masterpiece; there are very few books out there that fit into this category. It's pages are filled with depth of character, plot, and issues pertinent to how life is viewed. Card is a great philosopher, and his work is full of theology, sociology, economy and other thought-provoking topics.Don't worry about the heaviness of the subject matter in &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; though. There is plenty of scientific thought and experimentation, and action to feed those who favor less introspective literature.Card has managed to combine the best elements of all kinds of storytelling to create a believeable, interesting, and entertaining sci-fi novel that is also a great commentary on humanity and its interaction with the Universe around it.&quot;Children of the Mind&quot; is one of the few books that deserve the epithet &quot;must read.&quot;"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"First of all, Children of the Mind was a great conclusion to the Ender saga, providing closure to a story that was already somewhat resolved. However, I don't think it is geared toward those who haven't read the earlier books in the series, so it could have done without all the review to catch readers up to speed. If you can survive reading over familiar plot details, then you should find this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I thought this book was great. I thought It was one of the best I've read. A great end to a great saga. I suffered though reading Speaker for The Dead and Xenocide, which weren't that bad but kind of slow and boring. But when I got to Children of the Mind I loved it. It was a great book and had a great ending and was just GREAT!!!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"When I first started reading the series with Ender's Game, I was blown away. That book was one of the best I have ever read. Speaker for the Dead was another strong book, though it wasn't as good as Ender's Game. Then came Xenocide, I was incredibly bored throughout the entire book, it had its good moments, but they couldn't make up for the rest of the book. I still wanted to read Children of the Mind because I wanted to finish the series. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it. I believe that it was a strong ending to an overall excellent series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"i liked it, it wasn't what I expected but then it's not my vision it's the authors for me to interpret.Ask yourself if books always turn out the way the reader wants then who is actually writing.Deep thought - common sense"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind, the last (?) book in the series, also happens to be the weakest. It's still worth reading, and is a very good book, but compared to Ender's Game, it's only mediocre. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, but after reading a book as fantastic as Ender's Game, it's a bit of a disappointment. It lacks the intensity and excitement that kept me reading in his other books. Also if it really is the conclusion, it's not much of one, because it doesn't really wrap up the series. Despite all this, I truly enjoyed it, and it was a very good read"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"After getting to the end of Xenocide, I lost interest in Orson Scott Card and his novels completely. Children of the Mind has renewed my faith and ended a sci-fi series which has secured its place at the level of Asimov's Foundation series. One can almost excuse the poorly thought out ending of Xenocide with this well thought out and executed ending of the Ender series.My only complaints are Ender's small part and anti-climatic exit in a saga that placed him so highly and it's inability to seperate the unrealistic, mystic aspect brought on in Xenocide with the genuine Sci-Fi magic that made the first two novels in the series classics of the genre.However, if you read Ender's Game and are wondering whether to continue through the series, the answer is a definite yes."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I'm just sorry that it's over. Card has created a wonderful world full of equally wonderful and unforgettable characters"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I want to preface this by saying that Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are two of the best novels that I have ever read. Unfortunately, Children of the Mind, while a good book, did not live up to my expectations. It does have some moments of brilliance, but there are not quite as many of them as in OSC's previous works. Part of the problem is that much less time is spent with Ender, and Ender is the central reason that most of us became such fanatics. It is still a must read if you have read the other three, if for no other reason than to gain some sense of closure (although as others have pointed out, there is at least one story line that is left open). Go ahead and get it, but don't get your hopes up too high"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I read this book in two dys and loved it.

If you haven't read the first books, read them first, otherwise you'll have a hard time understanding huge chunks of the plot. Taken as the conclusion of the series it's a great book, though not as good as the first two in the series. Ender's game (the first book) is one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read, so, remember - all critism is relative.It's a beautiful book - philosophy, drama, and science all blended together perfectly. I had to try to slow myself down as I was reading it - I was going so fast I was skipping lines! As soon as I finished it I wanted to read the series all over again, all at once. I know there are things I missed this time because of the time interval since I read Zenocide."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"CoTM is absolutely worth a read, and worthy of inclusion in the Ender story. Perhaps not as stunningly deep and thoughtful as Ender's Game or Speaker for the Dead, but on a par with Xenocide. Card is brilliant and original, as always. If you have read the first three, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"OK, I got over the fact that Ender had a cameo and then died. But I couldn't get over the lack of good hard science (like Speaker for the Dead's explanation of how piggies reproduced). What in the world is an aiua, anyway? Novinha had undergone a sorry change from the intriguing, pivotal character she used to be, and the new characters introduced were more blah than the Brady Bunch. Grace Drinker (couldn't find a better last name?) and her husband who laughs all the time were ludicrous. If there really was a Jane, she'd be rolling over in her ansible network"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I was disappointed with this fourth (and presumably final) installment of the Ender saga. Indeed, this story isn't really about Ender at all but about the 2 Ender &quot;clones&quot;, Peter and Valentine. While this does not make this a bad novel, frankly, I was hoping that Card would have found a way to make the demise of Andrew Wiggen, one of the more interesting protagonists in science fiction, more memorable. Wiggen's death is reduced to almost a footnote in this installment and I could never generate the same degree of interest in either Peter or the young Valentine"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"As with most of Card's books I found this a very interesting book to read. But at the end of the book I was disappointed. I felt that I would have enjoyed the book a lot more if Ender was not one of the main characters. You fall in love with Ender in Ender's Game and you want to see him put his harrowing experience at Battle School behind him, but you miss the happiest years of his life in this series because we are watching Valentine in space. When he gets back together with his wife, instead of being happy he is &quot;bored to death&quot;. And the book ends without really dealing with the descolada issue. The reincarnations of Peter and Valentine were interesting, but they really seemed ill-fitting to the rest of the plot. I am finding Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow much more worthwhile reads."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Well, the story is finally ended. Even though I have others books that i like more than any of this series, the Ender series is MY FAVORITE story and series that i have read. Just trust me and read it for yourself -"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I can\`t believe that someone in a previous review would call this corny. Card is the best SF writer there is,was,and always will be. this book was amazing I believe that the only book that ever matched up to this is Enders Game."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I have read almost ever single review that is listed on Amazon's site and must say that I am greatly disapointed with what people thought of Card's finish to the Ender's Game Series.... Personally I found Card's forth book to be inspiring and a much needed addition to the Science Fiction genre. People have complained about his technique and about certain aspects of his book. But, I think they all miss the point. Card has created a type of science fiction that hasn't been done before, the people that hate this book were shocked and because of the were disapointed, when the reality of this book is that it is superb. It is amazing, and I think it is Card's best Ender's Game book. Because it DOESN'T focus on the Science, that Card has already established, but focuses on the PEOPLE, which is what his reader's loved."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender, hurt in his childhood by the lack of it, guiltridden because of his harsh decisions during his stay at the battle and command schools, even though not knowing better what else to do at that time, gets a second chance.Humanity proves again to be most alien of all."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender's Game: 10, Speaker For the Dead: 9, Zenocide: 7, Children of The Mind: 5A lot of useless self-absorbed inner turmoil and ridiculous pseudo-science in this one. Doesn't have the hard, bitter edge that made Ender's Game so great. These characters bask annoyingly in repentance and unconscionably benevolent gestures toward humanity. And they preach too much--to each other, to themselves, and therefore to me. It seems as though Card went a little overboard with his latest attempt to teach us to be decent to one another, and in the process forgot to entertain us with plausible scenarios. The parallel to modern-day earth he attempts to portray through absurdly homogeneous ethnic worlds is simplistic, hardly a subtle or elegant allegory. But man, was Ender's Game good.Take us back to battle school. Please."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Card further refines his philosphy that misunderstanding results in tragedy, and that understanding results in joy and value. Characters are convincingly written, and it's a pleasure to once again return to the Ender's Game and &quot;Speaker&quot; cast of characters, who are older, wiser, and more complicated than ever. Card's personal notes at the end of the book should be required reading for any serious student of American literary culture, or for any serious student of American culture, period."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"While this is perhaps the weakest of the books in the Ender saga, that rating comes only in comparison to an awe-inspiring beginning. COTM perhaps didn't have the depth of the other novels, but Card did an excellent job of fleshing out some of the more minor characters from the previous stories.Most of the criticism of COTM seems to concern Card's rambling style. This stylistic choice may be seen as a reflection of Ender himself in his final days, a skillful projection of the personality of the main character onto the frame of the work. Card's narrative didn't ramble all the time; observant reading relates Card's style to the &quot;rambling&quot; of Ender's soul. This book needs to be read with an open mind and an eye to the author's art as well as his tale."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"A subplot of this last book is that Ender, having overlived his usefulness, finds himself slowly wasting away into a bland, lifeless shadow of his once radiant self. A better analogy for this book there will never be.My first regrets about having bought Children came about page 25, when I realised that the dialog up to that point had consistd entirely of whining and bickering. I wish I could find some redeeming quality to the last chapter in Ender's life, but I can't.Rest in peace Ender Wiggin"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I'm a big fan of Card's and think his Ender series is great, but Childred of the Mind just isn't very interesting. It's rambling and lack just about everything that's good in the other books in the series. The other books in the series are well told, full of imagery and interesting ideas and twists, and one develops empathy with his characters. His editors should have reminded Card of what makes him a good writer. Perhaps Card is starting to write above mortals like me, or perhaps he's getting a bit weird on us. I'd suggest skipping this book and trying something else he's written"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I bought this book thinking that there would be a wonderfully insightful, charming story filled with 3Dimensional characters, and Card's intriguing blend of science and fantasy. But no. (HEAVY SIGH) I loved Ender's Game, Speaker and Xenocide but this book . . . I don't know where to start. The pseudo philosophy which was so long and drawn out did not consist of philopsphy per se, but a never ending string of whys and wherefores put forth in whiny voices. YUCKY. The characters were so incredibly white and flatbread - no shades of grey - they just tumbled out of the book and landed SPLAT in my mind. Children of the Mind was more of a bunch of half formed ramblings that came to a quick, insignificant, and ludicrous ending (re: Peter, Wang-Mu and the Little Doctor). What was most disappointing was the Afterword and it's disturbing glimpse into Card's reasonings behind certain aspects of the story. I am sorry to say it has made me reluctant to buy any more of his novels. The disappointment of CotM after the brilliance of Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead is very disheartening."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Characters - Who cares? Plot - What plot? Science - No, not really. This is by far one of Card's weakest books, I guess he just felt he had to finish the series and Ender. Kind of Sad after the wonderful Ender's Game and the Good Speaker for the Dead. Read &quot;Lovelock&quot;, it's a wonderful book, stay away from this one!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I can't tell you how dissapointed I was in this book. It was not what I have come to expect from Orson Scott Card. Many authors take a concept to the point where they just fill pages with words (i.e. Piers Anthony &amp; his Xanth tales), but I expected more from this author. I know Card is capable of better work Treason, and the entire Alvin Maker series are a testament to that, but this last book in the Ender Wiggins saga is not in the same class as his other works. My best advice is to ignore this book and enjoy the Ender Wiggins Trilogy"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Don't bother reading this final book in the Ender series. I know, I know, the ending of Xenocide was a cliffhanger. However, you'll be more disappointed if you read Children of the Mind than if you imagine your own ending. The answers to how the fleet sent to destroy Lusitania is stopped do not merit an entire book. Children of the Mind is long and boring. All of the characters of the previous books seem like ghosts; they just fill the space. It is also very weird. Ender created young copies of Peter and Valentine, but they depend on him for life. Since they aren't their own people, they are not really Peter and Valentine at all, but Ender's personality in new bodies. Ender doesn't have the energy to keep three bodies going. The question of who will be discarded is a main focus of the book and is not satisfactorily dealt with. I found the whole idea rather stupid. Children of the Mind does not have the same feel as the other books. Almost no attention is given to alien species and several new principles are introduced that just don't seem to belong in the Ender universe. I had read Xenocide a few years before I read Children of the Mind, and I was satisfied with the end of that book. The series has been going downhill, and this book is rock bottom. It took away from the series instead of adding to it. Card should have left the series alone."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Like virtually everything that is written by Orson Scott Card, \\"Children of the Mind\\" is a masterpiece and a 'tour de force' and a couple of other superlatives as well. However, the complex philosophical ramblings involving aiuas and philotic twining and things of that ilk cause the book to lose some of the beauty and humanity that is so wonderful about the bulk of Card's works. As a result, there are no characters introduced developed that are nearly so enthralling and beloved as Ender himself, Valentine, Human, Han Fei-Tzu, and Si Wang-mu were in the previous novels. Some new characters are introduced - Grace Drinker and Malu for example - but the only one who approaches the pantheon of Card's beloved characters is Aimaina Hikari. Also, some of the characterizations are a bit of a stretch. The Peter Wiggin who greets Si Wang-mu as she enters his ship at the start of this book is not the same bitterly nasty Peter Wiggin that invited her onto the ship at the end of \\"Xenocide.\\" True, he does start it off by saying that he's not himself - meaning that he's really Ender - but the vulnerability he shows here is nothing like that seen in the previous book. And the nastiness and sarcasm he exhibits here is also nowhere as biting as it was previously. The other character of whom I have problems is Quara. She was pretty wacked out in \\"Xenocide,\\" but in this book she has become a caricature of herself. One of Card's skills is that he is able to develop his stories without having characters who are evil-intentioned or blindly anti-social. Instead, the antagonists make their decisions for perfectly rational and well-intended reasons, even if their decisions ultimately turn out to be poor ones. Look at Card's treatment of Admiral Bobby Lands' moral dilemna in this book for an example. Quara, however, doesn't have this quality. Her behaviour is just stupid and ultimately unbelievable, even given the explanations that are offered for it. Regardless, saying that this book does not quite equal the beauty or humanity of Card's other works does not mean that it does not remain a very good book. This is definitely a must read for anyone who is familiar with the Ender saga, unless you are one of those readers who are looking for an action-paced novel without much in terms of greater depth, in which case you should stop with \\"Ender's Game\\" and move on to \\"Ender's Shadow.\\""},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"If we were looking for a trip back to brilliance by Orson Scott Card when we picked up this last book, we were sorely dissappointed. Enders Game is truly the only excellent piece of literature to come out of this series. Card seemed to be struggling for a plot. His examination of Japanese culture and of obsessive compulsive disorder is interesting, but he seems unable to really tie it in with the rest of the book and to me it seems like a gimic. I however have read everything that Card has written and might be a harsher critic of his writings than those who have just been reading his Ender series. It is certainly a fun and easy read, it just doesn't match up with Enders Game, Songmaster, or The Worthing Saga (my three favorite books by Card)."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This is by far the weakest of the Ender series. It could easily be cut in half with the loss of absolutely nothing. It is verbose in the basest sense. The dialogue is repetitive in the sense of ideas. Why take one sentence when you can drone on for a whole chapter? Card seems unable to simply be satisfied in making his point, or illustrating an idea. He just repeats the same ideas, the same concepts and the same one dimensional character personalities over, and over and over again. The conflicts are contrived and the solutions simplistic and predictable. Arrrggghh! It took me over two weeks to wade through this book because it bored me so much!It is as if Card merged the WORST of Camus, Dostoevsky and Asmiov-- Unending descriptions of introspective character musings by simpletons obsessing about themselves in a futuristic setting."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender's Game is a great book. Speaker for the Dead is a good book with some great new concepts. Xenocide and CotM are truly awful with CotM being so bad it is painful to read. And it sets up the reader for yet another sequel. Oh. Please. No.In CotM, Ender just withers on the vine. In the end, he literally bores himself to death. He must have been reading this book.Ender's Game readers will want to read the entire \\"quartet\\". Do so if you must, but be aware that life is short and you will never get these hours back. Do yourself a favor, pretend Xenocide and CotM do not exist and read the Shadow series if you need more in the Ender world."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I read the whole series, and I must say that the middle section of the progression lacks something. The bookends of the series were much better, but perhaps I just got used to reading from the abnormally-intelligent-children's perspective."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"After reading Xenocide , I was eager to read Children of the Mind. Children of the Mind was a lot better than I thought it would be after reading Xenocide and having been disappointed with Card straying from his roots that made Ender's Game and Speaker of the Dead such good books in the series. What makes Children of the Mind great is not only does it make up for Card pouring his heart's philosophies out in Xenocide, but Children of the Mind does what the last book in a series should do; which is close it out in a proper fashion. The plot, the story, and the amount of philosophy are all just right in Children of the Mind. Readers who are coming off Xenocide will be pleasantly surprised to find the Children of the Mind is nothing like its philosophical other half in Xenocide. In particular, the strengths of Children of the Mind include believable characters such as Grace Drinker, Malu, and Wang-Mu. I've enjoyed the Ender Quartet immensely as I've searched the summer for cures to boredom. With the Ender's Quartet I not only found a way to pass the time but found out some things about the world around me and how Card teaches the reader as well as writing a particularly good storyline."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender's Game= great, Speaker for the dead- good, Xenocid= GREAT, but Children of the mind=poor. Card in his last book of the Ender &quot;quartet&quot; just reies to juggle to many themes and eventually just loses himself and ends up with a heaped up plot. The book is left wide open open the issue of the new species, the descoladores, who made the virus. Though this is the last of the ENDER books, Card should write ONE last novel to tie up all the lose ends like the issue of Jane, Peter &amp; wang-mu, Starways Congress's response to hearing the descolada netralized, and they should be alerted about the descoladores! The next book should mainly be about the descoladores. THERE SHOULD BE A NEXT BOOK TO CLOSE THE HOLES."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Orson Scott Card was just criticizing Star Trek in the Houston Chronicle. So it's amazing that this book feels just like a bad Star Trek book. This is because of how XENOCIDE ended. The first two Ender books were perfect, and why? Because they WEREN'T STAR TREK! There were a few liberties taken, but generally the books were quite intelligent, even if the pacing was warped and disorienting in SPEAKER. I first realized the series was declining in XENOCIDE when I read the argument about Jane cutting off the fleet, which was really quite stupid and pointless, and didn't feel like pro sci-fi. Fortunately, I was drawn into the emotions of Qing-Jao and Wang-Mu...then BAM! Jane decides \\"oh, let's make a hyperdrive\\", and not only do they, but *gasp* a bunch of guys pop out of Ender's and Miro's heads! Then, Peter shows up at that Chinese place and says \\"Yo, guys, I'm gonna go take down an interstellar empire and all it'll take is some talking and a little traveling! But I've got a hyperdrive, so hop on!\\" or something like that.I put the book down, swore a lot, and made a commitment that, while I would buy the last book so that I would be satisfied with finality, I would never buy another OSC book ever. EVER.As Card explains, this is the second half of XENOCIDE, expanded a bit. And it is ridiculous, it gets worse and worse, and it's all thanks to Xenocide. Peter and W-M hop around the star systems trying to get people to stop Congress--yeah, great. And I bet that all it'll take to convince Americans to take over D.C. and establish an imperial world government is some talking and two weeks, too.And then there's the Descoladores. Another side-story set up by the third book. The entire debate about the virus being intelligent was unneeded, just fattened up the book a bit. The fact that the inhabitants of Lusitania manage to discover another sentient species of aliens--with which the humans will probably be warring--even as the Fleet approaches. Getting a bit far-fetched.The book really sinks to the level of common sci-fi. The only refreshing character is the Fleet Admiral, but even he is paper-thin. And pretty stupid, too.If only it weren't for Xenocide. This could have been great...but it just isn't. Instead, it's a joke.Speaking of which, OSC has announched his next book after Majic Street:The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Franchises: Kill a Franchse Without Really Trying!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Let's be frank - if you're still reading all these reviews by now, you're a hardcore Ender Wiggin fan. Which means that you've already read the book, which means you don't need me to summarize any further. I would like to tell you my experience with the Ender Saga - I started in my early pre-pubescence and ended Children of the Mind in the last year of high school. It has paralleled my development most interestingly - starting out with incredible surety and pride and ending in self-conscious philosophy. Be honest - no real reader would tolerate Children of the Mind if he (or she, but most likely he) was not tied up in the series. The writing sags alarmingly, the plot frays like old rope and the characters' emotions are stamped directly onto their cardboard surfaces. I think part of the intense appeal of the Ender saga is that most of us read it in our youth. We all love the story of the boy genius - we all dare to draw the parallels between his life and our own. By reaching such an uppity segment of the reading populace, intentionally or not, Card has unmasked one doozy of a love/hate relationship. So feel free to read Ender from his first moments of brillance to his tragicomic death. But if you compare yourself to him, even if only in your head, remember that his life has turned out just as absurdly as anyone else's."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Like most ever other reviewer here, I read the entire Ender's series up through this book. While Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are outstanding books (five star worthy), Xenocide and Children of the Mind are simply irritating. I despised all the characters, who were so self-centered and so completely flawed you have no connection to them to care whether they die or live, and can't conceive they could succeed at anything. Page after page of characters contemplating their relationships with the other characters makes for a very boring read, and I found myself skimming much of the book. *spoiler* Without Ender, who essentially withdrawls from the narrative to have a relationship with his angry-at-the-world wife, there are simply no sympathetic or interesting characters that you really care about. But hey, at least I read all four books."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Another ebook in the Ender series, which is as well written and entertaining as the previous ones. I recommend this ebook to everyone. After buying and reading this ebook, don't forget too rate it and write a review, your vote is important."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I've never liked the end of the Ender Saga as much as the beginning. Speaker for the Dead is a hard act to follow. The first couple of times listened to the series, I severely disliked Xenocide and CotM was a consolation, a resolution to the conflict of SftD, if nothing else. I resolved not to read the end of the series again once I'd done it once and found out the story.But even now, on my third time through, I still couldn't just stop with Speaker. I had to finish out the series, and I'll say that I appreciated Xenocide more this third time around, and Children of the Mind was actually the story I rolled my eyes through. I guess you do get something different out of a book every time you read it (or listen, as it were). While Xenocide was formerly the book I sighed through, rolling my eyes at what I perceived to be OSC's personal dogma coming through his story, this time it was CotM.I wish I'd written the review as I was listening instead of waiting a couple of weeks and a couple more books before sitting down, because I can't remember what exactly it was that rubbed me wrong about this book this time around. But I remember being surprised that I disliked it so much, as before it was my consolation after wading through Xenocide. Let's just say either way, I was happy to jump back to Ender's Shadow.I've gotten something different out of this book every time I read it, anyway, and I will probably continue to work my way through the entire series once every year or two, as I've done since first picking it up."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I don't know why I was a little disappointed in this book. I was excited to see the characters I left behind during the last Orson Scott Card read, that was the wrong one. This at least continued plot points that I wanted to see expanded on. But at least twice I felt the author came to an end. Middle of the book could have been an ending. At least Mr. Card didn't leave us there. The actual ending was much more satisfying.As of today I have the next book in the series in my Kindle ready and waiting. But I will try and read other \\"real\\" books awaiting review before I get started. My friends were right. I am addicted to Ender and his games! :)"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Finally things are tied up in this finale! The third book was terrible, but this one made up for it!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender's Game will forever be the king of this series, the best there is to offer. Nevertheless, this book holds its own against the heavyweight competiton."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind was different in a way from the first three books. Ender has not played a big role in the book compared to the other books. You could say he has not played a big role because in the begining of the book he joined his wife in the Filhos. But in a way he is playing the biggest role. You could say he is playing a big role, because of Peter and Val. Peter and Val are a piece of Ender if they want to be or not. You could say he is living through them without even doing anything. Peter and Val came about when Ender, Miro, and Ela traveled to outside space. When they were in outside space Ender must have had his perception of Peter and Val in his supconcious and they were created some how through him. Now Peter and Wang-Mu are on a mission to find the person that would have the power to persuade Starways Congress to stop the Lusitania Fleet from destroying Lusitania.

The other books in the series are bubble gum for the brain"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Ender's Game was fascinating but Speaker for the Dead had very little action and this book just was the absolute pit. Card sets up situations and then never uses them, the actions of his characters are all futile and every character is just a repeat of one created in a previous novel with a personality quirk. More importantly, we never discover who the people really are; we only learn their basic epithet, the blind one, the religious one, the silly one.The entire \\"Descoloda is sentient\\" argument gets tedious, the same conversations are repeated multiple times and nothing really happens for a really long time as if Card suddenly remembered that something actually has to HAPPEN in a book. The OCD people are just irritating. Card also creates charactes with potential (like Plikt) then discards them and they aren't spoken of again. Also he seems to write himself into holes and then have to write himself out again with this \\"Well what we spent the last 400 pages saying wasn't true suddenly is.\\" The \\"think-travel\\" is just ridiculous.

It was written by Orson Scoot Card. This is the first time I have heard of his writing. In fact I thought it was great. The book a lot of description in it and if you like science fiction you should love this book. My opinion on this book is once you start reading you can't and you don't wont to stop. Each thing that happened is tied into another.In this book Children of the Mind there were basically two teams or partners in this book. There was Miro and Young Val. Then Peter and Wang-mu. Peter is a creation of Ender but this isn't any kind if creation. Peter is a body but has no true soul he is really Ender. Peter and Wang-mu's job is to find information on people, plant's, and Jane.Miro and Young Val have Basically the same situation. Miro was given a body from Ender. While Young Val has the same thing as Peter She is only made up. In realty she is there but in souls she isn't even born. These two have to search for new plants for the species.So the reason they have to do these job's is because Starways Congress wants to blow up the planet Lusitania because it is threatened to have a virus. Jane, an evolved super computer, can help them save the planet but she will be shut down at any moment. The big problem is three species will die: the pequienios or trees, humans, and hive queens, which are like ants. While Jane is alive she can move ships faster than light. The question is: Will Jane live and be able to transport all the species? Can they save Jane before the planet is blown up?The Literary Elements were foreshadowing, drama, and sensory language. It even has some conflict. Well I recommend this book to any person who likes science fiction and who wants to read about what dilemmas people will have in the year 3000."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I loved Game, Shadow &amp; Speaker.

I cried when Ender died, (although he didn't die his aiua passed on to Peter) the character of Ender died. Through the series I have gotten so attatched to his character unlike any other character in any series. Through his guilt of xenocide, and hard life it was hard to read sometimess. Especially, when he had problems with Novinha in Xenocide, losing her for the time being but gaining her back in COTM. His funeral was very touching, and probably the best part in the book. The whole book was good, and had a satisfying ending. The philotes were a bit confusing, but oh well. Ender's Game is being made into a movie, and I doubt it's going to be very good, but they can make it good if they go into the emotions of the characters, not just the battles. The thing that I liked best about the series was the characterization, especially the character of Ender. After a life full of guilt he can live a new life.

All those Islamic terrorists trying to destroy America apparently don't realize that all you have to do to overthrow a superpower is bounce around a bit. Sounds ridiculous? That's not even half as ridiculous as this piece of...well, this mistake.The end of Xenocide was bad enough, when we learned that all your problems can be solved just by traveling to the magic dimension. Now, only a few weeks have past and not only have our heroes discovered a new race of alien species, but Jane--now a goddess-- has figured out that she was never really going to die anyway because she has the power to take over someone's body. Ender is boring himself to death, and Dark Peter and Wang-Mu are hopping around looking for random people to preach to.

A very good read!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"have not yet read the book, but it came quickly and I am happy"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This book ventures off into a nice story line that differs from the others.

It's almost as if the author wrote them all and then found places to end one book and start the other. This makes for a nice flow between characters when they speak to each other. It's also nice because it doesn't take 50 or 100 pages to get into a new book... it is simply a continuation of the previous book....I'm not sure there will be any more in this series after his last one, which is sad, but... a good series. Young adults I'm sure would love these! I as a full adult sure did.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I really enjoyed the first 3 books of the Ender series. This one- it was not very compelling. It took me weeks to finish where the first 3 books took a couple of days."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"About a quarter of the way through the book, I started mentally ticking whenever a character would \\"burst into tears\\" or start \\"weeping\\" at someone's unnecessary emotional badgering or their sudden epiphany about the pointlessness of it all, and it became an almost unreadable soggy mess, sappier than tumblr at its worse.This wouldn't warrant such a horrible rating if it were just for that fact. But really that outlines the bigger problem, that too many times the emotional reaction from the characters was forced on us in inner tirades and monologues that SATURATE this novel, not tastefully pepper as in the previous installments. The best books evoke from the reader that \\"Oh...\\" moment, or a gasp, without characters musing ad nauseum about the meaning of it all. As if in Inception, they \\"went deeper\\" about 5 times more, Card introduces too many shallow, fake characters not even to fill a plot hole; they themselves dig the plot holes and then half-heartedly fill them all by themselves (the business family, the military officials? pointless). Every female character in this book is a bitch. No tension or suspense. Everything happens perfectly, there wasn't a single disappointment for any of the characters of the book, imagining these wildly implausible deus ex machina solutions, which all perfectly work.Nothing really happens plot-wise in this book. I read it dutifully having finished the first three in the series, expecting an incredible finale, but it really was a disappointment. Read Xenocide and stop while you're ahead."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I've enjoyed all the books in the Ender series so far, and I'm making my way through the Shadow series right now. This book for now seems like the grand culmination of Ender's 3000+ year life (even though I think there may be another book being added? I'm not sure), and it brings a fair amount of closure to most of Novinha's family, while still leaving enough room open for potentially another novel. I see it as a slightly more philosophical/reflective novel, but at the same time there are some parts that seemed wildly fantastical even keeping in mind that it's all Sci-Fi. All that said, I still loved it, and enjoyed it just as much as the others in the series; every one of these books has been fascinating to me. Obviously, if you haven't read the previous books, it's probably not a good place to start."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I read Ender's Game for the first time when I was in high school.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed reading the entire series, but the ending was a bit dissapointing."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I dunno--I liked the other three books in the series. For some reason, though, this one just seemed tedious. Character interaction is there, sure, but it seems dull and plodding.

Card's biggest (only?) letdown."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I have read every book Orson Scott Card has written, even his non-fiction works. Ender's Game will always rank as a top Science Fiction work. My wife and I are writers who admire his work. I just reread Songmaster, one of my favorite Card novels and choked up in places. Card can summon emotions from the written page as well as any writer alive. After reading Card's \`How to Write Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy, I was inspired to start writing. I wrote Alien Rapture with Brad Steiger and have completed two other fiction works soon to be on amazon.com. I recommend this book to everyone and if you love science fiction enough you might want to read about how to write it. Card is a superb professional writer, teacher, and dreamer who all should admire."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I greatly enjoyed Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. The writing was wonderful, the characterization was excellent, and the plot was interesting and detailed. The first half or so of Xenocide was also wonderful, and the Godspoken of Path were intriguing characters. But by the end of Xenocide, I became disappointed, and Children of the Mind did little to change that. The philotes plot seemed silly (was he just trying to rescue himself after writing himself into a corner with the Lusitania Fleet?) The characters sagged. The new characters were two dimensional in their basic definition, and the book seemed just a forum to air his strange science twists. Even science fiction should still be based on characters and plot, not science or philosophy."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This book was a great way to finish the Ender series. Everything turned out just the way it should. I also like it, because it was a very human story. It isn't a happily ever after fantasy.

It really is the best story I've ever read."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Many times I have read a book and could barely contain myself while waiting for its sequal, but was extremely dissapointed by its successor. This book -- this series -- however, is quite a different story. While reading each and every book, I could hardly contain my excitement as I read line after line. It was almost too much for me to just read one sentence at a time, as I wanted desperately to take it all in at once. Even though I knew that each line brought me that much more information and detail about the world that Card has beautifully spun through these works, I found it sad to continue to read because I knew that it would also bring that much closer to the completion of the story.

But now I relise that Xenocide was just in preperation for the finale, Children of the Mind which I am happy to give 10 out of 10 because it really is brilliant and I say WOW all the time while reading it. Though not as good as the first 2, it is essential. Though very sad. And it leaves with a question that MUST be answered but oh it's the final."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I am a complete fan of Orson Scott Card, and have read dozens of books written by him. Nevertheless, COTM is not the &quot;perfect&quot; ending to the Ender Series. Although I have to admit, I was awed by some of the concepts of the book, I didn't necessarily like the sense of &quot;stoping before the ending.&quot; It leaves you wondering what is going to happen with the Descoladores planet, and Peter's new life.Although this is a set-back, I do also have to comment on the good parts of the book. The &quot;super-string theory&quot; that is represented in a different, but similar, way by &quot;philotes&quot; in this book. The belief of sub-atomic particles that are what all life is made of. The only difference is that philotes are in a sense a being themselves.The theory of an &quot;outside&quot; existing is also another theory that is described when one reads into the existence of co-existing dimensions that sometimes overlap on one another (claiming to be a reason for the appearance of ghosts). I believe that Card states many very facinating theories in a very different prespective, but a very realistic point of view."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I thought Children of the Mind was kind of boring and disconnected. And why did Ender have to die and go into another person. That soul/body stuff really got boring after while. The one thing that makes this book worth reading is the quotes the characters make and the philosophy stuff at the beginning of each chapter. If you are interested in Card's best though, read Ender's Game or Lost Boys."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"since i'm from israel i had to read all the first three books in hebrew, but took an effort and read the fourth in english. I finished it in 2 days. Orson's writing if flowing and easy to comprehend, even for foreigners like myself. The story is full of philosophical aspects and it enriches the reader, and gives the book the title of a classic noble, and not just yet another sci fi book."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Card thanks all the readers who sent in suggestions via his website in the intro to this book. Perhaps he should have ignored them. The story is disjointed and impossible to follow and lacks any of the suspense and excitement that Card created in the earlier Ender novels. Nor does the reader come to care about the characters, previously a Card strength (both in the Ender books and his other work). Perhaps this is because Jane is the focus of the story, and Card has failed to construct a complex being out of an annoying computer program, relying instead on the technological marvel of her self-awareness to carry him through. It doesn't. Overall, a complete and total UGH. I've hesitantly bought Ender's Shadow, and am praying that it is more like the first three than this disaster."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"It's probably pointless to try and convince someone not to read this book, as anyone completing the first three in the series would almost certainly want to read the next chapter. However, know that Children of the Mind feels like it was cranked out in a weekend, and besides being weakly written, it's outrageously boring and far-fetched. Any \\"reality\\" (a relative term to science fiction) which grounded the first three books is gone here. Ender's Game is great, Speaker for the Dead is different but every bit as good, and Xenocide begins the slide in the series, as Card loses steam and begins losing his grip on his own creation. Finally, Children of the Mind was a chore to read. I eventually skipped most of the last third and went to the end. It was so bad, in fact, that it ended my interest in reading Orson Scott Card, at least for the time being. In the end, Children of the Mind is about as essential to the Ender saga as the new Star Wars movies are to the original trilogy (basically an hack-job of a follow-up). Avoid."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Talk about pretentious -- in the afterword to Children of the Mind, Orson Scott Card compares himself to Nobel Prize winning author Kenzaburo Oe. And that really illustrates the problems not only with this latest novel, but the problem of the Ender series, in general.Card is so taken with moral and character dilemmas that he gives short shrift to the actual plot of the story. It might be acceptable if Card had the craft and skill of good &quot;mainstream&quot; author, but he is so heavy-handed that his attempts at literary depth are embarassing.Ender's Game was a great novel because Card did a magnificent job of compression; the result was a taut, gripping and moving story. Speaker For The Dead was a very good novel because the main plot involving the mystery of piggy culture and biology was strong enough to carry the reader past the bland soap opera of the Portugese biologist's family.But the third novel, Xenocide, completely collapsed under its weight, and C! hildren of the Mind -- after starting with what is admittedly a touching scene with Ender and his wife in the monastery -- dissolves into a mess. Any interesting plot flow that might have moved the book forward stops dead every time -- and there are many of them -- Mr. Card yields to his didactic side and inserts a boring, almost expository, conversation about the meaning of reality.Mr. Card also continues another unfortunate trend that began in Speaker For the Dead, as he again speculates on how different ethnic cultures might handle space colonization. No doubt the author is exploring his own well-intentioned curiosity about other people, but his literary clumsiness again betrays him and the results are parodies, such as Japanese wisemen spouting Lotus wisdom and Pacific Islanders who have the wherewithal for space travel but still row on bamboo craft to speak to primitive prophets. It's as annoying as the Catholic Portugese stereotypes that populated Speaker and as insul! ting as Xenocide's Chinese Geniuses-Who-Speak-Like-Confuciu! s.Children of the Mind tries to give us a cliffhanger ending with an interesting mystery to be explored, but although the sci-fi concept itself does have its intrigue, I just can't take any more of these characters."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Personally, I am glad that this is the end of the &quot;EnderSaga&quot;. Basically every character has already been exploited tothe fullest, and addition of any more characters would seem artificial and contrived. It is particularly sad that Card doesn't seem to intend to flesh out the characters fully - in some places (particularly Grace Drinker's house) the chracters don't seem to think, but rather blurt out pieces of the plot. They are either omniscient or Card chose to leave out the wonderful passages delineating the characters' train of thought that were the key features of the earlier books. Likewise, the imagery is quite lacking. Despite the fact that the characters hop from planet to planet I felt little difference. The very idea that each nationality settled a single planet that is exactly like their homeland seems &quot;a bit&quot; contrived. The superscience (exchanges of soul, instant travel, etc.) is poorly handled, at least in my opinion. Card seems to use Jane's &quot;teleportation&quot; just like Ender's incredible intelligence in Ender's Game, to surpise and overwhelm foes. But unlike Ender's Game, where the reader cheers for Ender, in CotM I found myself thinking that Wang Mu and Peter were exploiting someone else's resources. It is truly a sad sight to see one's once-favorite character's die down. The plot is somewhat naive. The character's are either tangled up in their personal relationships or are very crude in their means (once again, Peter and Wang Mu). All in all, I am happy that this is the end. Any more would be stupid."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"He misses the mark on almost all counts. The charecterization sucks and the plot *feels* manufactured. The growth of Ender Wiggin from a child to the speaker for the dead has been dealt with beautifuly in his earlier books but the entwining of ALL threads into this story is frankly unacceptable.In fact I even see traces of Alvin in Children of .."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I just finished Children of the Mind, the last of the 4-part series on Ender et al. The first book, Ender's Game, is really self contained, requiring no further reading. The next three books are a series, basically covering a colony on the planet Lusitania 3000 years in the future from when Ender's Game concluded. Ender and his sister have been star hopping, traveling so close to the speed of light when relocating that they essentially haven't aged much during that time. They now feel it's time to settle down and take root.I have mixed feelings on this book and the others. I will just summarize below.The good:Card has created a very interesting world! The story revolves around the planet of Lusitania and the (ultra) Catholic colony of Milagre. The planet was already populated by the pequeninos and their \\"sacred trees\\", pequeninos who have proved their worthiness to be sacrificed and reborn as a tree for breeding pequeninos, before the humans arrived. Ender adds the last remaining Hive Queen to the mix. Jane, a good-hearted computer program that sprang to life over the instantaneous ansible network, is there to help whenever needed.I also loved the other worlds in the story, like \\"Path\\", a Chinese colony world, and \\"Divine Wind\\", based on Japan. (These specialized worlds remind me of satellite radio stations ...) All the characters and philosophical teachings on Path were easy to digest, but with a strange lack of technology (which I mention later). It isn't explicitly stated, but it seems that some try returning to the simpler life, which seems much like the Amish.Ender's brother, Peter, is blunt, arrogant and ambitious, but in a good way.Metaphysics: there's plenty of it here. Card seems a little obsessed with the subject, essentially using the story as a vehicle to discuss some interesting ideas he's undoubtedly formulated over the years. Most of it is interesting... whether you will like it in the doses he feeds us is to be determined. I also found many of his philological and psychological observations and statements, voiced via the books' characters, fun. Hats off to Card's observation and analysis skills :)The ending has decent, though not complete, closure, Some may not like the way it ends, but I found it refreshing for whatever reason.The bad:Well, my biggest complaint is that all three books - Speaker, Xenocide and Children - are really longwinded. He could easily have his characters get their point across with far fewer words. I know editing is one of the hardest things for an author to do, but 10-20% of these books (easy) could go without anyone noticing. More than likely he edited a lot out already, but there's still way too much repetition. A writer needs to have friends (or publishers) who will tell them the truth here.As noted, many of the characters are interesting; Sadly, many are extremely boring and whinny, really testing the reader's patience. Ender's entire adopted family for instance, which sort of reminded me of the crazy drunk family down the street but with PhDs, whined and argued the entire three books... Of course, Card could have intended these characters to be just that (it probably takes just as much literary talent to create annoying characters as pleasing ones. But since I'm not a writer, I really wouldn't know). Ender's sister is also quite yawning.The books 'jump the shark' in many spots, esp when it comes to space travel. I won't spoil it, but things get a little unbelievable even for a sci-fi story. Networks that exist in the mind using instantaneous thought transmissions and so on .. it's all in there, a smorgasbord of wild ideas (!)Concerning future technology, you can really see how Card tries to sidestep the entire 'What will they be able to do in the future?' question. He willfully avoids reference to future vehicles, dwellings, medical advancements, and so on, glossing over any details.But in the process, this interferes with the story. For instance, Ender's angry young adapted son Miro is seriously injured trying to climb an electrified fence. He suffers sever spinal and nerve damage, making it difficult for him to walk and talk normally (he supposedly brain damaged too, but I saw no evidence in the story). Are we really supposed to believe that some 3000 years in the future, humanity has made no medical advancements to cure nerve damage?? This is but one small example of Card copping out on this area, but maybe he felt he wanted to tell a story and not spend time guessing of future gadgets (you're bound to be mostly wrong anyway, I would think).Card did seem fascinated - even obsessed - with people (especially women) 'telling off' someone. (Imagine that you're stuck in an RV with a really annoying angry partner, nagging the entire time.) I must have read this 10-15 times in the three books.. basically the same sequence; attack, catch air, attack, catch some more air, and destroy. Since writers often use real world experiences in their work, I can only pity the author :)The bottom line:Card's world of Lusitania and many characters are fun, and I feel like a spent a few years of my life on the planet, in a modest house watching the pequeninos and Hive Queen workers moving about. A simple life, indeed. The books were frustrating at times, taking a lot of patience to read them (I skimmed a little here and there, especially when a character decided to tell another one off ..yet again). If you have the time, take up the challenge. I'm glad I did, though they may not be for everyone."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Though one might argue that Card has put as much or more work into explaining the nature of his fictitious universe in this novel as any other, in terms of actual writing it feels as though he phoned this one in. The book lacks heart, meaningful character development and believability. The brilliant characters that the story centers around make consistently illogical decisions, interact in melodramatic fits of superficial dramatic tension, and overall fail to come across as either authentic geniuses or authentic human begins, let alone both. This unfortunate shortcoming holds true for Ender (all three of him) all the way down. What's more, Card seems to be incapable of sticking with a character to the end, abandoning Ender Wiggin in Children of the Mind in a way analogous to the treatment of Julian \\"Bean\\" Delphiki in Shadow of the Giant: getting rid of him in order to make way for characters he personally finds more interesting (interestingly, one happens to be the same character he pushed Bean aside for). Above all of these difficulties, however, the book's greatest weakness is the plot's utter reliance on a central deus ex machina, essentially giving the main protagonists unlimited power and simultaneously solving all of the problems that they don't create for themselves out of their own mean-spiritedness. The plot for the development of this magical solution to all of life's woes (which actually takes place in Xenocide) plays out like a cheap saturday morning cartoon: the main characters simply use 'science' to make things happen, and they happen. This is especially disappointing coming from an author like Card, who in the past has always demonstrated a rigid devotion to making his science fiction as realistic and fundamentally feasible as possible. If you read Speaker for the Dead, stop there and consider yourself fortunate. If you read Xenocide and felt that the story was doing anything other than getting better and better with each silly development, skip this book. And if you are the type of person who absolutely has to have a conclusion at all costs, take an afternoon to write a few pages of fan fiction and have done; I guarantee that it will leave you far more satisfied than the disappointing conclusion that Card has crafted for you."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"&quot;Children of the Mind&quot; finishes the story of EnderWiggins, as he finally reaches reconciliation with his past and present. A dazzling array of ideas and conflicts, the novel comes to a very satisfying conclusion. Starting &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; was a tremendous relief, because the ending of &quot;Xenocide&quot; had angered me with what seemed like an arbitrary escape from the plot complications. Rather, the introduction of Peter and Valentine from the combination of Ender's mind and the new mode of instantaneous travel come to fruition in this novel, and prove to be the point of Card's entire quartet. As always, this deeply religious man uses science fiction and fantasy as allegories to study the human spirit in all its facets. Essentially, Card is proposing the divine nature of the universe, and its identification with each and every mind as part of that divinity. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau proposed much the same thing, as did Robert Heinlein in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land.&quot; But Card takes these concepts to their broadest reaches in his recreation of the very structure of the universe, hinging the entire plot and character development of his entire series on this discovery. Like all endings should, this novel moves much faster than the previous two books; in many ways, it's the easiest to read of the series after &quot;Ender's Game.&quot; Anybody who professes to be a science fiction fan needs to read this series; it's one of the classics of the genre"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind is indeed a stunning and well-written conclusion to the best science-fiction series of all time. It is the second-best book that I have ever had the privilege to read, next to Ender's Game. The relationships are so well-developed that it makes one feel as if they themselves are in the characters' positions. Card does such a brilliant job of drawing the reader into the plot that I was almost unable to put it down. The book also gives surprising twists, as with the complications made by the young Valentine and Peter. Ender's step-children's personalities are also given depth in this book, showing their humanity. Ender is also portrayed in a different light, showing the dependent, vulnerable side of him rather than the headstrong, independent man that many thought he was. If you have not read this book but have read Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide, I recommend that you immediately purchase and read it. It is a worthwhile experience that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"&quot;Jane closed her eyes, smiled, and then all four of them were gone. Only the mothertree remained in the center of the clearing, bathed in light, heavy with fruit, festooned with blossoms, a perpetual celebrant to the ancient mystery of life&quot; I write this last paragraph of &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; from memory as I felt it was worth it to memorize the ending to the greatest SCI-FI saga ever written. This book ending the &quot;Ender's Saga&quot; is a masterpiece of writing. The characters are rich and full of life both good and bad. The morale battles waged are gripping and thought provoking. I recommend without any reservations that anyone who loves to read a well written story that they buy all the books in the series and pass them on to friends, family and loved ones as you will be giving them a gift of more than just words on a page but a gift of what life is all about."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Though I am a fan of Mr. Card, I must say this series of books has made Sci-Fi readers of people not originally Sci-Fi readers. As for me, I liked the twists and turns this book brought about from the beginning. I thought it was befitting for Ender to move on in this book. I also liked how Jane was tied together with the rest of the characters. I have read comments from the naysayers, but Mr. Card really puts pieces of his life into this book. Those of you who are familiar with his life, can see a part of his life and culture tied directly to this book as well as others he wrote. To the new reader, please start at the beginning book, Ender's Game, and read the entire series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I opened this book, and read it in two nights. It was so well written, and was so powerful. I loved it and couldn't put it down. It's a must read for anyone who likes science fiction. You really get the feeling for the characters, and all of their pain, and their joy. Rivals Ender's Game in quality. A MUST READ FOR ALL!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"You thought Ender's Game is one of the very best books written?You thought Speaker of the Dead was a good book?You thought Xenocide was slightly above average?You'll think this is god awful... but you'll have to read it, because you're an Ender fan. But I'd skip this and go read 'Hyperion' by Dan Simmons or some really classic Sci-Fi like Asimov, or even ENDER'S GAME again"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"... the rest is history.While yes, this book does seem quite predictable, no, there are not many surprises in the plot, those two issues don't seem to annoy you when you're reading; mostly because what Scott Card does is arouse so many interesting points and ideas that grab your attention, you just don't care that everything always turns out as you expect it.While the storyline is excellent for those who love to just read a plain book, people miss out on so much until they search deeper into the hidden philosophy within. One key section that Card explains in the postlude is his discussion (through Wang-Mu) of the Center and Edge Nations throughout history. But also auias, philotic twining, Outspace and Inspace... sometimes it makes you wonder why some of his ideas seem so logical... and why do many science fiction writers include something along those lines? Makes you think. Huh. Well, anyway, I would strongly suggest this book to anyone who has ever read Ender's Game... but read the second and third books first! You'd miss out on a lot if you didn't. This fourth book is not quite as graphic as Ender's game... so it could be suitable for younger readers. I don't know if they would be interested in the complex ideas, though. Try them out on Harry Potter first."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I just finished this book and I read it not too long after reading 'Xenocide'. I really should review 'Xenocide' but I wanted to get this out while it was still fresh since 'Children of the Mind' was so awful. A full review of 'Xenocide', though, isn't really necessary since both books are terrible and suffer from the same flaws.The big problem with this book is that Card violates the 'Show, Don't Tell' rule of writing. This book consists almost exclusively of long dialogue between characters and very long monologues and/or character ruminations. Even though a lot is happening in the book - colonies of buggers, pequeninos, and Lusitanians are moving off-world; the Starways Congress Fleet is traveling to Lusitania to destroy it; Peter and [the hyper-annoying] Wang-Mu are conducting Card's ridiculous idea of shuttle diplomacy - Card only ever has characters talk about it, rather than have the reader along for the ride. Card even takes the excitement out of space flight for Pete's sake.Then there is Card's half-baked morality/philosophy baked into the crust of this turd pie. For example, Peter's 'mission' is to sway political opinion against the fleet's use of the Molecular Disruptor (M.D., or the Little Doctor, first seen in 'Ender's Game'). They do this by going to exactly two planets - neo-Japan and, I'm not making this up, neo-Samoa! They have exactly two meetings (one on each planet) with two philosopher/academic types. These meetings consist of some pseudo-philosophical claptrap that is supposed to pass for weighty jousting of ideas of serious moment and then, presto! change-o! political opinion in the Congress of ONE HUNDRED WORLDS is changed and an order goes out telling the fleet not to use the Little Doctor!Then there is the pointless conflict and endless hand wringing over where Jane's soul (or aiua) will go. It's obvious that Jane will end up in the Young Val that returns from the initial faster-than-light space flight at the end of 'Xenocide'. But that doesn't stop Card from allowing his characters (such as they are) from arguing and bickering endlessly about it. As if that's not bad enough, the conflict is repeated (albeit on a blessedly smaller scale) with the question of where Ender's soul will go when he dies. (If you haven't figured out that it's Peter, hit yourself in the head with a hammer.)Which brings me to yet another annoying thing about this book - the endless bickering between the characters. It's not enough that the book is endless dialogue. It's a lot of endless bickering, sniping and malicious psychoanalysis between the characters. First of all, very, very few people (and when I say 'very, very few' I mean none) has the acumen that Card's characters have. No-one really knows what anyone else is really thinking or why they do what they do. This makes it all the more unforgivable for Card to saddle the book with loads of shrill attacks between Jane and Ender, Jane and Miro, Young Val and Miro, Peter and Wang-Mu, Ender and Novinha, Quara and everyone! It reminded me of why I stopped reading Card's Homecoming series, which suffered from the same shortcoming.Also, Card doesn't pass up the opportunity to re-hash all his earlier sermo - I mean, arguments from the previous three books about how it is wrong for one species - in this case, humans - to exterminate another - in this case, the buggers (notwithstanding the fact that the buggers were attacking humankind). Except that he doesn't even make an argument; it's simply an assertion. He doesn't explain why it was wrong of Ender to destroy the buggers' home world. He just declares that it is (and saddles poor Ender with the guilt). It was unconvincing the first several times Card made it and unnecessary in this volume.I think this book suffers from the Forced Franchise Syndrome. That's my own term for when a filmmaker, or in this case author, takes a perfectly good standalone property ('Ender's Game' in this case) and tries to string it out to create a series when it's not supported by the material. My two favorite examples of this are the Pirates of the Caribbean and the Matrix movies.I rarely give up on a book once I have started it. I thought long and hard about it with this one. In the end, the reason I didn't was because the book was relatively short and it only took me a little over three days to get through it."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Mr. Card had a great plot for the first book of this series. I really enjoyed that one. While Children of the Mind has some interesting ideas and insights, it is neither as powerful nor as captivating."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I first tried Ender's Game and liked it. I really got hooked with Speaker for the Dead. Xenocide presented some interesting philosophical issues.And then there's Children for the Mind.Children for the Mind is a direct sequel to Xenocide. Unfortunately, it takes some of the weaker parts of Xenocide and runs with them. This book focuses on the newly created Val and Peter Wiggin. Even in Xenocide, Ender's creation of his siblings out of thin air while traveling faster than light always seemed a bit farfetched. Card veers far away from anything resembling scientific plausibility.In resurrecting the pair, I think Card was trying to explore religious issues surrounding the soul, but his handling of the theme was unusually clumsy. The characters are actually described as reliant upon Ender's willpower, at risk of dying if he gets bored. Val and Peter think they're really just facets of Ender - except when they're not. I think some of the philosophical issues could have been better explored through the more conventional sci-fi technique of cloning.The dialogue and characterization in Children for the Mind are at times a chore to read, sometimes even atrocious. The way Wangmu and Peter impress to elderly philosophers with rhetorical nonsense made my eyes roll. These two kids go looking for \\"the center of power\\" in the human government. The new Val is even whinier than the original and much of what she says doesn't even make sense.I do like Card's characterization of the elder Ender. He comes across as a real person, perhaps a more sympathetic and believable character than Ender's ever been. His constant fatigue with life comes across powerfully. But he's an exception rather than the rule in this book. And the fact that most of his scenes are opposite his grating wife, Novinha, who has fled to a convent, doesn't help.Overall, 2.5 stars. Feel free to stop reading the series at Xenocide."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This was probably the most disappointing and tedious book I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was because I am a fan of the series and I have never put a book down halfway through. Card repeats himself to the point that it feels like he is beating you over the head with a hammer with his \\"philosophical\\" ramblings. I would estimate that 80% of this book is dialogue about characters' feelings that reads like one person's inner monologue. It is mind numbing and I seriously became agitated at points because I knew I should just cut my losses and quit reading. If you are a fan of the series and just have to know what happens next I would just do yourself a favor and read some cliff notes or read a summary on wikipedia. So little happens that it is unlikely you would miss much. You would at least save yourself the misery of reading this drivel."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The Lusitania Fleet will arrive soon, and when it launches the Little Doctor two species will die. Or so the leaders who ordered Lusitania's destruction believe; but Jane, the sentient entity living within the galaxy's great computer system, has been busy moving members of all three of Lusitania's resident species to other planets where they can establish colonies. For one of the Human scientists whose ancestors colonized Lusitania has found a way to neutralize the virus that every living thing on that planet carries - a virus that until this discovery made it impossibly dangerous for anyone from Lusitania to travel anywhere else, for certainty of spreading the dreadful infection.So whatever happens to Lusitania now, the \\"piggies\\" who are its natives and the alien \\"buggers\\" brought there by Ender Wiggin will survive on other planets. So will many of the Human colonists, but there are still plenty of people from all three species who cannot get away before the Fleet arrives. Jane's time to transfer starships instantaneously is running out even faster than is Lusitania's existence, because those controlling the galaxy's vast network of computers and world-linking ansibles think Jane is a computer virus. A particularly virulent one, that has to be eliminated by shutting the network down and then reconnecting it with powerful sniffer programs in place to prevent reinfection. They don't know that shutting down the network will, instead of killing a computer virus, kill a sentient being.The two beings created by the mind of Ender Wiggin during Jane's first attempt at transferring people and ships from place to place, young versions of Ender's now elderly sister Valentine his long dead brother Peter, are acting as additional bodies for Ender far more than as independent beings; and their continued existence places an intolerable drain on Ender himself, who is certainly no longer young. Disconnected from Jane by his own choice, Ender has followed his estranged wife Novinha into a Lusitania monastery. Soon he lies dying there. Meanwhile, Ender's stepson Miro and two of his stepdaughters - scientists all - work with young Val to try to find the world where Lusitania's strange virus originated; and Peter travels from one world to another in a quest to get the Lusitania Fleet stopped.Confused yet? Oddly enough, author Card manages to keep all of these plot threads in order and moving forward at a decent pace. He also manages to engage the reader's interest (well, mine, anyway!) in each character, and then maintains that interest throughout this final installment in Ender Wiggin's four-book story. You really do need to have read the other books first in order to appreciate this one. But if you have done that, it makes a satisfying conclusion; and Card's afterword is also intriguing.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Wonderfully wraps up the Ender stories. With the interesting twist on old characters brought into the new story, there are a lot of strange feelings. Card brings everything from each book together and fills all of the voids in this wonderful conclusion \\"Children of the Mind.\\""},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I'm lying, actually. I'm not planning on overviewing a darn thing. If you want the synopsis, look up underneath the title. I'm going to give you a frank opinion here, folks, so wander elsewhere if that's not what you want. So there. Pthbbb.If you've read the previous Ender books (which I'm assuming you have, otherwise why would you want to read this one? If such is the case, go read the first three, good golly, THEN read this one.), you're probably very attached to them and are yearning to read OSC's final entry. Perhaps you felt a bit cut-off at the end of Xenocide and lost sleep wondering what would happen to Ender and the rest. Cripes, I know I did. Children of the Mind does everything and more to make you feel better about yourself and the world around you, not even mentioning the emotions you will experience when you finish it. Finishing it is like being the guy on that milk commercial (y'know, the &quot;Where am I?&quot; one) and finding that the milk was actually there all along, only in the OTHER refrigerator across the room. By the end, you feel so connected to all of the characters and OSC himself. It's very sappy, actually, looking back on how -I- reacted, but geez, it's worth it. Never before have I read a book that touches me like this one did. I really can't stress that enough; it's absolutley fantastic. I'd use better adjectives if I could but, really, words can't express how deeply I dig this book.But then, I'm one of those crackpots who really start diggin' what they're reading on an unhealthy level. So sue me, I really like Orson Scott Card. (Wow, he's good. Isn't he, though? I mean, he's an incredible writer. My snaps to you, Mr. Card, for being just so dang awesome.) Maybe you're a crackpot who really likes him too, in which case you will most certainly not be disappointed with what my man Orson delivers to you in Children of the Mind. Read it, my friend. A better person will you be.Erin Tobey, Mikuyo@aol.co"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Card, in his third Ender book, Xenocide, left us hanging in the same place we started, with the threat of destruction approaching Lusitania. I, for one, wondered why I had bothered to read the volume.Fortunately for us, Card DID have a conclusion in mind.Children of the Mind includes not just an end -- a surprising, yet expected end -- to the story of Andrew Wiggin, but also a complete philosophical underpinning for Ender's universe.This book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This is not Card's best work, but it's one of the finestbooks that I've read in a very long time.

Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, can save the sentient races (humans, buggers and pequeninos ) but only for a while. Once enough of the net is closed down, Jane will not have access to sufficient processing power to move the ships.In the meantime, Ender is failing and his children must save Jane if they are to save themselves. Jane is losing her memories and concentration as the net is shut down. If Jane is to survive, she must find a way to transfer her ai&uacute;a (or soul) to a human body - and who better than Young Val or Peter? But which one, and what will be the consequences of the choice? And what about Ender himself?\`To light a candle of truth where there was no truth to be found. That was Ender's gift to us, to free us from the illusion that any one explanation will ever contain the final answer for all time, for all hearers.'I have very mixed feelings about this instalment of the Ender saga. I enjoyed the first three books more: the story moved at a different pace and the solutions posed to dilemmas were not always so neat. In this instalment, I found elements of the worlds created irritating, and the Jane that was saved was not the Jane I had come to admire over the course of the series. At the end of \`Xenocide' I cared enough about the characters and their worlds to keep reading in order to see how the various elements were resolved. For the sake of completeness, I'm glad I finished but it really didn't work for me. I am dissatisfied: by the neatness of the happy ending, and by elements of the transformation of Jane.\`And then it was over.'Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"These books just keep getting better.

For people who aren't much for science fiction novels, the Ender series is definitely worth a read. Children of the Mind deals with the speed of light, while not going overboard with boring details (sorry for the people who apparently DON'T think it's boring ^_^;;), and he kept us reading with the romances of Peter and Wang-mu (my favorite ^_^) and Miro and Val/Jane (i was extremely ANGRY when Jane overpowered Val-- I prefer Val over Jane and was disappointed that Mr Card thought different). Anywayz, the story is fun and should be read by fans. ^_^"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"A Review by ScottWang-Mu, an Oriental ex-servant, and Peter are charged with the task of convincing Starway Congress to pull back a fleet ordered to destroy Lusitania. They work their way up the chain of influence in order to convince the Congress to pull back the fleet. Miro and Valentine have the task of colonizing planets to save the humans, the Hive Queens, and the Pequeninos living on Lusitania before Jane, a being inside all computers, is destroyed losing the technology of instant space flight forever and the Destruction of Lusitania. On their quest to discover more planets, they learn their mission is entirely different. They find out they must stop a force that threatens all species in the known universe.I thought this book was very interesting. It is complicated which holds my attention. The book focuses on three different parties up until around the middle of the book when they begin to merge. I feel the characters don't have very distinct personalities. All the characters have the same trait of a very sophisticated, analytical mind. I feel it's a trait of the author that shows in the characters he writes about. Some examples are that Wang-Mu is always thinking of how society works and gives very thoughtful insights. Miro and his sisters also give very analytical thoughts on how different species of the universe could communicate. Ender gives thoughts on life and well-being. Even thought these are very distinct subjects, there's the feeling that one person is saying all those things and not different personalities."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind is the final book in the award winning science fiction series, the \\"Ender Quartet.\\" The plots of the previous books are very lengthy. In Children of the Mind, the main character, Ender Wiggin lives on a planet where there are two alien races living together with a small human colony. A devastating disease, which both alien species have adapted to, constantly puts the survival of the human colony in jeopardy. The government on far-away Earth sends a fleet of starships to destroy the planet, mainly because they fear that the virus will spread to the rest of the galaxy. The destruction of the planet where Ender lived, Lustinania, would result in the complete destruction of both alien races. This conflict, among others, add together to make a truly suspenseful book. In my opinion, this is a very well written book. It is not an easy book to read, but the plot and the characters are enjoyable. I would encourage 8th and 9th graders to read these books after having read the first three books of the series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Forgive me if it's illegal, but I am writing a review of CotM, and I have not, I confess, read it. I have, however, read the first two books of the same Ender series, and I would really like to say to those who have already posted their revealingly taste-lacking comments that you do not know good writing, masterful plotting, and genius in action when you see it. Orson Scott Card is one of the foremost science fiction writers of our time, and has something very important to show you--maybe relevant to your existence--which you could find if you only listened. Every element in his books--in any writer of that caliber's books, for that matter--is significant: you just aren't trying to see why. None of it, I repeat NONE of it is pointless, unsignificant, or boring. For those of you who actually enjoy great books, I STRONGLY recommend the Seafort Saga, otherwise known as the Hope series, by David Feintuch. His story is compared with the best of Card, C.J. Cherryah, C.S. Lewis, and Robert Heinlein. To those of you who don't recognize those names, they were and are the creators of sci-fi as we know it: the brains behind every trick, plot twist, and improbable circumstance thinkable. They wrote the book."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Hello I read this delightful book abot the fairies and the unicorns that take over the world by means of illegal weapons!!!!!!

The characters were stupid.The most frustrating part: they vacillate going back and forth from the descoladores planet AND NEVER GO THERE.Too saccharine an ending--just like Xenocide.In my estimation:-Ender's Game is a very good book and worth reading. It is also tightly written.-Speaker for the Dead is not great. The ending is not very powerful b/c I didn't find myself caring much for the Novinha character and what made her tick. It began a series of 3 books that were more about dialogue and pontification than action or intrigue. The introduction to the piggies was interesting at times.-Xenocide and Children of the Mind are bad. Xenocide I thought at times was more interesting than Speaker but again the ending was saccharine and it was too dialogue heavy.-By the time I got to Children, I was worn out.

These two books are quite ridicolous, Ender and Co. have long talks bickering with each other and talking about \\"philotes\\" and \\"Inside and Outide\\", which all make absolutely no sense at all, and how much they all hate each other and love each other. Theres a lot of complaining too. After a while, they just get really boring, you know? I think Card should have ended the books with Speaker for the Dead.

The series starts out with the fast-paced, action packed Ender's Game, then moves on to the relationship oriented Speaker for the Dead. The next book in the series is the preachy Xenocide and finally ends with the long winded, highly incredulous Children of the Mind. As a friend of mine said, Card milked it for all it's worth. In fact, the author created another series devoted to a character in a parallel timeline to Ender's Game.What did I not like about this book? The dialogue for the most part was horrible. At any point in the story a character is bound to be giving a monologue on something. Some characters speak and bicker like kids one moment and turn around and sound like psychologists with measured words the next. This is really a story about Jane. Ender's role as a provider, healer and source of strength ended with Speaker for the Dead. It's too bad the author decided to leave the second and third books incomplete. You really need to read this book to have closure on Ender's life.

There are good and bad readers and if you listen to a lot of audiobooks you know that sometimes the book can be good but the reader can be bad. I've read the entire series and just recently wanted to hear them again but because of the massive amounts of commuting I do I decided to try the audiobooks.Most of the readers in this book are good. Their voices help the story and keep you interested while driving in your car... One of the readers for this series of books was annoying to listen to, the reader who read the part of the character Si Wang Mu. When she reads the part of Wang Mu, she pronounces words as if English was a second language to her (ESL). Which to give credit, does make sense to the story since that character lived her life as a servant and did not get a proper education until later. Now I know that the reader didn't normally talk as if English was her second language because when she was reading conversations between Wang Mu and other characters, she pronounced things in an ESL manner, but read the responses from other characters normally and clearly. Therefore I know they made a conscious choice to do this, and I don't think it was a good one. It's not that I could not understand the reader either, I just did not like the attempt to sound uneducated. I did not mind the performance of the reader who read Miro's parts, even when they read the parts when he was talking with brain damage and he spoke slower.At first it was just annoying, but after a while it gets more and more intolerable to listen to since you know that the reader does not have to read the way that she does.Both Xenocide and Children of the Mind have this reader and it made me enjoy these books less than I did the first time when I read them.Ender's Game -- 5 starsSpeaker for the Dead -- 4.5 starsXenocide -- 2 starsChildren of the Mind -- 2 starsEnder's Shadow -- 5 starsI have not listened to any of the other audiobooks in this series yet, so I cannot rate them at this point.THESE REVIEWS ARE NOT ON THE STORY ITSELF, BUT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AUDIOBOOK!!

This series is also paralleled by another fantastic series both written by Orson Scott Card.

It shows us how mean the human race can be when the alien species reflects thier behavior back at them. Children of the mind a very good book to end the ender series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"My time would have been much better spent re-reading the first three wonderful books in this series than trudging through this corny, tedious anticlimax."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"As often found with writers of a highly succesful book: the subject is streched beont it's limits. The story drags on for pages without anything happening and wasting paper on surrogate deep thoughts. To quote Salerie from the movie &quot;Mozart&quot; this book just has &quot;to many notes&quot;, being to many words. It could have been a short story for a magazine, not a full volume in what could better have been a trilogy or a single book for that matter."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind read similarly to the stories I wrote in 2nd grade. Though more sophisticated, it had the same rambling tone, as if the author didn't quite know where to take it, and wrote the story while searching for a way out. In doing so, the story became too unbelievable, to be enjoyable. There were too many miracles, too many near deaths, too many almost destructions. Every time Card couldn't think of a way to get himself out of a tight situation, a new &quot;miracle of science&quot; was discovered, making the story a winding tale. The question is raised: Is it fair to give a lightsaber to a man facing lions?The ending left you hanging, but I, for one, have no desire to learn or read more. I have a feeling this was not meant as the end of a series, but the beginning of a new saga. A saga that may draw in others, but will continue to destroy the perfection of the original, Ender's Game"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Hello I read this delightful book abot the fairies and the unicorns that take over the world by means of illegal weapons!!!!!! THIS IS A GREAT NON- FICTION BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I think, personally, people are being a little biased against this book.The books Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind are basically seperate from Ender's Game. It's a different story, more or less, with Ender as the main character.The major difference between these two \\"series\\" is that Ender's game is more brash and fast paced. The next three are more scientific, moral, and focus more on what the right thing is to do.But more about this specific book:While many readers are mad that Ender does die a while before the book ends, the title, \\"Children of the Mind\\" implies his \\"children\\" will fufill his quest; also , read the back of the book; he is not meant to be the main focus in this book.The reason I don't think people really understand this book (Although they are entitled to their own opinions) is that you have to be really paying attention to it to understand it. At the beginning of Xenocide, they started talking about \\"philoites\\" and souls, and what keeps bodies and people who know eachother \\"twined together\\" so to speak. It may seem weird at first, but once you read through the series, this book works.Just to be clear, the book is NOT as straightforward as Ender's Game or Speaker for the Dead, but if you are willing to devote your undivided attention to Xenocide and Speaker for the Dead they are great reads.Quite frankly, I don't think some people are smart enoguh to really understand Xenocide and Children of the Mind, but I can see how some people don't like the book. I respect their opinions. Although I hope you read this book regardless of whether you heard good reviews or bad reviews, because it is the conclusion to the series.All in all, the book finished all the questions we had from the previous books and made some new ones come up that do not tie in to the story directly. Is another book coming? I hope so.If you read the series up to Children of the Mind, don't stop there. It is a great read and a good conclusion. You'd be missing out if you didn't. It might turn out that you will hate it. But it's not a extremely long book anyway. I would dive right in."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"A+, It's a gotta have for the Sci-Fi Officianado.The \\"Ender Saga\\" opens your eyes to human frailties, romance and Adventure.

I really enjoyed all the finishing of the series. Jane was an enity that I enjoyed all along and even more so in this book.

Good job Card!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This concluding novel to the Ender's series is wonderful. It tells the story of Young Valentine and Peter's attempt to stop the destruction of Jane and the planet Luistania by the Starfleet.Take one last ride with Ender; It's a ride you will never forget."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This book is very gripping- I read it in one day- and is a very good conclusion to the Ender Quartet. It ties up all the loose ends and develops some of the characters more than had been done before. The characters are very real-seeming and memorable, and the book has great emotionall impact. If you liked the other books in the Ender Quartet, then I greatly reccoment this to you."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Before I started reading &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, I would almost never read. I read boring books when I did read, often classics like Charles Dickens that made me incredibly bored. I was in the middle of &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; but I had left it in the school building, so I started reading &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, a book that had been gathering dust on my bookshelf for almost a year. I was hooked. I abandoned the Caine and read the book with god speed. I am now an avid reader and I read Orson Scott Card frequently. You would like Orson Scott Card just as much. I know.Orson Scott Card's book &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; is a masterpeice. When I finished this book, I was very disapointed. I was done with the Ender Series and I didn't have another one of Orson Scott Card's books to read. I loved the book so much, I immediately went to the library and got Lovelock, another one of his books.His ideas that he put in this book, like the computer lifeform Jane, or Peter and Valentine, is unparalleled by any other book by another author. I would highly suggest reading this book and the rest of the Ender saga, including Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide. I loved all of the books of his that I have read, and it is my belief that anyone who reads this book, will instantly be a follower of Cardography.This book is worth every cent of the price and more.If you saw the movie that came out a little while ago called &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; you would remember the mustard company. they said that if the target consumer would try Gildstiens mustard, they would buy more, because it was good mustard but not many people knew about them. It is the same story with Orson Scott Card. His writing can top any of the writers that you know about.It is my belief that Orson Scott Card is the next George Orwell. He is an excellent author who works hard and deserves every penny of the money he earns"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Card's first Ender book was undoubtedly the best, but the last three make good additions. While the theories prompted by Card are interesting, the ending is more of a deux ex machina than a groundbreaking revelation. Overall, Card has a problem with being narcissist: constantly adding new spinnoffs when the series is DONE, and pro/epilogs that make me angry every time..."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This book is nothing like the rest of the entire series. It's more phenomenal. :) This is one book many people say they don't like, but frankly, it's one of my favorite. I read a LOT of books - all sorts of books, but I make time to read this one at least 2ce a year. Yep - it's that good."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"When I first saw this book in the stores, I was excited at the prospect of another &quot;Ender&quot; book to read. From the beginning of my science fiction interests, Card has always been my absolute favorite.When I started reading this, however, I found that Card had used the creation of &quot;Young Peter and Valentine&quot; to an end that most of us could not have imagined. At the end of Xenocide, I was left almost flailing at the sudden ending. It seemed like it was unnecessary and a bog to the story. It turned out that Card had something in mind for the two &quot;Children&quot; of Ender's mind. This fourth book focuses on the entire group, all of which are controlled by Ender's aura. This leads to some interesting plot developments.Needless to say, Card's conclusion to the Ender saga is really not a conclusion in the true sense of the word. Most would expect that all questions would be tied up and finally there would be no loose ends when you turn the last page. But instead, we get just that - loose ends. This series could go on and focus on Ender's family or even Peter and Valentine for that mattter. But instead, it is truly where the series was meant to end - at the death of Ender Wiggin (sorry for the spoiler). Card's story is not an ending, however. It is more like a transition. No longer would Ender Wiggin as the readers know him be able to influence the characters of the series.All in all, this was an excellent book, probably as good if not better than the original &quot;Ender's Game&quot;. The reader is forced to connect things that are happening in this book to the rest of the series. Overall, it is a good read and is recommended to both Card fans and Science Fiction fans in general.Brian Shapella - shapellb@lafayette.edu"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--\\"Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?\\", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.EDIT: From now on I am never giving a book that I halfway like two stars again because each time, I receive the urge to change my rating to three stars. Just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Orson Scott Card went too far with this one. I felt he was pulling at strings to tie all of his books and the universe together in a cohesive work. He spun a web and got caught in it.Ok, no more metaphors. This book is the conclusion of Ender Wiggin, with his final acts and battles. This book gathers many of the characters from his previous books, and attempts to solve all of the universes problems through the acts of a few incredibly bright, isolated, tortured, souls. With a convenient, all knowing, almost all powerful being to help out, it's no surprise that our protagonists succeed in their tasks. It's a must read if you're a fan of Card, but far below the quality of the previous books in the series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Give me a break! This hunk of junk doesn't deserve to be sequel to a book as good as Ender's Game! It's terrible! The plot was just plain weird, and the author rambles on and on and on and on and on and on about every little topic until you'd rather just read a summary and throw the book in the trash. They totally killed the character of Ender in here, and...well, you get my drift. A word of advice-if you liked the original, this probably isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Will you people *PLEASE* stop casually inserting spoilers in your description of the book with no preface, no warning?I really despise having major plot elements thrown on me before I've had a chance to enjoy it with no warning.Show a little respect and a bit of forethought."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"everybody is a mind reader in this book, everybody knows exacly what everyone else is thinking, why they are thinking it, and whay they think they think it ... not so good...."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Ender Wiggin continues to redeem his life following the genocide he once caused. Ender resides on the planet Lusitania, home to the indigenous Pequeninos, a human settlement, and the Hive Queen he saved.Ender soon finds life is a circle as the weapon that he used thousands of years ago has come to destroy his adopted home. The Starways Congress has sent a fleet to destroy the planet out of fear of a virus traced back to Lusitania. They also want to kill Ender's friend, Jane the computer for they are afraid of her ability to control communications. Jane tries to save the sentient races of Lusitania before the Congress shuts down her intergalactic Net. Meanwhile Ender makes a last stand by creating replicas of his brother Peter and his sister Valentine.The conclusion of the Ender's series is a strong entry that readers will appreciate if they have read the previous novels. The tale provides the Orson Scott Card's powerful philosophy of involvement inside a strong redemption story line. However, many threads tied up in this novel will mean nothing to new readers, as this book is not a stand-alone. Still CHILDREN OF THE MIND is a fine finale (with new dangling threads) to a wonderful series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I have been re-reading the Ender saga mostly because the 'Shadow' books encouraged me to remind myself of how good the original series seemed to be. For the most part, Mr. Card does a fabulous job when he creates a new universe, but it seems he tends to take things a little too far at times. Now, this is a good book, and it does saty in line with the rest of the series, but it becomes more of a twist on the emotional flow, rather than a straight-up and objective view of the human condition. The author does throw in some new facets to his universe, including a non-reality component that can create people. However, this just adds to the confusion about why people are doing what they do.If this is unclear, it is because the book gets a little cloudy in the second half. It is similar to the issues that I find in both the Alvin series and the Homecoming saga. It seems that a good idea was stretched out a little too far.But, Mr. Card is still one of my favorite authors, and I will continue to read whatever he publishes."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The author reaches a little too far in this sequel to Enders series and also changes pace and type of book from others in series. This demonstrates the remarkable skill and expertise of the author with ability to write several different styles of story. But it can be confusing and perhaps disappointing for those looking for more of the same in the series. This book is Ok, but it is almost a different genre than others in Ender series and not as much fun for those who are fans. As a standalone book it is just \\"OK\\" although it creates some images that may leave you pondering after you finish the book, the \\"fun\\" level is lower."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Disappointing book, silly finale, characters that all the same and have no distinguishing personalities whatsoever. I don't know why I keep reading Card's book, but at least I'm finally done with this ridiculous series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This was less sci-fi, and more a fantasy experiment in metaphysics. FTL via metaphysical transport; soul-splitting; computers becoming human. There's probably room for a sequel, but the author moved on years ago, and he wrote this a few years after the previous installment."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I'm not going to apologize for liking a flawed series that is this good. Ender's Game is indisputably the King piece of the series, with Speaker for the Dead an excellent followup. Xenocide and Children of the Mind should have been one book, but that is only one of the couldas, shoulda, wouldas, about these two books. I don't care. There are a lot of cool speculative fiction ideas and a lot of grown-up philosophy ideas in all the books that are brain tickling, if not exploding occasionally. It's also more soap opera than space opera, so sue me if I happen to like it for all the Emo. It's a nice mix of types of science fiction, and maybe that's why people get a bit huggy and huffy all over the map on this one. Hard science types might hate the Emo, fantasy science fiction types might hate it because of the very light touch of fantasy, space opera types might hate the philosophy, and Dune lovers might dislike it for the lack of density, and it doesn't fit in the new sub genres like detective noir crossovers at all. Everyone suffers in a young adult emotional way in this series. Truly evil-loving characters don't exist in this universe. This is a series that is charming, fun, exciting and interesting in the whole, not in the parts. As a non-Christian-but-raised-as-a-Protestant, it was fun picking out all of the religious metaphors and Biblical references. Children of the Mind obviously picked up the Trinity that is God metaphor. I didn't mind it, it was amusing. I'll gladly read more by this author despite any writing quality issues since the entertainment value is high and the intellectual stimulation is mind-boggling always. There is a reason this author is on ALL the To-Read Recommendation lists, love him or hate him."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind picks up where Xenocide concludes. The author has stated that the two novels were initially thought of as a single volume, but that it grew too large and was split to allow both stories their full potential. I think that it might have been better to have kept these in a single volume and attempted to streamline the stories.As is, Children of the Mind seems to jump around a lot. We follow many sets of characters on their various goals, such as Peter and Wang-mu's struggle to convince the philosophers of two worlds, who inadvertently sway the starfleet congress, that destroying the world of Lusitania would be wrong, or Miro and New-Val's struggle to find new worlds for the various races to inhabit and then to find the ultimate threat who initially unleashed the virus. We also follow Jane and Ender, although separately as they leave their current existences behind and move on to the next phases of their respective lives.Somewhere in the various story-lines something was missing. The book flowed relatively well, but at the same time seemed a little disappointing. I think that it was perhaps the direction that the story took in Xenocide that set this volume up for failure. We did not have the action sequences or need for raw action present in Ender's Game, nor did we have the introduction and inspection of the new species as well as the well grounded moral dilemmas that accompanied them in Speaker for the Dead. Instead, the last two books seemed to be moving ahead not of their own volition, but instead almost just as a force set in motion by the previous novels. From what I have heard, the Shadow Series is better than these last two... Here's hoping that that is true, as the first two novels were very good.."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I found Children of the mind to be long on dialog (much of it redundant) and short on story. I would have preferred to see the last 10% of Children of the mind appended on to Xenocide and a new book four detailing experiences with the new alien species.But this is not the point of my review, I wanted to let others like me to know not to give up. I was ready to forgo reading any of the Shadow books. Fortunately I had already bought Enders Shadow for my Kindle and was obligated to read it (after all I already paid for it!). And I am glad I did, it was a much better read and almost as good as Enders Game!Moral of the story... Dont give up!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This is really a tremendous book. Though it can be seen as simply a continuation of Xenocide, picking up right where that novel let off, the tone is actually quite different. It's as deep philosophically, but it's punchier at the same time - I found myself reading this much faster than the preceding novel. Additionally, I found the conclusion very satisfying, especially since Card took this story to the very limits of credibility. The very delicately balanced plot could easily have fallen apart, but Card does keep it together long enough to bring everything home, resolving each of the characters' plot lines.As the back of the book says, this story concerns itself with the ethical evolution of humanity. That's a hefty challenge to take on, but Card does a commendable job not only to bring up some fascinating and difficult questions but to try answering them as well. I do think Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are better novels overall, but Xenocide and Children of the Mind come very close to that level and are worthy components of the Ender Quartet. This is top-notch science fiction, tackling questions and issues in a futuristic universe, exploring what it means to be human, or not human, and doing it with great emotional involvement. I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This Book is insightful as well as entertaining and takes the reader on an adventure into the possibilities of other worlds and creation. It engages the reader such that one feel invested and involved in the destination of 'good' ultimately triumphing.I loved it, as did my children."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"There were times, reading the first three books in the Ender series, where I wanted to skip page after page of Battle School talk. Sure, I like strategy and I like the occasional shoot-em-up, but what attracted me to Card's series was the undertones - the explorations of humanity. Ender embodied both the perfect weapon - able to destroy an entire species without a second thought. But Ender also embodied immense compassion. This book really highlights the significance of who Ender is outside of the Battle School.Maybe Card could have combined Xenocide (the last of the first three books) with Children of the Mind - but I really didn't mind the extra reading - and I suspect his publishers also didn't mind the additional sales!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Reading through other peoples views of this book and seeing how so many people say that this is the end of a wonderful saga, I remember reading the final pages and hoping there is a next book out sharing the discoveries of the descolada virus and its actual origins. I dont feel this was an ending for me but the beginning of a new discovery with Card and hope he publishes a further book in this saga. Ender's series has captivated me from the beginning and I now look forward to reading many other books by Orson Scott Card. He is truely an outstanding author."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Although it was not a GREAT read, it was a GOOD read. I tire of all the reviews complaining of Ender's death, and the &quot;lack&quot; of hard science (namely the &quot;auia's) in this book. This is science-fiction folks. Stop complaining about what can be, and starting opening your mind to what could be. Although the ending was a bit blunt, and abrubt, I think the book is a good ending to a fabulous series. Keep up the good work Orson."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"CotM is a great book, and an excellent read, it exceeds Ender's game and even Speaker. I found that the complaints of rambling are justified, but if you don't understand the rambling you may be unworthy. Ender's meaningless death has all the more meaning because it is meaningless. Still, if you want something more shallow and obvious, read Ender's game. If you've only a little bit of compassion, then read Speaker. And if you enjoy CotM, maybe you're no varelse after all."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind is the conclusion of the Ender's Game series; it fulfils this function beautifully and naturally. This is a definite contrast to the shoot-em-up atmosphere of Ender's Game - this is a very thoughtful story, and while the plot is exciting, the most meaningful part of the book is contained in the maturing of all characters involved. Be warned: if you are only interested in science fiction because it redefines the limits of sex and violence, this is definitely not the book for you. CotM stimulates the reader's imagination; it satisfies all major plot points, but it certainly doesn't tie off all the loose ends. This is an excellent book, but don't expect to be spoon-fed."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Orson Scott Card, my hat goes off to you. I truely lost myself in the series and compleated it in about a day. I'm only 16 but this book, it just hit me in the heart you know? I remember, I began reading the saga at about 9:30 pm or so....stayed up all night (On a school night!) and was done at about 4 in the morning...my mother came to my room and I was crying...it was awesome...Card has a strange power to make ethical dilemas seem like serious action..and you become so caught up in the book that you have to love it. Ender can rest in peace..his end was truely moving. Card is well on his way to being on the level of the late Isaac Asimov. On a final note: The end is'nt exactly an end, its more of a new begining. -Miguel Pimentel"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Orson Scott Card has made us feel for the life of Ender Wiggin, the poor boy mentally tortured by his Xenocide. Now he deals with the end of Ender's lifestory with tragic numbness. It's worth reading if you want the rest of the story, but it can in no way function as a stand-alone novel."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"So Ender saga came to an end. Mr Card, as its character Novinha, let him go peacefully, allowing him disintegrate because his life was no longer worth to live. Not a bad conclusion to a fascinating saga that was worth reading. We all know that finishing a book is much more difficult than beginning one, and that a saga it is no more than a way of delaying the final solution to a good story. Fortunately, Ender's universe is not ending with him. Mr Card has sown enough seeds for the story to continue, although next book if there is any (I deeply hope so) will not be a fifth book in a series but the first one of something new but familiar. And now a few bits of criticism. I prepared myself to enjoy this long delayed fourth instalment re-reading the third one, and to my surprise and if my Spanish translated copy did not fool me, I discovered than their merging was not as seamless as I expected. The I-do-not-know-who-I-am Peter of the fourth book has nothing to do with the arrogant, self confident character of the third one. We left Novinha inviting a reluctant Ender to join her in the Filhos do Mente, but find the opposite situation in the new book. Trips to the Outside seemed to need Ender or one of its replicas physically onboard, but Lusitania evacuation proceeds along the fourth book without this requisite. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this one as the previous ones for storytelling is the art Mr Card masters. I give a high qualification to the hours spent with one of Mr Card's books in my hands. Finally, I consider the afterword expendable and it makes me worry about the fact that Mr Card is somehow regretting writing fiction books."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This is the first book that I truly lost myself in. I have to say that I could relate with the characters in this novel. By using non-human characters, Card is able to show all of the aspects of humanity, both good and bad. A must read for anyone interested in human psychology in action."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Card's preaching in his most recent works (see Pastwatch) has precluded character development. Ender Wiggins becomes a one-dimensional character even if you include the &quot;personalities&quot; of young Val and Peter. The rest of the characters fare even worse. The plot progresses at a glacial pace until the last few pages and the resolution is only sleight of hand.After the disappointment of Xenocide, I hoped for a return to the vitality of Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. What we got was more &quot;magic&quot; solutions to problems faced by whining, self-absorbed characters. (Yes, I'm aware that technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced, but there were too many rabbits pulled from the same hat to generate a coherent, much less enjoyable, story.) Even though I am a fan of Card's work, I can't recommend this book to anyone other than an unrepentent SciFi diehard (or similarly afflicted ramen)"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the mind , although trying to close tomany of the marvelous dilemas concerning the deep and thoughtful character Andrew Wiggin , is a veryintresting thoughs-trigger and a very good end fora saga which I concern to be one of the best Sci-fi books ever."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"As a reader, I didn't find Ender's Game to be particularly great or noteworthy when I first read it. The plot just seemed like your standard &quot;Ohhh, Big Bad Alien Insects invade and good ol' humans have to defend themselves&quot; kind of theme. Card's characterization of Ender Wiggin, however, was truly extraordinary in both his depth and pyschological accuracy. Through the eyes of a scared, yet iron-willed 5 yr. old Card creates the essence of what humanity was feeling after the first two Bugger invasions: we fear you, and it is our fear that drives our will to survive, even if the price is Xenocide.Ender's Game establishes the platform for the lead-in with Speaker for the Dead where Ender attempts to speak not only for those who call upon him, but partly for himself, the self that has tried to atone for humanity's, his sins. He never finds the peace he seeks among the stars until he travels to Luistania and becomes the father of another man's broken family. His role as adoptive father allows him to finally heal his own childhood scars and at last provide him some semblance of peace.In Children of the Mind Card may attempt too much in such a short book, but he does attempt, and in that effort I praise him for what he does succeed in doing. A little bit overpreachy towards the end, but nevertheless, Card brings up important questions as to how and why we are the way we are. In Children of the Mind he gives an overview of where humanity started from in Ender's Game, glimpes of how humans reflected upon themselves in Speaker for the Dead, an examination of human/alien interactions in Xenocide, and a glimpse of where we might go in his final endeavor. The answers Card provides aren't perfect, they are sentimental, judgmental, culturally stereotypical in many instances, and unaswerable in many others. Still, there are many, many undeniable truths in this small novel that stabs at us to answer them for ourselves if we are to understand who we are as a race, and more importantly, who we are."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind is the fourth book in Orson Scott Card's Ender Wiggin books (Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide). The book concentrates on exploring the origins of the descolata virus, and on finding a way to save Jane's life.It's an interesting book, but it is merely building on the story that came before. There is very little here that is new and interesting. Most of these issues were resolved in Xenocide, and most of the story feels drawn out. It's the weakest of the four books.With all that said, it's still a fun read. The characters we've come to know so well are present and accounted for, and we get a better grasp on exactly who Jane is. And the typical Card empathy is obvioulsy present. Also, there is an interesting possible hint of a future storyline, though I'm not sure if Card is considering this or not. He seems to be focused on his Alvin Maker series (the fourth book of it, Journeyman Alvin, was released last winter).-Lewis Butlerwww.nyx.net/~kreme"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Everyone is saying this is the worst book of the Enders Saga, while I have always thought it the best. I guess everyone just reads it, but doesn't actually LIVE it. Whenever I read a science fiction, I think about it all the time, dream it, write it.When I read Children of the Mind, I thought, Wow, finally a book that contains science fiction, drama, romance, and just a bit of angst. Not a lot of sci-fi out there that captures your mind like this one. The deatail is amazing, and, for once, Card begins to focus on a many different characters, other than just Ender. Everything about this book was a stroke of pure genious.I believe most people don't like this book because the deatails are just to deep for them. It has more scientific and historical deatails that not everyone is willing to study if they do not understand them. I didn't understand, so I looked for information, read the book over, and there was the understanding! To truely love a book, you must understand it from all angles, not just one."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This series has &quot;grown up&quot; as I have. I read Ender's Game for its space opera value, and enjoyed Speaker for the Dead for its dialogic nature (religion, science, and reality). Xenocide left me hanging, but I had grown into its &quot;philosophical&quot; nature, and Children of the Mind was just the ending this series needed. It brings the Ender saga to its perfect resolution, offering some of everything we have come to expect from Ender, yet a thoroughly unexpected ending. This book was a wonderful read, and I recommend it to anyone who loved Ender the Warrior (Ender's Game), Ender the Speaker (Speaker for the Dead), or Ender the Philosopher (Xenocide), Card brings all of that together in this climactic volume."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Before reading this, I already knew what to expect having already ingested the previous three books in this series - Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide, so I'm not sure what exactly about this book was a disappointment. Card finally gives us a kind of end to Ender's 3000 year life and many plot points that arguably should have already taken place in Xenocide. Unlike the ending to the Harry Potter series, we are not left feeling a sense of sadness and loss at losing a character we have already followed for a thousand pages. Instead, we get another failed attempt at a philosophical science fiction novel. The dialogue is almost endless, one of my major criticisms of the last two books, but here, the religious and spiritual debates reach a crescendo, for me, it was almost too much and almost forced me to stop reading the book. But alas, having loved Ender's story, maybe only in the beginning to be honest with you, I had to see how everything played out.I cannot decide whether Card's note at the end of the book, where he tries explain what it is he was and is trying to do and where he discusses the work of Oe and Endo (both authors I adore), was a good idea or a bad one. For those having read the previous two volumes and presumably this one since you see the note at the end, you already figured that he had an intense interest both in Asian culture and writing and in creating some kind of moral pedagogy in his work. Unfortunately, his finished project does not stand up as well to other writers who have successfully done it--Endo, Oe, C.S. Lewis to name a few--because the philosophy and religion and other spiritual aspects of the novel are so in-your-face and all-consuming that the plot and the storylines disappear.Anyways, at least I can say that I'm done with this book series...Interesting Quotes:\\"Life is a suicide mission.\\"\\"Do the dead tips of fingernails feel bad when you pare them away?\\"\\"It's all fictions anyway. We do what we do and then we make up reasons for it afterward, but they're never the true reasons, the truth is always just out of reach.\\""},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"There is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much dialogue - both inner and outer - in this book. A planet with its inhabitants is about to be destroyed and we are misguidedly treated to endless useless and boring details about the love lives and inner demons of many characters. And pointless verbal sparring and pedantry.The stuff about the aiuas was interesting at first, but it doesn't seem to make any sense. Why can't young Valentine hold herself together? She has her own self inhabiting her body, no matter the forced ruminations about the topic. This should have been an obvious flaw from the outset. And that Jane cannot seem to find better solutions to being shut down by Congress is hard to believe."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This book had sadly little new... It just seems to be a rehash of Xenocide, and a drawn out one at that. I loved Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, but since then he's gone downhill with this series. As well, a significant portion of this book could have been left out, with little or no damage to the plot. Perhaps Card's status has resulted in editors being unwilling to alter his manuscripts... He should've spent his time making the Ender's Game script (yes yes yes!)."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"The Ender series is one of my favorite sf series, and Children of the Mind is a very satisfying conclusion to this epic. Like its sister books, Children of the Mind not only presents the external conflict of the plot, but the deep, emotional conflict of the characters. Because of this, Children of the Mind is very unique, and worth reading."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Orson Scott Card once again takes us into the minds and hearts of the characters he creates. Through his poetic language and fluid prose, we are guided by his plot's clarity. Card is a suberb author whose ability to clearly reveal philosophical aspects of the nature of mankind and of the universe deepens everyone's understanding of life. If one person could define the meaning of life, it would be Card. Finding the characters on a new discovery of themselves and their place in the world, we are captivated immediately by the inherent genius of his books. Although we are left wanting more after reading his novels, they leave us with a sense of surreal comprehension."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Children of the Mind was an excellent and surprising conclusion to the entire Ender series, and I very much enjoyed reading it. However, I noted early on that anyone who had not read the three books preceeding it would not enjoy it at all, so please don't buy it without reading the rest of Card's Ender series. Once you've done that, you should definitely read it.The book gives little background to what happened before, and any inexperienced reader of the Ender series would be lost in the strangeness of the scenes without understanding their origin."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"How can you go from Ender's game to this?!? I almost tore my eyes out when reading it. If you like boring characters talking about the same things over and over and over and over and over... and over, be my guest. Young Val is specially boring and annoying. The only redeeming quality is that there in not as much crying and weeping as in the last two books.You could probably write a fifteen page summary and miss NOTHING!!!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"In Children of the Mind, Orson Scott Card wraps up the Ender's Gamer series. That's what this book is basically for. Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead can stand on their own but Xenocide (the third book) and Children are for those who enjoyed the first two books and want to see the story to the end. Not to be too harsh on the very readable book but little is new. The ending is satisfying but no more. I would recommend the book to those who love Card and want the complete Ender's Game story."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"...and the thread of the story seems to just run further away from the original concepts. Wasn't thrilled with the new ideas expressed in it and wouldn't recommend it as a good read."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"\\"She worked her toes into the sand, feeling the tiny delicious pain of the friction of tiny chips of silicon against the tender flesh between her toes. That's life. It hurts, it's dirty, and it feels very, very good.\\"\\"Children of the Mind\\", by Orson Scott Card, is a science-fiction novel that takes place in Lusitania during the year 5040.The planet Lusitania is home to three sentient species: the Pequeninos; a large colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender. But once again the human race has grown fearful; the Stairways Congress has gathered a fleet to destroy Lusitania. Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. The Stairways Congress is shutting down the Net, world by world. Soon Jane will not be able to move the ships. Ender's children must save her if they are to save themselves.The theme of this book is the life and death of civilization. \\"If the purpose of life was just to continue into the future, then none of it would have meaning, because it would be all anticipation and preparation. There's the happiness we've already had. The happiness of each moment. The end of our lives, even if there's no forward continuation, no progeny at all, the end of our lives doesn't erase the beginning.\\"The important charactors in this book are Peter and Wang Mu who grow closer together as the book progresses, Jane who takes control of a human body and experiences human feelings for the first time, Ender, who loses interest in himself and literally crumbles into dust and then re-appears in Peter's body, and Malu, who develops a crush on \\"Young Valentine\\" and then has to say that she is worthless so that she will give up her body so that Jane can live in the body.As for what I think of this book, I actually think this was the weakest in the series. I have read \\"Ender's Game\\", \\"Ender's Shadow\\", and \\"The Speaker of the Dead\\" and I think this is has the weakest plot. Probably more then half the book is drama rather then science fiction. An example of a spar conversation is \\"So that's power to you\\", said Quara. \\"A chance to push other people around and act like the queen\\". \\"You really can't do it can you?\\" said Jane. \\"Can't what?\\", said Quara. \\"Can't bow down and kiss your feet?\\" \\"Can't shut up to save you own life.\\" Pgs. 270-271. This goes on for about five pages.I recommend that everyone should read Ender's Game before reading this book.If you are a fan of the Ender's series, you have to read this book!"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"... I love whole \\"Ender's saga\\" books at all. This one it was for me really suprise. I got information that O.S.C. put his one copy to AOL and let the users comment it. And he finally change some parts(as he state at the end of the book). There are definetely some sci-fi aspects, but I think it is diametraly different than any previous books from this Ender's saga.The \\"eastern/asian\\" mentality, faith, illness, social behavior and so on really got me. OSC really did his work well. The quotations before every chapter, precise translation from Chinese/Japanesse/Korean languages. I really love it.Anyone who is familiar with mentail sickness will be suprised how preciselly OSC describes the conclusion and confusion from this type of sickness.I read this master piece two times and everytime I found something new. This is possible caused by my age, because it rapidly grows so me preferencies changes and that's why I love this book much more than on first read.All other books from Ender's saga are pretty similar as the 1st one(ender's game) so I wrote only this review, because the others does not need it at all."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"This book is undenaiably a good book. That being said, it was still a trementous disapointment. I have read and adored the other books in the series, and after finishing Xenocide I was expecting somthing just a wonderful. This book was not it. I feel that Card has beglected his characters and beautiful ethical dilemmias for a plot that, while interesting, was not spectacular. The book is frusterating to read, with favorite characters dissapearing, and with inconsistencies with the earlier books. I would recommend this book to anybody who has read the series simply because it resolves the earlier books, but I wouldn't really recommend it for its own sake."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"Having deeply enjoyed the Ender series, I approached this book with interest, especially given the cliffhanger ending of Xenocide.What a disappointment. This book should have been compressed with Xenocide into a single volume. The effort to stretch 100 pages of narrative to 350 pages of novel drains the spirit. It it frequenty talky, preachy and repititive and not in a good way. There are frequent conversations between characters that are almost jarring. I find myself asking, \\"Does anyone talk like that? Do people sit around and psychoanalyze each other?\\"There's also the problem where the fascination with eastern cultures that appeared in Xenocide (and was good in it) goes to an annoying extreme, with pretentious ruminations on Japanese and Samoan culture.The book isn't terrible. It has some good parts. There ARE some fascinating ideas, even if they are plowed over too often. The resolution of the various plot threads is enjoyable. And you should read it if you've gotten this far. But a huge amount of fat could have been trimmed away. Prepare to spend quite a while reading this one."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"I really loved the Ender series. I thought Speaker for the Dead was better than Ender's Game and Xenocide was building on that untill Ender's umm... children came into being. Then Xenocide got weird. This book doesn't end this series like it should have. It continues on similar to the last hundred or so pages of Xenocide, and can be compelling, but lacks the substance of Speaker. Speaker was a sci-fi book that actually had a human story, based on human problems, and was a masterpeice. Children of the mind just deviates from that as much as possible. None of the problems faced by Peter or Jane are realistic in any sense. However the book is still a fun read for people such as myself that really enjoyed the rest of the series. It just lacks substance."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"After a disappointing Xenocide, Card went a long way in CotM to resolve many of the reasons why I thought Xenocide was haphazardly thrown together. Though some of the plot lines get pretty fantastical, I felt very satisfied with how the whole thing was wound down at the end. This is one of my favorite sci-fi series."},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","review":"OSC wraps up the ending to this epic a little too neatly. Not to give anything away, but it was almost a Hollywood ending.

There was a horror fiction writer in the group, Talia, whose job was to write horror stories and read to the other Thrill Club members during their weekly mettings. Meetings were held in different members' houses every week.The meetings were always enjoyable until the stories that Talia wrote began to come true.

When I read the synphosis, I thought, 'wow, this one is going to be good' because I also like to write horror stories.

She is on her way back from a college semester abroad, and an unexpected flight delay is keeping her in Beijing for two days. She called me this morning, excited about all the sights she'd seen, but as much as anything else she's excited about having bought \\"tang-hulurs\\" from a street vendor (\\"Just like Little Pear!\\"). They're some sort of sweets on a stick, mentioned in the books-- a special treat enjoyed by the title character and his friends. I think it's pretty cool that among all the stories we read, that particular image from my daughter's childhood is not only still remembered, but remembered with such warm enthusiasm. In my opinion, that's as good as it gets!"},{"Title":"little pear","review":"Little Pear was always in mischief. He was also a kind boy.

Instead it provided (and continues to provide) a growth space for me to demand and receive greater knowledge from Tarot.Written with great respect for the reader, and Tarot itself, this book is a wonderful initiation, full of ideas and techniques.I particularly enjoy the summary of how psychologist Abraham Maslow's concepts about self-actualization relate to some of the Tarot cards.

It gives a card-by-card journey into the user's deeper self.As a reader for over 25 years and someone who has also studied archetypes and their influences on personal growth and development, I found the execises both simple and deeply revealing. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Tarot Celebrations: Honoring the Inne Voice","review":"This book emphasizes Jungian psychology when using the Tarot, but is not at all exclusively Jungian.

Welcome to Leo's is a tastefully crafted ensemble of amorous, sensual, and eloquent stories about love, surrender, trust, and understanding...all centrally located at the fictitious supper club, Leo's, in our Nation's Capital.This esoteric compilation fuses the writing talents of Rochelle Alers, Donna Hill, Brenda Jackson, &amp; Francis Ray, who each present a story that rapturously embraces a common theme...finding love at Leo's. Each author's unique ability to create longing, sexual tension, euphoria, and passion makes 'Welcome to Leo's' a delightful read. The effulgent love stories intertwined with the artistic capability of these authors to verbally pluck emotions and visually elicit stimulating images of ardor, makes this chronicle of tales extremely difficult to put down, but very easy to finish.My personal favorite was the short story \`Main Agenda', which extended the satisfaction of success in a women's life to include love instead of excluding it. Make sure you allot enough time to read this book from cover to cover, because after you start reading it, you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"These four authors have established themselves in the black romance genre and in romance period as excellent writers with a large following. In the tradition of Della's House of Style the protaganists meet and romance in a common place, Leo's. Leo's is a deluxe supper club in Washington D.C. that caters to the movers and shakers, buppies, and those in the know. In Main Agenda by Brenda Jackson, an attorney sees the woman at Leo's who rocked his word five years prior during spring break. He let her go before, but now he has a chance to rectify that. She, on the other hand knows he was the ONE but she is carrying baggage about relationships that will not allow her to put love in the equation that might jeopardize her career. In Rochelle Aler's Second Chance, an event planner sprains her foot, end ups in the emergency room, and gets treated by the head of the department. This widower lost her husband and son to an accident thirty years ago and closed her heart to romance. The doctor at fifty-five has never married or had a serious entanglement, that is until this lovely lady needs his professional care. In Eye of the Beholder by Donna Hill, a church going professor captures the attention of a player who represents entertainers at Leo's. He lies about his profession because he feels he wouldn't stand a chance with her. She is drawn to his caring manner. Can their love stand the truth? In Sweet Temptation by Francis Ray, a Texas Ranger is in D.C. teaching a class and gives a call to the owner of a candy/gift shop as a courtesy to his supervisor's wife. He figures he is not in her league, but when she sends him a gift basket he is intrigued. They meet at Leo's and sparks fly. These stories will make you want to hop a plan to D.C. and find out if there really is a Leo's."},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"I loved Rosies Curl n Weave &amp; Dellas House of StyleIn Welcome To Leo's the atmosphere is not a hair salon where love is sprung in each story. This time it all happens in this eloquent supper club owed by the Hardcastle men and a female cousin.In the first story Rochelle Alers's Second Chance no matter what the age or circumstance you can always find love again, even after losing your husband and 6 month old child.Donna Hill shows us in Eye of The Beholder that church going conservative dressers can also look good in a knee high a-line dress and find Mr. tall dark and handsome.Main Agenda by Brenda Jackson spins a tale of 3 beautiful successful sisters obsessed with the words their mother left, they each almost lose out on true love until.....the baby of the bunch shows them you can have it all.Francis Rays Sweet Temptation.All in all this was a wonderful refreshing book as always when you get this dynamic 4 together."},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"&quot;Welcome to Leo's&quot; is a clear-cut winner with 4 breathtaking stories from 4 of my favorite authors, Brenda Jackson, Francis Ray, Rochelle Alers and Donna Hill. Each story carries its own weight from start to finish and each left me with that special feeling that comes after reading a first-class novel. I honestly can't say which story I enjoyed more as they were all beautifully written. There are definite highs and lows in each story but finding that special someone has never been smooth sailing. As we all know, romance can certainly be found in a variety of places even when we're not looking for it. &quot;Leo's&quot; was the perfect setting for each of these 4 masterpieces. My advice to those of you who enjoy reading high-quality material, is to go out and purchase this novel as there is no doubt in my mind that once you start reading &quot;Leo's&quot;, you won't be able to put it down until you've reached it's conclusion. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!"},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"I love the concepts of Leo&#65533;s and wish it was real so I can visit, especially on Open Mike Night.Second Chance by Rochelle Alers***Cute story about a middle-aged couple finding love which makes it a unique, not enough chemistry though.Eye of the Beholder by Donna Hill****Great story about a religious young lady who goes from having a dull life to stepping up to the mic on Open Mike Night.Main Agenda by Brenda Jackson*****Excellent story. If the others seem to be dragging, skip to this story and then go back to them. Strong, intelligent woman determined to make her mark in the world without a man, how in the world does she deal with love, though? I brought this book because I was searching for more of Ms. Jackson&#65533;s work. I recently read &#65533;Delaney&#65533;s Desert Sheikh&#65533; which is a Silhouette Desire Romance Book not even 200 pages. Excellent love story, this author knows how to write them.Sweet Temptation by Francis Ray****Great story. Make you want to go find you a ranger. Career oriented couple who definitely do not want a long distance relationship. Love has a way of changing the way you look at things."},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"4 very talented writers have done it again. They have depicted romance in a whole new light.Rochelle Alers with \\"Second Chance\\" has captured a romantic story with a more mature couple. Leigh & Scott fall in love and they are over the age of 50. You know age is number & shouldn't prohibit us from giving or receiving love & Leigh & Scott show us that after your youth has escaped you and your careers are in full bloom, you still want the comforting arms of a special someone to hold you tightly. Very enjoyable.Donna Hill with \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" Jae and Clyde are dynamic and their story tells that you have to get to know a person from inside out, you can't allow stereotypes to persuade your opinion of someone. Jae a Christian woman with morals and minimal experience with men, and Clyde an upscale entertainment manager with access to whatever type of woman is reevaluating his life and chose in women. Now when the drama unfolds and this Choir Song Bird and Mr.Talent Seeker finally come together, it is pure sensual music to the ears and heart. Love conquers all.Brenda Jackson and \\"Main Agenda\\" Now its true, Brenda is a good friend of mines, so you would assume that I can't be judgemental, but you know what... Friendship and admiration have nothing to do with my review on this story. Brenda has done it again, she has brought together some females with issues and men who are irresistable and determined. Willow Anderson Daughters Falcoln,Robin,Raven are successful and determined along with beautiful, but they were groomed to be. They have no time for committed love. Interest in a man will destroy you. So stay focused on your dreams and leave love to the weak. Well that's until Franco Marcus Renoir, John Augustan, Lincoln Corbain step into the pathway of the Anderson sisters. Now this story definitely displays \\"Birds of a feather, flocking together!\\"Francis Ray with \\"Sweet Temptation\\" Now this story will have you craving expensive chocolates. Julia is the type of woman who works hard, wants the best and will achieve on her own. Chase can be found in the dictionary under MAN= Hardworking, stubborn, play no games, straight to the point. Now when these 2 stop playing phone tag and meet, it is a pure and delicious meeting. You never know where your heart will lead you. Against all odds, they overcome the obstacles of 2 people living in 2 different environments,with different social accolades, but with one realization, that you can conquer all in love. Julia proves that you can have the strawberries and the chocolate forever. Chase and Julia don't have to give up their independence to become a unit. They make falling inlove a very Sweet Temptation."},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"I knew Welcome to Leo's was going to be a great read because of the authors. St. Martin's chose four of the best authors. I love reading all of these ladies books and don't have to read the back or know what to story is about to buy their work. They have all proven themselves to be wonderful writers with their own unique writting styles.Second Chance by Rochelle Alers was a heart-warming story of a woman given a second chance at love with a sexy doctor named Scott Alexander. Leigh meets Scott when she twists her ankle crossing a busy DC street. Even though they are older, I could see the attraction between them. Scott who has never been married or in love for that matter was really taken with the beautiful Ms. Leigh Walcott. Leigh on the other hand was fighting her attraction to the handsome doctor.Jae Crawford could go against the best of them when it came to singing. She was a down home girl who didn't have any fun. Her girlfriend Tara invited her out to a supper club called Leo's for her birthday. Jae reluctantly accepted and their is where she met Clyde Burrell. Clyde was handsome and all of that, but Jae was really skeptical about talking to this strange hunk. Clyde who is actually the talent director for Leo's liked Jae from the start. Once he talked to her, he found her to be a wonderful and warm woman he wanted to get to know better. Their story was beautiful with the fairy tale ending.Raven Anderson and Lincoln Corbain in Main Agenda by Brenda Jackson had been lovers four years ago. When they saw each other again at Leo's, the fire was still there. Lincoln had wondered why he let the lovely Raven get away from him after their Rendevous on Spring Break four years ago. He promised himself that he wouldn't let her get away this time. Raven promised herself that she wouldn't allow a man to destract her from her life goals. Lincoln didn't make it easy on her. Unfortunately, her sisters had the same idea. Their goals were their main agenda.Sweet Temptation was a great story about a stern Texas Ranger and a Confectionery Shop owner. Chase Braxton has to teach a class at Howard University and was told by his superior wife to call a friend she knew there and she would bake him his favorite cookies. He reluctantly agreed, because he knew he loved sweets. He called the young lady, but theyn kept missing each other. Finally, the beautiful Julia Ferrington invited Chase to dinner at Leo's. Chase couldn't believe how beautiful Julia was. Julia knew she wanted Chase even if it was only for a couple of weeks. The passion between the two was definitely a Sweet Temptation.Each author did a wonderful job at making Leo's come to life. It is really too bad there isn't a Leo's around. Congratulations ladies.If you have never read any of these ladies work,and I must say all of their books are good, I would recommend the following to get you started:Rochelle Alers - Hideaway (series of Cole Family) Donna Hill - Private Affair, Pieces of Dreams Brenda Jackson - Tonight &amp; Forever (series of Madaris Family) Francis Ray - Forever Yours (series of Taggart Family)"},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"If you need a quick &quot;pick-me-up&quot; by reading a short romance story, WELCOME TO LEO'S is the book for you. There are four unique vignettes by four authors with different writing styles, instead of one complete novel. The reader may see himself or herself in one of these dramas. The stories involve those who thought they were too old, too religous, too career-oriented or just plain too busy. The protagonists struggle with overcoming their beliefs and giving in to true, deep feelings of love and passion. Though short, each story is discussed in detail. Each one uses the Leo's, a popular supper club in Wahsington, DC, as an exciting meeting place and a romantic backdrop. This is a romance reader's dream. I loved each writer's style."},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"I truly enjoyed this work of fiction by my favorite authors. I hate to tell what is in a book, but when you see these four authors and including Felicia Mason, pick up the book and run to the counter. Each story centralized around age, divorce, widow, lost love and true love. Each story was awesome and you wouldn't be upset at all that you decided to purchase it. Pick up this book and let the adventure begin. Read the other reviews and they will tell you a little more. I love to read and watch a good movie and I get highly upset when I am told about it before I got a chance to read or watch it."},{"Title":"Welcome to Leo's","review":"What can you expect when four of your favorite author come together in one book? Nothing but the best. Most people should be familar with St. Martins anthologies by now and know that you will get a great book. This time we are introduced to the Washington DC supper club Leo's.

On the first day of her vacation Leigh sprains her ankle and ends up in the emergency room where she meets Scott Alexander. Fifty-five year old Scott is on his way out to start his vacation when he sees Leigh painfully waiting for service. This story shows that love can be found at any age or stage of life.Eye of the Beholder by Donna Hill introduces Jae Crawford. Shy, religious Jae promises to let her friend take her to Leo's as a birthday present. Jae is uncomfortable going because of the things her preacher father has told her about places like Leo's. Jae is left alone while her friend is on the dance floor. Clyde Burrell who is over the entertainment at the club comes to talk to Jae. After a brief conversation with Jae, Clyde decides to lie about his job. He discovers that Jae has a beautiful voice and talks her into singing at open-mike night. They fall in love with each other but when Clyde's secret is revealed Jae has to decide if she should risk her values for love.This is Brenda's first story for St. Martins and I must say she fits right in. Not only because she is my favorite authot but her story was so good. In Main Agenda Raven Anderson is determined to be sucessful in her career before she falls in love. Her and her two sister made a pack to their mother that jobs will come before love. Raven's plans begins to crumble when her first and only love Lincoln Corbain comes back into her life. After spending a passion fiiled weekend in Daytona four years ago Lincoln is determined not let Raven go again.

This is a must read for anyone who loves love."},{"Title":"Stumptown Kid","review":"Stumptown Kid is a well written late elementary school age level book. It would be a beneficial book to read to a class at the beginning of a school year, because of the issues that are dealt with as part of the story line. Both issues of bullies and the judging of others by the color of their skin or by where they may live are part of the young boy's life in this story. This book could be used as a springboard to a valuable class discussion. The story is written around the theme of baseball, which adds to the intrigue of the book. There is also a strand of mystery that keeps readers captivated throughout the book."},{"Title":"Stumptown Kid","review":"Here's a great new book hot of the shelf by Carol Gorman. It's called Stumptown Kid. This book is about a kid growing up when segregation was in the U S A. It's also Realistic Fiction because it happened during a real time and real place but not real people or characters per say. Another book by Carol Gorman is Dork in Disguise.Carol Gorman also writes in a unique writing style known as first person and Realistic Fiction. The main characters in Stumptown Kid are Charlie Nebraska and Luther Peale. Personally my favorite character is Charlie because if he doesn't do what ever he is trying to do he'll try and try again until he gets it done. Charlie Nebraska is an eleven year old kid in Stump County, Illinois whose father died in South Korea. Charlie's mom takes care of him now. When Charlie goes to baseball try outs he meets a mysterious man named Luther Peal who has a dark past hidden beneath his smiling face. I would recommend this book to people who like to read books about baseball and growing up. I liked Stumptown Kid because it was a griping, exciting baseball filled thrill ride of the year."},{"Title":"Stumptown Kid","review":"My 10 year old son read this book and loved it! He only read it to get points for school, but became enthralled...so much in fact that he finished it in one weekend! He would excitedly tell me all about the story as he was reading it and couldn't wait to see what happened next. He is not much of a reader so for this to capture his attention and interest, it has to be a great book! Would recommend to any parent for their child."},{"Title":"Stumptown Kid","review":"STUMPTOWN KID is superb. The plotting, characterizations, and evocation of period are wonderful. I also think this story has the makings of a great family movie as it has the all-ages appeal of a true classic. I found it compelling, moving and thrilling."},{"Title":"untitled","review":"Reading clearly has talent, but it lies in the realm of the succenct haiku-like cryptogram. Many of these poems are first-draft indulgences, collected in a helter-skelter manner. This book would clearly not have been published in America, nor could it have gotten past many of the poetry manuscript contests here. Reading is best at keeping his mouth shut (&quot;Alert!&quot;, a poem several pages in length should have never been written, let alone published) and his thoughts mysterious. And if there is a failure here, it's in Reading's lack of an editor (an editor who is also a ruthless critic). Every writer needs one, Reading more than most."},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"Roos is part real estate investor, part cheerleader. If real estate investing were as simple as getting excited about real estate investing then we'd read this book, leave our 9-5s, and, ahhh, riches. Real Estate Riches inspires me to invest in real estate the way Bruce Lee inspired me as a kid to become a kung fu master. It's great to dream about, but the hard work between the dream and the reality is usually enough dissuade.His basic plan-of-action is 1) use as little of your money as possible and as much of the bank's money, to, 2) --he skips this part about how hard it is it find and identify a positive cash flow property, then, 3) buy a place that continues to increase in value, while it simultaneously delivers cash in your pocket each month, and finally, 4) when you need more money to invest, drain the equity from your property and repeat.I think the best advice he gives, and the one insight you might find to be part of the real work of real estate investing, is the 100:10:3:1 rule. Look at _100_ properties, make offers on 10, negotiate financing on 3, and you MAY buy 1. Real estate investing is hard work. Roos show you all of the glamour, but little of the daily grind that's involved to make it happen for yourself.For a more balanced approach see Real Estate Investing, 4th edition by McLean and Eldred."},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"There is nothing detailed or even intellectually satisfying in this book. But I think the one thing that it does do is, (as another reviewer put it,) is to cheerlead. This book was exciting as it was the first book that I had ready on the subject. But now that I have done numerous transactions in real estate and handled millions of dollars worth of real estate and having experienced the ups and downs, DON\\"T DO REAL ESTATE AFTER READING THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! This book is so simplistic one does not know where to begin. For instance, Mr. Dolf, doesn't delve into possible set-backs seriously enough. He assumes that as long as you buy in a densely populated area, it is a safe bet. And he gives an example of \\"California\\" as one such place. There are many contingencies too numerous to list that destroys such a simplistic theory. Markets do have their time and in real estate, if you are stuck in a loan and a property you can't move, you are illiquid and repositioning is not as easy as it might seem. Therefore, being incapable of averting financial ruin is mmore difficult.Real Estate is something that is experienced. You can't just \\"buy by the beach\\" and then just earn equity growth because no one is making beach front. And how many people have the kind of money that allows their first deal to be a fixer in Malibu. His other formula to look at a hundred-pick three-and buy one is really idiotic. There are no formulas in a mechanism that is continually shifting. The real estate industry is continually evolving. There is always an element of risk involved in any purchase. And buying single family homes is a mistake unless you are in a rapidly appreciating environment simply because there is less income potential to hold notes. And the more units, the better the rate (commercial properties). Also, the diversity of loan products just about allows anyone to buy their own home--no need to rent. None of this is even mentioned in these pages.Then why three stars? Because, fundamentally getting excited is half the battle. And this book WAS exciting. Its simplicity is actually very appealing. In essence, he is right about one thing: Real estate is about debt acquisition ultimately. The SELECTION of the type and structure of debt and the INSTRUMENT against which a deed of trust is written is all-important. But Dolf miserably fails on these issues.There is a tremendous lack of serious dialogue and this book is simply an attempt to sell less than a mediocre work to a less than average society. For God's sake--HE TELLS YOU ABOUT THIS ONE HOUSE SOMEWHERE AND HE PAINTED IT AND LIKE MADE $20,000!! WOWIE!! $20k! You can buy gas for six whole months. Truth is, REAL ESTATE IS MORE COMPLICATED than one would ever assume. If you want something simple....buy an Index fund.If you want to raise your I.Q. read another book. If you want to understand the simplest of simple items in real estate and get excited, read this book as a starter. But promise yourself you will wait before you jump into a ridiculous formula of see 100:make offers on three and buy one by the beach you cant afford!"},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"I have to admit that I am a fan of the Rich Dad series of books. I also have to admit that Dolf de Roos was not initially my favorite author in the advisor series. When I came across the first edition of this book, I thought it was slim and the weakest of the series.Then I bought Dolf de Roos Real Estate College Program at Costco which includes a audio version of this book. I was impressed both by Dolf de Roos knowledge and ability to explain complicated real estate terminology in easy layman terms. He made learning easy and fun.I went out and bought the revised version of this book and love it. Having the printed version makes looking up information easy. I play the cd's in my car to reinvorce the material.Also recommend The ABC's of Real Estate Investing by another Rich Dad advisor Ken McElroy and Nothing Down 2000's by Robert Allen."},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"This book has some very good points, but it's more motivational than anything else. The examples seem very extreme and are given without much detail. Most of the methods seem overly simplified and lack clarity, others are quite vague. This does not seem like a great book for learning about investing, but it does get you really excited about real estate! It makes for a great introduction into the field as it compels readers to learn more."},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"What appealed to me about this great book by Dolf de Roos is1) It was written by an actual real estate investor who waswriting from his own personal experiencesAND2) This book is different from the other real estate books whichall more or less same the same things.Dolf does a great job showing that that real estate is still the best investment, actually tens and hundreds of times better than any other investment including and especially the stock market.Dolf will show you how to find the deal of the decade every week!How to massively increase the value of your property without spending too much money.olf also explains how the government can subsidize your real investments and how to create passive income using your bankers money so that you only work if you want to.My main business is network marketing. I have found Dolf de Roos real estate advice not only providing me with an additional stream of passive income, but also taken a chunk out of my tax bill as well.If you looking for another \\"Nothing Down\\" or \\"Get Rich Quick\\" book on real estate, look elsewhere. This book can however show you how to get richer quicker with proven strategies.Great book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using your Bankers Money, by Rolf De RossDolf talks about how real estate blows the doors off other investment vehicles because of the leverage available. The book is a bit basic and conceptual, but for those investors either just getting started in real estate or thinking about it, this book will give you the push needed. It explains how the returns can be explosive on the capital invested because of the use of leverage. It's true, understanding how the implications of leverage affect total return is very important, however I would have likes more real life examples. In my book, A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate, I go over in detail deal after deal to illustrate this point.Another key concepts covered are: productivity, and how it is affecting middle America, oceanfront or seaside property, and how it appreciates 50% more than other areas and the time needed to look at 100 properties before finding a real deal. All these are must know for the real estate investors of tomorrow.This book as well as the others in the Rich Dad series are great starting points. I read all that were available while building my real estate company which went from $0 to $25,000,000 in holdings in less than 5 years.By Kevin Kingston, Author of, A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate"},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"The good thing about this author is he's very easy to listen to and he keeps your attention no problem.

You will learn many valuable lessons from this program including how to find good investments, how to put deals together, how to manage properties once you acquire them. It will expand your mind as to what is possible for you to achieve. It changed my thinking!! Also, more importantly,it changed my actions. No product is worth anything if not acted upon. Thank you very much!!!"},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"The main purpose of this book, as the author clearly states in the beginning of it, is not to tell you how to invest in real estate but more why you want to invest in real estate vs. the stock market and other investments. The author clearly knows what he's talking about, and his insights into the tax loopholes and financing options a real estate investor has are more than worth the price of the book. If you're a beginner, this is a great book to start out with. It's not going to tell you what to do, but it is going to tell you why you want to do it and give you some insight into the virtually unlimited leverage options a real estate investor enjoys as compared to a stock market investor who might as well take his/her money to Vegas.If there's any doubt in your mind that real estate is the way to go, read this. I'd even recommend it for experienced real estate investors, for the reason that even though you won't learn anything new on how to go about your business, you might learn a few things about creative financing and tax loopholes that you'll wish you had known all along. Buy this book, read it over a weekend, then lend it to friends. It's not the real estate bible of the universe, but it is definitely worth reading if for nothing more than the author's upbeat, positive outlook and enjoyable writing style.I especially like the author's anecdote about how he went through all those years of college to get a Ph. D. in engineering, then when he received his Ph. D. he was offered a job at $32,000 a year (this was the early 80's, I think, so that was a good starting salary for an engineer back then). But the week before he was offered the job, he had completed a real estate deal in which he made $35,000. So he turned down the job and to this very day has never had a job. Imagine that..... living your whole life without ever having to rent out your labor to the Man for a pittance and put up with the expectations of some moronic, terminally blue-collar boss. This guy has never had a job. He has always made his money--more than enough of it--working for himself rather than slaving away for fifty hours a week making someone else rich.I recommend this book. It's definitely worth reading. I'm glad I have it."},{"Title":"Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money","review":"THis book was hard to understand becuase it was written in the kings english.

Unless you are a professional portfoliomanager, real estate is still the best investment. There areimportant tax benefits/write-offs and it is one of the onlyinvestments where you can make money when you buy. For instance,suppose I purchase a home from a motivated seller at 60% ofits value. If I obtain a loan up to 80% value, the differencecan be instant cash pocketed from the deal. Properties that arebought and quickly resold can produce huge piles of cash with little work except for the effort in finding the deal andcultivating the buy and ultimate resale of the property.As an asset, real estate retains its value in contradistinctionto an auto which depreciates the minute you drive away fromthe showroom. In real estate, location is paramount becausethis attribute will cause the property to have a high buyerdemand and rental value. The author asks that we always buyfrom a motivated seller and do so with no money down. The no money down can be done in various ways. i.e. flipping a propertyor purchasing a distressed property and obtaining a loan forthe fair value of the propertyAs a general rule, the author asks us to purchase from amotivated seller in order to obtain the property for the leastcost. The book names several inexpensive ways to make a property more valuable i.e. building a carport.

Both Frank Asch and Vladimir Vagin play their parts distinctively. The story is filled with suspense, exciting action, and a thought-provoking reversal.

The words, found in text balloons, repeat the exclamation, \\"Here comes the cat!\\" Yet in every case, we find them in both English and Russian. Signs on stores, also in both languages, offer a wider variety of reading opportunities. The book introduces first-grade readers to the concept of translation.

Ware did a fine job in explaining what Open Theism is and why people are attracted to it. His critique of Open Theism was quite detailed and it shows that he knows his opponents well and is familiar with the materials.However, there are a few major shortcomings in his arguments:i) Ware's position would have a hard time dealing with the &quot;Problem of Evil&quot; due to its God-will-always-succeed approach. Ware admitted this in the book. He said he would deal with it in his forthcoming book but I doubt a satisfactory answer would be given. Let's wait and see.ii) Ware has to have faith in God's benevolence given his position and the problem of evil, while Boyd has to have faith in God's power to be in control even if he does not completely foreknow the future. I do not see any obvious advantage in adopting Ware's position.iii) Ware did not really address the problem of interpreting some passages in the Bible which portray a God who is vulnerable, say, for example, the book of Hosiah. Boyd's position would be simpler and more consistent than Ware's in explaining this. To me, a vulnerable and suffering God, who is not only loving but is also Love, is a more accurate portrayal than a sovereign king who controls everything.iv) Ware did not really solve the problem on prayer. Does prayer make any difference after all? How could God truly &quot;respond&quot; to my prayer if the future is already, so to speak, fixed? Again, I could not see any obvious advantage in adopting his position.I have to say some of Ware's arguments were well put and the overall presentation was clear. I enjoy reading the book. I was nearly convinced by him at some points (e.g. when he talked about Abraham's offer of Issac and God's knowledge about Abraham's thinking and intention). But when I come to think about the overall picture as presented in the Bible, I still tend to agree with Open Theism.I am glad that Ware pointed out some of the weaknesses in the Open Theist position, which made me reflect upon them seriously. The book serves two purposes:a) to reconfirm the belief of those agree with Classical Theism (with some good arguments); andb) to push Open Theists to think about their own position and try hard to rebut through sound exegesis.Personally, I think Ware's work is the best defense of Classical Theism against Open Theism so far. It is certainly better than Geisler's &quot;Creating God in the Image of Man&quot;, which did not present Open Theism's position fairly.I am now anxiously awaiting Boyd's reply. It will be an interesting debate."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Ware quibbles with Pinnock, Boyd, Sanderson, and Hasker throughout. Ware's world is the classical view of God, with exception of his introduction of \\"relational mutability\\" of God. Essentially he says that God has exhaustive foreknowledge with a new twist. Even though God acted, created, and planned instantly one time trillions of years ago (the Super Big Bang), that when time rolls around to events in our lives, God steps into it takes special notice and gets in the fray emotionally. This makes no sense. It would appear that a God that has exhaustive foreknowledge could have no future. He couldn't plan. There are no such concepts as \\"plan\\", \\"look ahead\\", \\"tomorrow\\", or \\"the future\\" or a \\"now\\" to such a God. It seems to be his effort to try to soften the stoic, impassible God of Calvin and Augustine. Ware offers us the same classical portrayal of God as microscopically controlling the world and through direct or indirect cause bringing about every act in the human drama. This would include all rape, murder, wars, holocaust, or whatever. He concludes the last few pages by going back to the example Sanders used of the death of Sanders brother. Ware tells us the only way to view events like this is that God \\"took him.\\" The answer to his death is, as Ware writes, \\"Yes, the God of all wisdom, goodness, and power has ordained to take these lives.\\" It was all brought about by God personally for reasons we cannot know. This is tantamount to saying God loaded the boxcars personally of those going into Hitler's ovens, or placing select individuals in the WTC when the buildings collapsed. Or, that he takes every sparrow by divine decree. He advises us as we have been advised for centuries by \\"classical\\" theologians that all evil, even gratuitous evil, is designed and brought about by God. This thinking is in the same vein of R.C. Sproul, who points out, \\"not even one molecule\\" of the universe is moved without God specifically controlling it. All human thought, since it must precede human acts and our behavior, is controlled, motivated, and directed by God, for His \\"greater\\" purposes.His explanations of verses used by open theists, starting with Abraham's example, are through the eye of the beholder. He introduces \\"relational mutability\\" which he brings into the Abraham story in Genesis 22. Ware says \\"he (God) does interact with his people in the experiences of their lives as they unfold in time.\\" God seems to get into the movie he made trillions of years ago since it is now being shown in theaters. \\"God literally sees and experiences in this moment what he has known from all eternity.\\" He argues against himself somewhat in this area as he feels open theists do in their choices of emphasis of scripture. He points out that these verses as a whole should be taken as anthropomorphic statements, but he stops and chooses God's statement of \\"for now I know that you fear God\\", as teaching us \\"in the experience of this action, I (God) am witnessing Abraham demonstrate dramatically and afresh that he fears me, and I find this both pleasing and acceptable in my sight.\\" He takes what he says is anthropomorphic language describing what goes on and pulls a whole new thought allegedly of God from the exchange of God and Abraham. All of the many other verses he covers to debunk open theology could just as easily be emphasized as open theists do. I didn't come away from any of his explanations saying--\\"Now I know.\\"He ends by stating that what gets everyone's ire up (open theists) is that they can't give up the idea there is no \\"free will\\" in the universe. He views them and their model as \\"diminishing\\" God and how human vanity or pride is swelled. God can't be diminished. One's view or take or image which has been created within their belief system of thought, can be diminished.It always amazes me that individuals (Ware is one of them) that feel that libertarian free will believers bring God \\"down\\" by believing in a world where human beings can choose, make choices, contrary to the will of God. He says in his opinion that is the main problem of \\"open\\" theists.Free will or freedom to choose is the greatest responsibility any human being has on earth. We must make choices. I believe that it doesn't reduce God, bring him down to our level, or elevate us up to his level by his granting us free will or free choice before him. It does just the exact opposite. It makes God a far more powerful God, unthreatened by us - one willing to, for His higher purpose, allow His creation to spurn him, reject him, curse him, and vilify him. God lets his creatures say no to him. Hell is, as C.S. Lewis stated, \\"locked from the inside.\\" That is a free choice, unconstrained by God, or anyone else. Phillip Yancey made a great comment in his most recent book--Prayer. He wrote that--\\"History is the story of God giving away power.\\" George Eldon Ladd wrote in his Theology of the New Testament that \\"evil is the price God paid for human freedom.\\"I still embrace after reading it concepts of the \\"open\\" model, particularly human beings having free will to choose what we do in life and all its decisions, and that God is not microscopically ruling our world. God does have a future. He can plan. He has things which he can look forward to. He is not brain dead. He interacts with us in our time zone. Prayers do move him."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Ware is excellent in his presentation of Classical Theism. The problem I run into is his lack of hermeneutical theory. He says that you cannot always interpret Scripture in a straightforward manner. On this point, he is correct. But then he turns around and wants the reader to believe the classical view, which is based upon the reading of Scripture in a straightforward manner. The problem with these types of classical theistic works is that they tell us that open theism is using metaphor incorrectly. Metaphors don't really tell us a whole lot about God, but then classical theists don't tell us what these passages are supposed to mean. They simply dismiss open texts as metaphorical deviance and never tell us how open texts fit in to the classical model. In other words, they ignore open texts. My other major problem with Ware's book comes on page 145 when he tells us that we should not use the life of Christ as the foundation for telling us what God is like. If we use Christ's life as a road-map to understand God, then &quot;we conceive of God wrongly as being subject to experiencing those aspects of human weakness and limitations which Jesus underwent for the purpose of his mission.&quot; It seems to me that the more you try to make razor-thin distinctions between Jesus and God, the more you drift into polytheism. In other words, what characteristics or features would make Jesus God if you deny some of the aspects of humanity? In my opinion there are serious trinitarian issues in Ware's approach. Here is the question that Ware raises in my mind, does our concept of God come from the Old Testament or the New? Ware thinks Old Testament. This is shown by his concentrated look at God from the OT. Is the OT authoritative and overrides the NT in our conception of God? I don't think so. You cannot take the OT out of context when looking at the NT. If our conception of God comes from both the OT and the NT, then the life and humanity of Jesus should included in our look at the conception of God. What it comes down to is that classical theists are trying to tell us that their idea of God has more scripture than the openness position. Big deal. The contextual integrity of the Scriptures does not give classical theists the right to ignore open texts. All of scripture tells us about God not just classical scriptures."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Sometimes the Openness debate generates more heat than light, but Ware's book is a delightful exception.The volume is shot through with sound exegesis that demonstrates God's exhaustive and definite foreknowledge of the future choices of free agents. Chapter 4 corrects exegetical errors made by Openness Theology, and chapter 5 is Ware's refreshingly careful exegesis of a long list of passages that teach the traditional view.The book's argument is both penetrating and devastating. Rather than sweep the &quot;partly open future&quot; motif into the &quot;dustbin of anthropomorphism,&quot; Ware shows that if an exegete takes the &quot;open future&quot; passages at &quot;face value,&quot; as the Openness theologians think we should, then God would be ignorant of the present as well as the past, and He would need reminding of things. A &quot;face value&quot; hermeneutic proves too much for the Open Theists (reductio ad absurdum). The book also gives a helpful definition of the all too often undefined category of &quot;anthropomorphism&quot; on page 86.Unlike some theologians who have taken up their pens against this contemporary error, Ware rightly and judiciously discriminates between Open Theism and Arminianism. The former is outside the camp of evangelicalism, not the latter. This book never targets Arminianism; instead, it aims directly at the diminished god of Open Theism and proves that he is not the God of the Bible.Finally, throughout the entire work, the author's tone is urgent but kind, firm but loving, and polemical but pastoral.I heartily recommend this book to everyone who wants to know what the Bible says about God's knowledge of the future."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"One of the many challenges facing the Church and the Gospel today is the concept of open theism; the concept that while God is all wise, and all loving, He does not know the future in any detailed sense. While God does know all the possibilities, He doesn't know which possibility will become real. His love is all encompassing, but He has self-limited His power to allow absolute libertarian freedom for humans. Bruce Ware writes God's Lesser Glory to counter this view of God.Mr. Ware begins his book by explaining why his readers should be concerned about the rise of open theism within the Church. He provides a short overview of what open theism proposes, centering on the philosophical foundations of open theism's belief system. He then considers two results of open theism; the result on the nature of God, and the result on living the Christian life. Several specific cases are used to illustrate the inroads open theism has made into the Church at large, including the adoption of a resolution by the Baptist General Council allowing open theism to be within the bounds of Evangelical thought, and the decision by several Christian publishers to publish books supporting open theism within their portfolios. Once beyond the introductory material, Mr. Ware divides the book into three central parts. The first part examines the foundations and beliefs of open theism, the second provides a critique of these foundations, and the third examines the practical issues believers encounter when accepting the open theism view of God.The first section begins by explaining the origin of open theism as an alternative to the classical Arminian view of the nature of God. Mr. Ware sets up the problem presented by open theism; how can God know the future, if the course of the future is dependent on the choices of morally free agents? He defines the concept of libertarian freedom as contra-causal freedom, or the ability of a morally free agent to decide between two choices freely. The result of working through this problem is the dichotomy: \\"Comprehensive foreknowledge and libertarian freedom are mutually exclusive notions. You cannot have both together.\\" He then states that if you step out of this dichotomy by stating that knowing doesn't imply controlling, you've simply stepped into another dilemma. If God doesn't control history, then how can God be said to providentially guide history to His ends? The open theism solution to this pair of problems is that God simply doesn't have comprehensive foreknowledge.The author continues by assessing the perceived benefits of open theism, primarily that understanding God in this way allows for a truly personal relationship with God. In the open theism view of relationships, trust must be built in both directions, rather than in one direction only. In order for a true relationship to exist, then, God must learn to trust people, just as His people must learn to trust in God.Once finished with describing the beliefs of open theism, Mr. Ware turns his writing to undermining the basis of this theology from the Scriptures. He begins with an examination of the problems with the hermeneutic used by the proponents of open theism, using specific passages identified by these proponents to show how this hermeneutic cannot be applied uniformly. God shows knowledge of the future even using the reading they propose. He then spends a chapter discussing various Scripture passages that show God does have exhaustive foreknowledge, including middle knowledge, or the knowledge of things that might have been, but were not. Mr. Ware then discusses the concept of risk in open theism, and how this idea undermines the wisdom of God.The final section focuses on the impact open theism, and the beliefs held in this theology, have on the everyday life of Christians. Mr. Ware argues that there is no comfort in following a God who grieve with us, and who does not know the future perfectly, even if that God faces the future with more knowledge and wisdom than we can muster as humans. He shows that unless God can truly control circumstances, then He cannot truly answer prayer, and He cannot truly fulfill the promises of working all things to the best for the individual believer. He shows how open theism weakens our confidence in God's ability to guide us; God may make mistakes on our behalf because of his imperfect view of the future. Mr. Ware returns to the theme of suffering and evil in the world to drive his points in this area home.Mr. Ware's analysis of the Akedah, the Binding of Isaac, in Genesis 22 is an example of the excellent reasoning that marks portions of this book. The problem revolves around the words of God in Genesis 22:12, where God states He \\"now knows,\\" that Abraham loves Him. The implication is that Abraham didn't, before the Akedah, know that Abraham loved Him, so God couldn't have had knowledge of the future. The problem for open theism in this passage is three-fold. The first is that if God truly knows all current things exhaustively, then how could He not know whether or not Abraham loved him? The second is that if God doesn't know the future, then how could this one test prove that Abraham will always be faithful to God's calling? Wouldn't future tests be needed as well--in fact, wouldn't moment by moment testing be required for God to know this for certain? Finally, how could Abraham go into the test knowing God would restore his son to life if he really did go through with the sacrifice, as described in Hebrews 11? None of this makes sense in the view of open theology.Mr. Ware outflanks the openness belief system in this case by arguing God can change His relationship to humans without changing His nature. He uses the example of a mother taking her daughter to the dentist for the first time. She knows what is about to happen, and in a sense experiences the pain and fear with her daughter. But this doesn't decrease the mother's knowledge of the future, or ability to control the situation. The author's argument against the mutable nature of words our modern culture, and the deep concern with self-esteem, are well argued and powerful in the face of open theism theology.There are a number of points, however, where Mr. Ware's arguments fall flat. The underlying theme is that if God doesn't control the actions of individual humans, then He cannot control history; a God that cannot control the course of history is a \\"lesser god.\\" This is, however, a false dichotomy; there are two responses the author does not consider.The first possible response is that the statement itself has an implied everything built in. That in order for God to control the course of history, He must control everything, down to the last detail of the lives of every human being. This is a clear leap in logic that needs much more support to be accepted.The second possible response is to note that only in God do the will to act, the knowledge to act, and the ability to act exist in equally balanced proportions. In other words, only in God does the will to act automatically translate into action. It is perfectly reasonable to propose that while God controls history through controlling human action and maintaining control over some part of human will, God does not need to control every corner of human will to achieve His ends, because human will does not (and in fact cannot) always translate into action. The author ends up placing God's will in a position of pre-eminence over His knowledge and love, resulting in the same unbalanced view of God he decries among the open theist.In spite of these flaws, however, this is a well-argued book, and well worth the time required to read and digest. Mr. Ware's refutation of open theism is well grounded, and total."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"I had a nice, long, maybe even scholarly review of this book ready to go but then I thought, \\"You know, there's been toomuch angry ink spilled over this subject already.\\" So I ditched all my really juicy points and am just going to give you the short version:On the whole, this book is an unwelcome addition to the open theism debate. Even if Ware's arguments are correct (a big if, in my opinion), his unending sarcasm and invective pretty much guarantee that no open theist is ever going to be able to listen to him. If you want to learn about open theism, this book is definitely not the place to start. Ware just doesn't seem able to sustain the fair-mindedness he manages to show in his early chapters. He draws too many unwarranted conclusions and produces too many distortions of the open thiesm position. Instead, I would suggest the Intervarsity Press book \\"Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views\\", and the many works referenced therein. (This is available from Amazon, by the way.)I will give Ware credit for one thing: he does show that the open theists have not produced iron-clad arguments in defence of their position. He shows that they have their work cut out for them, particularly in regard to prophecy. (He thinks his arguments along these lines pretty much put an end to open theism, but I think that is far overstating the case.) If you are somewhat familiar with open theism and are maybe thinking of taking the open theism plunge, you should definitely look before you leap and familiarize yourself with some of the arguments Ware makes. But I really don't think this book is the place of choice to do it. Again, I would start with \\"Divine Foreknowledge\\" and move on to the works referenced there.If you want a very good overview of the more traditional approaches to the foreknowledge question, I can't think of a better book than Linda Zagzebski's \\"The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge\\" (ISBN 0195065581 -- don't know if Amazon carries it or not), but be prepared to digest some real philosophical red meat!"},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"I recently had to give a guest lecture on Open Theism for a theology course, and thought it would be wise to read some books about Open Theism before I did, to make sure all my information was accurate. I discovered one thing in my research: both the books for and against Open Theism are poor books. The books by Open Theists I find filled with poor arguments, but so are the books against Open Theism. I have yet to find a good book against Open Theism, and I doubt a good book supporting Open Theism can really be written. Why is this a poor book? For many reasons. First, Ware is simply not a good writer. I do not doubt that he is a good professor, but writer, no. Second, as someone who leans more toward Arminianism than Calvinism, I find many of Ware's arguments just as poor as those by Open Theists. In many places, Ware seems to be saying that Open Theism cannot be true because Calvinism is. While Calvinism seems to be slightly less Biblically inaccurate than Open Theism, even if I believed in Calvinism I would still not find Ware's argument against Open Theism especially convincing when he goes into defend-Calvinism mode. When you are writing a book against a certain position, supporting your own positions is something that you should do AFTER showing that theirs is inadequate, for then they will be looking for something else to turn to. If you go up to a non-Christian who is perfectly happy being a non-Christian, it is likely that you will not be able to convert them if you simply support your own position and never give them a reason to doubt their own. I am not saying that Ware does not give any good arguments against Open Theism, but rather that he should have spent more time arguing against Open Theism and less time arguing for Calvinism. If I wanted a book supporting Calvinism I could have found far better books than this.That said, Ware does provide some good information about Open Theists, and he points out many sources that one can look into if you are interested in reading Open Theist literature (and he makes sure to take their statements out of context somewhat frequently as well).In all, it's not a great book, but there aren't really many better ones out there (to the best of my knowledge), so I guess it's as good a place to start as any.Overall grade: C"},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"In recent years the movement known as open theism has claimed to be a more biblical and more practical alternative to the traditional view. In this book, Bruce Ware carefully and systematically refutes both those claims, showing that the traditional view better handles the biblical evidence and the issues of Christian living, while better preserving the glory of God. His examination of the biblical material is especially strong.MILLARD J. ERICKSON Distinguished Professor of TheologyGeorge W. Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor UniversityOpen theism, which denies that God can foreknow free human choices, dishonors God, distorts Scripture, damages faith, and would, if left unchecked, destroy churches and lives. Its errors are not peripheral but central. Therefore, I thank God for Bruce Ware's loving, informed, penetrating, devastating critique of this profoundly injurious teaching. I pray that God would use this book to sharpen the discernment of leaders and prepare the people of God to recognize toxic teaching when they taste it. O how precious is the truth of God's all-knowing, all-wise, all-powerful care over our fragile lives. For your name's sake, O Lord, and for the good of the suffering church who rest in your all-knowing providence, prosper the message of this beautiful book and shorten the ruinous life of open theism.&quot;JOHN PIPER Senior Pastor, Bethlehem Baptist ChurchOpen theism offers a God who, like us, does not know the future. Its sponsors see this humanizing of God as logical and devotional gain. Bruce Ware sees it as a way of misreading Scripture and impoverishing the life of faith, and he makes a compelling case for this view. I heartily commend this thorough and insightful book.J. I. PACKER Professor of Theology, Regent CollegeBruce Ware offers a compelling scriptural defense of an informed classical theism-that God's knowledge of the future is exhaustive, his providential governance is complete, and his eternal purposes will triumph-while fully preserving our authentic humanness. This book exalts the God who is truly God in undiminished greatness for the confidence, hope, and victory of his people.BRUCE DEMAREST Professor of Theology and Spiritual Formation, Denver SeminaryWhile I (basically a traditional Arminian) do not agree with all of Ware's answers, I applaud his keen discernment of the questions and issues raised by openness theology. He clearly sets forth the key differences between this view and traditional views of God, both Arminian and Calvinist; and he perceptively identifies its major weaknesses. I benefited especially from Ware's treatment of the biblical teaching on God's foreknowledge.JACK COTTRELL Professor of Theology, Cincinnati Bible SeminaryEvangelical theology faces a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. The denial and refutation of God's perfections will lead evangelical theology into disintegration and doctrinal catastrophe. The very identity and reality of the God of the Bible is at stake. The real question comes down to this-does God really know all things, past, present, and future? Or, is God often surprised like the rest of us? The Bible reveals that God is all-knowing and all-powerful. Bruce Ware sets out the issues carefully in God's Lesser Glory. This book is a much needed antidote to contemporary confusion, and it is a powerful testimony to the truth of God set forth in the Scripture. I can only hope that Christians will read it and rejoice in the knowledge of the true and living God.R. ALBERT MOHLER, JR. President, The Southern Baptist Theological SeminaryNot even God knows whether you will decide to buy this book or read it, at least according to \\"open theism.\\" But Bruce Ware shows that this position, which is seeping into evangelical churches, is contrary to Scripture, internally contradictory, and destructive to our Christian lives. This is a clear, fair, well-reasoned, and Bible-centered critique of a doctrinal error so far-reaching that it ultimately portrays a different God than the God of the Bible.WAYNE GRUDEM Chairman, Department of Biblical and Systematic Theology Trinity Evangelical Divinity SchoolBruce Ware's book is not the last word on this crucially important subject. Rather, it is the first book-length serious response to open theism-a movement that is beginning to inflict serious damage on confessing evangelicalism. Presenting itself as a legitimate variant within evangelicalism, \\"open\\" theism in reality so redefines the God of the Bible and of theology that we wind up with a quite different God. Ware's book demonstrates that this is so, and launches a courteous but firm attack against this incursion.D. A. CARSON Research Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity SchoolGod's Lesser Glory is a carefully reasoned and well-argued critique of open theism. Employing both philosophical rigor and outstanding biblical exegesis, Ware convincingly shows why the great minds in church history have with near unanimity affirmed that the God of classical theism is the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus of Nazareth. Every pastor, philosopher of religion, and theologian should have this book in his or her library.FRANCIS J. BECKWITH Associate Professor of Philosophy, Culture, and Law Trinity International University, California CampusAt once businesslike and practical, Bruce Ware's restatement of classical Christianity in the face of contemporary challenges to it within evangelicalism is bold and bracing. Driven by the pastoral and practical importance of God's greatness, Ware's approach keeps his defense from bogging down in pedantic rhetoric. This book clearly demonstrates that the historic Christian view, against centuries of antecedents to \\"open theism,\\" has been favored for so long for one reason: It is so evidently biblical.MICHAEL HORTON Associate Professor of Historical Theology Westminster Theological Seminary in CaliforniaIn their controversy with classical Christian theism, open theists have tried to seize the evangelical high ground by claiming that their view of God is truer to the Scriptures. God's Lesser Glory rebuts this claim. Bruce Ware goes to the heart of the hermeneutical issue, cogently arguing the biblical case for classical theism and showing why open theists should themselves be uneasy with some of their biblical interpreations.MARK R. TALBOT Associate Professor of Philosophy, Wheaton College Vice Chairman, Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals"},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Bruce Ware's book God's Lesser Glory is an outstanding work defending the classical belief in a God who has exhaustive knowledge of all things both possible and actual in the past, present, AND future. This is one of only a few book-length critiques that deal with open theism's proposal of a God of limited omniscience. Open theism has been attacking this vital doctrine of God's omniscience and Bruce Ware kindly, yet firmly, puts his exegetical skill to work in defense of God's complete foreknowledge.The book is divided into five parts--three primary ones with an introduction and conclusion. In the introduction Ware addresses the \\"so what?\\" question of the reader by familiarizing his audience with the mounting controversy surrounding open theism examines. The introduction is appropriately titled, \\"Why You Should Be Concerned.\\"The second section and first major part, \\"What Does Open Theism Propose?\\" builds directly on the introduction by succinctly dealing with the development of open theism as a theological framework and as a departure from the classical Arminian position (chap. 2). Ware also deals with \\"The Perceived Benefits of Open Theism\\" (chap. 3) in Part One.Part Two, \\"What's Wrong with Open Theism's View of God?\\" responds to Boyd's God of the Possible and Sanders' The God Who Risks (two chief proponents of open theism). In Chapter 4, \\"Assessing Open Theism's Denial of Exhaustive Divine Foreknowledge,\\" Ware evaluates both the exegetical method of open theism and its application to key Scriptural passages often touted by open theists as support for their position. Chapter 5 outlines a \\"Scriptural Affirmation of Exhaustive Divine Foreknowledge\\" as Ware presents a careful discussion of select passages of Scripture, against which open theists cannot really argue effectively. Chapter 6 then addresses an often unnoticed problem with open theism: \\"The God Who Risks and the Assault on God's Wisdom.\\"Part Three exposes the challenging practical ramifications of open theism. Ware discusses how this position harms the Christian's prayer life (chap. 7), results in diminished confidence in God's guidance (chap. 8), and creates outright despair in the midst of suffering and pain (chap. 9). Finally, in his conclusion \\"God's Greater Glory and Our Everlasting Good,\\" Ware restates the weaknesses of open theism and outlines the orthodox view of God's sovereignty.The strength of Ware's book is its expository method. Ware doesn't build straw men to tear down. He seriously and honestly interacts with the writings of open theists like Greg Boyd, Clark Pinnock, and John Sanders, answering their arguments from texts which apparently support openness theology and also presenting the full gamut of biblical passages which a lot of open theists fail to mention (such as, Isaiah 41:21-29, 42:8-9, 43:8-13, 44:6-8, 44:24-28, 45:20-23, 46:8-11, 48:3-8, and 48:14-16). Just a brief perusal of those texts should reveal the many holes in open theism. Also questions of God's immutability and \\"repentance\\" are handled with care and answered well.As well written as Bruce Ware's book is, there are a couple of areas where I believe that it could be improved, both of which deal with how exhaustive the book is. To me, among the most problematic ramifications of open theism is the reality that open theism, by definition, must acknowledge at the very minimum the possibility of biblical errancy and fallibility. In my view, one cannot consistently be an open theist as well as a believer in biblical inerrancy, since a great deal of the prophetic material written in the bible requires the exact kind of divine foreknowledge of the future that open theists say God does not possess. At the very least, open theism has to acknowledge that their view requires, for example, that the entire book of Revelation MIGHT prove to be wrong, since by their own teachings, the prophetic proclamations only represent God's best guesses of what might happen, rather than being part of a divine blueprint that is already in place. One other area that I think Ware could have been more comprehensive is how open theism requires a fundamental redefining of the substitutionary atonement of Christ's death on the cross. If God does not know the future that means that God could not know with absolute certainty that Christ's death would accomplish anything, since it is conceivable that nobody could have responded to it and believed. Neither of these issues is dealt with in much detail and I believe these issues represent monumental theological deficiencies in the openness view. Because of this, I believe, these issues should have been further explored in Bruce Ware's book.Having said that, what Ware DOES cover in this book is outstanding and represents a very able and formidable refutation of open theism and its implications on the faith overall, as well as individual believers. He effectively shows that open theism is purely a human concoction, as well as open theism's internally inconsistent mess as a matter of scholarship. I am thankful for Ware's successful attempt to discredit the theological and philosophy claims of open theism as it defames the glory of God. Christians owe this servant of God a great debt of gratitude for putting the accent of God's glory back into His sovereignty."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Recently I read all the way through Gregory Boyd's &quot;God of the Possible&quot; and Bruce Ware's &quot;God's Lesser Glory&quot; which are now the two most important arguments for opposing viewpoints in this debate within contemporary evangelism over the nature and extend of God's sovereignty and knowledge.Boyd's &quot;God of the Possible&quot; is actually quite a bit better than Pinnock's &quot;The Openness of God.&quot; Boyd uses more Scripture and resorts to less caricatures and purple prose. I must admit that it is well-written and superficially compelling and persuasive (although containing many internal contradictions and hideous examples of bad hermeneutics that the discerning reader will immediately detect). Since I am a Southern Baptist in Texas, the superficial appeal of Boyd is somewhat disturbing, since an increased amount of money and students are going to Baylor's Truett Seminary where Roger Olsen endorses Boyd's book and says that he is open to open theism . The average Southern Baptist college/seminary student/pastor is very Arminian and very vulnerable to Boyd's arguments.Ware's &quot;God's Lesser Glory&quot; is a devastating response to Boyd's book. Ware has obviously read all the openness literature, but he focuses his attention on Boyd's &quot;God of the Possible&quot; and John Sander's &quot;The God who Risks.&quot; It is amazing that Ware was able to respond to Boyd's book which was published earlier this year and get a response published in November that does not read like a hastily-written rush job. Indeed, I was extremely impressed by the book. Ware's beautiful prose style is worthy of emulation. He thoroughly refutes the open theist interpretation of Scripture and exposes all of the internal contradictions of this system. He finishes the book by lamenting the harmful implications of open theism for our understanding of prayer, guidance, and suffering. Although Ware is strongly motivated by practical and pastoral concerns, he effectively employs satire and sarcasm that is often quite funny (I was laughing out loud at page 80, footnote 15). Ware briefly mentions middle knowledge primarily in terms of the openness response to it, but his own development of the the doctrine of divine providence is Reformed, and he does not appear to incorporate middle knowledge (at least in this book). Of course, the purpose of this book for Ware was largely negative rather than positive. He is trying to refute open theism rather than develop his own view of providence, so his discussions of providence are not that elaborate, and his future work may describe how he uses middle knowledge categories in his understanding of God's eternal decree.Notice that Ware teaches at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. As a Southern Baptist, it is great to see that the leading defenses of orthodoxy are being written at (some of) our seminaries.I would recommend that everybody buy Boyd's and Ware's books. Read Boyd first, then Ware.This is really only Round One between Boyd and Ware. Both of them promise to write more comprehensive books on divine providence in the future (although only Ware's God knows exactly when or if these books will be published)."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"As with Norman Geisler's book &quot;Creating God In The Image of Man?,&quot; Bruce Ware's book simply does not take the issue nor the subject seriously. I wondered, quite frankly, as I was reading the book whether Ware had actually fully investigated and contemplated the subject he was addressing. As someone who has read the books Ware addressed in his critique of open theism, I found his criticism lightweight, which matches the impact this book will have in general. It's as if Ware simply took quotes from the books without studying indepth what the authors were truly writing about. The book suffers from two profound problems: 1) Ware doesn't seem to understand the subject he is addressing and, 2) his own defense of God's knowledge of all things is so weak as to actually energize the arguments open theism as been making. As someone who has been investigating and contemplating the claims of open theism over the past several years I have been waiting for a critique of it that actually does it justice. I am still waiting..."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"I had the privilege to hear much of this book in lecture form in Dr. Ware's class on the Doctrine of Providence. In response to a few of the other reviews let me say:1) Dr. Ware does indeed understand the issues he has written about. He is good friends with Greg Boyd and has spoken to him about the issue many times. Dr. Ware knows the position of Open Theism as good as any Open Theist does. Yet he disagrees with the position. Why? Mainly, because Open Theism does not adequately deal with the teachings of Scripture. As he points out, Open Theism has serious flaws both on theological and philosophical levels.2) Calvinism doesn't really play into the discussion. I believe Dr. Ware would think that an Arminian view of God would be closer to the Biblical text than that of the Open Theist. Open Theism comes close to, if not crosses, the line of evangelicalism. Regardless if Dr. Ware if a 5,4,or 3 point Calvinist, the point of the book is whether or not Open Theism accurately interprets the Biblical text, giving us a Biblical view of God. In the end, I believe he rightly says &quot;no&quot; and that with Open Theism we are given a God of &quot;lesser glory.&quot;"},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Solid critique of a very controversial movement. Open Theism ends up much like the old Process Theology. It is driven by folks who regard themselves as evangelicals despite their real problems with orthodoxy. In their zeal to explain the problem of evil they strip God of some of his key attributes.Try also John Frame's *No Other God* (2001)."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Dr. Ware has done a tremendous service with the publication of this polite but pointed refutation of Open Theism. Using careful reasoning,insightful analysis of key Scriptures and thorough research, Open Theism simply has been 'shut out' biblically, intellectually,philosophically,logically,metaphysically. See also Norm Geisler 'Creating God in the Image of Man','Chosen but Free' and Millard Erickson, 'Evangelical Left', 'God the Father Almighty' for additional refutation of Openness and powerful reinforcement of Classical evangelical view. The more one looks into Openness, the more one sees associations with Process thought, acknowledged by both Open Theists and Process Theists such as Pinnock,Rice,Boyd and Process Theologian Cobb. See also BGC Foreknowledge discussion board postings and articles by A.B.Caneday, Erickson et al for daily updated informational debate between proponents of Classical view and Open Theists. One major Open Theist, Greg Boyd is coming out with two new books related to his Open-Process Synthesis view: Myth of the Blueprint (Aug.2001) and Satan and Problem of Evil (Sept.2001). Ware's book will be a great arsenal of defense of the Classical evangelical view, with more expected from him, Caneday and Erickson,Geisler before it's all said and done. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"I am generally not inclined to write a review or a letter to the editor or other things of that nature but occasionally I run across material that is so troubling to me that I must respond. Ware's book is just such material.I have been following the developments of this debate pretty closely and am intrigued by the Open Theism position. However, I have been looking for a solid counter argument against which to weigh the claims. Ware's work was recommended to me as just such a work. While the person recommending the book did not believe the arguments to be devastating he did believe Ware had read and wrestled with the material. I was sorely disappointed. For all of the weight that Ware places on the signifcance of the debate there is an appaling lack of sophistication in his treatment. This book would serve well in logic class as a lesson in the effective use of logical fallacy that places the book well into the category of style over substance. Ware does not engage the material but simply regurgitates standard arguments that often beg the question and he repeatedly equivocates as he conveniently redefines terms and even other characteristics of God as they serve his system of thought (e.g. pg.164 note 2)concerning the nature of God.As one who is not yet convinced in the debate this work served little in helping even to clarify the issues involved. The book however, was well written in a persuasive style that will certainly move the less engaged reader who is looking only to be affirmed in a previously held position or who is unfamiliar with the Open position. Ironically, it is this strength among its many failings that poses the greatest danger."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Recently I spent some time reading Boyd's book \\"The God of the Possible\\". I wanted to hear from a supporter of Open Theism what they believed. While I found Boyd to be a good writer, I found his exegetical analysis irresponsible and his logical arguments untenable. I don't know everything about Open Theism. It makes some interesting points. I might even consider the view if I found a compelling argument. But Boyd's argument was anything but compelling and I felt he left the door wide open for a cataclysmic counter-argument from the classical view.Being interested in the classical response, I picked up God's Lesser Glory. But when I read Ware's book I found it somewhat dry and redundant. Don't get me wrong, Ware made some promising points that defended the classical view admirably. But I felt he spent too much time repeating and reinforcing his arguments than building upon them. And I enjoyed reading Ware's scriptural correction of Boyd's exegetical blunders, but I felt there was opportunity to attack open theism from a philosophical position as well - a missed opportunity.If you look at how Boyd argued, time and again you will notice how he trips over his own feet. But Ware did not expose these arguments as elementary. Granted, Ware adressed some of the issues men like Boyd raised. But I fear Ware may have held back attacking Boyd's aruments in fear of seeming malevolent toward Boyd himself. It is unfortunate as Boyd deserves to be called out on every fallacious argument he makes (as anyone, either classical or open does)!Open Theism has everything to prove if it wants to be taken seriously. If Boyd is the best Open Theism can produce (which I doubt he is), I fear open theists will be dissapointed; longevity will not be their companion. As I read through Boyd's child-like logic, the conslusions left me wondering if Boyd was even concerned with being cogent. But Ware did not take full advantage of this. Ware did not counter with a knockout punch.An example of where one should have been given was the problem of evil and determinism for the open theist. Boyd argues early on that God does not know what any individual will choose, but he does know with great certainty what a group of people will choose. To put it another way, he proposes that it is easy for God to predict the actions of a mob but difficult to predict the actions of an individual.When this is applied to his own worldview, it follows that God can predict with great accuracy how many people will suffer the fate of eternal damnation. God may not know which individual would not choose him, but he does know that most individuals will NOT choose him!God knows that most of his creation will suffer the pain of hell. What, then, does open theism offer in this area that classical theism doesn't? Nothing. Boyd criticises the classical view in which God creates people he knows will enter the gates of hell, yet his criticism is self-defeating as the God of open theism suffers the same problem (if you want to call this a problem). The God of Open Theism knowingly creates people who will go to hell, there is no recolciliation here. But Ware never made this argument, he never even mentioned the open theistic idea that God knows with great certainty what the mob will freely choose. The door Boyd left wide open was never walked through.This being a book review I won't take the time to polish my own argument. I realize there are holes in it, but this is not the place to fill them in. Ware's book, however, IS the place for these arguments and I feel he left the cupboard empty in some areas. I suppose Ware had to choose what he wanted to battle, but I would have liked to see a retaliation against Boyd in full force.Thus this was a good book but it was not a great book."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Ware displays a great deal of pastoral warmth in dealing with this issue while not shortchanging us on a fair analysis of it's problems. His thorough examination of the biblical texts is extremely satisfying. Slowly but surely he examines the context and the overlooked riches of the proof texts of open theism.As I read this book the thought that kept coming back to me was this - One's view of god has a direct correlation to a person's view of the world and their view of man. I believe that John Calvin was right when he said, &quot;Man never achieves a clear knowledge of himself unless he has first looked upon God's face, and then descends from contemplating Him to scrutinize himself.&quot; No matter how hard we try, we all view Scripture through different presuppositions. In fact, to deny that we have presuppositions is a presupposition in itself! So in doing theology it is vital that these preunderstandings are developed in the order of greatest importance to least. For example, we don't develop the doctrine of man prior to the doctrine of God and we don't develop the doctrine of salvation prior to the doctrine of Christ, etc. And this is the mistake of open theists. They have created God in the image of man instead of man in the image of god. They have forced an artificial interpretation on their proof texts because they have first come to the conclusion that man was created with libertarian freedom. Without this presupposition, they would have not arrived at the end of the train of thought they long ago boarded and which now chugs along at a frightful pace. I am especially saddened that men such as Gregory Boyd, who have opposed external groups such as the Jesus Seminar with their fine works, are having such internal conflicts with the faith. Upon a close examination, truly the God of open theism is a God of lesser glory and is therefore quite undeserving of our worship."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Thank you, thank you, thank you!

THANK YOU Bruce Ware!!"},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Dr. Ware rates 6 stars for his fair and Scriptural expose' of Gregory Boyd's Open Theory of Bible interpretation,a Bi-Polar Processismic Philosophy lensing to synthesize a Neo-Theology. Dr. Ware systematically dismantles Openism by bringing the Bible to bear on Boydism.What are the major aberrancies of Openist Neo-Process Theory?1)Rejection of Inerrant Bible. Boyd's own denomination Bapt. General Conference has as Affirmation of Faith &quot;The Bible is Inerrant&quot;. Yet Boyd in his across-the-boundaryline latest book 'Across the Spectrum' patronizes the Historic Christian position of an error-free Word of God in favor of an error-ridden Scripture in matters not touching on 'faith &amp; practice'.Ware and the rest of the Evangelical community wonder: just where,and who gets to decide which, Bible matters DON'T touch on matters of 'faith &amp; practice'? Boyd's allegations cast doubt on Bible reliability. It is wondered why BGC Pres. Jerry Sheveland and Bethel College Trustees haven't counseled with Boyd about his anti-BGC Affirmation views (while on the clergy roster and a college prof), asking for retraction or resignation?? Will the BGC annual convention in June side with Boyd or the Bible on this one? The world wonders!2)Rejection of specific Exhaustively Divine Definitive Foreknown Factuality prophecies like Elisha's Barley Futures in 2Kings; Gideon &amp; Midianite Dream Sequence; Zechariah the prophet naming King Josiah 300 years in advance; Peter's triple denial (where Boyd has God 'squeezing' Peter to force 3 denials out of him, unwittingly eviscerating openism's libertarian agency with a divine override!); Jeremiah stating as future factuality that 2 false prophets would meet with a doom so memorable, Judah would quote a curse based on the judgment - Jer.29:21-22.3)Boyd claims the title 'Evangelical' while advocating Neo-Processist ideas like non-literal hell, annihilationism, etc. Boyd claims that the Bible's descriptions of hell as 'outer darkness' and 'flames of fire' are self-contradictory, and can't both be true. Wrong again, Gregory! Aren't there heat energy waves not in the visible light spectrum (ultra-violet, micro-waves, etc.) that can generate tremendous heat energy yet no visible light? Or maybe Boyd hasn't heard of the out-of-body experience of a person who ended up in hell (instead of the usual tunnel of light or paradise). He stood on the shore of a huge lake or sea of flame, but it was dimly lit like zippo-blue-lighter fluid or propane flame emitting hardly any light. He was surrounded by a horrible,inky, suffocating pitch-blackness in the atmosphere all around. Like having it rain and shine at the same time, this man experienced 'outer darkness' and 'flames of lake of fire' simultaneously. Or just think of aerial photos of a forest fire or volcano lava flow at night. All darkness in the sky, with barely a glow of flame. Both at the same time. And both devastatingly real.All of the Bible's descriptors of hell, while hard for Boyd to imagine, show that the real hell must be infinitely worse than words can incompletely convey.4)Finally, Ware shows how Openism fails the 'Glory Test'. Does the Bible's portrayal of Divine Attributes like Eternal Exhaustively Definitive Foreknown Factuality of free futures reflect Who the True Jesus is? Or Boyd's 'extensive indefinite forecasting' combined with 'infinite chess grandmaster level intelligence', processism's 'theo-repentism', limited quasi-omniscience, surrendered 'pre-creation-omnipotence', finitized pseudo-omnipresence, etc. more accurately depict the Bible's God to fullest magnified Glory? Which Jesus is to be worshiped??He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches!Stay tuned for Ware's forthcoming God of Greater Glory. Also, see the fine 'God Under Fire' and 'Beyond the Bounds' for equally devastating expose's of the misguided, misbegotten, misinterpretive neo-processist heterodox philosophtheology called Open Theory, with its origins in Boyd's doctoral dissertation TRINITY &amp; PROCESS, a hybrid sterile mule mutated from a healthy horse(Historic Christianity)+ diseased donkey(Hartshornian Process Philosophy).&quot;God is greater than our hearts, and He knows EVERYTHING.&quot;Not 'everything there is to know' or 'everything logically knowable' or 'everything as fact except free futures' or'pretty much everything' or 'everything our genuine freedom confines Him to' or 'everything possible'. But EVERYTHING. Categorically. Unqualifiedly. Unrestrictedly. Unreservedly. Exhaustively. Free Future Factuality. Limitlessly. Omni-presciently. Without risk of contradiction. Settled in Transcendent Infinity-Eternity as if accomplished fact in Immanent Space-Time (though the Lord may change His stated intentions based on His unstated ones - see Jesus &amp; Philip and the feeding of the 5,000 in John 6:6).&quot;Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.&quot; (1John 5:21)"},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Don't let my title fool you. &quot;Hyper&quot; Calvinists refers more to their reaction to anything they deem as heretical rather than an advocate of all 5 points. This is most interesting seeing how the list of theologian objecting to Boyd's and Sander's work vary anywhere from 2 point to 5 point calvinists. (This is a another interesting anomaly amongst &quot;calvinists&quot; None are really calvinists anyway..but that is a whole other story) I was amused to see the list of theologians such as Erickson, Horton, Grudem, Sproul and others throw thier little diatribes into the mix. You would think there was a conspiracy going on here. Funny, being a seasoned seminary student I was fortunate to have read both Grudem's and Erickson's theologies. Erickson's &quot;middle road&quot; approach to Calvinism is simpy silly and confusing. I doubt Horton and Packer would find him in their camp on this issue. And this is precisely the irony in all of this. Evangelicals don't know what to beleive and few agree on anything. These evangelicals are a dwindling bunch and they are losing their grip on academia. Their attempts at reconciling calvin's teaching with thier own uncertainties about these mysteries is laughable. Boyd's and Sander's works are much more theological and intellectually honest. Until these &quot;heavy hitters&quot; of the evangelical ball park face up to their own uncertainties and are willing to admit the shortcomings of their vain attempts at resurrecting a made to order version of calvinism they will continue to strike out and already are well on the way to warm the benches of theological irrelevance."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"I think Ware has done a fine job of defending classical theism's belief in a God who has exhaustive knowledge of all things both possible and actual in the past, present, AND future. Open-theism has been attacking this vital doctrine of God's omniscience and Bruce Ware kindly, yet firmly, puts his exegetical skill to work in defense of exhaustive divine foreknowledge.The strength of this book is it's expository method. Ware doesn't build straw men to tear down. He seriously and honestly interacts with the writings of Open-theists like Greg Boyd, Clark Pinnock, and John Sanders, answering their arguments from texts which apparently support openness theology and also presenting the full gammit of Biblical passages which most open-theists fail to mention, such as Isaiah 41:21-29, 42:8-9, 43:8-13, 44:6-8, 44:24-28, 45:20-23, 46:8-11, 48:3-8, and 48:14-16. Just a brief perusal of those texts should reveal the many holes in open-theism. Questions of God's immutability and &quot;repentance&quot; are also handled with care and answered well, in my opinion.Reading this book helped me understand what attracts some people to open-theism - namely, the idea that suffering happens outside of God's knowledge and will. Some people seem to derive comfort from the idea that God is as surprised by the calamity which befalls us as we are. Personally, I find this concept totally unbiblical and without much comfort to offer. Open-theism's god is like a crippled king with a good heart, not an all-wise and all-powerful Sovereign who must be trusted by us. He is like a handicapped friend who empathizes with us, but cannot really help us. Open-theism puts God in a wheel-chair. I have experienced trials (as have we all) when I didn't fully understand why God had allowed it or what He was doing at the time. I suppose there are some questions that won't be answered this side of heaven. But I find much more comfort in believing that &quot;behind a frowning Providence, He hides a smiling face,&quot; than I would if I believed that God didn't know what was going on any sooner than I did.It boils down to this. Either the Bible teaches that God actually has all knowledge of all things - past, present, and future - including the free choices of men, angels, and demons and all the sin and suffering which results from those choices - and has a purpose in permitting it all to happen as He does; OR, the Bible teaches that God is less than this: a kind-hearted but straight-jacketed despot who feels our pain but won't interfere because He exalts free-will above His own wisdom. I'm convinced that the Bible teaches the former, not the latter. Ware gives a good defense. If you are wrestling with the issue, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Bruce Ware wrote in the Preface to this 2000 book, \\"Readers will find this book unkind to open theism... this debate with open theism is central, not peripheral. It has everything to do with the God whom we trust, follow, honor, and obey.\\"Ware cites John Sanders' interpretation of God's promises to Noah, and comments, \\"Here, then, God second-guesses his prior decision. 'Perhaps this is not after all the best way to deal with despicable human evil,' God apparently reasons... And given that God promises never again to act in this manner... God must have felt very badly about what he had done.\\" (Pg. 54) He later summarizes, \\"What confidence can we have in a God who must second-guess his own actions? ... If God is not sure that what he does is best, can we be sure that he really knows what he is doing?\\" (Pg. 159)He quotes Isaiah 48:3-8, observing that what this passage asserts is nothing short of massive foreknowledge and absolute accuracy, \\"neither one of which can be accounted for in open theism.\\" (Pg. 118-119) Concerning Deut 18:18-22, he comments, \\"If God lacked knowledge of the future, how could he predict such matters with such accuracy and certainty...?\\" (Pg. 137)He asks hypothetically, \\"Why would one ever think that it is a benefit to us that God takes into account what we think as he decides what is best? How can it be better that God and I decide my future together, rather than leaving this altogether in God's infinitely wise and perfect hands? Who do we think we are?\\" (Pg. 186-187)Ware's book is a spirited and useful contribution to this ongoing debate."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Ware quibbles with Pinnock, Boyd, Sanderson, and Hasker throughout. Ware's world is the classical view of God, with exception of his introduction of \\"relational mutability\\" of God. Essentially he says that God has exhaustive foreknowledge with a new twist. Even though God acted, created, and planned instantly one time ganglions of years ago (the Super Big Bang), that when time rolls around to events in our lives, God steps into it takes special notice and gets in the fray emotionally. This makes no sense. It would appear that a God that has exhaustive foreknowledge could have no future. He wouldn't have to plan. There are no such concepts as \\"plan\\", \\"look ahead\\", \\"tomorrow\\", or \\"the future\\" or a \\"now\\" to such a God. There wouldn't be a \\"beginning\\" event in his life, such as the creation of man, etc.The introduction of \\"relational mutability\\" seems to be his effort to try to soften the stoic, impassible God of Calvin and Augustine. Ware offers us the same classical portrayal of God as microscopically controlling the world and through direct or indirect cause bringing about every act in the human drama. Since thoughts precede acts, God would have had to create thoughts to bring about actions in the world of his creatures. This would include all rape, murder, wars, holocaust, or whatever. As an example of his beliefs relative to what we experience in life, he used the example of the brother of Sanders who had died a violent death. Ware disagreed with Sanders an an Open Theist. Ware concludes his book in the last few pages by going back to the example Sanders used of the death of Sanders brother. Ware tells us the only way to view events like the death of Sanders brother is that God ordained from the beginning of time that Sanders brother would be killed in the manner he was killed. Ware uses the softend term that God \\"took him.\\" Ware writes, \\"Yes, the God of all wisdom, goodness, and power has ordained to take these lives.\\" It was all brought about by God personally for reasons we cannot know. This is tantamount to saying God loaded the boxcars personally of those going into Hitler's ovens, or placing select individuals in the WTC when the buildings collapsed. Or, that he takes every sparrow by divine decree. He advises us as we have been advised for centuries by \\"classical\\" theologians that all evil, even gratuitous evil, is designed and brought about by God. This thinking is in the same vein of R.C. Sproul, who points out, \\"not even one molecule\\" of the universe is moved without God specifically controlling it. All human thought, since it must precede human acts and our behavior, is controlled, motivated, and directed by God, for His \\"greater\\" purposes.His explanations of verses used by open theists, starting with Abraham's example, are through the eye of the beholder. He introduces \\"relational mutability\\" which he brings into the Abraham story in Genesis 22. Ware says \\"he (God) does interact with his people in the experiences of their lives as they unfold in time.\\" God seems to get into the movie he made trillions of years ago since it is now being shown in theaters. \\"God literally sees and experiences in this moment what he has known from all eternity.\\" He argues against himself somewhat in this area as he feels open theists do in their choices of emphasis of scripture. He points out that these verses as a whole should be taken as anthropomorphic statements, but he stops and chooses God's statement of \\"for now I know that you fear God\\", as teaching us \\"in the experience of this action, I (God) am witnessing Abraham demonstrate dramatically and afresh that he fears me, and I find this both pleasing and acceptable in my sight.\\" He takes what he says is anthropomorphic language describing what goes on and pulls a whole new thought allegedly of God from the exchange of God and Abraham. All of the many other verses he covers to debunk open theology could just as easily be emphasized as open theists do. I didn't come away from any of his explanations saying--\\"Now I know.\\"He ends by stating that what gets everyone's ire up (open theists) is that they can't give up the idea there is no \\"free will\\" in the universe. He views them and their model as \\"diminishing\\" God and how human vanity or pride is swelled. God can't be diminished. One's view or take or image which has been created within their belief system of thought, can be diminished.It always amazes me that individuals (Ware is one of them) that feel that libertarian free will believers bring God \\"down\\" by believing in a world where human beings can choose, make choices, contrary to the will of God. He says in his opinion that is the main problem of \\"open\\" theists.Free will or freedom to choose is the greatest responsibility any human being has on earth. We must make choices. I believe that it doesn't reduce God, bring him down to our level, or elevate us up to his level by his granting us free will or free choice before him. It does just the exact opposite. It makes God a far more powerful God, unthreatened by us - one willing to, for His higher purpose, allow His creation to spurn him, reject him, curse him, and vilify him. God lets his creatures say no to him. Hell is, as C.S. Lewis stated, \\"locked from the inside.\\" That is a free choice, unconstrained by God, or anyone else. Phillip Yancey made a great comment in his most recent book--Prayer. He wrote that--\\"History is the story of God giving away power.\\" George Eldon Ladd wrote in his Theology of the New Testament that \\"evil is the price God paid for human freedom.\\"I still embrace after reading it concepts of the \\"open\\" model, particularly human beings having free will to choose what we do in life and all its decisions, and that God is not microscopically ruling our world. God does have a future. He can plan. He has things which he can look forward to. He is not brain dead. He interacts with us in our time zone.

This leaves many with a similar attitude that Peter had when challenged by the Lord Jesus, \\"Lord, to whom shall we go?\\" (John 6:68) Bruce Ware, in his book, \\"God's Lesser Glory,\\" does no such thing. Not only does he offer a solid refutation of the open theist position; he explains why the classical theism position is better.Many Christians are unaware of the open theist position and how it is seeping into the very fabric of what we call, \\"conservative evangelicalism.\\" They find it rather odd to hear things like, \\"God isn't sovereign,\\" or, \\"God isn't in control.\\" Sure, open theists might use such phraseology, but mean something completely different. The problem is, many Christians have already come to embrace a form of libertarian freedom that seeks to \\"get God off the hook\\" when it comes to theodicy (i.e., the \\"problem\\" of evil). They reason that because God is all-loving, He cannot be \\"responsible\\" for evil. Thus, God \\"allows\\" evil, but doesn't \\"cause\\" it. The only thing that the Christian can do without being an open theist is to still affirm God's exhaustive knowledge of future events. This keeps God in the realm of being in control. As long as God knows the future (though He didn't actually decree it), we can still attribute \\"control\\" to Him since He knows the outcome and knows what's best for His children.However slippery this slope may be for the Arminian who still affirms God's exhaustive knowledge of future events, Bruce Ware argues in such a way (for the most part) that the Arminian will be able to refute the open theist position. But why should the follower of Jesus Christ be concerned with such an argument? Because the manner in which we conduct our Christian lives are at stake. If God does not know the future, does this not have the most profound implications on how you live your life? As Bruce Ware points out, the future becomes a guessing game that depends solely on the free actions of men. God may desire and do the best he can to preserve the greatest good, but in the end we just can't know for sure what is best; not even God.Throughout much of the book, Bruce Ware spends a great deal of time explaining the open view of God. I confess to never having read a book by an open theist, but Ware explains their position in such a way that it seems the open theist spends a lot of time explaining the benefits of their position. I have no reason to doubt that the author was accurate in his portrayal of the open view, so I can say that their position was explained in detail and well documented. The two proponents that Ware seemed to focus on the most was John Sanders and Gregory Boyd.If anything can be said about this book, it would be that it is very \\"meaty.\\" That is, most of the book was devoted to lengthy exegesis of the key passages; in particular, those which are used by the open proponents to defend their view. Ware's explanation of these texts couldn't have been better. Rather than divert from the texts with responses like, \\"This text might seem to support your position, but it can't mean that because of this text over here...\\" the author faces the text head on and offers sound exegesis.One of these texts included Genesis 22:12. In this text, God says that he learns the state of Abraham's heart. If you are unaware of the open view, keep in mind that they believe that God doesn't actually know everything; he is in a constant state of learning. The author rightly points out the implications if the open position is correct. Ware argues, \\"First, if God must test Abraham to find out what is in his heart (recall that the text says, \\"for now I know that you fear God\\"), then it calls into question God's present knowledge of Abraham's inner spiritual, psychological, mental, and emotional state.\\" (p. 67) Next, Ware points out the irony in whether or not God really needed this text to prove whether Abraham fears God. \\"That is, while it is significant that the openness interpretation implicitly denies God's present knowledge (the first point), even more telling here is the implicit denial of the specific content of this present knowledge, that is, knowledge that Abraham fears God.\\" (p. 68) Thus, the author refutes the open position by their own standards.After spending more than enough pages in refuting the open position through their key texts, the author goes into the exegesis of the texts which establish God's exhaustive knowledge of the future. For those of us who have read Pink's, \\"The sovereignty of God,\\" and other standard works within Reformed theology, Ware was only stating the obvious. That is, it is difficult to imagine how one can read through Isaiah and miss the fact that God not only knows all things, but is in control of all things. Unfortunately, the open theist abandons the clear teaching of Scripture in favor of the freedom of man. This turns God into the divine reactor rather than the divine initiator.The last section of Ware's book is perhaps what I appreciated most, for he offered the benefits of the classical theistic position in light of the weaknesses of the openness position. One of these benefits that I found to be noteworthy is that of prayer. For me, this is where the rubber meets the road in refuting the so-called \\"benefits\\" within open theism. Ware rightly summarizes the issue with, \\"Your will be done,\\" rather than, \\"Your will be formed.\\"In conclusion, I cannot recommend Ware's book enough. Even if open theism is not on the rise in your area, you will find Ware's book to be a refreshing breath of fresh air as he establishes a sound case for God's sovereignty. If you are an Arminian, I would recommend this book to you as well, as you will see that the Reformed position offers the strongest refutation of the open view available."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"I was so thankful to find this book. I had some disturbing feelings about the open view and Greg Boyd. I visited Boyd's church several times, but something was not right. I also knew a couple who attended there. The wife was a HUGE Dr. Boyd follower. She ended up divorcing her husband and neither Dr. Boyd nor his church stepped in to help. His advice was similar to the advice he shares in another book about the woman named Susanne. Open theism is a very harmful belief system and Bruce Ware has the knowledge of it to be able to present it as he does in this book.It was not until I read this that I really understood why I was so inwardly bothered at Boyd's church and I understood why this wife felt there was nothing wrong with divorcing her Christian husband. The open view is actually very liberal and it is an extreme teaching of grace that pushes grace beyond the &quot;boundaries&quot; in the Bible. This made sense when I thought of this couple's divorce. She would say, &quot;Well God is going to forgive me&quot; and I know her beliefs came from Dr. Boyd's teachings on God who is truly a &quot;lesser&quot; God because Boyd's God does not require obedience.Ware presents this philosophy clearly although some of it was hard for me to follow because I am not familiar with philosophy and various beliefs (like Armenism). I hope he will write another book on the open view and I would encourage this for all Christians to read so that they are not deceived by the open view's teachings. I do hope though that all future books like this will be more in layman terminology because for those unfamiliar with many of the terms, it can be hard to read."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"This is the second book I noticed on the subject of Open Theism. The previous one was by an author who was Calvinist, and claimed that the error of Open Theism was the natural result of Arminianism (i.e. anything short of five point Calvinism). While a Calvinist, Ware is much more balanced, and realizes that while you would never have an Open Theist who's a Calvinist, Open Theism is not a result of Arminian thinking in all or even most cases.One thing this book helped teach is the difference between compatablist free will and libertarian free will. A libertarian free will person would say I can go to the cafeteria and have a choice between chicken parmesan, turkey and dressing, or liver and onions. A compatablist will say I do not have free will to get the liver and onions because I don't like liver and onions. Thus, taking this simplistic example a little further, God does not have to worry about protecting me from food poisoning if the liver and onions is contaminated because I would never eat it.This book does a good job at showing the weaknesses of the open theism point of view. One reviewer seemed critical that the author assumes the classical view. My experience is that those who reject the classical view not because of evidence but out of preference, because they don't like the implications of the classical view.This book is well outlined, and addresses that open theism not only had problems on the theological level but the practical levels of prayer, guidance, and suffering."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"I am generally not inclined to write a review or a letter to the editor or other things of that nature but occasionally I run across material that is so troubling to me that I must respond. Ware's book is just such material.I have been following the developments of this debate pretty closely and am intrigued by the Open Theism position. However, I have been looking for a solid counter argument against which to weigh the claims. Ware's work was recommended to me as just such a work. While the person recommending the book did not believe the arguments to be devastating he did believe Ware had read and wrestled with the material. I was sorely disappointed. For all of the weight that he places on the signifcance of the debate there is an appaling lack of sophistication in his treatment. This book would serve well in logic class as a lesson in the effective use of logical fallacy that places the book well into the category of style over substance. Ware does not engage the material but simply regurgitates standard arguments that often beg the question and he repeatedly equivocates as he conveniently redefines terms and even other characteristics of God as they serve his system of thought (e.g. pg.164 note 2)concerning the nature of God.As one who is not yet convinced in the debate this work served little in helping even to clarify the issues involved. The book however, was well written in a persuasive style that will certainly move the less engaged reader who is looking only to be affirmed in a previously held position or who is unfamiliar with the Open position. Ironically, it is this strength among its many failings that poses the greatest danger."},{"Title":"God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism","review":"Bruce Ware has been one of the more prominent evangelicals leading the charge against open theism in evangelical circles. He was one of the key speakers at the most recent meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society which ultimately voted better than 2 to 1 to reject open theism's proposal of a God of limited omniscience. This book is Ware's written attempt to discredit the theology, philosophy, and claims of open theism. For the most part, I think he succeeds.For everything that is taken up in this book, Ware's analysis is devastating to open theism. Ware effectively cuts through much of the sweet talk that's popular in open theism and methodically exposes the many negative ramifications of the openness view in terms of theology and daily Christian living. Ware's critique is very good in taking somewhat complex theological and philosophical material and making it accessible to lay people without watering down the concepts. He also does a good job of quoting extensively from a number of prominent open theism apologists, particularly Greg Boyd. In my view, after reading this book, it would be highly difficult for someone to try and suggest that Ware was erecting a strawman and arguing against that, rather than fairly discrediting the actual premises of open theism as articulated by its leaders.I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought that Ware's analysis, while outstanding in the areas that are covered, could have been more exhaustive. To me, among the most problematic ramifications of open theism is the reality that open theism, by definition, must acknowledge at the very minimum the possibility of biblical errancy and fallibility. In my view, one cannot consistently be an open theist as well as a believer in biblical inerrancy, since a great deal of the prophetic material written in the Bible requires the exact kind of divine foreknowledge of the future that open theists say God doesn't possess. At the very least, open theism has to acknowledge that their view requires, for example, that the entire book of Revelation MIGHT prove to be wrong, since by their own view, the prophetic proclamations only represent God's best guesses of what might happen, rather than being part of a divine blueprint that's already in place. In addition, the other major theological problem with open theism is that it requires a fundamental redefining of the substitutionary atonement of Christ's death on the cross. If God doesn't know the future, that means that God could not know with absolute certainty that Christ's death would accomplish anything, since it is conceivable that nobody could have responded to it and believed. This raises huge problems both about the character of God (what are we to think of a God who willingly allows His only Son to be brutally sacrificed if He didn't know for sure that anything good would come from it), as well as what Christ's death on the cross is supposed to represent.Ware has verbally expounded on these critical points in various speeches and lectures, but neither issue is discussed in this book. Because I believe these issues represent monumental theological deficiencies in the openness view, a book worthy of 5 stars would have comprehensively explored these issues. Because Ware does not, I am compelled to give the book 4 stars instead because of its non-comprehensive critique.But having said that, I strongly stress that what Ware DOES cover in this book is outstanding and represents a very able and formidable refutation of open theism and its implications on the faith overall, as well as individual believers. He effectively shows that open theism is purely a human concoction that requires repeated caveats in order to cover up its rather obvious shortcomings - caveats which are actually in contradiction with the stated principles of open theism. Similar to Geisler's refutation of 'neotheism' in another book, Ware effectively shows not only that open theism is an internally inconsistent mess as a matter of scholarship, but also that open theism cannot deliver on many of the rosy promises it makes to undiscerning Christians who are intrigued by this redefinition of God. Ever since this book came out, Boyd and company have been playing defense, and it is clear why this is."},{"Title":"The anti-Zionist complex","review":"Despite this book having been written 25 years ago , it is still relevant today.Jacques Givet was a holocaust survivor , whose entire family perished in Hitler's flames.In this book he strips bare the revolting and frightening phenomenon of anti-Zionism , the anti-Semitism of today.Givet exposes anti-Zionism as the psychological malaise which it is.He also deals with hatred of Israel and Zionism coming from Jews in the diaspora ( I am extremely disgusted by Jewish anti-zionists) : \\" That there should be Jews to challenge the existance of Israel and indulge in lengthy public self-questioning on this theme reperesents warped thinking , a breach of faith and a human tragedy. And this is a unique phenomenon. No Cambodian , Chilean , Czech (and now Afghan) exile , however bitterly opposed to his current government , denies his country's right to exist\\".Givet does not set out to examine all the cogs in the machine of anti-Zionism but rather limits himself to considering certain ways of thought , certain patterns of twisted thinking , which tend to pass unnoticed , in the field of international public relations , in the media and in academia.He comments on how anti-Zionists tend to believe that Jews are not strongly attached to the Land of Israel, \\"Palestine\\". He explores some of the figures covered by historian Salo W. Baron , which demonstrate the permanence of the Jewish presence in \\"Palestine\\". In the first century CE there where about three million Jews in \\"Palestine\\" and in the seventh century , two hundred thousand.The Jews in \\"Palestine\\" where in almost perpetual revolt. After Masada (72 C.E) , Bar Kochba's revolt (132-135 C.E) , and the insurrection which threatened Emperor Septimus Severus early in the Third Century , there was an insurrection in Galilee in the fourth century , and in the seventh a new Jewish war lasting fourteen years (614 to 628), brought to an end by Emperor Heraclius.These facts and figures deserve mention because they weaken the case of nthe anti-Zionists (read anti-Semites) to deny Israel the right to a national existance.Indeed Givet refers to history to lay bare the facts obscured by the anti-Zionist disease.Israel recognized an Arab \\"Palestine\\" from when the State of Israel was re-established in 1948. While in accordance with a United Nations decision , Israel was ratifying the creation of an Arab State in \\"Palestine\\" , Arab armies occupied Arab \\"Palestine\\" and launched an attack on that part of it that had been reserved for Jews. Far from granting any autonomy to those now known as \\"Palestinians\\"(the term was only used from the 1960's to refer to Arabs from this area) , not one member ofArab League recognized a seperate Arab \\"Palestine\\" before the Six Day War of 1967.The PLO etc has always trimmed it's sails to suit the wind. In the past their emphasis was on linking \\"Palestine\\" with Jordan , Jordan and Lebanon , or Syria and Lebanon.Quoted is Zuheir Mossein , head of the PLO bureau of Military Operations , in the Dutch newspaper Trouw in 1977:\\"There is no difference between Jordanians , Palestinians and Lebanese ; we are all members of a single nation. soley for political reasons are we careful to stress our identity as Palestinians , since a seperate State of Palestine would be an extra weapon in Arab hands to fight Zionism with. Yes , we do call for the creation of a Palestinian State for tactical reasons. Such a State would be a new means of continuing the battle against Zionism and for Arab unity\\".The author expresses surprise that left-wing writers should show no understanding of the fact that one of the purposes of anti-Zionism is to divert any attention away from opression and momentum for change in the Arab/Islamic world.Givet questions how atrocities commited in the name of a 'Free Palestine\\" , no matter how heinous , such as those commited against women and children , are treated with understanding and justified in advance whenever Israel , goaded beyong endurance , by some outrage , resorts to a legitimate act of self-defence.As the author points out anti-Zionism is anti-semitism because the anti-Zionist denies , of all people , only the Jews the right to nationhood.'The anti-Zionist becomes an anti-Semite as soon as he goes beyond criticism of the policies of the Jerusalem government ( a favourite activity of the Israelis themselves) and challenges the very existance of the State of Israel.For to refuse the Jews their right to nationhood is the perpetuate their bondage. to \\"de-Zionize'\\"Israel would be like trying to de-Helvetize Switzerland. The fact that Israel has an Arab minority is shocking only to those for whom the idea of a Jewish majority in any country is intolerable\\".Givet deals with the leftist patrons of the Palestinians and the prejudiced United Nations , who are repsonsible to a large extent for terror against Israeli women and children.'Dub a Jew a \\"Zionist\\" and any crime can be commited against him with the clearest of consciences'. Hence Arab massacres of Jewish old people , women and children is judged as acceptable by the anti-Zionists , as the victims are dubbed 'Zionists'.It is entirely keeping in the character of Islamists or rabidly leftist anti-Zionists that they should carry a rabid hatred of Israel to the point of defending the killers of Israeli children.Givet refers to the massacres of Israeli children at Ma'alot and Kiryat Shmona in 1974 , by the Marxist Popular Front for the LIberation of Palestine. Recent years have seen the murders of hundreds of Israeli children by Arab terrorists.The author points out to how prejudiced and unfair condemmnation of Israel in the United Nations has led to deeds: 'For moral denigration encourages physical elimination ; a few days after the adoption of the resolution of 10 November , 1975 , challenging the very existance of Israel , a bomb killed six young people (all of them refugees from Arab countries) in Jerusalem. The PLO forthwith claimed the credit for this feat , and justifying it by reference to the United Nations resolution , described it as \\"heroic\\" 'In more recent years , Irish poet Tom Paulin explicitly called for the killing of Jewish civillians in Israel .In an interview with the Egyptian paper, Al-Ahram Weekly Paulin claimed that Jewish settlers in Israel \\"should be shot dead\\". In an interview . Paulin, a leading anti-Zionist, called Brooklyn-born Jewish settlers \\"Nazis and racists\\", and insisted: \\"I feel nothing but hatred for them.\\"A few days later , a five year old Jewish girl , Danielle Shefi , was shot dead in the Jewish village of Adura, by Arab terrorists , as she cowered under her bed. They also shot her 2 year old baby brother. Journalists on the far left website indymedia openly gloated over and celebrated this murder.In 2002 leftist anti-Zionist journalist , Richard Calland , wrote in South Africa's far left Mail&Guardian; that he \\"quietly celebrates Israeli casualties\\".Charlotte Kates , a law lecturer at Rutger University in New Jersey and an 'activist' of the pro-terror 'International Solidarity Movement' has endorsed the killing of Israeli children by Arab terrorists , calling Israeli children 'fair game'.The same way , that the demonization of Jews by Hitler Goebbels and Der Sterner laid the way for the holocaust , I believe that the purpose of anti-Zionist propaganda is to pave the way for the genocide of Israel Jews , which would be justified , in the eyes of some Islamists and Leftists , as they are dubbed \\"Zionists\\".Givet also refers to how the rights and lives of genuinely opressed people like the Kurds , Black South Sudanese , Tibetans , Naga , Karens etc are pushed aside in favour of the 'Palestinian' agenda.As Givet puts it so eloquently:\\"...Anti-Zionists, like traditional anti-Semites, see only the reverse side of the coin in Jewish history - the reaction not the act, the accident not the cause, the wastage not the process of creation. In this they display a lack of human understanding and also an inability to think dialectically - shortcomings from which they are the first to suffer. The way in which, to salve their consciences and in the interest of their policies, they picture the Jew as a sordid, guilty \\"Zionist\\" freezes their ability to think and feel. The freedom to exist which they refuse me prevents them from seeing the world as it is. Their reasoning is infantile, their information inadequate, their scale of values absurd in that one Palestinian equals 1,000 Kurds or 10,000 Balts or Armenians - and how many Nagas or Tibetans? (A scale in which an Afghan, incidentally, counts for nothing.) The anti-Zionist is not interested in the sufferings of these other peoples and takes no trouble to find out about them, or about many others in revolt against the imperialisms he is all too ready to praise. The free Jew, the Israeli, he is completely unable to understand\\""},{"Title":"The anti-Zionist complex","review":"This book was written twenty-five years ago but it is not out of date.The author reminds us that the concept of having a Jewish state that can serve as a refuge for Jews has a sensible basis. In the past 2000 years, there have been about 200 expulsions of Jews from nations: about one every ten years. He then goes on to quote a number of antizionists whose idea is simple: we outnumber the Jews, so we ought to get everything and they ought to get nothing!The next topic is the false symmetry of Israel and its attackers and between \\"attempts to destroy a community and the reprisals that the community must resort to in self-defence.\\" Givet goes on to explain the arbitrariness of having Arab refugees cooped up in UN camps for decades while millions of refugees everywhere else in the world generally get resettled in a matter of a few weeks.The author explains that an antisemitic government \\"discredits itself in all its doings.\\" And he tells Jews that \\"only by working for their own national liberation will they join the mainstream of the forces now working for greater freedom in society at large.\\"Meanwhile for antizionists, the Arabs are the heroes, not because any of them care for Arabs per se but because \\"the Arabs deny (and are encouraged by the anti-Zionists to deny) the human and political rights to which the Jews aspire.\\"I was amazed by the extent to which Middle Eastern Christians condemn Jewish nationalism outright. All too typical is a quote the author finds of the Director of the \\"Journal for the Study of International Relations\\" who explains that Jerusalem is an Arab city of which its legitimate sovereign has been despoiled. This Director goes on to say that \\"in fact, Jerusalem, a Holy City, is also, and above all, an Arab town. A Holy Place in which the spirit walks, it does not exist remote from the contingencies of time and space. It is a city of men and women.\\"I've never forgotten the implication that Jerusalem, the Jewish capital which has had a Jewish majority since the 1870s, is an Arab town! Nor that Jews are not men and women but something else entirely. I wonder if Pagans are men and women?Well, is there anything wrong with saying, as Maxime Rodinson does, that the Arabs \\"could do no other than dream of destroying the state of Israel?\\" You bet there is! Givet explains that such a statement is anti-scientific, pessimistic, anti-dialectical, arbitrary, retrograde, debasing (to Arabs), and irresponsible. In addition, it reveals a static outlook, is opposed to progress, and shows a lack of discrimination and contempt for facts. And, of course, it is an unreasonable generalization: not all Arabs are the same!Givet is at his best when he comes up with the start of a glossary used by antizionists. These words (such as aggression, colonialism, jus soli, land, refugees, resistance, settlement, and territories) are always used to mock Jews and give unjustified praise to antizionists.This is an excellent little book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"How to Make It in Musicals: The Insider's Guide to a Career as a Singer-Dancer","review":"There is a lot of decent information in How to Make it in Musicals, but most of it is aimed at children who are interested in being performers when they're older.

This recording is a wonderful introduction to her art, her thought and her personality; and it is a gift to have the poems read by the poet. In addition to reading many of her poems, Nikki also offers many fascinating and occassionally extensive background remarks about particular poems, reflecting on events and people of the Civil Rights Movement and upon life, as only a poet of her stature can.

Now traveling with their rescuers , the Millennium Falcon along with its crew and passengers makes its way to a destination, a planet named Necropolis (meaning: City of the Dead. Catchy, huh?).During the flight, while sleeping in one of the Falcon's compartments with his sister, Zak has an awful dream about his deceased parents. You see, Zak and Tash were from Alderaan, and while Zak and his sister were on a vacation off of the plane, by the time they got back, they had already heard of the destruction of their planet, but more than that, the deaths of all of their loved ones. Since all their relatives were now dead, Uncle Hoole, who is a Shi'ido or shape-changer and who was only related to them through the marriage of his brother into their family, took them under his guardianship. They had been with him and Deevee ever since.So Zak dreamed, and in his dream he was back in his bed on Alderaan with nothing that seemed out of shape. Surprised, he got out of bed and looked out the window. He then noticed that he wasn't in Alderaan but in space, watching the stars in the distance. Though he could hardly believe it, he continued staring out. As Zak continued to stare out the window, two objects were floating toward him. At first Zak couldn't make out what they were, but as he continued to stare he knew with out a doubt that they were his parents...and they were dead. As his parents drew closer, Zak backed away from the window. His parents, in their deathly gray color, started to beat on the window with their shriveled hands and mouthing words with their lips, even though no sounds came out. Zak knew what they were saying though, and the meaning hit him to the core: \\"Why did you leave us, Zak?\\"Zak awoke, screaming and crying, startling his sister out of her sleep. Tash asked what was wrong, and Zak told her. Even though Tash tried to comfort her brother and gently ease in that their parents were gone -forever, Zak still had his doubts. When Zak, Tash, Uncle Hoole, and Deevee arrived on the planet, they thanked and said goodbye to their rescuers, then continued on their way. With in a very short time of being on the planet, Zak is told by a local about a curse and an ancient witch, who if one were to ask her at her tomb to raise a dead person to life, it would happen. A deep desire burned in Zak as he thought and earnestly questioned if the dead can come back.He had to find out.This book like the first one, Eaten Alive, is a page-turner, but, unlike the first one, this one wasn't balanced as well. The writing was good and had humor in it. The characters and their emotions, though, suffered a little. While some had adequate background, some seemed a little shallow, and the emotions of the characters likewise sometimes seemed a little superficial. Added on to this, the story drags a little. This not to say that it wasn't a good book, but it is just that it wasn't quite as good a book, in my opinion, as Eaten Alive.If you are a fan of Star Wars and would like a relatively quick read with some frills, this might be your book. As is my stance on most books, I'll suggest it here too: if you can, unless you really want to buy this book, I suggest that you take it out of your local library first, before you purchase it.This marks the point of no return -or the end of this review, anyway.-Jake SmithersP.S.: The one thing that comes to all people, if you haven't guessed it already, is death."},{"Title":"City of the Dead (Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear #2)","review":"Zac and Tash are on their home planet, but they had to leav quickley because the planet was going to be blown up by the death star, a weapen created by the empire.

There is a mysterious quality to the book, and always the feeling that something this magical might happen to any child at the right time in the right place. This is one of the stories I most strongly remember falling in love with as a child-- some 30 years later, it still sticks with me."},{"Title":"The Court of the Stone Children (A full length play by Mark Bucci based on the book by Eleanor Cameron)","review":"This is one of the best children's books I have ever read. It has an intriguing plot and marvelous atmosphere. Above all, it has believable characters that are easy to identify with. The main character, Nina, is struggling to adjust to her family's move from the country to the city, and this struggle leads to her meeting with other, memorable characters involved in struggles of their own. The ghost story and the struggles with the nature of time add wonderfully to make the book a unique, timeless read"},{"Title":"The Court of the Stone Children (A full length play by Mark Bucci based on the book by Eleanor Cameron)","review":"I first read this book 20 years ago as a young girl, and I loved it so much I kept it for years and read it over and over again. It made me love museums and antiques and anything from yesteryear. To this day, I can't help wondering about the history of any beautiful old things I come across and secretly hoping for a little enchantment to envelope me when I touch them.

It will give you an imagination if you don't have one, and if you do have one, it'll fire it up all the more. I love it. I still pull it out and read it on occassion, usually in one sitting.

It made me have a feeling of nostalgia--- even though I have not, (and probably never will have) this experience: It made me long for the the timeless feeling of not being busy with endless plans and appointments. It is descriptive; it paints a beuatiful picture for the reader (but then again, that seems to be the character of Nina: Aware of her surroundings). The characters were very real, and one is able to visit each in turn and deeply empathize with them. I would say that the plot builds admirably, though to me at times it seemed a little slow (but maybe that't just me?). However, that is the style of the book; timeless, mysterious, and discriptive. Some things seemed slightly unexplained, however, when I reached the ending...I would conclude that this book would appeal to people who see disdinguishments in characters; a book for people who enjoy life, and who see and experience its many beauties. A good book? Yes, very much so!"},{"Title":"The Court of the Stone Children (A full length play by Mark Bucci based on the book by Eleanor Cameron)","review":"I wish I could give this 4 and a half stars, because I rarely give out 5 stars. I recently reread this book after 25 years and I still love it. Eleanor Cameron understands how kids see the world: part magic, part mystery and sometimes just plain hard to live in. I recommend her Julia Redfern books, especially &quot;A Room Made of Windows.&quot;For adults interested in children's literature and writing, I strongly recommend her collection of essays &quot;The Green and Burning Tree, On the Writing and Enjoyment of Children's Books&quot;.

If anyone is considering purchasing this book for class, you should look up the google ebook which is free, complete and free of blurred print. Or just purchase a version from a better publisher."},{"Title":"My name is Aram","review":"I reached for this book because I was thinking about stories that I had loved in my junior high years, and I remembered some of Saroyan's stories about a boy growing up in a rural area during World War II. I don't think the author's reputation has really grown much in recent years - up until the 1970s or 80s he was part of the cohort of great American 20th century writers, and I am not sure he is in that category any more - but he is a very interesting writer. His stories are a little odd, yet deeply American and very human. He writes a fair bit about what seem like fairly minor, ambiguous incidents in his characters' lives.This book of short stories is based on his memories of growing up near Fresno, Cal. between 1915 and 1925. His family was Armenian, and they were farming people. These are well-written and charming little yarns, which have the ability to appeal to both younger and older readers. \\"The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse\\" is the best, and I used it in a class I was teaching. It tells the story of two cousins, one around 10 and the other around 13. The older boy has stolen a white horse which they ride around at night so that no one can see them. Eventually they are caught, and give the horse back to its rightful owner. In another one I liked, a few boys go for a long hike and a swim in a river. On the way back they meet an eccentric shopkeeper with a Yale education. It describes a kind of adventure which is mostly gone from the American landscape today. In a funny piece, one boy keeps getting sent to the principal's office, where the principal half-heartedly flogs him, and the boy somehow gets in between a possible budding romance between the principal and a teacher. In a sweet yet slightly disturbing tale, an Indian who apparently has come into some money hires a boy to drive him around town and show him where the good fishing is.Not all of these were good for today's students - in fact only a couple would be. But I enjoyed reading them, and I look forward to someday dipping into some of Saroyan's more adult works."},{"Title":"My name is Aram","review":"Arrived Quickly and in the Condition Promised.

I immediately was intrigued by Saroyan's method of writing and the fact that his novels are autobiographical. This is a story of Aram Garoghlanian, a boy living in Fresno with his large family of Armenian immigrants. Throughout the book, such ideas are touched upon as maturity, honesty, and acceptance. My Name is Aram is a portrait not only of Aram Garoghlanian and William Saroyan himself, but Americans in general. Americans struggle with basic values and ideas everyday, and accepting our eccentric family members is something we learn to do. Saroyan describes small details in hi writing that bring the story to life and open up a new world. Readers will soon realize when they open this novel that each of us holds Aram inside us, whether it means we struggle with the idea of stealing a horse or keeping the families reputation. I strongly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"My name is Aram","review":"The book is composed of different events that happened in the author's life. It is the life of an Armenian immigrant family in the beautiful San Juaquin Valley. Although, the story is about events that are happening in a particular Armenian family, in reality it is the life all immigrants in America. The stories some how effects all Americans. I am positive that some where in our lifetime we were criticized for a certain cultural trait. It is the story of the ultimate underdog who is determined to succeed. At the same time it is a very fun and easy book to read. I could not put the book down.Saroyan has to be the best writer to come out of the West. He should have been recognized more for his genius work."},{"Title":"My name is Aram","review":"This is a nice small book of short stories which offers a pleasing weekend or evening read.

It describes Aram's adventures during his early teenage years and events happening in his great and proud tribe of Garoghlanians.Book is base on episodes of the author's childhood, and the characters of Aram's tribe are based on real individuals, Saroyan's relatives. The book is sensitive and pleasant, and each of the 14 chapters, is written as a separate short-story."},{"Title":"My name is Aram","review":"William Saroyan who is also the author of the famous song, made immortal by Rosemary Clooney, \\"Come On A My House\\" wrote these great tales. He and a nephew, Ross Bagdasarian (David Seville) wrote the song in their enthusiasm while on a road trip to visit an Aunt somewhere out west. Rosey Clooney added her seductive slant to the song in 1951 and we got the famous million seller.I read this book for the first time over forty years ago. I loved it and never forgot many of the stories.As I held the book in my hand to write this review, I began relating some of the tales in it to my wife. Then I sat down and read the book again to see how good my memory was. My memory was pretty good ... but not as good as the book.This book was one among many books of short stories that have served to inspire my own writing. Until re-reading this book, I did not realize how much of this book and this writer I had incorporated into myself.These are all true to life tales of childhood (granting poetic license) and growing up on the West Coast, in Fresno, California way back when. The stories are about mom, dad, grandpa, and uncle Khosrove and the author's unique immigrant heritage.I grew up decades later on the East Coast in an old industrial mill town - nothing like the rural settings in this book. But other than replacing a \\"borrowed\\" car with a stolen pony, the humor and the sentiments are all universal. Today as I review this book, the movie \\"My Big, Fat Greek Wedding\\" comes to mind. The immigrant nature, the humorous relatives, the contrasting values and the crazy antics and situations brought together by life in the new country are common to the book and the movie.Two of the stories that I never forgot are \\"The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse\\" and \\"Old Country Advice to the American Traveler.\\"\\"A Nice Old-Fashioned Romance\\" isn't bad either. The only thing bad about this book is maybe you haven't read it yet.The writing is cleaver, entertaining, humorous and spun through with simple wisdom. In this modern copy I have, I have noticed that the punctuation is rather radical. There are no quotation marks used. Rather strange but easily readable nonetheless. I didn't notice that 50 years ago when I read this book the first time. But there are many things quite evident today that I didn't notice 50 years ago.Not many people write books like this these days. Writing has become too sophisticated. There are no monsters from outer space, no demons, no devils, no spirits or ghosts. There are no serial killers, perverts or criminal insanity. Nobody eats any children in this book. No one flies on a broomstick in this book. There are no spells or even \\"little people.\\" I suppose the younger crowd would find it boring.I have always loved it ... and still do.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Just Hangin' Out, Ma,\\" Humorous Anectdotes"},{"Title":"My name is Aram","review":"\\"My Name Is Aram\\" is a collection of short stories set in Fresno, California in the early 20th century featuring a boy named Aram and his extended Armenian family. The stories are essentially in chronological order and include recurring characters, but the book isn't truly a novel, as all the stories are self-contained and could really be read in any order.Most of the stories in \\"My Name Is Aram\\" are superbly written gems of short fiction. The first, \\"The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse,\\" has frequently been anthologized and with good reason: it is an expertly crafted short story, with a childlike sense of wonder and some unforgettable characters (such as the easily irritated Uncle Khosrove, who reacts to EVERYTHING by shouting \\"It is no harm! Pay no attention to it!\\"). Another favorite is the offbeat \\"Locomotive 38, the Ojibway,\\" about a wealthy, eccentric Native American who wanders into Aram's town. These are two stories that everyone should read at least once. I also particularly enjoyed \\"The Circus\\" (Aram can't resist skipping school whenever the circus comes to town), \\"The Pomegranate Trees\\" (about an attempt by Aram's uncle to grow a field of pomegranate trees in harsh desert land), and \\"The Three Swimmers and the Grocer from Yale\\" (on the way home from a swim, Aram and two other boys encounter a very strange grocer). A couple of the other stories have a somewhat sad or serious tone, which helps balance the book as a whole.Many of these stories reminded me of the works of Jean (\\"A Christmas Story\\") Shepherd. Aram is often getting into minor trouble and clashing with the authority figures at school, but even when they're punishing him, most of the adults realize he's just being a kid. A common theme in this book is the conflict between people who are artistic (or \\"poets\\") by nature and those who consider such pursuits to be foolish. William Saroyan clearly sympathizes with these \\"poets,\\" who he admits may not always be practical, but who nonetheless make the world a much more colorful, interesting place.Originally published in 1940, \\"My Name Is Aram\\" is a timeless classic that everyone should read. If you've never read any of Saroyan's short stories, you're in for a treat!"},{"Title":"My name is Aram","review":"This is Saroyan's collections of short stories from his youth in the early 1900's.

Stanley Liu November 2003"},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"Although there are more and more chartered and public schools using Montessori methods of teaching, most Montessori schools are private enterprises and must charge considerable tuition in order to stay open. If you are in favor of Montessori methods but are not able to send your child to a Montessori school, this is the book for you.The author of this book gives a brief history of Maria Montessori and how she discovered how children learn. It then goes on to describe the methods used, and gives detailed instructions for all the exercises and demonstrations which are used with preschool-aged children.The author also gives instructions for making many of the Montessori materials at home, with common household items or easy-to-obtain craft supplies. Throughout the book she offers many alternative suggestions for the materials which are typically used in a Montessori classroom. For instance, she mentions that a muffin tin can be used very effectively to sort buttons, and that a handtowel may be used for the workmat.Although this book was orginally written in the 1960's, most of the information is still useful today. The cover mentions that it has been updated and revised, but it is not clear what information has been changed in this edition. Still, overall this book is a wonderful resource for frugal parents who are able to teach their children at home, and who want to use Montessori methods to do so."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I became interested in the Montessori method while researching different educational styles in order to prepare for what my family's options would be once our twin toddlers reach preschool age. After doing research on the internet, attending an open house at a Montessori preschool in our area, and reading &quot;The Discovery of the Child&quot; by Dr. Maria Montessori, I felt that I needed to find a book that I could use as a guide and would serve as a frame of reference for beginning to do activities with my children that are based on the Montessori approach. This book not only served as an excellent reference guide to how to use the Montessori method at home with your children, but it is well written, easy to follow, and well organized. I particularly like how each activity includes clear directions on how to carry out the activity, the materials needed for the activity, the purpose of the activity, and the learning objective for the activity. I also like how the author included a section on how to make a &quot;prepared environment&quot; for learning in your home, being that the &quot;prepared environment&quot; is one of the, if not the most, critical aspects of a Montessori education. This book is really helpful for someone like me who wants establish an early educational foundation for my children at home and see what suits their needs and personalities before the time comes for my husband and I to decide what will be the educational setting for our children's preschool and kindergarten years."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"My mother was an educator who spent the first nine years of my life staying home with my sisters and me. My parents could not afford to send me to Montessori School. Instead, my mother constructed many of the materials described in the book and used them with me. Because of her efforts, I was reading phonetically at 4 in addition to being well prepared for 1st grade math. I remember fondly the time when we spent together with &quot;school&quot; and do not remember any insecurity or feelings of being pushed. I feel I have benefited from a lifetime a learning and self-confidence that has aided me in many of my endeavors.When I became pregnant with twins, my mother purchased the new addition of this book for me. I work full time, but still have found time to make the materials in the book (they are very easy!). I enjoy spending time on the exercises with my girls, who are now two and a half . They also look forward to when he have &quot;school&quot;.As an introduction to the world of Montessori; this book has been an eye-opener to me. This book has shown me the beauty of the Montessori Method itself, so much so that my husband and I are considering placing our girls in a Montessori school when they get a little older.I did find the index of toys and materials outdated, as hinted at by the below critic. Some of these toys are no longer manufactured. I find it sad, however, that the below critic finds teaching manners such as cleaning up after yourself outdated. My girls, at two and a half, enjoy watching me and my husband in the kitchen, helping us clean with their child-size brooms and mops, dusting, etc. I want my children to understand that they are a contributor to their own environment, and not to expect such things to be taken care of by maids or parents.I recommend this book to you as I have to many parents of pre-school children."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I was completely ignorant about the Montessori method when I bought this book. My son is almost 3 and as I had become tired of playing with cars and trucks and saying &quot;no&quot; all the time. I was looking for a more engaged kind of play-with-learning that we could do at home.This book is fantastic - outlining many activities and giving a taste of the Montessori approach that will let you decide whether you want to know more (I did!). Many Montessori programs are expensive but this book equips you to do the activities with home made equipment. It also inspires parents to teach their children about everyday activities in a more formal way - eg. my son loved the 'lesson' on how to open and close a drawer properly.

A good portion of the book is telling you about Maria Montessori and her life/her teaching. You can find that on the internet. Towards the end of the (very thin) book, there are simple ideas to do with your pre-schooler. Again, you can find it all on the internet and much more."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I became interested in this method of schooling the first time I ever read about it. I had yanked my four year old son from his preschool program because he had gone from a normal happy preschooler to a biting, kicking, swearing little monster. He also has a speech delay, which did not help matters at all because we could not understand what he was talking about when he tried to tell us what was happening during his day.His father and I decided to homeschool him until he's six, upon which time we will enroll him with the local charter school. So I started researching different methods and the first time I saw this I fell in love. But my heart sank when I saw just how expensive the equipment is. I was also dissapointed when I discovered that we have a local Montessori school only to find out it cost more than we make in a month. My husband is a full time student on a very low, limited income. I could not in good concious sanction spending that kind of money. So I read everything, online and books, that I could get my hands on. And while all I read talked of the different methods, it never said how to implement them.I saw this at Paperback Swap (awesome site) and snagged it on impulse. I am so glad that I did. It gave me everything I needed to get a start. It helped me understand the resources I already had and told me how to pull them together in a cohesive whole. I have four children ranging from 8 months - 4.5 years. The three oldest think it's great and they are so proud of themselves every day. Even my husband got in on it and helped me construct several items. We both love this book and I reccomend it to everyone that talks about teaching Montessori.I also reccomend Seven Times the Sun: Guiding Your Child Through the Rhythms of the Day by Shea Darian"},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"A few months ago I decided to implement a Montessori curriculum at home for my almost 3 year old. I am a certified K-8 teacher, so I had some familiarity with the Montessori method. I've decided to purchase a Montessori curriculum to follow (do an Internet search for \\"Montessori curriculum\\" and you will find quite a few), since I don't feel I have enough of the experience and knowledge to create my own. This was one of the first books I bought, in an effort to become familiar with the method. It's much shorter than I thought, however it is full of very valuable information.The introduction to the book provides a short overview of the method and its success, but if you are looking for an in depth coverage of the Montessori method, look elsewhere. I purchased this along with \\"Montessori in the Classroom,\\" \\"The Essential Montessori,\\" and \\"The Montessori Method.\\" Instead of looking at this book as the \\"be all, end all\\" book, I saw it more as a piece of the foundation that I was trying to create.Many of the materials mentioned in the book are no longer available, but a quick internet search can usually turn up what you are looking for. Some of the activities seemed like common sense to me (learning to push in a chair, washing your hands, etc.), but for someone completely new to the method they make sense. As adults, it's often easy for us to forget that many of these daily activities don't come naturally. It was a good reminder that we can't have high expectations for these routines, unless we specifically teach them.The one thing that I felt was lacking was the method for presenting the materials. Luckily, I was able to find a more in depth description in other books (see above). She lists a few short steps (usually about 3-5) for introducing the materials, but she doesn't make it as explicit as I would have liked. There also aren't many extension activities listed. Generally, there is one (sometimes two) activties listed for each material. I would have like to see more variations and extensions. I do like how she lists the control of error for each material. It became very clear to me that all of the Montessori materials allow students to be self taught. It becomes very evident when they've made a mistakes, so children are more likely to self correct without teacher intervention.This is definitely a great supplement to a beginning Montessori library. I can see myself using this quite a bit as we begin the school year, but as we become familiar with the method, I see myself passing it along to someone else. It's definitely a good starting point for teaching Montessori in the home, but the material is quickly mastered."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"This book is a short, simple, practical guide to doing Montessori-inspired activities at home with your kids. There are several dozen examples of Montessori learning activities, each 2-3 pages long, with instructions on how to gather or make what's needed -- it could be as simple as finding colored buttons for sorting into an egg crate, pouring rice or sand between cups in a tray, or making salt clay with flour, salt, and water. Sure, they sound simple, but this kind of play teaches kids about cause and effect and stimulates the senses without needing battery-powered blinking lights and beeping sounds.The activities are simple and give even the youngest kids opportunities for open-ended play while keeping an older kid's attention. As an example, I made the salt clay for my two year old and five year old and gave them plastic placemats and some cookie cutters, and they had fun for an hour making and naming what they made.

If not, it is quite difficult to implement many of the ideas in this book. There were some ideas I liked and was able to try them successfully at home. For example: my 3yr old daughter liked the 'walking on a line' exercise. We would make different letters and she would have fun trying to balance while walking over the lines. It became a challenge for her and she;d want to practice it often. We also tried some variations of the 'blind-fold and weigh tablets' exercise. We turned it into blindfolding and trying different textures and guessing what I had placed in front of her. There are a few more exercises I have tried and probably a few more I can try but more than half the book is not going to be that useful to me. Still a decent book for the price I got it at."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I purchased this book since I will home school my grandson this coming winter session.

Great book perfect for Pre-school or even before. Very happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I love this book. Hainstock does a great job at presenting Montessori in a very approachable manner. She makes it easy, especially for mothers who are new to Montessori and need a little help with making materials."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"The book was somewhat informative and helpful but I felt several of the exercises were things my toddler and I already do.

I found it to be very out-dated (50's &amp; 60's photo/graphics of children) and (many remarks about etiquette &amp; being graceful). Granted I want my children to be well mannered, but this reads like something from &quot;leave it to beaver&quot; Some good tips of things to do with your pre-schoolers, but nothing out of the ordinary that one wouldn't think to do of on their own, or read about in a parenting magazine."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"As a parent and teacher I would highly recommend this book to parents looking for information about the Montessori method. I currently teach at a Montessori school and this is one of the books that we recommend to parents."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"Hainstock's easy to understand format will be helpful to the parent who knows little or nothing about how to use the Montessori method. The instructions and presentation of each of the learning activities mentioned in this book, in my humble opinion, are excellent. Parents today are busy and they don't have time to wade through books with complicated, confusing information. Their time is valuable, and Hainstock is sensitive to this fact. She is also sensitive to the child and his or her needs. Her lessons truly represent Montessori in every way.I have looked at this book from two persepectives - a parent and as a teacher and came away with the same feeling. Job well done."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"After a recent visit to a local Montessori school with my three year old son, my husband and I became convinced that this was the best educational approach for him, at least for the next few years. Since the school here does not have mid-semester admittance, I decided to start implementing some Montessori activities at home with him. I found this book to be the perfect resource for getting started...it's so easy. I immediately began introducing the exercises at home and my son loves them! Just today he washed his own little dishes, helped sweep the floor, poured rice, and strung beads...he had a fine time and was very interested and quite proud of his accomplishments. Yes, even rambunctious little boys enjoy helping with household tasks. Now we're off to feed the dogs..."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I originally checked this book out from the library, and I appreciated the information so much I ordered a copy for myself. I am investigating homeschooling my 4 year old, and I wanted to get some information on hands-on, child-friendly teaching methods. This is a great beginning. This book has several chapters of narrative, that cover all areas of education (literacy, math, science, fine and gross motor skills), followed by many pages of how-to instructions on making the materials and supplies needed to teach in Montessori style. I was very excited by this book, and felt that it really equipped me to teach my 4 year old self-care, independence skills as well as furthering her knowledge of letters, numbers, and the world around her."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"My 7-year-old and 2-year-old have gone to Montessori school since they were babies, so when I recently decided to quit working and keep the 2-year-old home with me for a couple of years, I immediately sought out this book to help me prepare my home classroom. It has been wonderful for getting started. I can see though that I will eventually need more in-depth Montessori instruction manuals so I can fully understand how to introduce and teach using the more advanced Montessori materials. But this book was excellent for teaching the basics!"},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"This book is great to have if you are interested in introducing some Montessori materials into your home.

I was looking for the guidance to homeschool my son via the Montessouri Method and this is the place to start. It explains and demonstartes all kinds of activities. It explains all of the activity benefits as well. It also tells you how to construct many of the activity pieces. I have read several other Montessouri books and haven't felt like I knew enough to start teaching it at home but that has all changed with this book!! Many thanks to Elizabeth Hainstock!"},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Rather than finding the emphasis on manners and grace to be outdated, I found it to be a refreshing reinforcement of an aspect of our children's socialization process that has been neglected by busy parents and over-crowded schools. In my child care center, these elements of life are recognized as being extremely important. The child who learns to be respectful and who learns good manners is well received by the world, and usually enjoys a healthier dynamic within her family. With so many two career couples, these socialization skills are often lost in the busy shuffle. Children are pushed very heavily to perform academically, while other aspects of their growth and development are sadly neglected. The ensuing imbalance may be responsible for some of our oft lamented social ills. Montessori materials and proper applications are no less than brilliant. Proper applications being a key term. When learning is presented in the form of play, without pressure in regards to emergent skills, the experience is very powerful and very positive for the child. I'm delighted with this book, and others like it that make Montessori more widely accessible."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I was completely ignorant about the Montessori method when I bought this book. My son is almost 3 and as I hadbecome tired of playing with cars and trucks and saying No all the time. I was looking for a more engaged kind of play-with-learning that we could do at home.This book is fantastic - outlining many activities and giving a taste of the Montessori approach that will let you decide whether you want to know more (I did!).Many Montessori programs are expensive but this book equips you to do the activities with home made equipment. It also inspires parents to engage their children with everyday activities - eg. my son loved the 'lesson' on how to open and close a drawer properly. He quickly &quot;taught&quot; his panda and Maisie how to do it noiselessly and showed a great deal of pride. What a change from throwing Hot Wheels cars at the wall!"},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I am fortunate enough to be able to be a stay at home with my children because I want my kids to stay at home as long as possible (while they are young) so they can fully appreciate the family dynamic. Because I stay at home, my family and I are living off a single income and cannot afford to put our children in the Montessori program. I am still interested in the Montessori philosophy, and wanted to try to incorporate it here at home. I checked this book out from the library just to see how applicable it would be, and I found that this is a great, not complicated introduction to the Montessori method. The activities are great and realistic for little ones to explore and learn, and will be useful to them in the long run. They also don't require alot of \\"shopping\\" so it can be very affordable as well. I'm very excited to help my children learn with this book.

This seemed a formidable task until I found this book and the book &quot;Montessori Read &amp; Write&quot; by Lynne Lawrence, both of which gives me the guidelines and instruction I need to successfully utilize the Montessori method in my own home.

Until she begins Montessori, I want to begin instilling some of the instructions. I ordered this book along with one other you will notice in my reviewed items. Both books are very good in my opinion, and all that I need. Even if I never enroll her in daycare, preschool, this is adequate.

Very good quality book."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"So I feel weird about this book. I am down with Montessori \\"schooling\\", but this book didn't give me anything new, in fact most of it was pretty dated. And much of the theory was very common sense, such as how to show your child how to do something, I was like \\"um...yeah, no kidding\\". Also, I don't know if this is because it is so dated(40's?) but many of the tasks for \\"3 to 5\\" year olds my 1 1/2 year old can do, or is already learning, I felt like much of the things this book guides you to show your two year old, my bobbler already gets. There is even a part where it suggests we start teaching colors at age 3, my kid knows all his colors even though he can't say them. I am not bragging here, it was just weird. Also the \\"busy board\\" is put together with upholstery tacks, and I am pretty sure I wouldn't want my kid playing with something that included tacks.There was NOTHING here that I couldn't find on Montessori sites, or mom blogs."},{"Title":"Teaching Montessori in the Home:The Preschool Years","review":"I knew the idea behind Montessori, but never read a book about it.

Preschools all around are more and more competitive and they only focus on academics. This book teaches that first the child needs to master the world around him/her and then they will become great students. The example exercizes the book gives are all great. Another plus, is that monst of the activities can be done with things that you may already have around the house.

Kelly brought him to doctor after doctor, hospital after hospital, looking for some medical reason for his seemingly endless and always transforming condition. It wasn't illness (at least not the kind doctors can help) at all---it was possession!Enlightened Through Darkness is the true story of the evil forces that inhabited Edward's body---forces that caused him to act crazy---to hit, scream, curse and threaten. Forces that attacked not just Edward, but his dad, sister, mom and anyone else trying to understand, and help.The violence and destruction, the fear and the episodes increased dramatically. Kelly and her husband Leo exhausted all the doctors and, even went to different churches for help, to no avail. Then Judy Goodman entered their lives, sent by God she said, and able to see both sides at all times.Demons proliferated, as cruel and harmful as in the movie, The Exorcist---except this was true, this was real, and it was for Judy Goodman to use all her power to exorcise these creatures of hell from little Edward's body. And so, Enlightened Through Darkness is a page-turner of truth, about the battle of good versus evil, God versus Satan and light versus darkness.\\"Sometimes we don't realize that there is an unseen world of existence around us. The reality of these things is not dependent on our knowledge or belief in them\\", writes author, seeker and mom Kelly Hartmann. Enlightened Through Darkness, in this reviewer's opinion, is a marvelous book, but beware---when you start reading it, be prepared. You won't be able to put it down until page 222, the end!"},{"Title":"Enlightened through Darkness","review":"I was given this book and read it without putting it down! If you have ever picked up a book that gave you answers to many unknowns through telling such an unbelievable story...read this! How can mysteries be solved? How does love conquer all with a faith to see you to that path of unconditional love? I adored this story and the characters involved. It brings you into their home, their struggles, and their victories over the powers of darkness. To feel for this child and his parents as they learned and as they moved ahead, how they never gave up when all of the powers from the dark side rode hard against them...you will know how truly strong the spirit we all have, is. The author opens the door to her thoughts, worries, unbeleif of the situation and shows us how she searched for the truth; that ultimately sets her family free and paves a way for a &quot;new life&quot; founded through the trials of her son. She intorduces us to one of the worlds' light workers, whom are available to be of service to those who truly ask for help. It is a powerful love story, a love for her son, her family, and for their higher power, to be the reigning force in their lives and destroy the darkness that was ripping them apart. To understand how they went to every type of medical doctor seeking help and how it was all a mystery to them; how they never quit when most of us would've given up, moved me forward in my life to always search for the truth. If your desire in life is to live by the truth, than this book will inspire you to be stronger than you ever thought, to find your truth under and above the sun. If you've wondered how horrific things in life occur here without any rhyme or reason; this &quot;enlightens you&quot; to look beyond the physical and mental. It helps you to remove our limited thinking and all the barriers that keep us stagnant in our spiritual growth. I applaud the author and her courage to share her life with us, write it to help others, and for inspiring me to be the brightest light I can. Bravo...waiting for the next one..."},{"Title":"Enlightened through Darkness","review":"I am a paranormal investigator and have worked with many psychics, and demonologists and exorcists.

These people should have sought help from John Zaffis and had a catholic exorcism performed or perhaps several. Until the demon was vanquished.I also will say this, I do not know if the author was using the real names of the Demon involved, I tend to think she was, in which case It is complete idiocy to mention, think about, write, or even say a Demon's name as this allows them access to the individual.

I wonder if this author even visited any of these towns.This book is also dated so the financial, crime & growth information is not accurate which makes it almost useless for my needs. I looked up one of the recommended towns and things have changed dramatically. One local describes the town as a he**hole and says drugs are rampant in this little town, mosquitos are unbearable and unfriendly dogs just run wild. This town is described in the book as a desert paradise so it makes me wonder about the rest of the recommendations here.The book also tells very little about the \\"feel\\" of each town, which is very important to me and there are no pictures at all. What are the neighbors and communities like? Will the town be blown away by a hurricane or tornado? The book touts itself on interviewing actual residents of the town but I can't possibly imagine business owners and town planners saying negative things about the town and that is who the author chose to interview. I don't recall seeing any regular Joe type interviews.

It has over 85 awesome color pics of all different kinds of fire trucks in every color imaginible. I especially enjoyed the section on special units. Also, there are sidebars covering such topics as quints and squad companies. Also, if you like this book, be sure to check out &quot;Fire Trucks In Action&quot; by George Hall- They're both great books!"},{"Title":"Fighting Fire Trucks (Enthusiast Color)","review":"The title is actually a misnomer. This book isn't all about fire pumpers and ladder trucks but also contains great information about Rescue, Support (lighting, air resupply, generators), Airport crash trucks, Tankers, and Command and Control trucks. The last section talks about the colors and &quot;decorative appearance&quot; of trucks in different cities.I find this book a wonderful all-around reference to the above vehicles. The book contains photos and info on the best of the breed of tankers, support, rescue, etc. The author went to the large cities and basically &quot;peeked into the firehouse&quot; to see what they have and what they used it for.Methods and procedures are discussed such as how to hook up hoses to hydrants, drive to the scene, and conduct firefighting or rescue operations to name a few.The author was also there for many major fires and rescue work in several cities so the photos are taken at great &quot;frontline&quot; angles and not behind some crowd. Also, the captions are specific and describes what the photo shows and is about. It's not &quot;Four rescue trucks at a downtown accident,&quot; BUT &quot;This is a pretty rare scene where four out of five NYFD rescue trucks show up for the construction accident. You can see the debris lying on the street in the background. One person was killed in this accident.&quot;The best part I find is the explanations. As I read, I have questions which the author seems to predict and answer. Do tankers run to the water source with lights and sirens? Why does some cities run ladders and others towers? Do cities paint their trucks orange? Why don't firemen ride standing on the rear bumper? Why do rural towns have better vehicles than large cities? All these questions the author answered.Highly recommend for the fire vehicle and modeler fan.

Leay's)","review":"Some Golden Harbor (2006) is the fifth SF novel of the Leary, RCN, series, followingThe Way to Glory. In the previous volume, after the loss of his captain, Lieutenant Daniel Leary took the Hermes to attack an Alliance convoy in the Bromley system. The cutters damaged several cargo transports and the heavy cruiser Scheer, but Midshipman Timothy Dorst and his crew were killed in action.Later, Signal Officer Adele Mundy made cutter 614 appear as a battleship and the Scheer surrendered to Admiral Milne's flotilla. Leary and a prize crew took the Scheer to Ritikin. There Leary was promoted to Commander by order of Admiral Anston, President of the Navy Board.In this novel, Daniel has orders to go to Ganpat's Reach in an advisory role. Adele meets with Maurice Claverhouse in the Pleasaunce Style restaurant to obtain information about Dunbar's World. Adele is hoping that Claverhouse will have more current information on the situation than that available from Mistress Sand's organization.Daniel visits the mother and sister of Midshipman Dorst. They already know of his death, but Daniel was his commanding officer and feels a duty to personally console the family. He also steers the family to his sister Deirdre to hasten distribution of Dorst's share of the prize money; Daniel's private deal with Deirdre will ensure that the Dorsts get immediate payment of the full amount.Adele has expedited the use of the Princess Cecile to carry Daniel to Gunpat's Reach. Moreover, she has arranged for former Sissies to crew the ship. Their crew is being held in a hulk near Harbor 3.Admiral Vocaine is now the Chief of the Navy Board, taking office after the retirement of Admiral Anston following a heart attack. Vocaine has instituted a new policy of detaining enlisted personnel between voyages, denying them port liberty. Both Daniel and Adele travel out to the place to collect the crew.In this story, Lieutenant Vesey is acting captain of the Princess Cecile since Daniel is officially a passenger on this voyage. Besides, Daniel figures that the responsibilities will take her mind off the death of Midshipman Dorst. She has been very lost in her grief except when she has duties to perform.Their first stop is Pellegrino, from which the invaders of Dunbar's World have come. Adele discovers that a disabled Cinnabar freighter has been waiting for parts for more than a month. Daniel decides to visit the captain of the freighter to get local news.Adele visits the Cinnabar consular agent, who is also an agent for Mistress Sand. Hijaz Nordeen tells her the reason for the invasion. Chancellor Arruns has a son and heir -- Nataniel -- who is impatient in his wait for the chance at power. So Chancellor Arruns would prefer that Nataniel remain on Dunbar's World indefinitely.Bennaria was the initial complainant to the Cinnabar Senate, for the invasion has disrupted their trade. Yet Daniel and Adele discover that Bennaria is not taking any steps on their own to oppose the invasion. Of course, they are quite willing to lend support to any Cinnabar effort, as long as it does not require their money or military.This story tells of how Daniel accomplished his mission on Dunbar's World without any naval or military support other than the unarmed Princess Cecile and her well-armed crew. Daniel and Adele conduct covert operations on Bennaria to acquire what they need. Then they use these resources on Dunbar's World to get the Pellegrino troops off the planet.Naturally, Daniel and Adele are resoundingly successful on Dunbar's World and confound their critics on Cinnabar.

Start at point A. Move to point B. Can't open door - it's locked. Return to point A and find magic key. Return to point B and use key. Oops - I forgot to grab the magic lint - can't cross threshold. Return to point A, get lint. Return to point B. Unock door again. Use lint. Can't look around - Darn - it's dark. Return to point A for a torch. Return to point B, fight ogre blocking door. Unock door. Use lint. Look around with torch. Can't. I forgot to grab the matches and light the torch. Return to point A, get matches. And on and on and on. I was getting ready to fall over I was spun around so much!I'm not kidding. Leary was a pinball dizzily bouncing between two planets throughout the book. There was more \\"political action\\" - about as exciting as reading the minutes from a Senate session on Soybean Subsidies - then anything else.The \\"tyrannical Alliance\\" was nothing of the sort. More a minor character that sent advisors and hired mercs. And really poor, unskilled mercs at that.Tovera is becoming more humanized (at one point Drake seems to have confused Hogg with Tovera.) Adele is turning into a Schitzo. At this rate, we'll have a new character named Adelovera. Or we'll get a \\"Fight Club\\" hit, and find out that Tovera and Adele are the same person. The lines between the two are becoming too blurred.Spoiler (kind-of)....The end, with a cross-dressing TV serenading the crews was a pretty pathetic and uninspired moment in the book, and one of the most bizarre events in the series. Picture this: You have commanded your crews through harrowing space battles, negotiated peace on two planets, and avoided a fight between hired killers/bodyguards.Do they do to Disneyland? Nope. Get drunk and party like it's 9999? Nope. They watch a drag queen sing from on top of the ships hull.The whole story seemed unpolished and rushed to print. Yes, the storyline was good - not great (as many of Drake's are) - but the execution was poorly done this time. Sure, Drake at his worst is better than many authors at their best, but this was not up to par. I'm sure if he would have read his final version a few weeks after putting it down, he would have said \\"What the hell?!?\\""},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"This series is an homage to O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series, and despite some flaws I like it better than the original. For the rest of this review I'll assume the reader has read the other novels -- I don't recommend starting with this one.The interesting thing about this book is that it is not really about Daniel Leary. He actually serves mainly as a narrator/observer to everyone else. The younger officers are learning how to become officers, Tovara is becoming more complex, Hogg is becoming more real, but Adele Mundy is remaining something of a whiner. The crew was mostly present in a cameo role, but the new non-RCN characters were more interesting than usual.Unfortunately, the plot didn't have much color to it. No excursions to exotic caves or jungles or deserts, no spy intrigue, no chain-of-command conflicts, no meetings with pirate warlords, etc. What was there seemed like a fairly generic SF military novel. Drake spent some time telling us all the things that might go wrong with the battle plans because actually nothing really did go wrong -- the battles were all pretty much pro forma.The series this is based on was 20 books long; a boxed set runs to 7000 pages. I don't know if Drake is going to keep chunking these out every time he finds some historical battle that fits the mold, but unless we start seeing some more character development from Leary and Mundy I expect the quality to just peter out over time."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"Boy, I really dislike writing this review. Why? Because I've really enjoyed the first four in this series. Well, \\"The way to Glory\\" was showing a bit of a slowdown, but nothing like \\"Some Golden Harbor\\"!Yeah, there's some action, but it's the same kind of action you're seen time and time again in the other books. Character growth? Forget it! There has been little or no change in any of the relationships since \\"The Far Side of the Stars\\". Leary's still just a big old playboy who just happens to be a terrific navigator and ship fighter. Mundy isn't much better, same old robot in a human shell.The worst part about this is it's starting to get really boring, and that's a shame since it started off so well. I think the best thing Drake can do is either kill them all off, abandon the it or put some real changes into the storyline. But I suppose as long as we keep buying this churned out crud he'll keep writing it.Neutral on this one."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"This will have to be brief - but I have an advance copy of the book and can say that anyone who has been following Leary's and Mundy's adventures in the war of the Republic of Cinnabar with the Alliance will find this one a worthy continuation of the series.We left Leary promoted to Commander and about to take the prize Scheer home for repair - and find him no longer in great favor at the Admiralty, as his patron Admiral Anston has retired following a heart attack. However - Adele Mundy remains an agent of the Republic's Intelligence apparatus (headed by one Bernice Sand) and the pair of them (with the aid of a little creative data base alteration by Adele - bright girl she is) are off with Princess Cecile and the Sissies on a new adventure.Those who see a resemblence to some of the O'Brian Aubry-Maturin novels (including a privately owned warship pressed into the use of the nation that employs the primary characters)are observing what Dave wants them to, by the way.In any case - we see the usual combination of well-realized characters and blazing action against odds that the author has used for most of his writing career. Well worth acquiring a copy of this fine book, but I'd advise not making it your first encounter with Daniel Leary and Adele Mundy. It can stand alone, and you won't be sorry you read it, but there are nuances of character that will be more apparent if you have read the earlier tales in the series. And (like most of Dave's tales) it is solidly grounded in history. As he has said - if people did it that way once, why wouldn't they do similar things again? It does help to keep the stories grounded in reality, seems to me."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"SOME GOLDEN HARBOR(2007)**1/2 is far-future interstellar Military SciFi, and follows the first four books from the Republic of Cinnabar Navy(RCN) series: THE WAY TO GLORY(2005)***, THE FAR SIDE OF THE STARS(2003)*****, LT LEARY COMMANDING(2000)****, and WITH THE LIGHTNINGS(1998)*****.I'm a big fan of David Drake's, and of the RCN(Leary/Mundy) Series. Unfortunately, there is very little new here. There is nothing special about the planets that are visited, the action scenes are too little and too far apart, and when they do happen, they are nothing very different than what we have seen in past books in the series.The regular characters exhibited no new behaviour, and frankly, Adele's \\"little smiles\\" are becoming a bit old. There was very little interesting about the new characters either - the alien Fallert (who seems to be interested in Tovera?) is about the only exception.One thing I noticed is that the author made reference to use of VHF frequencies in this book - I like the way he uses actually frequency data... and after I'd complained about him using a 15Khz frequency for data in one book, and said 151.880Mhz(VHF) would have been more appropriate.Another thing I've notice is that the level of violence in this series of books has declined - or maybe I'm getting so used to Drake's descriptions of killings, that I'm becoming immune to them... I'm also currently reading Cormac McCarthy's BLOOD MERIDIAN (1985), a Western set in the 1850's, where the descriptions of cruelty, violence, murder, and death are so frequent and graphic that it makes Drake's books look like walks in the park."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"I really enjoy David Drake's writing. His science fiction has always been really great.The RCN space opera series, of which this is the latest book, is really good. Only the fact that Drake wrote the Slammers series keeps me from calling this series his finest work. This book is five stars, but is also the lowest five stars of the series. It is still a great book, the others are better.The hero started the series as a low ranking officer who is from a powerful family but disowned. His spirit and raw ability to command bring him riches and respect of his own.His faithful sidekick, the fallen noble family daughter Mundy, is a sexless Spock type character who is as loyal as she is expert in computers and capable of unfeeling logical violence.The series tracks the duo as the hero climbs the ranks and gains enemies and wealth. This latest adventure see the two defeating a fortifed island with only scant resources, and saving a world.The cracks that are just starting to arise are 1) Mundy is just too good at killing and data hacking. She can kill a dozen soldiers with a simple pistol, and hack any data network and override any computer safety. Even her sadness at being such a good unfeeling killer is expressed at the perfect time in the perfect way.2) The hero, Daniel, is much too perfect. Every plan is masterful, every chance pays off for him. He can make the ship do magic things, every shot hits just as it should, every crew member loves him like a minor god.The author, a vet himself assigned to a combat headquarters, does a great job with expressing Daniel's command of a crew of about 200. However, it is clear that while the author understands command functions passed on to units in combat, he cannot write about directly commanding larger bodies of fighting men. This leads to the now mid/high-ranking Daniel being, yet again, in charge of the same basic 200 men as in the first novel. The reasons for the small unit are starting to repeat.The problem is not serious yet, but small signs are there."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"This is the fourth in David Drake's Lieutenant Leary series. After reading the first book (With the Lightnings) I became hooked and look forward to subsequent follow-ups as Drake churns them out.Each book so far has followed the same formula: the protagonists are on a planet doing stuff and there is minor violence. Leary goes on a mission in a spacecraft with the same old crew and his \\"special friend\\" Adele, who is a spy, a whiz with computers and also a dead shot with a pistol. There are raids on shore and the finales involve battles in space with missiles, etc.(Readers familiar with Patrick O'Brien's \\"Master and Commander\\" series may note an eerie resemblance even though his books are set around 1800 and involve a frigate in the British navy.)Maybe not in the league of, say, Larry Niven, the Leary books are a fine read -- good characters and lots of action."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"These are book 5 of the RCN series by David Drake. This is hard core Military SF, the good stuff.Drake has been very good in this series on going into how tough it is to be in a Navy ship, be it ocean going or space going. And how tough it is to make port when the port doesn't like you very much. That makes the books very comfortable to read."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"Unfortunately, Some Golden Harbor did not appeal to my senses. The plot, characters, and battle scenes were monotonous and bland. The political complexities ended up being linear. A has problem with B, so shoot both A and B and C wins.Very sad considering I have enjoyed the Lt. Leary series up to this book.I felt that the problem began when the majority of the focus ended up on Adele with her anti-social behavior and robotic outlook on life. You know what you get with her and because she is devoid of emotions, the book followed suit. Also, the excessive use of \\"a Mundy of Chatsworth\\" or \\"my word as a Mundy of Chatsworth\\" was very distracting.Definitely read the first 3 books, maybe the fourth, but skip this one."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"With the admiral who favored him retired, Commander Daniel Leary can no longer expect plum assignments. Being sent to the back end of nowhere to support some Cinnabar commercial interests would be bad enough if they at least gave him a couple of naval ships. But sending him in his own private spaceship seems doomed to result in nothing but disaster. Fortunately for Leary, he's used to being set up for failure. Even more fortunately, his signals officer, Adele Mundy at his side, his ship is the retired but renovated Princess Cecile, and he's able to break most of his old crew (the Sissies) out of the hulk where they, along with other Cinnabar sailors, are being held between assignments.Cinnabar really has no essential national interests at stake, but Leary doesn't like failure. He's been tasked to end the invasion of Dunbar's World and he intends to do it. Unfortunately, there's a Pellegrino cruiser supporting the invasion force and the Princess Cecile wash shipped with no missiles. On the ground, things are not much better. The Pellegrino mercenary army has bogged down, but opposition is fragmented and breaking down. Even a helpful army from yet another world is available, but sending a few thousand men into the meat-grinder of battle hardly seems likely to change the course of the war.Author David Drake continues his RCN series with another space-bound adventure modeled on the Napoleonic naval genre of novels. Like C. S. Forester's BEAT TO QUARTERS, which may have served as partial inspiration for this book, Drake sets his adventures outside of the main battle (in his case, between Cinnabar and the Alliance), where the results matter to those killed but not really to anyone else.The fun of this series comes from the space action and from the interaction between the characters of Daniel and Adele. In SOME GOLDEN HARBOR, compared to others in the series, both the action and the interaction seems muted. Drake seemed to find a need to over-explain Adele's relationship with her servant, Tovera, and Tovera's possible relationship with a reptile-alien seems to have expanded beyond its importance to the plot or its interest to me as a reader. I definitely got tired of Tovera giggling. Similarly, I don't really have a problem with Adele and Leary being unconcerned with the morality of their actions. But couldn't someone care whether they were doing the right thing--even if that someone was ultimately ignored?I've enjoyed the Leary/Mundy series up until now, and SOME GOLDEN HARBOR is certainly readable--not a bad book, really--but it isn't up to the standards of this series."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"This is a hard review to write for someone who loved the other stories in this series. But really, don't bother. I've had this book for months and reading more than a page or two a week is a chore. And I'm only halfway through. It's that slow. Nothing of any interest at any level has happened yet. I really should give this book a one-star rating, but the last half has to be better. Doesn't it?"},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt.

It's intelligent, with strong characterization and a gorgeous setting that nevertheless works as a human society.Read on!"},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"Five books into the Lt. Leary series and I have to pull the plug. Only dogged determinaton got me this far, and a willingness to give character developement a fighting chance. Unfortunately, author David Drake fails to deliver in so many ways with SOME GOLDEN HARBOR.The basic storyline has the now Commander Leary heading off to Dunbar's World to assist an allied system that has been invaded by another world in the far off Ganpat's Reaches. For this mission, Leary recruits most of the same crew that has been with him since the first book. Colorful characters like the six and a half foot tall female bosun with the unpronouncable name Woetjans, along with the colorless Tovera and Adele Mundy sign up for another dangerous but profitable tour.That could have been the basis for a good story. No one involved with this product seemed to make an effort to make the reality fit the promise. This book has all the drama of a two day drive through Kansas on I-40.We have had a glimpse of Daniel Leary's swinging ways in all of the previous books. I assume the author thinks we are bored with straight sex because little of that is even hinted at in this book. In it's place we are presented with a list of deviant social and sexual behavior. Here in SOME GOLDEN HARBOR you are treated to slavery, homosexuality and bestiality. Actually, on the last, since it involves the barely human Tovera and the alien lizardman Fallert, it might require a new word like XENOPHILIA (sex between humans and sentients from another planet). If that isn't enough, human sentries are reported to be watching porn involving a woman and THREE aliens!Another fault mentioned in a previous review is the complete failure of any sort of military organization within the RCN. Only officers are ever promoted in this massive spacefaring Navy. Leary is a commander after an improbable two step jump at the end the pervious book. Midshipman Vesey has made full lieutenant. Every other person on this ship is still at the same rank doing the same job they were doing in the first or second book. As an retired Navy man myself, I can tell you how much traction that system would have.The Princess Cecile, a small corvette with small guns and few missiles, is past it's usefulness for the storyline. Leary's rank alone warrants a move to a bigger ship with greater capabilities.Character development also falls flat in this story. Adele, Tovera, Hogg, Pasternak, et al remain exactly as they were when they first met on the Princess Cecile. Leary himself devolves in that he begins the series with a distaste for the arrogant, nationalistic slur \\"wogs\\". However, by this fifth book it has become a normal part of his conversation.His crewmen and women, the Sissies, also fail to develop in this book. All of the minor characters are treated as cardboard cutouts but with less personality. They do little more than risk their lives in dangerous situations and get drunk. Spacers apparently have no families, no homes and no loyalty to any nation, planet or government, except to Leary. If the aren't avoiding sudden vaporization or a lingering death in a bubble universe, they are chasing whores and blowing their money. That's it.This series has ground to an ignoble stop for me. The last few pages put the period on it solidly. Few points are resolved clearly. Instead we and the crew are treated to a transvestite in a wig singing on the top of the ship in the middle of the day. Why?There are at least three other books ahead of this one but I'm done with it. I've tired of the careless editing that lets twice the words do half the work. Clearly no one bothered to proofread the copy before it went into print. Drake should be ashamed to lend his name to this substandard fare. BAEN BOOKS should apologize to any reader that paid full price for the books, and the reviewers crowded across the back sleeve should check to see if the book they reviewed was the same that was printed. Personally, I hope this is not an example of where the genre is headed. Jim Baen would be in tears."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"Book 5 of the Leary-Mundy space opera series continues to meet the high standard set by its predecessors.Daniel Leary's patron, Admiral Anston, has been medically retired and his replacement as Boss Admiral is not a Leary fan. So when there's a crisis out in the back of the beyond, Leary is sent to deal with it. Since Adele Mundy is going with him, the support from Navy Headquarters is a bit more than originally contemplated by the anti-Leary faction. The Princess Cecille becomes a \\"Naval Auxiliary\\" and a large part of her crew comes with her. Incidentally, Vocaine putting planet-bound enlisted personnel in clapped-out hulks is the same way the Royal Navy treated ship's crews during the Napoleonic Wars. I wonder if in later books we're going to see a replay of the Spithead-Nore mutinies of 1797.There's the usual daring deeds, the usual Cinnabar sneering at the wogs, and the usual political chicanery that Drake handles so well in this series. Unusually, Daniel doesn't seem to pick up a floozy or two to seduce. However, someone's got a boyfriend. No, it's not Adele. Our favorite sociopathic killer, Tovera, meets a similarly-minded alien lizardman and the love (or lust) appears mutual. There's also a gay female impersonator, a stranded Alliance nobleman with his battle-hardened retainers, and an evil slaver who meets his just deserts.\\"Some Golden Harbor\\" is another good romp in the series. I read it in one sitting and I'm looking forward to the next Leary-Mundy book."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"David Drake's Some Golden Harbor is the fifth novel about now Commander Daniel Leary of the Royal Cinnabar Navy and his faithful Signals Officer (and spy) Adele Mundy. This is as I have mentioned a series superficially resembling Aubrey and Maturin in space -- but I should also mention that while much of the setup resembles England in the Napoleonic Era, other aspects, including specific incidents on which some of the plots are based, are derived from Ancient (Republican) Rome.As this novel opens Leary is out of favor with the new head of the RCN. Thus he is assigned to a minor job away from the war front (Cinnabar is at war with the evil Alliance), as an \\"advisor\\" to a Cinnabar ally trying to protest the invasion of another (somewhat allied) planet by a planet more closely tied to the Alliance. But Leary manages to arrange for his own personal ship, the Princess Cecile (a warship he captured in book I and which was sold out of the Navy later, much like the Surprise in the Aubrey/Maturin books), to take him, and a picked crew, to his assignment.The rest of the book consists of shuffling between the three involved planets. Bennaria, Cinnabar's \\"ally\\", is rather a mess, controlled by corrupt oligarchs involved in slaving. Pellegrinia, the Alliance's ally, is controlled by a strict ruler who has sent his son to invade the third planet, Dunbar's World, to get his son out of his hair. Leary must improvise wildly, stealing and commandeering more ships, convincing various only partly interested people to help him, saving the odd victim from the odd sadist, training his promising midshipmen to command, etc. etc.It remains fun, fairly light, action-packed, military SF. There are hints of some development in Leary's character and life -- possibly even the attention of a more intelligent woman than his usual one-night stands. Mundy remains Mundy, but some other Sissies get to grow just a bit. Is it a masterwork -- by no means. But I did like it -- and I think I'd rank it as one of the better books in this series (though not so good as the first, With the Lightnings, which remains the best)."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt.

Daniel and the usual suspects are engaged, once again, against overwhelming odds and implacable foes.I loved the Horatio Hornblower books and I feel Drake does just as well but sets his Horatio sometime in the future without iron men and wooden ships.Leary's most endearing characteristic is his loyalty to his friends. He continually does what he thinks is right as opposed to what perhaps might be the easy way out. His Machiavellian circumvention of orders generally means he is undermanned, under supplied and outgunned whenever he is assigned a task. Yet with gentile charm and superior skills he always triumphs.Daniel Leary is not a boy scout, he is lethally ruthless when it comes to accomplishing his goals or protecting his people. Adele Mundy, Tovera and Hogg are all back and their quirkiness just adds the m&eacute;lange of flavors that make Drake's Leary series so sumptuous.I can't help it, I love these books and I highly recommend this book and the whole series."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt. Leay's)","review":"David Drake borrows from events in Italy, circa 5th Century BC, merges it with elements from Patrick O'Brien's novels and sets it in space. This 5th book in the \\"RCN Series\\" continues the adventures of Commander Daniel Leary and his signals officer/spy/librian friend Adele Mundy. Together, with their shipmates from the corvette Princess Cecile, they confound the corrupt politicians on four planets, stop an army from invading an allied world and shoot down a blockading cruiser. The story is a little slow at several points, because the good ship & crew end up traveling back & forth several times between three planets, to obtain weapons, crewmen and even a destroyer. The author's premise for space travel appears plausible and makes readers feel they're immersed a \\"Horatio Hornblower in space\\" yarn. While it's a decent stand alone novel, it's best appreciated if you've read the previous four books."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt.

Adele Mundy is turning into a robot, and how many times do we have to hear that a hint of a smile is all she can do because of her emotional state? All Lieutenant Leary seems to want to do is hang out on the ship's surface in matrix space. The supporting characters have even less depth. They all have hard looks on their faces, but everyone knows that they mean business. I'll give this series one more try with the next one. I hope it's better, or I'm done."},{"Title":"Some Golden Harbor (RCN - Lt.

What no one knows is that another shark has entered into the waters and is making itself just as much at home as the first one did. This novelization is adapted from the script by Dorothy Tristan and Howard Sackler. However Tristan had to leave the project when her husband, director John Hancock, was replaced by Jeannot Szwarc and Jaws screenwriter Carl Gottlieb was called in to do a massive rewrite, in the end only co-screenwriter Howard Sackler retained credit. While many events in the completed film can be glimpsed in this story (two photograph taking scuba divers attacked at the wreck of the Orca, the picture they take of the shark becoming an important plot point later, a water skier gets gulped and the speedboat blows up, a scuba diver bumps into the shark and shoots to the surface way too fast, a helicopter gets yanked under, and a group of shark bait kids are attacked and trapped at sea during a boat race), but their context within the discarded storyline are radically different. Author Hank Searls adds a welcome amount of detail to the story, some, such as getting into the mind of both the shark and a harbor seal searching for its lost child, foreshadow his masterful whale novel Soundings. The book is somewhat better written than Benchley's source novel, but it does not contain the visceral terror of the original, then again how could it? Nonetheless, Jaws fans should seek this out, just to see what could have been a far better sequel. Recommended."},{"Title":"Jaws 2","review":"I thought this would be really bad but I loved the first Jaws so much I thought I would take a shot and spend the 5 bucks. It was REALLY good.

When I got it, I read it in three weeks. I couldn't put it down. It was very descriptive and had a high atmosphere on terror and suspence. This book is based on an early script of Jaws 2 written by Howard Sackler and Dorthy Trisan. There are really cool subplots to the novel. Some of it has to do with the mafia. Some parts get very Tony Soprano like! This should have been the movie. When writer, Carl Gottlib, came in for rewrites, he butchered the script. I'm not saying the movie is bad, I'm saying the book is better. This book is also much better than the book of Jaws 1, not the movie Jaws 1, the book Jaws 1. The book Jaws 1 went into really stupid subplots. The author of Jaws 2, Hank Searls, did a great job on this book. It is too bad that the book went out of print. If you don't like the movie of Jaws 2, forget it, this is the real deal....! Hank Searls is also the author to Jaws: The Revenge which, like Jaws 2 was written after the movie. There was no book for Jaws 3-D. I haven't had a chance to read Jaws: The Revenge yet, but I have it. The book Jaws 2 came out the same year the movie was made. If you ever chance, pick up this book and buy it. It is a reading experience with a climax you will never forget. A novel of parylyzing terror that will grab you from the openign chapter...

I don't remember much about the book other than that I found the story more interesting than the movie.The shark in this book is a pregnant female, and the events pertaining to that would make a difficult-to-film movie even MORE difficult. Movie audiences at the point basically just wanted to see a dorsal fin cutting through the water and a handful of people get eaten.

I liked that it doesn't focus on political differences. You get to see how people of other faiths pray, celebrate life and death, and view moral issues -- which can only help us humans see our similarities. The book is slightly weighted toward the Judeo-Christian tradition (but consider that the authors are a rabbi and priest); however, it doesn't skimp on coverage of the other major religions. \\"Religion For Dummies\\" is a good foundation for the titles in what seems to be an expanding lineup in the Dummies' religion/spirituality series.

For example: the Christianity side heavily emphasises the Roman Catholic beliefs - the different Protestant beliefs are but lightly touched on and Anglicanism (Church of England - which is one of the world's biggest Protestant churches) is not mentioned at all. Some of the information is rather odd: for example it is claimed that Protestant Christians rarely celebrate the Eucharist. Well, not in my experience: in the UK most churches celebrate it several times a week!The same criticism can be levelled at the description of Judaism: reading this book one would never guess how radically different the various Jewish groups are (and how much they are often daggers drawn too). And ditto Islam.I accept that I am going to see this book differently from an American reader but I could not see why the other religions were so lightly touched on. In the UK there is a substantial population of Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs: I had expected this book to give more information about these faiths and to expand my knowledge of them. It didn't. This book is too heavily orientated towards 'The Big Three' and there are other, better books that cover these.I was pleased to see that Native American faiths were lightly touched on and a hint was given about Australian Aboriginal beliefs.As I was aware from my own studies of several spectacular errors and a lot of small misunderstandings (which I accept are inevitable on such a subject) I became doubtful of the veracity of a lot of this book and did not feel that it expanded my knowledge of religion one iota. Why was the book not written by persons of the various faiths and then edited to match the 'Dummies' format rather than wholly written by a Rabbi and a Catholic Priest? The different faiths are not dealt with in separate chapters but mixed up all together: following a thread to get an overall picture of one religion is not particularly easy or obvious.This book has made a brave attempt to cover a huge subject but the accuracy, detail and layout fail.

The book overall is often very uplifting as it discusses how all religions try to help us face the problems and mysteries in life we all have to deal with. The book also discusses major issues and criticisms most religions face and gives a rational defense without ignoring the obvious examples of bad religion. The only issue I take with the book, as a Catholic, is that even having been co-written by a priest, several desecriptions of Catholic and Christian beliefs are almost dangerously over simplified. One example, describes Catholics worshiping Mary which would suggest idoltry. However, Catholics beliefs toward Mary are much more complicated than worshipping her as if she were God. It's quite possible that the other religions are also over simplified for understanding at times too, but I would have expected a little better from a Catholic priest.

This I know, for the TeeVee tells me so.\\"And what are the \\"great\\" religions? According to the photos on the cover, the appellation \\"great\\" is reserved only for the big three monotheistic religions, all of which owe their \\"greatness\\" to an aggressive, external propensity to use violence (submit or die) and a very heavy, internal control mechanism based on punishment (submit or be damned). All three are inherently violent because they posit an irrevocable \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" dichotomy. Their shared core elements of immoveable authority, hierarchy, exclusive identity, and inescapable violence to any \\"others\\" outside the faith are expressed in statements like, \\"No one comes to the Father but by me,\\" \\"I Am that I Am,\\" and \\"There is no god but God.\\" Inescapable punishment in Hell by an omniscient and omnipotent god, compounded by humans' natural fear of death and the unknown, is the social control mechanism invented by the priesthood in monotheistic religions. It is the unquestioned acceptance and enforcement of this control mechanism that increases group cohesion and survival through individual obedience. Violence against \\"others\\" and control of the in-group through fear are often the requirements for being \\"great.\\"Once the priest and the rabbi establish monotheism as the definition of what constitutes a \\"great\\" religion, we can see the jockeying for \\"greatest\\" as Christianity, Judaism and Islam continue their dominating, zero-sum game among themselves--or at least among two of them as an imam was not invited to participate in writing this book. And you can bet there was a reason for this in a society where the word Muslim has replaced the word Communist to indicate the irredeemable, pure-evil, enemy \\"other.\\" In the first two photos we see Christianity and Judaism as private and individualistic, warm, intimate and with an attractive human face. In contrast, the Muslim in the third photo is faceless and prostrate. His is portrayed as a public religion where there is no separation of church and state, no line between the kingdom of god and the world of men. It is an image that supports the idea that there are Islamo-fascist states. The whole tone of the picture is stark, static and cold. Not only is Islam presented as the clear loser in the competition for \\"greatest\\" religion, but also its negative, dehumanizing treatment here is a direct affront to the Christian injunction to love your enemy.Through their choice of words and photos on the cover as well as in the pages that follow, the priest and the rabbi have betrayed \\"Religion for Dummies\\" not as an educational primer for the uninformed but as propaganda. Theirs is not a work objectively comparing religions where they equitably discuss similarities and differences and allow the reader to draw their own conclusions. Instead, the authors subtly insist on telling the reader which religion is best through their biased choice of words and the quantity and quality of their treatment of religions. By their exclusive definition and use of the word \\"great,\\" what virtue or value they grant to all other religions is irrelevant. Of course! That is the fundamental point of monotheism: proclaiming and enforcing who is greatest; whose One True God is the supreme, inflexible Authority, the ultimate Right Answer, and whose followers are the irrefutable, predestined winners.\\"Religion for Dummies\\" might be useful if it had been written by folks who weren't ideologues and didn't have a god in the fight. Reading \\"Religion for Dummies\\" in order to gain an understanding of the world's religions would be like reading \\"Football for Dummies: America's Great Teams\\" if it were written by Bill Swerski's Superfans.

Even the editors forgot to put \\"is\\" in the title. Despite this glaring oversight, I read the contents anyway.Religion is a hard topic to tackle, I will admit. Add the task of keeping a straight-faced demeanor when outlining them and, well, you've got a tough task ahead of you. I feel the authors did a fine job of outlining the major religions, though they left out such important figures as the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and Sauron. I understand page numbers for such books have to be limited somehow, but the omission seems to make the inference that they aren't all on the same level of believability. True, Jesus did die for us, but lugging around a sack of quarters for kids with teeth under their pillows is no small task. Perhaps I'm just being nitpicky though.The reasons people believe in these religions is also completely left out of the book. \\"How could this be?\\", I asked myself. If I were writing a book about Chinese food, I would have to mention the reason why it's eaten all over the world. There was no mention of \\"blindly following\\" or \\"controlling the masses\\" in the whole book. Refutability as well was left untouched. The book also omitted any mention of such upstanding folks as the Westboro Baptist church group, Jimmy Swaggart or Pat Robertson. All are excellent representations of faith-based decision making and critical thought.The largest bone to pick I have with the book is that they left out all the pictures of humans and dinosaurs co-existing. Although the relationship between the two species was tenuous at best, it should still have some airtime with the rest of the fun facts in here.In conclusion this book is interesting, but it misses a lot of key points.

Overcoming barriers, showing how Christians and Jews can get along in quite a jolly way. Except that there seems to be an ugly and bigoted underside to the dynamic duo. I just heard Rabbi Marc Gellman on the TV commenting on the election of Pope Benedict. He closed with the witty remark that he didn't think that \\"being Torquemada's successor\\" was the best qualification for being Pope. Isn't ecumenism partly about increasing mutual understanding and dispelling falsehoods and stereotypes? The fact is that Pope Benedict is no sense the successor of Torquemada. Ratzinger was Prefect of the \\"Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith\\". That body was created in the 1960s after Vatican II to replace the \\"Holy Office\\", which in turn was the historical successor of the \\"Roman Inquisition\\". Torquemada was the infamous head of the Spanish Inquisition, an insitution completely distinct from the Roman Inquisition in its origin, structure, and methods. It shows great historical ignorance to confuse the two. Moreover, as a young theologian Joseph Ratzinger famously called for the abolition of the \\"Holy Office\\".

Lee is about a trial against a biology teacher that taught evolution. Towards the end of the play it was no longer about evolution vs. religion, but the right to think. Neither religion nor evolution won. However, there wasn't a winning side, but it was left for us to decide. The point that was to be proved was that every man has the right to think. The only character in my opinion that was fully atheist (it became obvious towards the end of the play) was Hornbeck, the cynical journalist. He was not ready to back down from his point of view. Drummond, the defense lawyer, doesn't agree with Hornbeck about the townspeople and says they have the right to their belief. The townspeople were followers, but that didn't matter either (it was brought up in many scenes of the play). At the end of the play, Drummond weighed the Bible and the Origin of Species in his hands like a scale. It was significant because he was called the devil (atheist), but he didn't dismiss one book or choose between the two. He wanted to balance them, in other words, faith and thought. In my opinion, the last idea was that everyone has the right to think and it matters on how you use your ideas. You can have faith and belief, but you also have a mind. It was biased, but that represents the atmosphere of the play. I don't think it was a debate at the end; it was what you want to think of it. Interpret and understand what you thought as you read the play."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"There are very few books that I am required to read for school that I actually enjoy, and even fewer that I find myself reading all in one sitting.Inherit the Wind was one of these books.

The book has no exact setting, Hillsboro, but that Hillsboro could be anywhere at anytime so that readers can relate. This small conservative Christian town is brought into a tailspin of controversy when school teacher Bertram Cates challenges his students to think &quot;outside the box&quot;, by suggesting the evolutionists point of view, that life comes from a long, long miracle; man wasn't just put here in seven days. This one lesson he taught, brings Hillsoboro into the national spotlight with a trial that goes against all conventional ideas.This book will leave you thinking long after you've finished reading it.

But I won't go into what many here have already stated, the fact is that this book is very well written. Its characters though fictional come across as very real, each with goals and fears that lead each of them into their paths. The play and its content does what every great should do, its allows the reader to think for themselves. However, what I found most interesting is what I have always found to be true. Winning isn't everything...to be declared a winner doesn't mean that you have won if the purpose of your goal has been defeated as was shown. About the only negative thing I would have to say about this play is that it has a tendency to be biased towards the evolutionists and against the religious zealots.

Lee very carefully point out that &quot;Inherit The Wind is not history. The events which took place in Dayton, Tennessee...are clearly the genesis....It has, however, an exodus entirely its own.&quot;This should clear up the question of whether or not this play, or any other play based on historical events, can be considered a revision of reality. The playwrights saw a dramatic clash of ideas in the Scopes trial in 1925, but they used it as the basis of their drama, not the storyline. Drama requires clearly drawn characters in crisis, and that is what we have in Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady. Unlike the real trial, evolution is not on trial here, and there is no verdict rendered. This play does what all good plays should do - it makes the audience think.By carefully crafting Drummond and Brady as fully-defined characters, their legal arguments take on a higher level. They show us the human side of these people - their firm beliefs as well as their fears. Drummond believes in his client and fiercely defends him, but he also understands the faith that lead to the enactment of the law he's trying to defeat. Brady is rock-solid in his faith in God and the Bible, but we also see that he has his doubts about his own zealotry. Neither of these men are painted as fools or fanatics. This, more than any dramatic moment in the play, is what makes the play work so well. We are swept up in the drama because we understand these people...and we care about them.The issues in this play were not resolved in 1925 - nor were they in 1955 when it premiered - and they are still with us today as states such as Kansas wrestle with the battle over including &quot;creationism&quot; in the public school curriculum. That is what makes the play important.At the end of the play, Henry Drummond is left alone in the empty courtroom. He picks up the Darwin book and the Bible. He weighs them carefully in his hands, then puts them together, side by side - not one on top of the other - then slowly exits as the lights fade. That is the true question the play asks...and leaves for the audience to answer. It is simply brilliant theatre."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This story is great because, it's true. It teaches the horror of ignorance. While it may say the bible is not true, to some readers, all this book states is for people to think. It is a book about looking into new ideas, and attributing those ideas to life. So much of this book, however, is so true to life. It states, that this book could have been yesterday, it could be today, or it could be tomorrow. In other words, this is a book about how we need to consider thoughts, to continue helping our world grow. Summarizing my points would state that this is a fine book, with a quality point."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Whatever side of the isle you're on, evolution or religion, this book/play has a lesson to be learned for both sides.

The play Inherit the wind is a play that Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee wrote. When I read both the play of Inherit the wind and watched the movie of Inherit the wind, and typical scene which at first, everyone blames Cates for teaching Darwin's Theory which is not allow to teach. However at the end, they changed their mind, it provided me a chance to analyze the distinction between the minority and majority. We live in a world in which most are based on the democracy, many think that majority is righteous, for it is the way to satisfy \`more' people. In fact, I have agreed on the above notion. However, after reading the play, my thoughts have dramatically changed. Of course, the majority's opinion is valuable and significant; however, when it comes to the better method of solving, minority plays a more precious role than the method of the majority. Minority has different views from the majority. Majority can hear from minority that they could not think about in the first place. If many groups as possible. Both the majority and the minority were to exist in a community, they would find better and suitable solutions for everyone. In addition, freedom of thoughts is also worthy to note about. Every members of society has rights to \`freedom of thought' and \`freedom of speech'. However, in the play and the movie, Cates has violated such freedom by the town people who are, in fact, pious and religious. Therefore, contents about the disturbance of Cates's freedom by town people derived me into the thought that religion can't be considered as a part of the law, but it is a decent model of advice that provide one to live in an uprightness manner. The law should be equal to everyone."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Inherit the wind is a very accurate play. Many times readers expect a play that follows a direct plot and goes from point A to point B. However that is not how real life is, it can flop from one topic, relationship or theme to another, which is why I enjoyed the play. It explores many points of views of what happened in Hillsboro, to its people and to the outsiders that looked in. One of the parts that I found unfavorable was the character of, Hornbeck who was often rude and an inaccurate portrayal of the big city graduate. There was so much back and forth banter between the characters of Hornbeck, Drummond, and Brady I would have liked to explain the relationship between them and why it was hinted with animosity. During most of the play it was Hornbeck and Drummond vs. Brady. I also enjoy this play because this topic (the argument between belief and fact, basically right and wrong) and how it can affect thousands of people by bidding them against each other. There are many other play the play on the emotions of a small town and the opinion of what seems to be the rest of the country, but this does it in a sometimes entertaining form. Finally I believe that people could interpret this book in many ways, however, many themes could go under many relationships throughout the book."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I thought I would hate it. But instead, I loved it!

Drummond's stand that neither the secular fanaticism of the newsman nor the religious fanaticism of the preacher is a good idea is a good stand and makes for a character who comes out as truly idealistic and heroic. Unfortunately, for those who take this book to be a history, it isn't. The fictional representations of Bryan and Darrow diverge greatly from the truth - Bryan was hardly a right-wing nut and Darrow wasn't as open-minded and accepting as this book portrays him to be. Robert Cherny's biography of Bryan is helpful in explaining the actual case (hardly religion vs. science, as Bryan himself said &quot;religion has no quarrel with science&quot;) and the progressive character of Bryan. Also books by the likes of Patrick Glynn, Ian Barbour, Gerald Schroeder and Robert Jastrow help show this in modern times, that science has done a better job of defending religion than of bringing it down.

A must read if you are trying to understand what the intelligent design debate is all about."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This is great playwrighting. A taut, exciting, play that raises important questions, it is still timely today, as Darwin's theory is still under attack by those who believe in Intelligent Design. Einstein once called Piaget's theory of child development \\"So simple, only a genius could think of it.\\" So it is with Darwin. It has withstood countless attacks, and there has been no credible alternative theory proposed.Well, back to the play. All the characters (except Rachel, the love interest, and her preacher father) are based on the main characters in the Monkey Trial. Some of the dialogue comes from the actual transcript of the trial, but most of it was written by Lawrence and Lee. Luckily, it is magnificently dramatic.For those who want a more factual rendition of what went on in Dayton, read \\"Summer for the Gods\\", an excellent book that will fill in the gaps. Like the fledgling ACLU represented Scopes, not Darrow, who, quite to the ACLU's chagrin, decided to \\"offer\\" his services because of his opposition to Fundamentalists trying to insert religion in the public schools. (The ACLU saw it more as a free speech issue.) It is a fascinating book and should be read along with \\"Inherit the Wind\\" to get another perspective on what went on that summer."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Inherit the Wind is a fictional play of a real trial that did happen in the early part of 20th century, tackling on the education of the students on evolution. While I did like the play, I prefer to read the real thing: the transcripts, the description of the atmosphere, and the whole nine yards. What I really didn't like about Inherit the Wind is how childish it seems. Most of the time, I was feeling, \\"Is this a kangaroo court or what?\\" Also, I didn't like a few of the characters, most especially E.K. Hornbeck the reporter from Baltimore. I like to say that I felt a deep meaning within the play, but that's not the case. It's basically a mocking of the religious people and their concept of life, and take that away, there isn't much else to speak of in the play because there is not enough of substance. In the end of the play, the idea of evolution eventually wins. Of course, I am all for it because evolution makes the most logical sense.

Although the way I've just described the plot sounds simple, this play is anything but simple. It has many different character relationships and dense themes that it confronts in a matter of only 3 acts. While that may work for a piece of literature like the Odyssey, I found the play harder to wrap my mind around. The story switched tones and themes so quickly that I found myself getting whiplash. Now I liked the story, and I am interested in all of the themes presented in it, for example, majority vs. minority, the separation of church and state, and the relationship between the Americans in cities and country folk. However I don't find it conducive to good writing to read about too many of these dense subjects in a matter of 118 pages. However, I did like the characters and their developments throughout the story. Jerome Laurence and Robert E. Lee told the story of a small town getting not only its fifteen minutes of fame, but scratching the surface of one of the older arguments that have been going on in our country; is there truly a separation of church and state?If you want to hear a lot of ideas in a short period of time, this play is for you, its easy to read, however if you are someone who really likes to ponder and study one theme or issue at a time, this play will not allow you at kind of \\"luxury.\\""},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this in my freshman English class years ago, but it stands out as a major turning point for me.

My review of \\"Inherit the Wind\\" is concise and to the point. Oh, I get it. That person is a fanatic, and he or she doesn't like that state of mind exposed.This explosive drama is a re-enactment of one of the twentieth century's greatest courtroom dramas--the 1925 Scopes Trail. The collision of William Jennings Bryan (a religious fundamentalist) and Clarence Darrow (an agnostic) is wonderfully enacted. Scopes, a high-school teacher, was put on trail for teaching evolution.The preacher's daughter is in love with Scopes, and the sparks fly over the conflict. The preacher's religious fanaticism threatens to destroy his own family. Thus, the line from Proverbs 11:29: \\"He that troubleth his own house Shall inherit the wind.\\"I would also highly recommend Eric Hoffer's classic little book, \\"The True Believer.\\" A must for educated readers.The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)"},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Inherit the wind was written as a play in 1955 and is still relevant today. The play was freely adapted from the &quot;Scopes Monkey Trial&quot; of 1925. The teacher was placed on trial for teaching evolution and not creationism. This argument continues to rage today after the turn of the twenty first century! The beauty of this play is that it is simplicity itself. The play is a very fast read and is very enjoyable. The play covers some very tough subjects, but does it in such a way that the reader deos not get bogged down in heavy philosophical discussions. They are still there, but handled in an ingenious way. What I loved about this play was that the issues were not really about the teacher, but the clash of personalities of the major players. The teacher is nothing more than a background player here and the evangelist and the defense lawyer are the true stars. Makes one think when the same issue comes up after eighty years since the original trial of Scopes what is really being argued. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Despite the brilliance of the cross-examination of Darrow (or here, Drummond), I think that the modifications from the true historical facts change the story a bit too much. Also, the idea that there is a lot of hype surrounding the trial is not conveyed very well. The ending also proves to be slightly out-of-character and contradictory; it is not so much that the characters should not be more moderate than one would stereotype them to be, but in the end it seems that they take on new illogical personalities."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"INHERIT THE WIND does an excellent job of presenting some accounting of the actual Scopes trial, of the intellectual and poilitcal competition between two great men, of rural life in the 1920's Bible Belt, and of some semblance of the science versus religion debate. However, a more philosophical view could be that the story depicts the dangers of fanaticism in any area of society. The story makes the reader realize that an open mind is the true corridor to progression. Likewise, a mind so narrow and closed that it does not allow for change in either natural law or human law, is a mind that is self-destructive and a potential threat to all others influenced by it. Thus, the Reverend and Mr. Brady lost their followings and indeed, themselves, because of their religious fanaticism."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"I don't normally care about the books I have to read for school. In fact, in the past there have been books that I've purposely tried to forget, but when I had to read this book for a 10th grade religion class, I was surprised to find I liked it.Inherit the Wind is a short and sweet book which not only makes a good point, but makes it quickly and clearly. This is something I can respect...after sorting out Jane Austen's mess of romantic words and snotty characters in Pride and Prejudice, it was a relief to say the least.It takes place in small town called Hillsboro in Tennessee and revolves around a freethinking teacher named Bertram Cates who deliberately broke the law by teaching about evolution in his classroom. His trial becomes known nation-wide for both political and religious reasons. His lawyer is smart, practical but heartless Henry Drummond and the prosecutor is the likable Mathew Harrison Brady, both huge political figures. The trial erupts into a rude awakening for the ignorant residents of Hillsboro and changes the way they all think about the world.It is one of only three or four required reading books I've managed to enjoy and this is why I recommend it completely."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This book touches upon subjects that are greatly scrutinized throughout the world today. It deals with the conflicting ideas of Evolutionism and Divine Creation. First of all, I found this book tolerable because it isn&#8217;t bias towards either view.I believe in Evolution because it answers questions that Divine Creation can&#8217;t. I just can not fathom the idea that everything on this planet just appeared one day because God thought it would work. I believe that every species on Earth, and even Earth itself evolved from something else, it was not just put here.The protagonist wants to teach the Darwin&#8217;s Theory of Evolution in his classroom. He is put on trial for breaking the school board&#8217;s set of codes on the subject (which in ancient times would have been equal to a trial for heresy and spreading ideas against the will of the Church.) Does it not say in our great constitution that church is separate from state? Teachers should be allowed to teach Darwinism to those that want to be enlightened, and those who wish to remain ignorant can find education elsewhere.Anyway, I liked the book and how it served the interests of both views. I found the ending a little vague, but the rest was flawless. The setting, Tennessee, was factual and believable. It is a great work of literature, and addresses subjects that were casually swept under the table before. I encourage you to make your own judgments about this book, not to necessarily follow all of mine."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Perhaps the most interesting thing about this play is how VERY few people \\"get it\\" even now.At one point in the confrontation between Drummond and Brady, Drummond - on the subject of Cates' right to think, and to say what he thinks - demands of Brady:\\"Suppose Mr. Cates had enough influence and lung power to railroad through the State Legislature a law that only Darwin should be taught in schools!\\"\\"Ridiculous, ridiculous!\\" answers Brady.Yet here we are, fifty years later, with evolutionists demanding exactly the same exclusivity for the teaching of their ideas as Brady wants for the teaching of religion - in this play. So do we NOW have freedom to think what we choose to think, and to speak about what we think?As other reviewers have said, this play isn't, and was never intended as, an accurate representation of what happened at the Scopes trial of 1925.And neither is it simply a story about narrow-minded, ignorant fundamentalists (which meant something quite different in 1925 compared with now) against open-minded, rational scientists.It is about narrow-mindedness and intolerance no matter where it comes from.On this basis it is a pity that the play, and to a greater extent the film give such a one-sided portrayal of Drummond - emotional but deeply caring, rather self-effacing and above all reasonable (nothing at all like the real-life Darrow), whilst Brady is a glutinous, smug, buffoon who was once great but has lost his way (about the only time Brady is shown in a sympathetic light is at the end of Act 1 when he rescues Rachel Brown (Cates' fiancee) from the \\"righteous\\" fury of her \\"hell and damnation\\" father, the Reverend Brown.I have to wonder how much it might ease the tension between creationists and evolutionists in America if this play were presented in schools for what it really is - a reaction against the hate mongering and intolerance of the McCarthy \\"witch hunt\\" of the late 1940's and early 50's instead of treating it like a documentary and interpreting it in the narrowest sense - as a battle between religion and science.As Lee and Lawrence wrote in their \\"Production Notes by the Playwrights\\":\\"The most eloquent line in the play is unspoken: DRUMMOND's weighing of the books [the Bible and The Origin of Species] at the end. He should be holding them in his upturned palms, balancing them like the scales of Lady Justice, then SLAPPING them together SIDE BY SIDE. Don't put either Darwin or the Bible on top.\\"'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This is the dramatized version of the infamous Scopes \\"Monkey\\" Trial of 1925. Two observations. One, this is dramatized history, so you are not reading the court transcripts, which are available at your local law library. Secondly, although I do not believe in evolution, I find the play fascinating. Indeed, you might say that I am fascinated with the fascination around this event, as if a court could decide the truthfulness of a scientific theory!This is a play about ideas, and many sub ideas. Are we free to teach what we believe? Should the state underwrite every theory? Should we engage in civil disobedience? What makes a just law? Is there really a conflict between scientists and saints? Religion and Science? The Bible and \\"Origin of Species?\\" Which is authoritative-the Bible or Science, or some combination of both? And the crucial question: Is evolution true?We are familiar with the set up, although in the play, the names have been changed to protect the innocent: Bertrand Cates (Scopes) teaches evolution, and is arrested for breaking the law. The ACLU hires Henry Drummond (Clarence Darrow) to defend Cates. The broader aspects and implications of the discussion of evolution was understood by Matthew Harrison Brady (William Jennings Bryan), who say this as \\"a contest between evolution and Christianity . . . a dual to the death.\\"An OJ-esque circus atmosphere surrounded the trial, as would be expected. The trial went along rather plainly, until Drummond decides to put Brady on the stand as an expert witness on the Bible. He then begins to cross examine and impugn the Bible, citing contradictions and inconsistencies in the Bible, much in the same way Thomas Paine had don in \\"Age of Reason.\\"Of course, the fundamentalist Bryan cannot defend the inconsistencies in the Bible, so he is left to an emotional ranting. Despite Drummonds' maneuver, which ranks up there with \\"You're no Jack Kennedy,\\" Cates is convicted, and Brady dies in the courthouse giving a frantic speech defending the Bible.I believe all playwrights are subversive, and that is what makes them so exciting! Indeed, this small drama is far better recognized and knows than the original events. This play has for all purposes taken a life on it's own. It is a good work for what it does-to show the importance of standing up for conscience and freedom of the mind. Even thought the world is mostly free now, there are still pockets of tyranny that suck the souls out of their citizens. Plays like this make you think.As I mentioned, this is drama, and dramatic licenece has been taken. Some of the facts taken out of the play are rather revealing. For instance, the ACLU wanted to do a test case challenging the Butler Law, and solicited volunteers in a newspaper ad. So this really wasn't solely a matter of conscience, or freedom of thought, but also a political agenda on the part of the ACLU. Another very tendcer fact that was left out was that William Jennings Bryant paid Scopes $100 fine. No hard feelings there. But the way, Bryan did die several days after the trial quietly in his sleep, and not grandstanding at the courthouse.The only other aspect of the play that bothered me is that there is only one witty character, namely Drummond, who gets all the bumper-sticker lines and clinch quotes. This is a mistake that many playwrights make, such as Robert Bolt who gave Sir Thomas More all of the good quips and quotes, but ignored everyone else. I know that this is done to highlight and emphasize the protagonist, but I think it would be far, far interesting to have two witty characters that are so similar that it is hard to tell who is the protagonist and who is the antagonists."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This book has a wonderful plot with a surprising twist turn.

Their ability to think is there, but dormant and it does not make sense to them. However, as the Hillsboro townspeople participate and watch the Cates Trial, they slowly begin to think about what they believe in and the way they act.This book also clearly portrays the theme of American Religiousness VS Separation of Church and the State. Throughout the book, I could see that people were thinking that the Church and the State as one body, and that religion is the most \\"holy\\" thing that should not be questioned at all. If church and state are two different bodies, this argument over Creationism VS Evolutionism would not exist. Drummond, the attorney who defends Cates continuously questions his beliefs on behalf of the trial to prove his point whereas Brady, who does not believe in Evolutionism, leaves his belief of Creationism alone, thinking that what he believes is unquestionable.Hornbeck, an arrogant reporter from Chicago presumes that Drummond believes that people of Hillsboro are going up the mainstream, and are very ignorant about their Christian beliefs. However, Drummond chides at Hornbeck, telling him that the Hillsboro townspeople have their right to have their own beliefs, and in the same manner, other people have the right to believe in Evolutionism.The 1st Amendment of United States Constitution states the freedom of religion.

Despite my knowledge of the history of the trial which, as an earlier critic on this forum has claimed, was not the sensational trial it was made out ot be in this play, I found the merit within this romantic portrayal of the Scopes &quot;monkey trial&quot; to seriously outweigh its downfalls. The play is not meant to be a historical account and, in fact, it is stated in the foreward that it is based on the events of the trial but is not meant to be a recount of history. Had it been, the character's names would most probably have been unaltered and the story would have failed to relate its most primary, most valuable, and most eloquently delivered theme. The Lawrence/Lee play struggles and succeeds, quite brilliantly, in teaching its audience how easily one can be clouded by the schemas which they create for themselves. Inherit the Wind, therefore, is almost a study in the innerworkings of the critical aspect of the brain and it cleverly paints the picture of man's stubborn nature of defending an institution to ridiculous lengths. The hero of this story is neither religious dogma or scientific pomposity but rather the loyalty of man towards his convictions. This, too becomes a vice within a virtue; here lies the intrigue of the play. The antagonist and protagonist are not only an intangible character, but also the very same entity. This story is not without its faults, but it can not be denied that its examination of the human mind is both accurate and eye-opening. I dont find it at all presumptuous to relate this play to a work such as &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; in the respect that it is such a vivid portrait of an aspect of human nature. Lawrence and Lee did not set out to make a history; they set out to manipulate history into an allegory for posterity, a task which they completed with both entertainment and literary brilliance. To hold against the authors the discrepancies within the play, in regards to historical accuracy, is to fault countless authors, Shakespeare included, for using history as allegory."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Please note, I think \\"Inherit the Wind\\", taken solely as a piece of drama, is a great play in all respects.These comments are specifically about the SparkNotes guide to the play.\\"Inherit the Wind\\" is NOT about the Scopes \\"Monkey\\" Trial - and the way in which this guide thoroughly confuses the two does a great disservice to anyone who reads it.To fully understand the origins of the play you have to know that it was written, and ready for performance NOT in 1955, when it was finally produced on stage, and NOT in 1960, when it became a film, but in 1950. And here's why that is important:In 1955, when the play appeared on Broadway, the McCarthy witch hunt had collapsed in ignomany six months or more in the past, and Senator Joseph McCarthy was no longer a threat to anyone. In 1960 McCarthy was not only out of politics - he had died approximately 3 years earlier.BUTIn 1950, just writing this play was a major act of bravery, because the House UnAmerican Activities Committee was operating at full throttle. And Joseph McCarthy was one of the most powerful men in America, a man who could destroy people whole lives just by \\"suggesting\\" that they were, or had been, \\"commie sympathisers\\" - a part of the alleged \\"communist conspiracy\\".Is it any wonder, then, that Lawrence and Lee took the precaution of dressing up their expose of McCarthyism - the bullying, the innuendo, the bigotry, the incitement to hatred and so on - as what was by then an almost forgotten event from the 1920's, 25 years before?These notes are a disservice, in equal measure, because they confuse the events of the real life trial with the events in the play; and because they conceal the real motivation behind the writing of the play and the courage of the authors in daring to write the play at all *at that time*, and ignore the important messages that Lawrence and Lee wanted to get across, not only about intolerance in general, but also about McCarthyism in particular.If you really want a study guide for \\"Inherit the Wind\\", I'd recommend the CliffsNotes version. It isn't perfect, but it's a whole lot better than this."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This is a well-written play based on real life events that explores important ideas fairly, and in an engaging manner. Basically, a teacher, Bertram Cates, is on trial for teaching evolution in the small town of Hillsboro \\"not long ago\\" (but likely in the 1950s). The prosecutor is Mathew Harrison Brady, a Christian who interprets the bible literally, and Cates' lawyer is Henry Drummond, an 'agnostic' who values the right to think.A casual reader may think this play celebrates 'the triumph' of evolution over religion, but a deeper reading shows that what is celebrated is not evolution per se, but the right to think, the right to contemplate and learn about our world.Likewise, religion is not denigrated per se, but rather, the authors criticize a dogmatic acceptance of religious tenants, particularly religious history. In fact, in the end, cynical, arrogant, cold hearted atheism is shown to be problematic as well: religion very much still has a place in teaching us in how to relate to our fellow human beings, which is with justice and generosity.I do have one criticism- I would say that some characters, particularly the prosecutor Brady and the residents of the town of Hillsboro are painted one dimensionally as foolish, thoughtless buffoons. The authors make this very clear, stating in the stage directions that the town itself, not just the defendant Cates, is on trial.On the other hand, equally flawed characters, like the cynical atheist journalist Hornbeck, are not presented in such a negative fashion (although I personally found his 'poetry' throughout the play as jarring and annoying.) And certainly the authors have nothing but praise for the lawyer Drummond.A more fair portrayal of all characters concerned would have made this great work even stronger."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Inherit the Wind, a book written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is based on the famous Scopes Trial. In this novel, Henry Drummond is the lawyer fighting for what is right. Inherit the Wind takes place in the summer of 1925, in a small town. The majority of the book is inside the courtroom. The major conflict is between Henry Drummond and Matthew Brady who believes in God and wants the law enforced. The theme of Inherit the Wind is that just because you don't believe in something, doesn't make it wrong for someone else to. Lawrence and Lee use foreshadowing in this book. The people in the court take their jackets off because it is so hot to foreshadow that the trial is going to get heated. I found this book to be very easy to read and understand. It has a valuable lesson and I would suggest this book. \\"He that troubleth his own house, shall inherit the wind.\\""},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Inherit the Wind is a classic, meaningful play. Indeed, it has aged over the years, yet it has enough redeemable qualities to make it still to this day a controversial and intriguing play. I've heard some say that Robert E. Lee and Jerome Lawrence's adaptation of the Scopes Monkey trial that occured in the 1920's isn't accurate. It probably indeed is not, yet Inherit the Wind displays how things change with time and peoples's beliefs so well. It is truly one of the most history revealing plays of last century. Evolution coming into our schools and God literally being pushed out was an important movement for the folks back then which continues to affect all of us now. I certainly don't agree with how the play ended, and have a strong belief that despite all these evolutionary ideas that scream they must be true, God still created the Earth in 7 days as he spoke of in the book of Genesis. A great compromise was made on the part of people during the actual time of the real trial, accepting evolution. Those with need for scientific evidence could breathe a little easier when the &quot;Big Bang&quot; crept into our schools, but it seems more importantly to me the word &quot;Faith&quot; was simply chainsawed apart. Two letters from each side. &quot;I&quot; only remained, a fact which is even more evident today. As we look at ourselves 80 years or so after that trail I think all of us, especially those who &quot;live and die&quot; by evolution should be haunted by Matthew Brady's quote as he stood tall in the name of the Lord, &quot;Our children will turn into a Godless mob with no direction without the teachings of the Bible (paraphrasing). Most seem to think evolution is right and will propell us through the next century. Yet, what Brady describes, children who are a Godless mob with no direction, isn't that what has happened some 80+ years after the trial took place?"},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Almost all of the scientific evidence brought forward during the time of the trial has been discarded.There was another very disturbing thing about Inherit the Wind. It caricatured Christians as self-righteous, intolerant and mean-spirited. The two leading Christian characters in the film rant like lunatics much of the time. Phillip E. Johnson's bookDEFEATING DARWINISM BY OPENING MINDS (available at Amazon) writes about how Christians were stereotyped.The play did get one thing right. It is indeed a \`crime' (to use their word) to censor an opposing view in the classroom.

The end is boring, predictable, and plain dumb; and the dialogue--which should be good because that's all a play has for it--is redundant and boring.

The entire thing was orchestrated by the Darwinists as a test case. The law on which the trial was based was merely symbolic; it wasn't meant to be enforced. The trial was anything but dramatic. It was an open and shut case: the prosecution won and Scopes was fined. The law was eventually revoked. Those who see the Scopes Trial as a victory of Science and Reason over religious dogmatism and antiquated fundamentalism don't know the facts."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"I read the script and saw the movie when I was in high school and it masterfully reinforced my own bias against the Bible and &quot;fundamentalism.&quot; This was, of course, its objective.How interesting to learn later in life that Inherit the Wind, which purported to be about the Scopes Trial, was filled with fact-twisting, outright historical falsehoods, and straw-man arguments in an attempt to discredit a biblical view of origins and biblical Christianity as a whole.Numerous books and scholarly articles have been written to substantiate the indictment of Inherit the Wind as an intellectually dishonest fraud, including a recent one by a secular scholar. But still, most readers unknowingly assume it is an accurate representation of what happened at the Scopes Trial. They also assume it is a fair representation of the debate between evolutionists and those who are skeptical of the largely undocumented claims of evolution.The book insultingly portrays biblical Christians as ignoramuses and exalts cynical atheists as enlightened thinkers. Ironically, Inherit the Wind is a prime example of just the reverse: secular, atheistic &quot;fundamentalism&quot; which ridicules and unfairly caricatures anyone who dares raise a voice against its unbending dogma. Sadly, it is still a part of the anti-Christian canon of secular scripture and influences unwary readers who are unaware of the cogent scientific and philosophical case against evolution by respected scientists such as Michael Behe, Phillip Johnson, Michael Denton, William Dembski, and others who have books distributed by Amazon.

This movie, produced by an atheist Christian-hater, is simply a thinly disguised attack on Christians. A teacher who shows this to his class is perpetuating this prejudice. The film does everything it can to portray southern American Christians as hateful, bigoted, intolerant, narrow-minded, ignorant, anti-scientific, and utterly unsophisticated. But, isn't such a hateful portrayal itself bigoted, hateful, & intolerant? Is such an image REALLY accurate about ANYONE? Here in Canada we are taught not to tolerate religious bigotry any more than racial bigotry. Anyway, \\"hate & mockery\\" truly describe the spirit of this film - it is so extreme, it is almost unique in this way. As for its content:The film is technically fine - a courtroom drama. But unfortunately, it is not faithful to the facts of the trial; in fact, the whole picture is essentially a lie. For instance, no one arrested Scopes, the whole trial was initiated by the ACLU in order to overturn a penaltyless anti-evolution law. The ACLU convinced Scopes to play this role and even the prosecution cooperated as a test case. Scopes was not poor and defenseless either, a whole team of lawyers and scientists was brought from NYC by the ACLU. Thus, it wasn't really a normal trial - this is why the defense freely admitted Scopes \\"guilt\\". Scopes himself hadn't even taught evolution, the \\"defense\\" attorneys had coached the children three months later to say he had (read perjury). What Scopes had done is teach from a book which did teach evolution (the same textbook also declared evolution proved whites were superior to other races, by the way). Anyway, Scopes himself said in his autobiography that he was treated very well by everyone in town. As for the angry fundamentalist preacher and the violent lynch-mob, these were complete fiction - a straw man falsely representing only what the filmmaker WANTED to envision - in short, a lie. And...It was Darrow, not Bryant, who was cited for contempt for his rudeness. Darrow was an avowed atheist who admitted in his own autobiography that his real goal for the case was to attack what he called \\"fundamentalists\\". In fact, the last day of the trial this man broke his word by refusing to testify. By contrast, Bryant, Darrow's opponent, was no intolerant, ignorant buffoon, as he is portrayed in the film - Bryant was chosen as the democratic candidate for president three times and was Wilson's Secretary of State. And the scientists? Darrow wouldn't even let them testify because he knew what Bryant could do to them on the stand! The whole movie deliberately twists the facts much like a Nazi or Soviet styled propaganda film. This movie is simply a deliberate slander: it has nothing to do with science - it was designed to slander Bible believers. Think about what you are really doing before you embrace this film. Using this film in a science class does not teach science; rather, it trains children to despise Christians.There are few films I'd actually condemn - this is one of about ten. And by the way, before you mock creationists, intelligent design proponents, religious people, or atheists, be intellectually honest by taking a couple of hours to hear the specifics of what your opponents are saying; have you ever even heard what they have to say? Have you? Use science to carry on this controversy - not ridicule. Ridiculing others, as the filmmaker has so eagerly done, is just plain wrong."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This book is extremely confusing and very hard to follow.

That's a testament to the fantastic writing, of course, but unfortunately also shows how little we've learned since then."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Based upon the Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, TN, Inherit the Wind looks at the trial as a battle over the suppression of ideas that is reminiscent of Arthur Miller's The Crucible. However, it also includes some interesting thoughts reagarding fundamentalist interpretations of the bible. Some of these were taken from the actual testimony from the trial, although the book does take some liberties with history in order to make its point. Its themes are universal and the book/play definitely brings up some ideas that are still worthy of consideration today."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"In a world that is still divided over the wide range dilemma of religion, Inherit the Wind is brilliant in the manner where it analyzes its complexity. The premise is relatively simple. Based on the infamous Scopes Monkey Trial of 1945, the plot charges forward when a young teacher, Cates, breaks a local rule banning the teaching of evolution in the classroom. He is arrested, and placed on trial within a not-so-welcoming town. Yet the real drama takes center stage when the trial moves beyond violating a local rule. Matthew Harrison, the national fundamentalist hero, views this trial as an opportunity to gain popularity across fundamentalist Christianity and decides to take on the case. His staunch orthodox is intensely rivaled by Henry Drummond, the avid atheist set on transforming the small town's approach to the bible and opposing view points. The novel's authors, Lawrence and Lee, take great care to expand the issue over the theory evolution to a broader context of the various forms of biblical interpretation. Lawrence and Lee bring up dilemmas such as whether or not the bible and religion itself have the capacity to correlate. The idea that the authors expanded the issue of evolution to a higher complexity focusing on biblical interpretation is in my opinion the greatest portion of the play, and deserves the reader's attention throughout.Yet, while the variety of opinions were equally considered in the plot, they aren't the only portions that add to the novel's complexity and beauty. The famous political leaders themselves, Harrison and Drummond, are given traits that give justice to the men that they were based on. William Jennings Bryan, Harrison's character, was known to the public in the same form that Harrison was portrayed. Darrow, represented by Drummond, was a passionate atheist concerned for the law. The authors made it a point to stay true to the politicians' personas while at the same time steering the play away from a typical historical representation.While in my opinion, the play had a liberal bias, it in no way went out to outright ridicule a conservative interpretation. What it did instead was demand that the general public remain open minded. It argues that people of all religious and political ideologies come together and discuss differences that in no way impede others from freely practicing what they believe. This in combination with the criticisms of our nation's justice system garner it the raves it deserves."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This play is great. I read it in 10th grade and i loved it. It inspired me to become a lawyer and defend what i believe in. Lawrence and Lee did a wonderful job depicting such a historical event such as the Scopes Monkey Trial. This play is awesome and i recommend it to everyone! DEFEND WHAT YOU BELIEVE!!"},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"An explosive drama portraying the events of the famous 1925 \\"monkey trials\\", Inherit the Wind isolates the importance of examining the standards of society in order to encourage the progression of the human race as an educated people. \\"He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise in heart\\". A proverb used twice throughout the book, this quote captures the message of the story, and is the reason that the tale of a humble schoolteacher from a small Tennessee town shall never be forgotten. He that questions the ways of the world in which he lives, shall inherit the wisdom, knowledge, and reason that others may never hope to achieve.A quick read, but a lot to think about. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Inherit the Wind was definately one of the finest plays (books, for that matter) that I have read. It's a top notch read and everyone should take a stab at it at least once. Definately a fine read if you're one of the debate types :)."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This is a work of literature that deserves merit. The characters were realistic and funny. Bertram Cates is a teacher who taught Darwin's Theory instead of the creation story from the Bible. This is against the law in his small town of Hillsboro. A famous lawyer comes to defend him, but an eloquent speaker and presidential candidate is on the prosecution. It's a heated arguement between strictly religous people and those who believe in evolution. Anybody who likes to read drama and historical fiction(as it's based on the Scopes Monkey Trial) should read this book. It really makes you think."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This is a good book and a fun read. Based on the famous Scopes Monkey Trial it tells the story of a man on trial for sharing with his classroom the story of evolution. Written originally as a play it has also been the basis for two movies that I plan to soon watch. Reading this story has caused me seek out other books and information that is based on the actual trial that took place early in the 20th century. When a story does that to me then I know that I have found something special."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"A great retelling of the Scopes Trial. I loved it"},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Based on the Scopes trial of 1925 a young teacher is accused of teaching Darwin's evolution theory in a USA school. The play revolves mostly around the foiled attempts of the defending lawyer (in real life the famous Leopold-Loew defending lawyer, Clarence Darrow) to get expert witnesses on the stand who will defend the theory. In desperation he is eventually forced to put the prosecuting lawyer, a self professed religious expert, on the stand and he takes him through a cross examination which touches sheer brilliance. If court dramas make your day it will be worth your while to plod through the play - not everyone's cup of tea, alternatively rent the movie and sit back and enjoy the intellectual encounter."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"&quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; the play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, premiered on Broadway during the 1955-56 theater season. But the play's genesis (no pun intended) lies in the events of 1925. In that year, a high school teacher named John Scopes was put on trial in Tennessee for violating a law that forbade the teaching of Darwinian evolution. With William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense, this became one of the most important trials in United States history. The trial remains a key battle in the ongoing war of biblical literalism versus science and reason.The play freely adapts the details of history. The authors even change the names of the principal characters involved: Bryan becomes &quot;Matthew Harrison Brady,&quot; Darrow becomes &quot;Henry Drummond,&quot; etc. But the core events of that historic trial remain firmly embedded in the play.&quot;Inherit&quot; is an excellent play that is very readable in book form. Lawrence and Lee write superb dialogue, and create vivid characters in Brady, Drummond, and the rest. The play is an effective satire of religious fundamentalism.With the continuing efforts of religious fundamentalists to force their views on the general public (both in the United States and elsewhere), &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; remains as relevant as ever. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"On a number of levels, this is a great story. Some people see it only as a take on the Scopes trial. The characters are fictitious, but the story is largely based on facts. The readers that only see this as a book about the monkey trial miss the point.Those who view this book as promoting evolutionism, see Chrisitians portrayed as narrow-minded and intolerant. This is no more of a stereotype than a Middle Easterner playing the role of a terrorist in a James Bond film. In the Scopes Trial, the Chirstians were intolerant of evolution being taught. Tolerant Christians, which still comprise the majority, would not exactly play the role well.The point of the story is clearly laid out in the final pages of the book. The agnostic defense attorney Henry Drummond (who represents Clarence Darrow in the actual Scopes Trial) is talking to the arrogant reporter E. K. Hornbeck. Hornbeck assumes Drummond agrees with his view that the peopleof Hillsboro are backwards and ignorant in their Christian beliefs. Drummond lashes out at Hornbeck, telling him the people of Hillsboro have every right to have their beliefs. In the same way, people have a right to believe in evolution.The 1st Amendment provides freedom of religion, or freedom not to subscribe to any particular religious beliefs. This book is a powerful statement not about evolution, but the right to think. Whether you fall on either side of the argument for evolution or have compromised between the sides, the story is a lesson worth noting."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Though it is based on the Scopes Trial, which took place in Tennessee in 1925, INHERIT THE WIND is essentially a work of fiction; even the names of the principal characters have been changed (John Scopes is now Bertram Cates; Clarence Darrow is Henry Drummond; William Jennings Bryan becomes Matthew Harrison Brady). In addition, the setting of the play is non-specific: a certain southern town, \\"not long ago.\\" IDEAS are what the play is about, and like most great works of art, INHERIT THE WIND does not offer simple answers. Just as Drummond argues for \\"the right to think,\\" so does the play allow the reader/audience member to consider many possibilities. For instance, in the play's final moments Drummond places both a copy of Darwin's book and a Bible in his briefcase, then leaves the courtroom. This suggests the possibility that science and religion might be compatible. Because he is willing to consider both theories, Drummond is very unlike both Brady, who believed in a literal interpretation of the Bible, and the cynical reporter E.K. Hornbeck (originally H.L. Mencken -- the \\"Greek chorus character,\\" or commentator, who speaks in free verse), who completely rejects Brady's ideas. It is in fact Brady who emerges as a true tragic figure; it is also Brady who undergoes change and is therefore the most complex character in the play. INHERIT THE WIND has everything: a tragic hero, colorful characters and dialogue, gripping courtroom scenes, and a skillfully foreshadowed, climactic death. Also recommended: the 1960 film version, starring Spencer Tracy as Drummond and Frederic March as Brady."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"\\"He that troubleth his own home shall inherit the wind:And the fool shall be servant to the wise in heart.\\"Proverbs 11:29In Inherit the Wind, Bertram Cates, a small-time schoolteacher, teaches Darwinism and dares to challenge his upbringing in the small town of Hillsboro. The mob mentality of overzealous religious people causes them to object. The protagonist of the story is Henry Drummond, the defending attorney for Bertram Cates. The antagonists are Matthew Harrison Brady, the prosecuting attorney, Reverend Jeremiah Brown, who condemns to Hell all people who dare to challenge his strict interpretations of the Bible, and Hornbeck, the forever cynic of everyone's thoughts and feelings but his own.Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee are not supporters of Darwinism. They just want to convey, through their story, that things and thoughts should not be condemned merely because they are different. In their writing, the authors used flashbacks through Henry Drummond and metaphors through many of the characters in order to communicate their feelings. This book conveys a message to its audience that is well-worth reading."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"I'd have to say that this is one of the best books i've read this year. No, it is not a historical account, and I am somewhat surprised that people looked at it that way at all.I think it portrays the &quot;bible beaters&quot; as ignorant for a reason: fundamentalism tends to breed ignorance. Oh, and maybe I'm the only one who noticed, but there are still people who refuse to think about evolution at all and instead take the word of the Bible literally without thinking. In fact, there are many such people, especially in my home state of Utah, so this book was particularly meaningful to me because of my experience in junior high/high school. (it is also good to remember that fundamentalism is not limited to religion.)This is not to say that it is a proponent of atheism, either. If you notice, all of the characters believe in God with the exception of Hornbeck, and he isn't any sort of hero. Rather, the heros are those who can think for themselves and balance science with religion without harming the work of either. Evolution and Creation are simply a structure in which to discuss the issue of free thinking. That is what this book/play is about -- the ability to think for oneself.Happy reading!Scott"},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"In this introduction to &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee attempt to put the play into historical perspective: &quot;'Inherit the Wind' is hot history. The events which took place in Dayton, Tennessee...are clearly the genesis of the play [but] it has...an exodus entirely its own.&quot; The playwrights took only a handful of phrases from the trial transcript and declared that &quot;The collision of Bryan and Darrow at Dayton was dramatic, but it was not a drama.&quot; In the play William Jennings Bryan becomes Matthew Harrison Brady, Clarence Darrow was transformed into Henry Drummond, H.L. Mencken changed to E.K. Hornbeck, and John Scopes was now Bertram Cates. However, from the play's first performance in 1955 it has been impossible to dissociate the characters from their historical counterparts.The Scopes &quot;Monkey&quot; Trial did not pop up in American history books until the late 1950s after the debut of &quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; and many early descriptions followed the play rather than actual events despite the fact that changes are numerous. Unlike Scopes, who was persuaded to be a test case, Bert Cates takes it upon himself to violate the law, becoming a pariah in the town of Hillsboro. The citizens of the town in the play have much more of a lynch mob mentality (which is played up even more in Stanley Kramer's 1960 film version), but the centerpiece for both the historical drama and the theater version is the cross-examination of one lawyer by another before the media and the world.Whereas Darrow had a weekend to practice his examination of Bryan, Drummond is suddenly inspired to put Brady on the stand. The cross-examination in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; most notably differs from the Scopes trial transcript in that Drummond is required to confine his questions only to the subject of the Bible, where as Darrow could ask not only about the miracles in the Bible but explore Bryan's knowledge of various sciences and non-Christian religions as well. Drummond insists that &quot;it takes a very smart fella to say 'I don't know the answer,'&quot; which, ironically, is what Bryan repeatedly responded to Darrow on the witness stand in Dayton.The character of E.K. Hornbeck, the cynical observer, has such an extreme view of the proceedings that he forces the audience, whether viewing or reading the play, to take a more moderate position. Ultimately, the judgment here is of &quot;Brady&quot; and &quot;Drummond.&quot; Brady is portrayed as a foolish fundamentalist, whose chief sin is ignorance more than bigotry. In contrast, Drummond is a religious atheist, who finds the right to think to be holy. When Drummond leaves at the play's conclusion he puts the Bible and a copy of Darwin into his satchel together, suggesting an equality of sorts that neither character, in the drama or in history, ever espoused. There was such a figure of reconciliation during the trial, defense lawyer Dudley Field Malone, but he remains the most forgotten figure of the trial as the idea of the compatibility between Genesis and evolution has come to be rejected more and more by both sides.Lawrence and Lee's fictionalized account of the Scopes trial was not only the first major work to touch on the Monkey trial after World War II, it was the most significant in terms of public knowledge about the trial. Certainly more people have seen the film or television movie versions of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; than have read all the books on the Scopes trial combined. Whatever disclaimers are provided to the contrary, the play's version of what happened in &quot;Hillsboro&quot; is accepted as either being true or close enough to the truth to make the differences inconsequential. When Susan Epperson challenged Arkansas' Rotenberry Act journalists actually invoked &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; rather than the Scopes Trial as their point of reference.Furthermore, the &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; dramatization has never been challenged. Scopes admitted the film &quot;altered the facts of the real trial,&quot; but focused on the &quot;small liberties&quot; of suggesting he had been jailed and met his future wife during the trial. Overall, Scopes declared that the film version &quot;captured the emotions in the battle of words between Bryan and Darrow.&quot; In the final analysis that idea of &quot;emotions&quot; may be the best way of capturing the essence of the Scopes myth; it is a version of the Scopes trial that is shaped and colored by emotions rather than by factors or logic. After all, when the play premiered the Butler Act was still on the books in Tennessee.It was not until the vote by the Tennessee legislature to repeal the Butler Act, after the supreme court decision in Epperson vs. Arkansas, that &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; became more history that rhetoric, although certainly the rhetorical dimension has, to some extent, been subsumed by the theatricality of the piece. After all, from Paul Muni and Ed Begley to Spencer Tracy and Frederic March to Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas to Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott the play has been a dramatic showcase for its two male leads. Perhaps it is for that reason that it will remain a staple of high school and community theaters rather than for the resonance it brings to current events regarding the teaching of evolution in American schools. Furthermore, you can argue that the touchstone for the play is now more the separation of church and state than the original issue of evolution. What is not in dispute is that &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; has become a rare instance of fiction that has assumed the mantle of fact."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"I didn't read Inherit the Wind in school. Maybe because I went to Catholic schools? But I can see why many people did and still do. This is a true classic, concerning a gigantic human and national issue, one which well defines America still.Based on the Scopes Monkey Trial, this is a spectacular drama, full of people from the town of Hillsboro (a fictional setting) and outsiders, converging to witness the trial of a man who dared to teach or suggest Darwinian evolutionary theory, and the two lawyers who argue for the law of God (and here the law of the state) and the laws of Science, respectively.This is an important, positive play because it is about choice. I wish I could have been part of a class discussion of the play, and to see how other people, especially kids take this story.I read the Dramatists Play Service edition, which features extensive stage directions that take up equal space to the dialogue itself. The scope of the production is evident, with about 30 speaking parts and dozens of other bystandards. For this reason I wonder if another edition is less extensive...But the stage directions can be skimmed, and if you are reading for the heart if it, they should be. The heart being the trial scenes themselves, particularly when defence attorney Henry Drummond cross examines his counterpart Matt Brady, an avowed Biblical expert.Highly recommended.

IN HILSBORO,WHICH IS A VERY RELIGIOUS TOWN, A MAN DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ILLIGAL."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"The Scopes trial of 1925 pitted John Scopes against the state of Tennessee. Scopes had been a public schoolteacher fired and jailed for teaching Darwin's theory of evolution to his class. What ensued was one of the most popularized trials in U.S. history, as the separation of church and state was weighed upon in a Tennessee courtroom. For the prosecution, celebrated politician William Jennings Bryan (Brady in the play) was called upon. Clarence Darrow (Drummond in the play), a well-established lawyer, represented the defense.This play is a very readable account of the trial. Drummond's wit is evidenced throughout, while Brady is cast into an unfavorable light. While Drummond's quips may be amusing however, they deserve some thought, as this play is more than it originally seems, presenting a clear philosophical argument. On the whole, whether you are interested in the history of the Scopes trial or interested in any way in the subject of law or society in the respect as a whole, this book is an entertaining read. Indeed, it is written so that any can appreciate the logic of the argument, with bias, sure, but also with truths that can be spun to support any viewpoint."},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"The so-called \\"Scopes Monkey Trial\\" occurred in 1925 Dayton, Tennessee and was essentially a hoax.The state wanted a test-case to see if a recently enacted law against teaching Dawin's theory would hold up in court. The test was arranged by the American Civil Liberties Union; Scopes, who was actually a coach that taught the occasional science class, agreed to say he had broken the law for the sake of the test; the town cashed in on the media circus; and the legal wrangling was left to Clarence Darrow for the defense and William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution. Darrow did indeed call Bryan to the witness stand as an expert on the Bible, but their exchange was more friendly than acrimonious, and the next day the judge deemed Bryan's testimony irrelevant and threw it out. Scopes was convicted and the case was appealed to the state Supreme Court, which threw out the conviction on a technicality and expressed a desire that everyone would shut the hell up and go home. (One of the state Supreme Court Judges described the case as \\"bizarre.\\") The case was not retried and ten years later everybody but pop historians had forgotten all about it.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, however, Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Unamerican Activities Committee began a series of witch-hunts for communists in the country, and as their reign of terror intensified the issue of what could and could not be taught in the public schools once more came to the fore. Playwrights Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee--who would also write another great play of the era, AUNTIE MAME--seized on the Scopes Monkey Trial and used it as a model for the battle over freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and what could and should be taught in the classroom. The result was the play INHERIT THE WIND, and in 1955 when the play debuted there wasn't a person who didn't instantly know it was a metaphor for Senator McCarthy and like-minded individuals. Today Senator McCarthy and his minions were a thing of the past--and the play is usually interpreted as a battle between narrow-minded Christians and more liberal, perhaps even agnostic or atheist scientists. Even so, it is easy to detect the issues of freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and freedom of expression simmering just beneath the skin of the play.The play begins with the arrival of William Harrison Brady (based on William Jennings Bryan) in small-town Hillsboro to assist in the prosecution of school teacher Bert Cates, who has dared teach Darwin's theories in his science class. Brady is peturbed when a reporter named Hornbeck (based on H.L. Menken) announces that Drummond will be attorney for the defense--but he remains convinced he can win the case. Although the first act includes several scenes, including a notable fundamentalist Christian revival meeting, the bulk of the play is consumed by courtroom scenes. Indeed, the entire second act is essentially an extended courtroom scene, and it is justly famous, particularly the moments in which Drummond traps Brady into an implied admission that evolution and creationism are not actually incompatible notions. More than fifty years after they were written, these scenes still have the power to hold audiences spellbound, and while audiences now tend to see the play through a different cultural filture, it remains as disquieting, disturbing, and controversial as it was when first written.INHERIT THE WIND is a powerful play, beautifully constructed, possessing titanic figures playing out titanic issues. It is truly one of the great dramas of the 20th Century and deserves to be read--and if possible, seen--by everyone interested in American theatre.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"Like most I had to read this for school too.

How to Talk Yankee is a brilliant spoof of the dictionary, the Yankee dialect, and Linguistics as a study.Material covered in this book includes grammar &quot;So don't I&quot; pronunciation &quot;there are no R's in the middle of words... hahse, Cah, except where they don't belong,&quot; Ayuh &quot;THE WORD!&quot; and inevitability, &quot;You'll never fool a yankee, but you may fool other 'summer people'...&quot;The art in the book only adds to the humor, the cover (someone from &quot;out of town&quot; looking at the book and trying to translate &quot;Ayer&quot;) illustrates perfectly how exasperating it can be to try to understand a &quot;down-easter&quot; who speaks &quot;English.&quot;The book in it's manner spoofs not only the language of the &quot;yankee&quot; but is really a spoof of guidebooks and their genre. I can't recommend this book highly enough, a must for everyone who has ever been to Maine, taken a linguistics class, or tried to use a &quot;convenient guidebook.&quot;"},{"Title":"How to Talk Yankee: A Guide For Tourists, Migrants and Summer Complaints","review":"This was more of a Boston accent book then a \\"Yankee\\" accent book. If you want info on that then its right on the money."},{"Title":"How to Talk Yankee: A Guide For Tourists, Migrants and Summer Complaints","review":"I went to college in Maine and bought this first North Country Press printing soon after it came out in 1989. The original book was published ten years prior.People really do speak this way, at least older generations, as well as in rural areas (of which there are many in Maine!). To be fair, there are of course regional dialects across America and many have been well parodied. To wit, Southern, North Central (think \\"Minnesoooota\\"), Californian.The author himself acknowledges an earlier effort in this genre:How to Speak SouthernLike that one, How to Talk Yankee is a slim volume. It's also the only reference book I can think of without page numbers. No matter, the entries are spot on and the illustrations from (now well-known) Maine humorist Tim Sample are simple yet funny.I just realized that while there is no index nor systematic cross-referencing, any word that is italicized within an entry is itself defined elsewhere in this guide.This probably has limited appeal for actually using the language. But to the extent that it provides a window into Maine culture, it is a cheap, easy, and enjoyable way to get some Down East flavor. As Maine comedian Kendall Morse said, \\"You have to have more than a teaspoonful of brains to understand Maine humor.\\"One personal observation is that the usage of \\"son of a whore\\" (son of a ho-ah) is similar to the Italian-American \\"forget about it\\" (forgetaboudit); it can be positive or negative, or plenty of degrees in between. Remember that great scene in Donnie Brasco where the myriad intimations are debated?

This is the only reason I have given it 2 stars instead of one. The ending is very obvious, as to who the killer is and like all of the other people wrote, it is totally implausible that none of the FBI agents would have noticed what was going on. The whole method of killing was ridiculous and made no sense and then .... now, for those who don't want to know the ending, don't read further........to blame it on hypnosis is ludicrous and a simplistic way to try to tie knots together. Obviously Lee Child doesn't know a thing about hypnosis, because it has been proven that while you can make people do silly tricks on stage, you can't make them do things that go against their character or will and the concept of these post hypnotic suggestions is totally bizarre. Maybe the novel should be called The Stepford Army Girls."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The compelling, lethal, yet mild-mannered, ex-Army MP major Jack Reacher can't win for trying in the opening stages of this interesting crime thriller. He foils a blatant shakedown attempt by two Syrian toughs at the small restaurant that he frequents by inflicting precisely measured pain in a back alley, as only Reacher can do, only to be nabbed by the FBI who has been watching him for a while. It turns out that Reacher is the common thread among several women who have been mysteriously killed after being forced to leave the Army after pressing harassment charges, which Reacher had sympathetically handled as a MP officer.After dropping the pretense that Reacher is a suspect in the murders, the FBI agents more or less force Reacher to assist them in this investigation by threatening to make known his connection to his high-flying lawyer girlfriend Jodie, despite their blatant animosity towards the Army. But how does one catch a killer when there are absolutely no clues, no evidence, other than that all of the victims end up in a bathtub of Army-issue green paint?Reacher needs time to sort through all the possibilities, but time is of the essence: the killer seems to be on a timetable. Reacher does not buy into the killer's profile constructed by Agent Julia Lamarr, but he has no substitute. They can do little more than operate in scramble-mode, trying to predict where the killer will strike next. It is left to Agent Lisa Harper, tall, lithe, and quite attractive, to shadow Reacher - to contain him.It is a time of uncertainty for Reacher beyond the investigation. His inheritance of a large house from a man he was close to in the Army, Jodie's father, has put him in a very uncomfortable position. He is a vagabond; he does not want a house. Furthermore, Jodie is on a fast-track to being a partner in her law firm - the very epitome of stability. Can he really live with the love of his life? On the other hand, Agent Harper represents daring - life on the edge.It is an intriguing story with good pacing and reasonable plausibility. Reacher has some tough questions to solve; sometimes answers can be ambiguous."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I love the series but the murder method in this one is so incredibly unrealistic and lame and cheap and cliche that it totally spoils what would be a really entertaining book."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I generally like the the Jack Reacher series and will continue to read Child. However in Running Blind the action keeps me interested until page # 157 when, he ruins the the New York sequence-and- repeats it. He refers to Ft Dix, New Jersy as \\"Dix\\"; then he increases his foolishness by calling it a marine base. The navy has bases, the Corps has camps and active army has \\"Forts.\\"my respect takes a dip here. Fort Dix is an active for reserves, National guard, and other activitries; too Partially active Army has camps. Come on Lee! Where were you when you wrote this? Is it \\"deous ex machina?\\" If it is, you fell through the thin Ice. He could have gotten a huey from someone. He dosen't the address scene for this unknown marine who owes him a favor. And then he repeats his mistake. I'm even more cncerned by the supedity of the editer who let this pass. Then through out the rest of the book are misspellings, mispronounciations. You know-I read rest of the book rather quickley. GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER, BOY! (BEING 72YRS I CAN DO THIS) I've been to both Fort Dix, and it's neighbor, McGuire AFB.

Reacher takes no guff from anyone, routinely slaps around multiple thugs, breaks bones and kills when necessary, but becomes a complacent servant to pencil neck FBI geeks when threatened? Hopefully, Reacher will grow a pair for the next novel. Oh, and yes, the killer is obvious way early. Look for the person who is the most unlikeable and has the most idiosyncrasies. If the author of a mystery tells you something unusual, it is for a reason to be explained later. That's in the mystery writers manual. Please Mr. Child, try harder next time. And as others have said, the murder method is absurd. A zero star rating would be too high for this drivel."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is one of my favorite Lee Child novels. While the main storyline was a bit complicated, I loved it how Jack Reacher was able to solve the mystery using simple methods and logical reasoning. The animosity between FBI and Army was a bit exaggerated, and how the murderer actually killed the victims was highly improbably. But all in all, this was a fun and quick read."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is the fourth book I have read from Lee Child in the Jack Reacher series. They are very engaging and well written. The lead character is smart, resourceful, strong and ruthless when he has to be to put down the bad guys. He also has a heart and the character descriptions, interactions and dialogue all feel real when it could easily devolve into a comic book style. I have enjoyed his writing style and character development and plan to read the entire series over time. I can understand why they are so popular."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I enjoy the Reacher books. I have not been able to read them in sequence. But thats not such a problem. It would have been nice to read this one prior to finding out some of the facts in later books. A great book but the last few chapters don't have the same momentum as the rest of the book. Looks like a conclusion needed to be reached and that was it."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"There are some Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child that have a higher body count, and others where there is more thinking and figuring things out. \\"Running Blind\\" is one of the latter. Reacher does not rack up a high body count of bad guys, but he still makes for a tough guy hero you can cheer for, and one that has his own problems and demons inside.This book picks up shortly after \\"Tripwire\\" and continues with some of the story that started in that novel. However, the new house and girlfriend from the previous book don't make everything a bed of roses for our hero. There are problems on the home front, as well as an FBI investigation regarding a serial killer that Reacher gets caught in the middle of. The \\"perfect\\" crimes that have the FBI stumped cause Reacher to scratch his head more than once too. The investigation that has Reacher and the FBI \\"Running Blind\\" takes them back and forth across the country witch with temptations and feelings that don't make things easier for Reacher back home in New York.Child's character Reacher is a thinking tough guy, and Child writes in an engaging and entertaining manner that keeps you turning pages to find out what happens next. There are a few twists and turns to keep the reader guessing as to where the story is going and who the clever killer will turn out to be. The dealings with the FBI might not be over, so I'm wondering if any of the agents will show up again, especially Agent Harper. It will also be interesting to see where the relationship that started in \\"Tripwire\\" finally ends. (Having read some of the newer Reacher novels, I know, but am looking forward to seeing how Child does things with the story line.)I discovered this series two years ago by reading a couple of the series from the middle, and have since read the newest Child books, but also went back to start the series from the beginning and throw one into my reading every now and again. This is the fourth book in the series, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was a fun read, just like I've found all of them. I'm looking forward to reading the fifth book, \\"Echo Burning\\" as well as the new ones that come out as Child continues to write them.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From The School Of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I'm reading all this authors books in order. I like his style short straight sentences (He isn't into the adjective game with adjectives about adjectives on top of adjectives), the good guys are slightly flawed but prevail,the bad guys fail and the stories are involved and interesting. Simple straight comfort food for an afternoon read. The reason I rated this title so low is also simple. The whole story is about the identification of the bad \\"guy\\" but the person was identifiable by the reader very very.....very early in the book. Anyone that thinks about what they are reading will have to read the following 2/3 of the book knowing the ending. Very, very, ....very tedious."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Two women left the army after sexual harassment proceedings, both are killed and ex Army MP Jack Reacher knew both of them. As a perfect psychological match, Reacher is arrested by the FBI, but is released when another woman is murdered. Now Reacher has to use his skills to clear his name, and to do the Army and FBI's work for them.(This book is released as \\"Running Blind\\" in the US and as \\"The Visitor\\" in the UK.)This book features a new twist in writing style - the author Lee Child lets the reader know about the thoughts of the killer in between! These parts are also quite interesting even if the reader does not get any useful hints towards the identity of the killer. In general the book is well written, Reacher is charismatic and intelligent as ever, the pace is great and I hardly could stop reading the book. Even if the identity of the killer is really a big surprise and took me completely off guard I am not quite convinced by it since I do not think it was completely logical and especially believable.\\"The Visitor\\" is Lee Child's fourth book and to my opinion it is clearly better and more thrilling than his second and third novel (\\"Die Trying\\" + \\"Tripwire)\\". Unfortunately it does not reach the brilliance of his first book \\"Killing Floor\\". Therefore I could not rate it with the full 5 stars."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Not much to say about this book. In a review of another Reacher book (\\"Echo Burning\\"), I said that these books were fun reads despite their many drawbacks as novels (careless and sloppy writing, no attention to factual accuracy, one dimensional characters, plots that rely on coincidence etc). This book is not fun, just stupid.The plot is literally incredible in many respects. The mysterious villain is telegraphed. The facts are wrong (my favorite: Fort Dix as a Marine Corps base--at the time the novel was written, it was an Army and Guard/Reserve base as it had been for over 80 years). If you can even faintly buy the ending and explanation I've got a bridge in Brooklyn that I could sell to you. Don't read it. It will only encourage the author to do it again."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is an excellent story but the UK publisher and the US publisher selected different titles for the same story. Sooo - it has created some confusion."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Literary license is the authority readers grant a fiction writer to bend reality into an interesting story. The license is to bend, not to break. Running Blind smashes reality into some twisted mess that is impossible to accept. Impossible unless you have about a hundred pounds of brain damage.This book flat out violates the Pigs Can't Fly Rule. That is the rule that says that no matter what any fiction writer says, pigs just can't fly. Here are some examples of how this rule is violated in Running Blind (WARNING: the rest of this review contains STORY SPOILERS):1. The FBI Agents in an elite We Catch Serial Killers Unit are dumber than dirt. They can only see two or three possible solutions to the \\"who did it\\" puzzle. The have no ability to consider alternate theories or to ask insightful questions about the evidence. Now I know that not all FBI Agents are going to win the Nobel Prize in Physics, but if they were as dumb as they are portrayed in the book, they would not have enough brain power to find their way to work in the morning.2. The Serial Killer is an FBI Agent who is a big shot in the We Catch Serial Killers Unit (which should be renamed Serial Killers R Us). As an Agent, she has some phobia about flying on airplanes and refuses to get on one. As The Serial Killer she is flying all over the countryside. Nobody in her elite unit notices that she disappears at critical times, or ever suspects that she might really not have a fear of flying. Lots and lots of dead bodies don't bother her, but United Airlines freaks her out! And nobody wonders why. I told you these FBI Agents were dumber than dirt.3. The hero of this story is some X Army Major who goes through the entire tale (which takes a while and which requires him to travel all over the place) with just one pair of undershorts. This apparently gives him a connection to the murdered victims because after a while, neither the dead victims or Major Undershorts can smell too good. Further, Major Undershorts cracks a key clue in the case by deep french kissing a hot blonde 6 foot plus FBI babe who usually doesn't wear a bra but who otherwise wears men's clothing so that she will \\"fit in.\\" No contradiction there. And well, I guess when you think about it, lots of serial killer cases have been solved by having some stained undershorts freak tounge a hot blonde FBI Agent. NOT! Buy the way, Major Undershorts name is Jack Reacher. To many Middle Eastern Terrorists he is known, of course, as Asheets Madrawers.4. The Serial Killer's method of operation is to hypnotize her victims into, in effect, murdering themselves. There is no use of hypnotic drugs to assist in this effort. The problem with this nonsense is that only a very small percentage of people can deeply hypnotized to the point that they can be forced to take actions against their will, and have hypnotic amnesia. If we could really use hypnosis that easily, nobody would have a problem with losing weight, or with trying to stop smoking. We would just put them in a hypnotic state, and tell them to stop, and they would stop. And since The Serial Killer's motive in the book is financial gain, all she had to do was to open up a Hynosis Clinic that would guarantee its clients that they would stop smoking, stop overeating, stop having a fear of flying, or stop doing whatever it is that they wanted to stop doing and she would make boatloads of money. Boatloads! And without all the muss and fuss of killing all those innocent people.Of course, if pigs could fly than I could stop traveling on airplanes. But they can't, no matter what some fiction writer says."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Did I miss something. Two books ago, Jack saves an FBI agent who just happens to be the daughter of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and grand daughter to the President. In that book Reacher came in contact with the head of the FBI and Chairman of the JCS. So now I am to believe to get Reacher to work for them (FBI) they threaten his girl-friend.What world does the author live in, in the real world one call to the agent he saved would have heads rolling..."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've loved all of the Jacker Reacher novels... until this one. Don't get me wrong, the story reads great, as always. However, the ending is completely disappointing. I don't want to give it away, but it's based on a stereotyped, way-overused, and completely false quasi-science that is impossible to happen the way it does in the book. When you see this plot in a TV show, you know that the writers are running out of ideas, as they always seem to eventually use this one. I expected better from Lee Child. Perhaps others can overlook that (or don't realize it's completely unreal), but it ruined the book for me.So go ahead and read it if you can't stand the thought of missing a Jack Reacher novel, but if you're new to the series, please start with another one, like The Persuader or Without Fail, or at the beginning with The Killing Floor."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I am reading the series in order. I think this was the best one yet. It leaves my very excited to continue the Reacher series. We began to see more depth in Reacher as he struggles with understanding himself. The story moves forward at a wonderful pace. It was just great. While reading this I had the opportunity to hear Lee Child speak. He gave some insights that I think will be helpful. First he said he starts the book at the beginning and does not really know how it will turn out until he gets there. He also said that when he is stumped he has Reacher get a cup of coffee. Child does the same."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"As usual, Lee Child creates a very interesting and thrilling story about the \\"hero\\" Jack Reacher. This story is in the time before he took to the roads, roaming around in the States. He is living in New York, dating the love of his life and an unfortunate involvment in a restaurant owners trouble with the maffia, Reacher gets accused of murdering woman he has known as an MP in the army.It's very good, but some parts can get a little bit boring.Still, from me it get's 4 stars! Hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"We are all Jack Reacher - or would like to be. In every adventure he succeeds the old fashioned way. He works. He works hard. Things don't always come easy for Reacher. He falls. He fails. He gets up. He gets up and gets going.I never liked a guy like James Bond. Too pretty. Too clean. Too boring. Reacher is a guy whose hands get dirty. In Running Blind, Women are dying. The only common thread is that the women once worked for the military and they knew Reacher.The elite FBI team on the case is baffled. Even Reacher is baffled. The hunt is on. GO JACK ! five stars of five.PS...as great a read as this book is.......it is a better listen. See the audio version. There's a tape edition and a CD one. Both are great and both are UNABRIDGED. The tape set consists of eight casettes--12 exciting hours brilliantly read by Dick Hill."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child's notorious anti-hero, Jack Reacher, is now into his fourth book, and that's a dangerous time for a character. A character who has cheated death and dastardly villains in three books teeters on the brink of invulnerability, and that can be quite dull. Child has thrown Reacher up against violent counterfeiters, bloodthirsty anti-government folks, and (literally) cut-throat businessmen. How does he top himself in Book 4?First, by creating a mind-blowing mystery. Otherwise-healthy women are being found dead in bathtubs filled with military green paint, obviously murdered. Yet there is no murder weapon or even evidence that anyone else has been in the house. How can even the legendary investigator Reacher solve a murder with no weapon, no witness, and no evidence? The only link is that the dead women all successfully brought sexual harrassment claims against their superiors in the Army. Not much to go on, even for Reacher.Second, Reacher gets brought into this investigation unwillingly, as he is first tagged by a team of FBI profilers as the exact type who would commit this crime. A loner, a former military guy with a known violent past. As an MP, Reacher saw many senior commanders get busted for claims of sexual harrassment . . . so the FBI shoves a gun in his face and brings him in.After the FBI realizes that Reacher didn't commit the murders, they still remain hostile and use Reacher's beloved girlfriend Jodie as leverage to keep Reacher working on their case. As the FBI is about to learn to their chagrin, nobody threatens Reacher's girlfriend, and things don't work out quite as planned for the feds. (This subplot is both ingenious and allows Reacher to exercise his well-honed craft of cracking heads.)But the most interesting aspect of this fourth novel is that Child writes several passages from the killer's perspective, which is a first for this series. Getting inside the killer's head is always dangerous for a writer, for you don't want to say too much to give away a novel's secrets. Child tap-dances his way through the killer's twisted mind, and the result are several chilling passages where the murderer's crystalline genius stains the pages.Can Reacher track down this anonymous, untraceable murderer in time to save a friend, his girlfriend, and even himself?All in all, \\"Running Blind\\" is more of a mystery than the earlier Reacher novels. Child writes with his trademark economy and attention to detail, and the result is a highly satisfying thriller.The only criticism I have is that Reacher once again finds himself working hand-in-hand with a beautiful woman who meets his particular standards. While Jodie is still in the picture, she's on the sidelines for most of the novel as she is up for partnership at her New York law firm. Nevertheless, Child still gives us a \\"Reacher Girl,\\" his own not-too-subtle twist on the Bond Girl stereotype. I'm all for gorgeous, capable women, but the novels' symmetry on this score is becoming a bit stale. (This is a minor criticism, but keeps it at a four-star level.)"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is a typical Jack Reacher story, that's why I enjoyed it so much.

Maybe next they'll retitle \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" as \\"She's Upstairs\\" and everyone will buy it."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This is a great novel for adolescent sex addicts who 1. don't know anything about the military, 2. think the best way to keep a job is to insult your employers, 3. think it's cool to wear the same clothes day after day, 4. would like to commit sexual harrasment themselves.The dialogue is simple and extensive, which keeps the pace fast.What is most astonishing are reviews on the cover calling Mr. Child's efforts a 'masterpiece' and 'spectacular'. My response: a roll of the eyes and moan of \\"Good Grief!\\"."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Have read the first four of Child's Jack Reacher books. They all have had some parts that are really unbelieveable but so much of this one is it is unreal. Reacher is blackmailed into helping the FBI track down a seriel killer. Why is the killer taking out single women? The connection seems to be they were all military and filed charges of sexual harrasement charges against a higher authority. But is that the reason? We have Julia Lamarr and Nelson Blake, bad FBI agents and Lisa Harper, good FBI agent. I really think a lot of the actions by the FBI is really what is happening in the world today. Women keep getting killed in bathtubs covered in paint. How did they die? No one can figure out. Jack must be slipping, the FBI has followed him for a week and he is not aware of it. The crimes take place to far apart and it takes forever for Jack to explain to Lisa how he knew who the killer was. I agree with other reviewers that Jack needs to clean up more often. I guess I will read more about Jack Reacher but hope the next one is more believeable."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child's &quot;Running Blind&quot; is a novel about the FBI's efforts to find a sadistic and malevolent serial killer. The main character is Jack Reacher, a macho ex-military man, who is as sharp mentally as he is quick and capable with his fists. Reacher lives by a unique moral code and pretty much does as he likes. He has no job, has little respect for authority and doesn't play by society's rules. The FBI enlists Reacher's help when their best investigators are stymied by the aforementioned killer who is murdering women without leaving any obvious clues. Reacher is a brilliant investigator who thinks creatively and makes mental leaps that are helpful in solving difficult cases. &quot;Running Blind&quot; is fast-paced and action-packed, and Reacher is an appealing, if rough-edged, hero. Child would have us believe that Reacher owns one set of clothes and wears them all the time! That is a bit much to swallow. Another quibble that I have is that Child uses too much misdirection to fool the reader and I feel that he sometimes does not play fair. However, &quot;Running Blind&quot; does have sharp dialogue and many unexpected twists and turns. It is a page-turner and I doubt that anyone will be able to put it down in the last ten pages. I recommend &quot;Running Blind,&quot; since it is a clever police procedural that keeps the reader guessing until the end."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child has created an unusual hero in Jack Reacher which has provided the basis for quite a number of books now. I dimly think that the author Lee Child is British but regardless of whether he is or not his creation Reacher is designed to appeal to all of the trigger points of an American audience.Reacher is a person who can handle himelf in a scrape. He has done time in the militiary and has been trained in the art of combat.His combat traiing involved learning about firearms. He also spends him time in manual work so that he is fit. Yet he is not only an action hero.He has worked in the militiary police so that he has developed Sherlock Holmes skills in investigation. (Sherlock Holmes like skills because the Reacher books are not procedurals. No slow accumulation of facts and evidence. Reacher solves crimes by way of intuitive break throughs, just like old Sherlock)Most of the books have some referance point back to the army and Child the writer is cloying in his attempts to paint the United States Army in a posative light as an organisation which is on top of its game. One can imagine the pick up truck Republican crowd who are presumably the main audience for the books beaming with pride when there is some discourse in the books about the good old US army. Very limited discussion of the downside.Never the less the previous books have been effective enough as time fillers and a good read when one is going on a plane flight. This one however seems a little formulaic. Perhaps it is simply that I have read a few and the nuts and bolts of the construction has become clearer and makes it more difficult to suspend disbelief.The main problem however with this book is the end. Whilst it is perhaps a bit silly to say that it does not ring true.(It is a work of escapist fiction) It is perhaps harder to take seriously than some other of the books which appear to be better constructed. Still this is all subjective no doubt."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have now read the first four of the Jack Reacher stories. I very much enjoyed the first. The second was not great. Not bad, either. The third and, finally, the fourth have pushed my tolerance level to the limit. I strongly wished the author would do more research before he puts &#34;stuff&#34; in the books. Nothing intolerable by itself, but they start to add up. For example, Jeep is copyrighted trade name and does not apply to all SUVs. (book three) There is a difference between the US Army, Air Force, and Marines. One cannot use the names and commands interchangeably. I found the portrayal of the FBI somewhat distasteful and not realistic. (book four) Artistic license is certainly expected. They should, however, try to stay within reasonable limits. After researching the author's background, I suppose a greater level of &#34;bad America&#34; conspiracy theory is expected, but I am not obligated to read it."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"i have just finished reading this title and given it only 3 stars due to its printing format. The book was good as one has come to expect from Mr Child. The story was taught and one was in suspense as to who was the killer right to the last chapter. But it did not have any chapters, this was confusing as one would be reading one scene with one set of characters when half way down the page the scene completly changed and we were having conversations with other characters! If this was a cost saving excercise it did not work!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I always enjoy the Jack reacher series. They are easy read and always keep you gussing. Jack always comes out on top. Too bad he can't settle down with a good woman."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have just started reading this series and really enjoyed this book. Can't wait to read the rest of them"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've just started this series and I can't seem to read quick enough. Great suspense and action. keeps you constantly thinking."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I'm basically reviewing this book in order to get my rating on record, because it is an honest opinion of the content - not quite as polished to fit the 'I love it' catergory where I would put the other Reachers I've read but a perfectly good puzzle, and well worked out, which is not reflected by the average ratings.For sure, it is unethical on the part of the publishers not to make it clear that the novel was previously published under another name, but I'm not convinced that giving the BOOK only 1 or 2 stars for this reason is ethical either. It is certainly not helpful. One of the reviewers issued the warning - which was helpful, but neverless rated it 5 stars, also helpful to those who have not read the book before. Isn't that what these reviews are about?This is good, standard Reacher. He is put under pressure by the FBI to help them find a serial killer whilst being watched like a hawk. The hawk beig an entertaining character, and not beyond flashing an absence of bra when the context requires it. Like the Reacher we know he deals with the pressure, then follows the trail his way, not via the FBI's definition of the killer (of course). He does get side-tracked, but this is part of the action, and necessary in order to tick off the possibilities so as to arrive at the final probability.Be warned,(and this has nothing to do with stars) the killings, and their MO, are bizarre and call for a real stretch of the imagination. But then this is fiction, after all, for believable killings we can read the Sunday papers."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have read almost every L.Child book, this is one of the best yet, I cannot put it down. I love all of the Reacher books."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I have commented on most of the Jack Reacher books. This one is fairly good; it has all the usual elements of suspense, intrigue, deduction, and revenge. It's good escape (and yes, I have used that before for these books as it is appropriate) writing that you just start reading and get in the flow of, and then suddenly you are hooked, and you have to know what happens. Childs is especially good at sucking you in to know how his hero will solve the problem(s)."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Of the first four Jack Reacher novels, this one is the weakest. I'm certainly not a reader who avidly tries to figure out all of the twists and turns before the big reveals at the end. I will quote this from the review: \\"The ending will come as a complete surprise to even the most careful reader\\". If you are even paying half-attention to the story you will figure out the killer early on. I looked down at my Kindle when I figured it out and I had read about 23% of the book. Childs actually points it out fairly clearly. So when he unleashed the reveal at the end, I shrugged instead of gasped as I knew who it was for most of the book.I also felt the relationship between Reacher and Jodie was completely different in this book. You would be hard-pressed to tell they had secretly been in love for 15 years based on their interactions here. Worth a read, but not the best in the series so far."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've read about all the Jack Reacher books and I was terribly disappointed with this one. It tried to be a \\"whodunnit\\" and was short on the usual Reacher mayhem. That in itself isn't terrible, but this story seemed very mechanically cranked out, got awfully repetitive and after a while I really didn't care what happened. Although the ending is a big surprise, getting there wasn't worth it."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This novel had its elements, but the basic premise was so preposterous that it undid any good aspects. The \\"bad guy\\" all but acquired magic powers in order to carry out his crimes. (In the interest of not giving away the plot, there are some misleading terms in this review.) If this sort of thing was possible, people would be using it all the time in criminal activity, but they aren't -- because it's not possible.In short, I didn't believe anything about this novel. The author must have been in a desperate mood during its composition -- even Reacher's breakup was abrupt and not well explained. I wanted to read the whole series, having started out with the first one. This one makes me want to abandon the project entirely."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child has a UK version and an American version for all his books. Running Blind is the American version and The Visitor is the UK version. Same book...different country."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I enjoy the Reacher series, but for someone who is as successful as Mr Child one would think he could afford someone to fact check his books for glaring errors.A couple examples that undercut the stories:1. He discusses a trip Reacher made (in book #3) to \\"The Army flight school at Ft Wolters, TX\\". (It may have been still \\"Camp\\" Wolters, but I need a fact checker for that.) Wolters was closed and all functions transferred to Ft Rucker before I went to the Army flight school in 1960, so it had to have been closed in the 1950's.2. He discusses at some length the Marines at Ft Dix. (Book #4) Ft Dix is an all-Army Post. (Except, of course for the inevitable jarheads in liason-type positions.)"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I usually enjoy reading the Reacher series of books. But this one disappointed me. I know it is a fiction, but Reacher's relationship with the FBI was unrealistic - a bit of a stretch. The ending was weak. This book could have been much shorter."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I discovered the Jack Reacher series last December when I splurged and bought a few dozen used books from amazon to read beginning over winter break for sheer escapism from work. I finally got around to starting the series (in order) a couple of weeks ago. I gobbled up the first 3, really enjoying the ride, and started on this one. Like the others, it has an intriguing premise that hooks you right away -- in this case, women being murdered in an undetectable manner and being found naked in their bathtubs, which are filled with Army green paint. Reacher is basically blackmailed into helping the FBI find out who the killer is. So far, so good -- Lee Child really knows how to keep you turning the pages. The problem is, I figured out who the killer was and the killer's motive WAY too early -- before page 100. I kept hoping I was wrong -- I actually like to be surprised! -- but I wasn't. The ending was a huge disappointment, as it seemed HIGHLY unlikely that such a thing could ever work. In addition, I found several plot holes in this book that were annoying -- e.g., since there's no way Reacher could have contacted his colonel-friend-who-owed-him, how was everything set up and ready when he got there? And the \\"problem of the box\\" (hopefully that's vague enough to NOT be a spoiler) raises obvious questions that are never satisfactorily answered, just followed up on a couple of hundred pages later when they should have been figured out immediately. In addition, it became REALLY annoying when Reacher would figure something out but when another character would ask him to explain, he would say something like \\"No time,\\" or \\"Later,\\" or whatever -- this happened over and over and over again, and the ONLY reason for his idiotic responses was that the plot needed him to not reveal what he knew at that point, even though of course in real life any real person would have. And finally, I found Reacher's \\"interludes\\" with the new FBI agent annoying too -- not to be overly moralistic, but come on -- isn't he supposed to be crazy in love with someone else? Overall disappointing, although not enough to turn me off the series -- in fact, I am already 100 pages into #5 and so far so good on that one."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Typical Lee Child; keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Always a great storyline/plot with plenty of true-sounding action."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This one of the best in the Reacher series, very fast moving with unexpected twists all the way to the end. Another page burner from Lee Child"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"a good book but since it was previously printed under a different name i felt a little shortchanged after purchasing it again"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Child uses the same character but each book is a different story. Although there are occasional references to previous story lines, the setting and direction are completely new."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Another exciting Jack Reacher adventure. Once I get the book in my hands I don't want to put it down. Lee Child is one of my favorite authors. Enjoyed book very much.PMA"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Lee Child plays the game well. Personally, I won this game, spotting the killer fairly early. That certainly didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book. It did free me, to an extent, so that I could carefully study some of the author's technique, his attempts to make me question my first certainty. And he certainly plays the game fairly. We are given many of the killer's thoughts from the very fist chapter on. So it's a case of matching the psychological profile we're given to the more superficial pictures of the characters. THis book also continues the subplot introduced in TRIPWIRE in which Reacher must make a crucial lifetime decision.I do recommend reading first DIE TRYING which introduces the Leon Garber character, and then TRIPWIRE in order to get the full subplot. The Jack Reacher novels are fairly fast reads in spite of the 400+ page length of each one, but I did find this one even faster than the others. Very highly recommended, but do read at least a couple in the series, preferably those I've mentioned, first."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"One of the best spy/thriller series going. Once you start reading about Jack Reacher's hair-raising adventures you will be hooked. This is 4 in the series."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Follow Jack Reacher, an ex-MP, as he falls into another mystery to solve. Reacher uses his knowledge and past experience to put the pieces together in unorthodox ways.Child creates vivid scenes, interesting characters and a twisted story. His dialog patterns are just enough to keep the story moving and Reacher true to form.Try a Lee Child novel and you'll find yourself reading them all."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I've read almost all of the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child, and RUNNING BLIND is just a fair entry in the series. A serial killer is on the loose, and Reacher has been drafted by the FBI to help find the killer. This novel is essentially a whodunit, and I found it an enjoyable read because I like Child's writing style.As with most of the Reacher novels, the plot in RUNNING BLIND isn't even remotely realistic. The FBI in this novel is portrayed as laughably corrupt and incompetent. As a result, they must take Jack Reacher prisoner in order to force him to solve the crime for them. The way the murders are committed are absurd and have no scientific basis. The female FBI agent character is also ridiculous and something of an insult to female professionals everywhere (she's gorgeous, wants to be treated seriously as an FBI agent, but deliberately parades around in see-through blouses).In fairness, Child is not trying to write realistic books. His plots are deliberately sensational and over-the-top. Still, there's a limit to how much implausibility I'm willing to tolerate in a novel like this. There are plenty of good thriller writers out there who can write exciting books without tossing believability out the window.RUNNING BLIND is enjoyable and fun overall, but I strongly prefer other entries in the Jack Reacher series because they are somewhat more believable. In particular, I recommend KILLING FLOOR, ONE SHOT, THE HARD WAY and ECHO BURNING."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"You have to love this guy...and envy his sense of \\"keep it simple\\" by travelling light. I think I travel light by not owning much, but Jack really knows how. The man definitely has his priorities straight. Another \\"I can't wait to get to the next page\\" kind of book."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"This book isn't really all about the title for the review. That being said, it does make sense to the reader at the end of the book. It's funny how I being into this series never guessed who the perp was until it was revealed to me. The actions at the end make sense though. There are many twists and turns and you just have to buckle up for the ride. I only wish some body parts weren't as weak as some are would of been nice to see some justice done."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Way too much about how hot is is in south west Texas. We knew that.The mid 1/3 wasvery slow. However the end moved fast.I have read 4 previous books by Child and liked them.This review was supposed to be for ECHO BURNING !!"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I find the Jack Reacher books to be a quick and enjoyable read. This book is no different. It's not a deep book. Just good ol' fashion adventure and action fun. The story has enough mystery to keep it interesting, but not so convoluted and arcane to tax the mind that might want some relaxation after a tough day at work.Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the Kindle Version is formatted badly. There are no indents at the beginning of each paragraph (it's all left justified), making dialog exchanges and determining where new paragraphs begin a little to tricky at times. Hopefully we'll get a better formated version to \\"update\\" the one I just bought"},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Our hero, Jack Reacher, always treats women well, and author Lee Child writes strong women characters that often match our hero in intelligence and determination. For the first time Child presents us with a really nasty female. At the same time Reacher is shown sympathetically dealing with rape victims and their long term problems. The book has a claustrophobic feel, as it is set in the city, Reacher wrestles with the horrors of home ownership, a love that might lead to real commitment, and a &#34;locked room&#34; room puzzle of a mystery. One can hardly wait until Reacher is back on the road and far from New York.As always the language is what helps mesmerize readers. &#34;He killed the motor and heard nothing but fog hanging in the air and the crunch of boots on his driveway.&#34; Then the reader learns the physics of attacking with a bat, done with dispassionate seriousness that makes Reacher intellectually appealing while he beats bullies half to death."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"Jack Reacher is at it again in this 4th book from Lee Child. He does an unsolicited good deed and has the FBI all over him as a result. While the Bureau doesn't look particularly good in this book, Reacher certainly does. It is sad that he can't settle in with the love of his life, but if he could where would that leave the readers? Another great book that expands the Reacher character and points the way to further adventures. Tight plotting, great character development and no let downs keep Child's books at the top of the list for me."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"I chose five stars because, the case is hard to solve and very interesting. This is my favorite in the series, so far.

This is a very good series."},{"Title":"Visitor","review":"The movie with Tom Cruise deserves discussion--haven't seen it, but just bought a sweet 'smart' TV and signed up for Netflix streaming, so I may watch it eventually. I'll just say here that, regarding the movie, and despite Mr Cruise's pathological delusions about what passes for 'real life'...I confess that I'm a fan. TC's (usually) fun to watch on screen.But casting him as Jake Reacher...what were they thinking?Reacher graduated West Point, served honorably and heroically for 15 years, including 'Nam, as an Army MP. He was awarded a Silver Star for digging out and rescuing Marines from the rubble of the terrorist bombing of their barracks in Lebenon. Everyone who knew him in the Army speaks highly of him, not a few with reverence. He's also, at 6' 5,\\" 220 lbs, a highly-trained killer, and as a civilian, he continues to kill...the very, very bad guys he encounters. Meanwhile, the elfin Mr Cruise, when standing ramrod straight and executing a last-second (surreptitious) tippy-toe move just before the camera clix, is, at best, 5'5\\"--a foot shorter than Reacher... in a narrative where Reacher's investigative skills AND his physical size and prowess are essential. His appearance alone makes him intimidating, a crucial element in the reader's ability to suspend disbelief.In any case, the series is good, good stuff. Solid writing. (Don't be put off by the Hemingwayesque shite, at the beginning of first Reacher novel. The writing gets better, so good you don't notice it.) I've just ordered #5...gotta be ready to follow Jack Reacher and his exploits when I'm done with #4. Good plots, good stories, great character/hero. Having read the first 3, I can tell you they're the proverbial page-turner. Maybe not quite as good as the wizard himself, Elmore Leonard, but close enough. There's nothing not to like about the character and the writing gets better and better with each book...did I mention that a good series such as this is a godsend, a blessing, frickin' welcome, big time, anytime.

It is as easy to read as the other Lee Child 'Jack Reacher' books. I have read five of them in a bit over a week so you can assume they can hold your attention.

It takes you to different places and then throws you off the scent before you realize.This book didn't have the graphic violence that a couple of the others have had.
