As a consequence, there is a lack of interactive and dynamic qualities in methods connected to this paradigm of garment construction, from both expressional and functional perspectives. This work proposes and explores an alternative paradigm for pattern cutting that includes a new theoretical approximation of the body as well as a more kinetic method for garment construction that, unlike the prevalent theory and its related methods, takes as its point of origin the interaction between the anisotropic fabric and the biomechanical structure of the body. As such, the research conducted here is basic research, aiming to identify fundamental principles for garment construction. Based on some key principles found in the works of Genevi ve Sevin-Doering and in pre-tailoring methods for constructing garments, the proposed theory for  and method of  garment construction was developed through concrete experiments by cutting and draping fabrics on live models. Instead of a static matrix of a non-moving body, the result is a kinetic construction theory of the body that is comprised of balance directions and key biomechanical points, along with an alternative draping method for dressmaking. This methodology challenges the fundamental relationship between dress, garment construction, and the body, working from the body outward, as opposed to the methods that are based on the prevalent paradigm of the tailoring matrix, which work from the outside toward the body. This alternative theory for understanding the body and the proposed method of working allows for diverse expressions and enhanced functional possibilities in dress.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UearBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Official Splatter Movie Guide: Hundreds More of the Grossest, Goriest, Most Outrageous..","description":"Combining both volumes of the original print editions, The Official Splatter Movie Guide, Volumes I & II is a dream come true for splatter aficionados: a film-by-film guide to more than eight hundred masterworks of blood and gore.

Using an historical analysis, el-Khazen sheds light on the political situation of the country in the lead up to the conflict and the major role Lebanon's neighbours had in the events.

Candle burning is a Psychic and Psychological experience, and may compliment your particular faith by arranging your rituals to blend into it. Nevertheless, you need not do anything which you feel is inharmonious with your personal beliefs, as there are countless alternatives. The one basic simple fact we can feel sure of is that the act of burning candles does indeed cause an altered state of awareness, producing changes in circumstances. Think of the millions of men and women who have been persuaded and seduced, or extracted promises and proposals, concluded business deals, patched up squabbles, and resolved differences or opinion in the glowing magic of a candlelight supper.

Instead, his ship, the Endurance, became locked in sea ice, and for nine months Shackleton fought a losing battle with the elements before the drifting ship was crushed and his crew marooned. Shackleton's gripping account of his incredible voyage follows him and his men across 600 miles of unstable ice floes to a barren rock called Elephant Island. It records how, with a crew of four, he crossed 850 miles of the worst seas in a twenty-two-foot-long open boat and how, after landing on South Georgia Island, they then had to traverse over twenty miles of mountainous terrain to reach the nearest outpost of civilization. Shackleton recounts, too, the efforts of his support party aboard the Aurora, who in temperatures of -50 [degree] and winds of 80 m.p.h. still managed to drop off supplies on the opposite side of the continent, little suspecting the fate of the Endurance and the ordeal of its crew.

Joyce Aparo seemed to be the perfect single mother. She doted on her sixteen-year-old daughter, Karin, encouraging her musical ability and lavishing affection on her. But behind closed doors, Joyce was a terror. For thirteen years, she beat Karin savagely, kept her away from other children, and demeaned her relentlessly. When Karin met the troubled yet brilliant Dennis Coleman, the two fell head-over-heels into lustful infatuation. But Joyce disapproved so she had to die. On August 5, 1987, Joyce s body was found under a bridge near the ConnecticutMassachusetts border. She had been strangled, and was covered in bruises, with paper stuffed in her mouth and pantyhose knotted around her throat. The police investigation soon dragged her horrific treatment of Karin into the open, and the teenage lovers became the prime suspects. Dennis eventually confessed to the murder, testifying that Karin begged him to kill her mother. But Karin had a very different story to tell, claiming to have no knowledge of Dennis s plans. Was she manipulating the police the same way she manipulated her former boyfriend, or was she an innocent victim? Based on meticulous research, court transcripts, and interviews with the survivors, Beyond Obsession is the definitive account of an American tragedy and the basis for a popular TV movie starring Victoria Principal and Emily Warfield.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_3SyDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Entre DOS Lunas (Walk Two Moons) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Why Birds Sing: A Journey Into the Mystery of Bird Song","description":"A musician and philosopher explores the science and art of bird song in a quest to determine if birds sing for other than sexual or territorial purposes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V8RbSQAACAAJ&dq=Why+Birds+Sing:+A+Journey+Into+the+Mystery+of+Bird+Song&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portrait Sculpture Simplified","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wh0xAQAAIAAJ&dq=Portrait+Sculpture+Simplified&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cast a Bright Shadow (Lionwolf 1)","description":"The setting is a world of eternal winter, where once thrived hot climates and exotic luxury.

Hamilton was a well-known figure on Wall Street. Cornelius Vanderbilt, America's first tycoon, came to respect, grudgingly, his one-time opponent. The day after Vanderbilt's death on January 4, 1877, an almost full-page obituary on the front of the National Republican acknowledged that, in the context of his Wall Street share transactions, \\"There was only one man who ever fought the Commodore to the end, and that was Jeremiah Hamilton.\\" What Vanderbilt's obituary failed to mention, perhaps as contemporaries already knew it well, was that Hamilton was African American. Hamilton, although his origins were lowly, possibly slave, was reportedly the richest colored man in the United States, possessing a fortune of $2 million, or in excess of two hundred and $50 million in today's currency. In Prince of Darkness, a groundbreaking and vivid account, eminent historian Shane White reveals the larger than life story of a man who defied every convention of his time. He wheeled and dealed in the lily white business world, he married a white woman, he bought a mansion in rural New Jersey, he owned railroad stock on trains he was not legally allowed to ride, and generally set his white contemporaries teeth on edge when he wasn't just plain outsmarting them. An important contribution to American history, Hamilton's life offers a way into considering, from the unusual perspective of a black man, subjects that are usually seen as being quintessentially white, totally segregated from the African American past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aP-5BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reunion at University Avenue","description":"Mike thought campus politics was funny - until someone wanted him dead.

The fourth edition is larger than the previous edition and I expect that a future edition will be even larger. The learning process of a plantsman is a life-long endeavor and I will continue to discover new plants in my travels. The idea for this text started developing when I was a student in a herbaceous plants course at the University of Illinois. At that time, I realized that there was no one text that included identification characteristics and the ornamental and cultural features necessary to obtain a complete understanding of the subject. This idea was further reinforced when I became an instructor of herbaceous plants at Kansas State University. I found it impossible to recommend any one book for student use because each had its advantages and disadvantages. This text provides the student, the professional, and the home gardener with illustrations and concise treatment of plant information. I have had an opportunity to travel extensively in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Great Britain. Information gained in these travels has been incorporated in this expanded fourth edition. There are over 1 20 new plant descriptions and now a total of 384 color photos. Wildflowers and herbs are two examples of plant groups where coverage has been expanded. Since the printing of the third edition of the Manual of Herbaceous Ornamental Plants, I have received many helpful suggestions of how this text could be enhanced. I am indebted to those individuals who took time to contact me with their suggestions. I have assimilated their comments and incorporated them in the fourth edition.

But that's the past. Now, devastated by the death of her husband, Kate is attempting to quietly rebuild her life as a single woman. Gone are the Park Avenue penthouse and designer clothes. Now it's a funky Chelsea loft, downtown fashion, and even a hip new haircut as Kate plunges back into her work writing a book about America's most celebrated artistic era, the New York School of the 1940s and '50s, a circle that included Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko. But when a lunatic starts slashing the very paintings she is writing about along with their owners Kate is once again tapped by the NYPD. As she deciphers the evidence cryptic images that reveal both the paintings and the people who will be the next targets Kate is drawn into a world where art and art history provide lethal clues. The Killing Art is Jonathan Santlofer's most gripping and chilling story yet, but that isn't the only reason the novel is remarkable. The author, who is also an acclaimed artist, has created works of art just for the book that tantalize and challenge readers by using well-known symbols in innovative ways, allowing them to decode the clues along with Kate.

Father and son nurtured their first interactions in Alethaville, the family residence that was located in Station Hill, one of those villages in Barbados whose special culture is being eroded with time. It was in this colonial Caribbean island that the father's identity was rooted. Not surprisingly, therefore, it was an event of single proportions when the family moved to New York City in 1956. These transnational migrations always induce stress, as much as they create novel opportunities for the immigrants. In retrospective contemplation, the author celebrates his father's life and a relationship so powerfully linked to things Barbadian.

Taken together they constitute a valuable resource for the homilist in the creation of future sermons of equal relevance to the time and circumstances under which they are delivered.

The substantial Introduction is Hegel's best exposition of his general philosophy of art, and provides the ideal way into his Aesthetics. In Part I he considers the general nature of art: he distinguishes art, as a spiritual experience, from religion and philosophy; he discusses the beauty of art and differentiates it from the beauty of nature; and he examines artistic genius and originality. Part II provides a sort of history of art, divded into three periods called Symbolic (India, Persia, Egypt), Classical (Greece), and Romantic (medieval and post-medieval up to the end of the eighteenth century). Part IIIdeals individually with architecture, scuplture, painting, music, and literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zj8kAwAAQBAJ&dq=Aesthetics:+Lectures+on+Fine+Art+Volume+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning Irish: An introductory self-tutor","description":"An introductory Irish language course.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EVOcnQEACAAJ&dq=Learning+Irish:+An+introductory+self-tutor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las nanas de abuelita / Grandmother's Nursery Rhymes","description":"A collection of traditional South American nursery rhymes in both Spanish and English.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6ME8zwEACAAJ&dq=Las+nanas+de+abuelita+/+Grandmother%27s+Nursery+Rhymes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life, Love, and Laughter: Gifts of the Spirit","description":"Gordon's most frequently requested poems, award winners, and personal favorites make her first chapbook varied, witty, playful and profound. --Anacade International.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VIMtPQAACAAJ&dq=Life,+Love,+and+Laughter:+Gifts+of+the+Spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A slave's gambit: A new novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kqi_PwAACAAJ&dq=A+slave%27s+gambit:+A+new+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trial of Christ: A Twenty-First Century Lawyer Defends Jesus","description":" The Trial of Christ will prove enlightening, thrilling, and captivating to all who pick it up and take time to read it.

The New York Times Book Review  Important . . . empowering.   Gayle King, CBS This Morning \\"That [Fowler] became a whistle-blower and a pioneer of a social movement almost seems inevitable once you get to know her. Uber should have seen her coming.   San Francisco Chronicle Named a Best Book of 2020 by NPR Susan Fowler was just twenty-five years old when her blog post describing the sexual harassment and retaliation she'd experienced at Uber riveted the nation. Her post would eventually lead to the ousting of Uber's powerful CEO, but its ripples extended far beyond that, as her courageous choice to attach her name to the post inspired other women to speak publicly about their experiences. In the year that followed, an unprecedented number of women came forward, and Fowler was recognized by Time as one of the \\"Silence Breakers\\" who ignited the #MeToo movement. Here, she shares her full story: a story of extraordinary determination and resilience that reveals what it takes--and what it means--to be a whistleblower. Long before she arrived at Uber, Fowler's life had been defined by her refusal to accept her circumstances. She propelled herself from an impoverished childhood with little formal education to the Ivy League, and then to a coveted position at one of the most valuable companies in the history of Silicon Valley. Each time she was mistreated, she fought back or found a way to reinvent herself; all she wanted was the opportunity to define her own dreams and work to achieve them. But when she discovered Uber's pervasive culture of sexism, racism, harassment, and abuse, and that the company would do nothing about it, she knew she had to speak out no matter what it cost her. Whistleblower takes us deep inside this shockingly toxic workplace and reveals new details about the aftermath of the blog post, in which Fowler was investigated and followed, hacked and threatened, to the point that she feared for her life. But even as it illuminates how the deck is stacked in favor of the status quo, Fowler's story serves as a crucial reminder that we can take our power back. Both moving personal narrative and rallying cry, Whistleblower urges us to be the heroes of our own stories, and to keep fighting for a more just and equitable world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yikVEAAAQBAJ&dq=WHISTLEBLOWER&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Searching for Values: A Grandmother, a Grandson, and the Discovery of Goodness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-_HjPwAACAAJ&dq=Searching+for+Values:+A+Grandmother,+a+Grandson,+and+the+Discovery+of+Goodness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Christmas Card for Mr. Mcfizz","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bLKsq4C0xEsC&dq=A+Christmas+Card+for+Mr.+Mcfizz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thong Also Rises: Further Misadventures from Funny Women on the Road (Travelers' Tales Guides)","description":"Too many travel guides are dry lists of attractions or portentous histories of a place.

Borodin is #50) * A detailed and anecdotal look at each composer's life and work * The five primary works of each composer and specific recommended CDs for each. * Further great works of each composer--if you really like him * Concise explanations of musical terminology, forms, and periods * A guide to the parts and history of the symphony orchestra \\"This book uses every conceivable gimmick to immerse readers in the richness of classical music: lists, rankings, sidebars devoted to lively anecdotes, and catchy leads.\\" --The Washington Post \\"One terrific music appreciation book...The information is surprisingly detailed but concisely presented.

A soaring tale in which, at long last, these daring World War II pilots gain the credit they deserve.\\"--Liza Mundy, New York Times bestselling author of Code Girls \\"A powerful story of reinvention, community and ingenuity born out of global upheaval.\\"--Newsday When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Cornelia Fort was already in the air. At twenty-two, Fort had escaped Nashville's debutante scene for a fresh start as a flight instructor in Hawaii. She and her student were in the middle of their lesson when the bombs began to fall, and they barely made it back to ground that morning. Still, when the U.S. Army Air Forces put out a call for women pilots to aid the war effort, Fort was one of the first to respond. She became one of just over 1,100 women from across the nation to make it through the Army's rigorous selection process and earn her silver wings. The brainchild of trailblazing pilots Nancy Love and Jacqueline Cochran, the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) gave women like Fort a chance to serve their country--and to prove that women aviators were just as skilled as men. While not authorized to serve in combat, the WASP helped train male pilots for service abroad, and ferried bombers and pursuits across the country. Thirty-eight WASP would not survive the war. But even taking into account these tragic losses, Love and Cochran's social experiment seemed to be a resounding success--until, with the tides of war turning, Congress clipped the women's wings. The program was disbanded, the women sent home. But the bonds they'd forged never failed, and over the next few decades they came together to fight for recognition as the military veterans they were--and for their place in history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RvAgEAAAQBAJ&dq=Silver+Wings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Statistical Physics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZGpCxQEACAAJ&dq=Complete+Statistical+Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"She was a queen,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V-sz0_2nScIC&dq=She+was+a+queen,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Age is a Laughing Matter: How to Laugh Through the Second Half of Your Life","description":"Limericks, parodies and playful light verse about birthdays, aging, Elderhostel trips, late-life romance, time's wisdom, and humor in a retirement community. --Anacade International.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x8g7AAAACAAJ&dq=Age+is+a+Laughing+Matter:+How+to+Laugh+Through+the+Second+Half+of+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Network Analysis, Architecture and Design, Second Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Networking)","description":"Traditionally, networking has had little or no basis in analysis or architectural development, with designers relying on technologies they are most familiar with or being influenced by vendors or consultants. However, the landscape of networking has changed so that network services have now become one of the most important factors to the success of many third generation networks. It has become an important feature of the designer's job to define the problems that exist in his network, choose and analyze several optimization parameters during the analysis process, and then prioritize and evaluate these parameters in the architecture and design of the system. Network Analysis, Architecture, and Design, Third Edition, uses a systems methodology approach to teaching these concepts, which views the network (and the environment it impacts) as part of the larger system, looking at interactions and dependencies between the network and its users, applications, and devices. This approach matches the new business climate where customers drive the development of new services and the book discusses how networks can be architected and designed to provide many different types of services to customers. With a number of examples, analogies, instructor tips, and exercises, this book works through the processes of analysis, architecture, and design step by step, giving designers a solid resource for making good design decisions. With examples, guidelines, and general principles McCabe illuminates how a network begins as a concept, is built with addressing protocol, routing, and management, and harmonizes with the interconnected technology around it. Other topics covered in the book are learning to recognize problems in initial design, analyzing optimization parameters, and then prioritizing these parameters and incorporating them into the architecture and design of the system. This is an essential book for any professional that will be designing or working with a network on a routine basis. Substantially updated design content includes ad hoc networks, GMPLS, IPv6, and mobile networking Written by an expert in the field that has designed several large-scale networks for government agencies, universities, and corporations Incorporates real-life ideas and experiences of many expert designers along with case studies and end-of-chapter exercises","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iddGPgR48_MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Airs & Graces (G.

Respighi's interest in the works of Monteverdi, Vivaldi, and other composers was expressed in his own creations, which have come to be regarded as typical examples of Neoclassicism. This unique collection spotlights the original piano version of the very popular title piece, Ancient Airs and Dances (Antiche Danze ed Arie). Well-known as an orchestral work based on Renaissance lute pieces by Simone Molinaro, Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo Galilei), and additional anonymous composers, this enchanting suite can now be enjoyed at home. Additional features--Six Pieces for Solo Piano and Three Preludes on Gregorian Melodies--highlight other early and lesser-known pieces that offer glimpses of Respighi's distinctive and beautiful interpretations of Neoclassicism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yo93H7aYlQwC&dq=Airs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prevention's The Healthy Cook: The Ultimate Illustrated Kitchen Guide to Great Low-Fat Food","description":"Recipes for low-fat fare include tips from top chefs","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WtKITfYYQf0C&dq=Prevention%27s+The+Healthy+Cook:+The+Ultimate+Illustrated+Kitchen+Guide+to+Great+Low-Fat+Food&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eye for an Eye","description":"A killer running rings around the police.

Lily marries Stephen, only to discover that his family's fa?ade of respectability conceals a terrifying combination of repression, jealousy and violence. When Stephen's terrors merge dangerously close with reality, the truth of what took place in the mud and darkness brings him and all who love him to a terrible reckoning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AFdAYDpIfQAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cosmos Crumbling: American Reform and the Religious Imagination","description":"In the forty years before the Civil War, America was awash in political and social reform movements. Abolitionists stormed against the cruelties of slavery. Temperance zealots hounded producers and consumers of strong drink. Sabbatarians fought to make Sunday an officially recognized sacred day. Woman's rights activists proclaimed the case for sexual equality. This colorful text brilliantly reassesses the religious roots of these antebellum reform movements through a series of penetrating profiles of key men and women who sought to remake their worlds in sacred terms. Arguing that we cannot understand American reform movements unless we understand the sacred significance reformers bestowed on the worldly arenas of politics, society, and the economy, Abzug presents these men and women in their own words, placing their cherished ideals and their often heated squabbles within the context of their millennial and sometimes apocalyptic sense of America's role in the cosmic drama. Tracing the lasting impact of what began as a peculiarly Protestant, largely New England, style of social action on the uniquely American traditions of activism that flourish today, Cosmos Crumbling is invaluable for helping students of American and religious history understand the myriad ways in which the quest for enlightenment and salvation continues to shape American politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ey68wAEACAAJ&dq=Cosmos+Crumbling:+American+Reform+and+the+Religious+Imagination&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If I Ran the Rain Forest: All About Tropical Rain Forests (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","description":"The Cat in the Hat takes Sally and Dick for an  umbrella-vator  ride through the understory, canopy, and emergent layers of a tropical rain forest, encountering a host of plants, animals, and native peoples along the way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZIiVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Imperial Middle: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Class","description":"Examines the concept of America as a classless society and reveals the social and political problems associated with the myth","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MLHzyjZu7kEC&dq=The+Imperial+Middle:+Why+Americans+Can%27t+Think+Straight+About+Class&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DEAD NAMES : THE DARK HISTORY OF THE NECRONOMICON","description":"The dark history of the Necronomiconone of the world's most feared and fascinating bookstold by the one man who saw it all...and lived to tell the tale. The Necronomicon is one of the most controversial books ever published. The master of Gothic suspense, H.P. Lovecraft, wrote about a mystical and dreaded grimoire, known as the Necronomiconan ancient text written by an Arab that, if it were to fall into the wrong hands, could have disastrous consequences. But no one thought the Necronomicon had any basis in the world outside of Lovecraft's fiction. Until... Simon was a young man drawn to the mysterious world of the occult through his association with several Eastern Orthodox religions and his friendship with the owner of an occult bookstore in Brooklyn. In 1972 he stumbled upon a stolen text in a friend's apartment, unaware that what he held in his hands was the real Necronomiconsomething long thought to be a creation of Lovecraft's brilliant mind and deft pen. After an arduous translation, done in the utmost secrecy (since the tome was in fact stolen), Simon and his close circle of friends unveiled the nowinfamous grimoire to a clamoring public. In Dead Names, Simon tells the amazing true story that surrounds the Necronomicon. From the main players' humble beginnings in the pageantryfilled and secret world of Eastern Orthodox religion, to the accidental discovery of the Necronomicon, to the Son of Sam murders, the JFK assassination , the brilliant William S. Burroughs, and the eventual suspicious deaths of almost everyone involved with the grimoire, this book is an enthralling account of a book steeped in legend, lies, and murder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s0W3_Qs8uw8C&dq=DEAD+NAMES+:+THE+DARK+HISTORY+OF+THE+NECRONOMICON&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir","description":"Caustic, brilliant, uncompromising, accomplished, Lillian Hellman, one writer noted, can \\"take the tops off bottles with her teeth\\".

I would recommend it to all early childhood practitioners, not just those considering their current assessment procedures, as the chapters focusing on the child as a learner are of value on their own' - Julia Browne, Goldsmiths Association for Early Childhood This book shows that an early childhood setting can be described as a learning place in which children develop learning dispositions such as resilience in the face of uncertainty, confidence to express their ideas, and collaborative and thoughtful approaches to problem-solving. These dispositions provide the starting point for life-long learning. The author asks: How can we assess and track children's learning in the early years in a way that includes learning dispositions and avoids the pitfalls of over-formal methods, whilst being helpful for practitioners, interesting for families, and supportive for learners? The book - describes a way of assessment that stays close to the children's real experiences and provides an alternative to mechanistic and fragmented approaches, - shows how practitioners can assess what really matters: those learning dispositions (interest, involvement and perseverance for example) that provide a foundation for life-long learning. The book is about weaving theory and practice: theorizing development and learning as reflected in assessment practice. The author also argues that unless we find ways to assess complex outcomes in early childhood they will be excluded from the teaching and the learning. Simple and low level outcomes and goals will take their place. The theoretical ideas and arguments are illustrated throughout by transcripts and stories of children in a range of early childhood settings. At every turn in the journey it asks: How is this reflected in a real life context? It documents the voices of children, practitioners and parents as the learning story develops.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FqUiglbxIAwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frecuentar el fuego (Villegas Novela)","description":"Latino Book Award 2005 - Mejor Novela Rom ntica (Best Romance Novel) This remarkable novel exists as one of the most accurate narrative descriptions of rural violence in Colombia.

An entire household of eight people had been axed to death in their beds. Within 24 hours, in spite of limited mass communications, the story was national and international news, knocking the White Star Titanic off the front page and captivating the general public. The mass murder became a catalyst to a growing nation starting to realize the 20th century, with all of its advancements, held new forms of terror and insecurity. If the mass murder could happen in this idyllic little village, it could happen anywhere. Author Stephen Bowman's version of the story has been compared to Capote's IN COLD BLOOD mystery as it recreates the gruesome murder and the aftermath in an expose of rural family strife and local mores toward bigotry, superstition and caste system which still exists in rural America today. The suspenseful mystery brings to life a vivid cast of characters. Through the main characters, the themes of rural life and prejudice are revealed as they each struggle with conflicts between self-respect, family honor and justice. The crime remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of the 20th century","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KDgf2LoOGZIC&dq=Morning+Ran+Red:+The+Villisca+Axe+Murders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notes Toward a New Rhetoric (6 Essays For Teachers)","description":"Genuine Teachers of This Art examines the techn , or \\"handbook,\\" tradition which it controversially suggests began with Isocrates as the central tradition in ancient rhetoric and a potential model for contemporary rhetoric. From this innovative perspective, Jeffrey Walker offers reconsiderations of rhetorical theories and schoolroom practices from early to late antiquity as the true aim of the philosophical rhetoric of Isocrates and as the distinctive expression of what Cicero called \\"the genuine teachers of this art.\\" Through a study of the classical rhetorical paideia, or training system, Walker makes a case for considering rhetoric not as an Aristotelian critical-theoretical discipline, but as an Isocratean pedagogical discipline in which the art of rhetoric is neither an art of producing critical theory nor even an art of producing speeches and texts, but an art of producing speakers and writers. Walker grounds his study in pedagogical theses mined from revealing against-the-grain readings of Cicero, Isocrates, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Walker also locates supporting examples from a host of other sources, including Aelius Theon, Aphthonius, the Rhetoric to Alexander, the Rhetoric to Herennius, Quintilian, Hermogenes, Hermagoras, Lucian, Libanius, Apsines, the Anonymous Seguerianus, and fragments of ancient student writing preserved in papyri. Walker's epilogue considers the relevance of the ancient techn  tradition for the modern discipline of rhetoric, arguing that rhetoric is defined foremost by its pedagogical enterprise, the project of producing rhetors capable of intelligent, effective, and useful civic engagement through speech and writing. This groundbreaking vision of the techn  tradition significantly revises the standard picture of the ancient history of rhetoric with ramifications for the contemporary disciplinary identity of rhetoric itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fioUCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE LONELY HOUSE","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4TAljwEACAAJ&dq=THE+RIDDLE+OF+THE+LONELY+HOUSE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King of the World","description":"The bestselling biography of Muhammad Ali--with an Introduction by Salman Rushdie On the night in 1964 that Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) stepped into the ring with Sonny Liston, he was widely regarded as an irritating freak who danced and talked way too much. Six rounds later Ali was not only the new world heavyweight boxing champion: He was \\"a new kind of black man\\" who would shortly transform America's racial politics, its popular culture, and its notions of heroism. No one has captured Ali--and the era that he exhilarated and sometimes infuriated--with greater vibrancy, drama, and astuteness than David Remnick, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Lenin's Tomb (and editor of The New Yorker). In charting Ali's rise from the gyms of Louisville, Kentucky, to his epochal fights against Liston and Floyd Patterson, Remnick creates a canvas of unparalleled richness. He gives us empathetic portraits of wisecracking sportswriters and bone-breaking mobsters; of the baleful Liston and the haunted Patterson; of an audacious Norman Mailer and an enigmatic Malcolm X. Most of all, King of the World does justice to the speed, grace, courage, humor, and ebullience of one of the greatest athletes and irresistibly dynamic personalities of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vkvoAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Core Concepts in Health: With Powerweb","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RxfDvQEACAAJ&dq=Core+Concepts+in+Health:+With+Powerweb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classical Music: The Era of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven (The Norton Introduction to Music History)","description":"He demonstrates the enormous diversity and constant change that characterized every aspect of music during this period.

And feeling is still less without love.' Celebrated in its own day as the progenitor of 'a school of sentimental writers', A Sentimental Journey (1768) has outlasted its many imitators because of the humour and mischievous eroticism that inform Mr Yorick's travels. Setting out to journey to France and Italy he gets little further than Lyons but finds much to appreciate, in contrast to contemporary travel writers whom Sterne satirizes in the figures of Smelfungus and Mundungus. A master of ambiguity and double entendre, Sterne is nevertheless as concerned as his peers with exploring the nature of virtue; unlike other writers of sentimental fiction Sterne insists on the inseparability of desire and feeling. This new edition includes a selection from The Sermons of Mr Yorick, which shed light on the concerns of the Journey, The Journal to Eliza, which records Sterne's feelings as he languishes for the company of Eliza Draper, and A Political Romance, the satire on a local ecclesiastical squabble that was the catalyst for Sterne's literary career.

In The Little Book that Beats the Market a New York Times bestseller with 300,000 copies in print Greenblatt explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices. Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, The Little Book that Still Beats the Market updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author s time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6th grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You ll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone  knows  it. While the formula may be simple, understanding why the formula works is the true key to success for investors. The book will take readers on a step-by-step journey so that they can learn the principles of value investing in a way that will provide them with a long term strategy that they can understand and stick with through both good and bad periods for the stock market. As the Wall Street Journal stated about the original edition,  Mr. Greenblatt says his goal was to provide advice that, while sophisticated, could be understood and followed by his five children, ages 6 to 15. They are in luck. His  Little Book  is one of the best, clearest guides to value investing out there.

When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse. Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all?

It seems to signal the end of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe. But it is just the beginning. Over the course of the next three decades, the reservation grows to more than two thousand acres and becomes home to Foxwoods, the largest casino in the world, grossing more than $1 billion per year. The Pequots are reborn, immensely wealthy, and in possession of an enormous amount of political influence. How did it happen? In compelling detail, Without Reservation tells the stunning story of the rise of the richest tribe in American history. It begins with the grand ambitions of two men. One, an unemployed navy brat and outsider, is a failed preacher with the uncanny ability to charm; the other is fresh out of law school and armed with a brilliant legal theory to help impoverished Indian tribes. Together they resurrect the Pequots and battle the local townspeople to aggressively expand their reservation, taking on the state government for the right to gamble on their land. Embracing their cause are misguided and misinformed government officials and a former mob prosecutor who brings Malaysian financiers to the table. The Pequots must also contend with the price of power. Without Reservation reveals the mysterious roots of today's Pequot tribe, the racial tension that divides them, and the Machiavellian internal Power struggle over who will control the tribe's purse strings. This is a story of the duality of the American dream, the good and the bad that come with enormous wealth. Author Jeff Benedict shines a light on the dreamers and the deal makers, the backroom politicking and courtroom machinations, the trusts and betrayals, and the world of high-powered attorneys, politicians, tribal leaders, and financiers who made the Pequots what they are today. As compelling as a novel, Without Reservation is must reading for anyone interested in the way today's world really works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JDF8QgAACAAJ&dq=Without+Reservation:+The+Making+of+America%27s+Most+Powerful+Indian+Tribe+and+Foxwoods+the+World%27s+Largest+Casino&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Handgun Hunting: Tips and Tactics for Hunting Small and Big Game","description":"Everything you need to know about hunting with pistols and revolvers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XKlMvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Ultimate+Guide+to+Handgun+Hunting:+Tips+and+Tactics+for+Hunting+Small+and+Big+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thorn Witch (Biscuit, Buttons & Pickles)","description":"Two rag dolls captured by the Thorn Witch teach her some of the niceties of hospitality and friendship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SzumtwEACAAJ&dq=The+Thorn+Witch+(Biscuit,+Buttons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A COMPENDIUM OF THE THEOLOGICAL WRITINGS OF EMANUEL SWEDENBORG.","description":"A classic!

In it, Russell provides a detailed narrative describing the day-to-day life of an ordinary trapper in the Rocky Mountains. The Journal begins when Russell hired on with Nathaniel Wyeth's second expedition to the west. He participated in the establishment of Fort Hall, and later became a free trapper. He trapped for nine years in the greater Yellowstone region before leaving the mountains to settle in Oregon.Osborne Russell (1814 - August 2, 1892) was a mountain man and politician who helped form the government of the U.S. state of Oregon. He was born in Maine.Russell first came to the Oregon Country in 1834 as a member of Nathaniel J. Wyeth's second expedition. He returned to the country in 1842 with the Elijah White party. He participated in the May 2, 1843 Champoeg Meeting, voting in favor of forming a government. In October of that year he was selected by the First Executive Committee to serve as the supreme judge for the Provisional Government of Oregon and served until May 14, 1844. In 1844, he was elected to the second Executive Committee of the Provisional Government of Oregon. He was allied with the group that planned to create an independent Republic of the Pacific and thus was unsuccessful in his run for governor of the Provisional Government in 1845, losing to George Abernethy. Russell eventually went to California.Although not published until well after the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, Osborne's Journal of a Trapper contains an early description of the Lamar Valley or Osborne's Secluded Valley in Yellowstone.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3glTMQAACAAJ&dq=Journal+Of+A+Trapper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heralds of That Good Realm: Syro-Mesopotamian Gnosis and Jewish Traditions (Nag Hammadi and Manichaean Studies)","description":"This volume examines the transmission of biblical pseudepigraphic literature and motifs from their largely Jewish cultural contexts in Palestine to developing gnostic milieux of Syria and Mesopotamia, particularly that one lying behind the birth and growth of Manichaeism. It surveys biblical pseudepigraphic literary activity in the late antique Near East, devoting special attention to revelatory works attributed to the five biblical forefathers who are cited in the \\"Cologne Mani Codex\\": Adam, Seth, Enosh, Shem, and Enoch. The author provides a philological, literary, and religio-historical analysis of each of the five pseudepigraphic citations contained in the \\"Codex,\\" and offers hypotheses regarding the original provenance of each citation and the means by which these traditions have been adapted to their present context.

Some deny the possibility of \\"recovering\\" repressed memories of abuse, or consider date rape an invention of whining college students. At the opposite extreme, others contend that women who experience abuse are \\"survivors\\" likely destined to be psychically wounded for life. While the debates rage between victims' rights advocates and \\"backlash\\" authors, the contributors to New Versions of Victims collectively argue that we must move beyond these polarizations to examine the \\"victim\\" as a socially constructed term and to explore, in nuanced terms, why we see victims the way we do. Must one have been subject to extreme or prolonged suffering to merit designation as a victim? How are we to explain rape victims who seemingly \\"get over\\" their experience with no lingering emotional scars? Resisting the reductive oversimplifications of the polemicists, the contributors to New Versions of Victims critique exaggerated claims by victim advocates about the harm of victimization while simultaneously taking on the reactionary boilerplate of writers such as Katie Roiphe and Camille Paglia and offering further strategies for countering the backlash. Written in clear, accessible language, New Versions of Victims offers a critical analysis of popular debates about victimization that will be applicable to both practice and theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_gUUCgAAQBAJ&dq=New+Versions+of+Victims+:+Feminists+Struggle+With+the+Concept&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We're Alive And Life Goes On - A Theresienstadt Diary","description":"Presents the diary of a young woman living in a model concentration camp designed by the Nazis","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O1FoCgAAQBAJ&dq=We%27re+Alive+And+Life+Goes+On+-+A+Theresienstadt+Diary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microeconomics , Study Guide: Theory & Applications","description":"Provides a rich array of over 100 examples that show how theory works in real companies, industry, and government. * Applications throughout the book and in four unique applications chapters demonstrate the importance of microeconomics to sound decision making. * Makes microeconomics interesting, relevant, and easy to understand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u6VUOtqdcuUC&dq=Microeconomics+,+Study+Guide:+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asset Choice, Liquidity Preference, and Rationality under Uncertainty.(uncertainty economics): An article from: Journal of Economic Issues","description":"This book originated from a 2010 conference marking the fortieth anniversary of the publication of the landmark \\"Phelps volume,\\" Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory, a book that is often credited with pioneering the currently dominant approach to macroeconomic analysis. However, in their provocative introductory essay, Roman Frydman and Edmund Phelps argue that the vast majority of macroeconomic and finance models developed over the last four decades derailed, rather than built on, the Phelps volume's \\"microfoundations\\" approach. Whereas the contributors to the 1970 volume recognized the fundamental importance of according market participants' expectations an autonomous role, contemporary models rely on the rational expectations hypothesis (REH), which rules out such a role by design. The financial crisis that began in 2007, preceded by a spectacular boom and bust in asset prices that REH models implied could never happen, has spurred a quest for fresh approaches to macroeconomic analysis. While the alternatives to REH presented in Rethinking Expectations differ from the approach taken in the original Phelps volume, they are notable for returning to its major theme: understanding aggregate outcomes requires according expectations an autonomous role. In the introductory essay, Frydman and Phelps interpret the various efforts to reconstruct the field--some of which promise to chart its direction for decades to come. The contributors include Philippe Aghion, Sheila Dow, George W. Evans, Roger E. A. Farmer, Roman Frydman, Michael D. Goldberg, Roger Guesnerie, Seppo Honkapohja, Katarina Juselius, Enisse Kharroubi, Blake LeBaron, Edmund S. Phelps, John B.

Top Gun: 50 Years of Naval Air Superiority begins with a fascinating behind-the-scenes account of the blockbuster film that helped America shake off the trauma of the Vietnam War and once again take pride in its military. The book then launches into the even more incredible story of why and how such men consistently capture the imagination of children, adults, pilots, and audiences around the world. Chapters spotlight pivotal military movies and television shows that presaged the movie Top Gun, including edge-of-the-seat vignettes and anecdotes of pilots and their lifestyles, the origin of the Navy s fighter pilot program and its rigorous training, and how it inspired the Air Force s counterpart, Red Flag. Other chapters highlight what it takes to be a pilot in other branches of the armed forces, and takes a look back in time at the most notorious (and feared) pilots of World War I and World War II from all around the globe. Fast forward to the jet age, when the first aces flew hair-raising missions over Korea and Vietnam, and learn how past and contemporary aerial dogfighting really works. The book also reveals the many technological advances that transformed aerial combat from the dangerous, unsynchronized machine guns that bounced bullets off propellers in World War I to today, where air-to-air missiles are launched by pilots who have no visual contact with an adversary, and finally illustrates how drones are adding a new dimension to the meaning of Top Gun. Finish with an in-depth look at Naval Station Fallon, one of the most modern and renowned American naval stations, located outside Fallon, Nevada. Top Gun: 50 Years of Naval Air Superiority concludes with a look at Top Gun 2, the highly anticipated sequel to one of the biggest action movies of all time and the one that made Tom Cruise a worldwide superstar. Featuring over 200 photos, new interviews and stories from aces, engineers, commanders, and more, and written by best-selling author and president of the Military Writers Society of America, Dwight Zimmerman, Top Gun: 50 Years of Naval Air Superiority is the must-have guide to the fastest, deadliest, most storied aerial combat squadron the world has ever known.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hjeSDwAAQBAJ&dq=Top+Gun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Welcome to the Monkey House","description":"Since its original publication in 1968, Welcome to the Monkey House has been one of Kurt Vonnegut s most beloved works.

In 1939, seven-year-old Saul and his family were forced to flee to France, where they lived through the German Occupation, until his parents' ill-fated attempt to flee to Switzerland. They were able to hide their son in a Roman Catholic seminary before being sent to Auschwitz where they were killed. After an imposed religious conversion, young Saul began training for priesthood. The birth of Israel prompted his discovery of his Jewish past and his true identity. Friedl?nder brings his story movingly to life, shifting between his Israeli present and his European past with grace and restraint. His keen eye spares nothing, not even himself, as he explores the ways in which the loss of his parents, his conversion to Catholicism, and his deep-seated Jewish roots combined to shape him into the man he is today.

According to Kuyper, Calvinism has a natural affinity for scientific investigation, because like scientific inquiry, Calvinism seeks to unify the cosmos under universal laws. Predestination, he says, proves that a set of laws exist to govern the world, and science is merely trying to figure them out.

The concept of modernity the notion that we, the living, are different and somehow superior to our predecessors and that our civilization is likely to be succeeded by one even superior to ours is a relatively recent Western invention and one whose time may already have passed, if we believe its postmodern challengers. Calinescu documents the rise of cultural modernity and, in tracing the shifting senses of the five terms under scrutiny, illustrates the intricate value judgments, conflicting orientations, and intellectual paradoxes to which it has given rise. Five Faces of Modernity attempts to do for the foundations of the modernist critical lexicon what earlier terminological studies have done for such complex categories as classicism, baroque, romanticism, realism, or symbolism and thereby fill a gap in literary scholarship. On another, more ambitious level, Calinescu deals at length with the larger issues, dilemmas, ideological tensions, and perplexities brought about by the assertion of modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bPVYpE04y0AC&dq=The+Influence+of+Franz+Kafka+on+Three+Novels+by+Gabriel+Garca+Mrquez+(Comparative+Cultures+and+Literatures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery (2 Volume Set)","description":"Covering the history of human slavery in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas, and the United States, this volume has entries for individuals and such topics as the details of living conditions, resistance and rebellion, law and emancipation, and theory and politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5s0YAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Historical+Encyclopedia+of+World+Slavery+(2+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silver Pages on the Lawn","description":"Silver Pages on the Lawn is the true story of student lovers and their star-crossed romance that endures parental disapproval as well as the want of time, money, and privacy.

ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EXH2BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From 9/11 To 666: THE CONVERGENCE OF CURRENT EVENTS, BIBLICAL PROPHECY AND THE VISION OF ISLAM","description":"Many years of conversations with Muslims sprang to mind as I saw the plumes of smoke rising from the Twin Towers and the screams of eyewitnesses in New York.

Matusow now presents the first comprehensive history of Nixon's political economy. He depicts a president who disliked the subject but was forced to pay attention or lose his dream of effecting a historic realignment of the political parties in America. The study derives its authority from extensive archival research in Nixon's presidential papers, including notes by Haldeman and Ehrlichman of crucial conversations in the Oval Office. Matusow shows the poverty of contemporary economic theory, Nixon's willingness to sacrifice the world economy for his domestic political purposes, and his desperate attempts to find something, anything, that might work. Lurching from one set of policies to another, Matusow argues, Nixon achieved only illusory successes that ultimately brought on a decade of economic disaster.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vWuM4vxkZmwC&dq=Nixon%27s+Economy:+Booms,+Busts,+Dollars,+and+Votes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reconstructing Keynesian Economics With Imperfect Competition: A Desk-Top Simulation","description":"'Professor Robin Marris, who almost thirty years ago made pioneering contributions on the theory of managerial capitalism, has now written a fascinating and highly unusual book on Keynesian macroeconomics.' - Amitava Krishna Dutt, Review of Social Economy '. . . the book provides many valuable insights for macroeconomists on both sides of the Atlantic.' - Stephen McCafferty, Journal of Economic Literature This path-breaking book - written by a leading economist - is certain to create controversy and will lead to a fundamental reassessment of Keynesian economics.

Technological advances have benefited our world in immeasurable ways, but there is an ominous flip side: our technology can be turned against us. Hackers can activate baby monitors to spy on families, thieves are analyzing social media posts to plot home invasions, and stalkers are exploiting the GPS on smart phones to track their victims  every move. We all know today s criminals can steal identities, drain online bank accounts, and wipe out computer servers, but that s just the beginning. To date, no computer has been created that could not be hacked a sobering fact given our radical dependence on these machines for everything from our nation s power grid to air traffic control to financial services. Yet, as ubiquitous as technology seems today, just over the horizon is a tidal wave of scientific progress that will leave our heads spinning. If today s Internet is the size of a golf ball, tomorrow s will be the size of the sun. Welcome to the Internet of Things, a living, breathing, global information grid where every physical object will be online. But with greater connections come greater risks. Implantable medical devices such as pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt of electricity and a car s brakes can be disabled at high speed from miles away. Meanwhile, 3-D printers can produce AK-47s, bioterrorists can download the recipe for Spanish flu, and cartels are using fleets of drones to ferry drugs across borders. With explosive insights based upon a career in law enforcement and counterterrorism, Marc Goodman takes readers on a vivid journey through the darkest recesses of the Internet. Reading like science fiction, but based in science fact, Future Crimes explores how bad actors are primed to hijack the technologies of tomorrow, including robotics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. These fields hold the power to create a world of unprecedented abundance and prosperity. But the technological bedrock upon which we are building our common future is deeply unstable and, like a house of cards, can come crashing down at any moment. Future Crimes provides a mind-blowing glimpse into the dark side of technological innovation and the unintended consequences of our connected world. Goodman offers a way out with clear steps we must take to survive the progress unfolding before us. Provocative, thrilling, and ultimately empowering, Future Crimes will serve as an urgent call to action that shows how we can take back control over our own devices and harness technology s tremendous power for the betterment of humanity before it s too late.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5v99BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Defector","description":"In Moscow Rules Gabriel Allon went up against the sadisitc Ivan Kharkov.

For most of his life, David Wojnarowicz considered himself the ultimate outsider and a true invisible man.  I m a blank spot in a hectic civilization,  he writes in this fierce and unforgettable collection of four blistering autobiographical pieces, illustrated with his own arresting ink drawings. Wojnarowicz, who died of AIDS in New York City at the age of thirty-seven, left behind a body of work that was staggering in its variety and originality. Painter, writer, photographer, performance artist, and filmmaker, he made an indelible mark on virtually every stage of the national arts scene. Yet nowhere does his anger, love, or compassion show itself as strongly as in his writing, which earned a Lambda Literary Award and prompted critics to call him the Jack Kerouac of his generation. The horrors of Wojnarowicz s past inform his literature his years spent as a child prostitute and living homeless on the New York streets, his outspoken, very public battle against the disease that would eventually take his life, and the entrenched government bureaucracy that sat by and did nothing. The world as seen through Wojnarowicz s eyes in these four masterful short works is stark, cruel, and cold and yet gloriously alive, ennobled by surprising acts of heartrending humanity. Memories That Smell Like Gasoline is a celebration of sorts: of sex, of love, of art, and of having truly lived.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4IySAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The PreHistory of the Far Side: A 10th Anniversary Exhibit.","description":"1989 FarWorks, Inc.

Set in the pre-Nara period, The Tale of Matsura is the story of a young Japanese courtier, Ujitada, who is sent to China with an embassy and has a number of supernatural experiences while there. Affairs of the heart dominate The Tale of Matsura, as is standard for courtly tales. Several of its other features break the usual mold, however: its time and setting; the military episode that would seem to belong instead in a war tale; scenes depicting the sovereign s daily audiences, in which formal court business is conducted; a substantial degree of specificity in referring to things Chinese; a heavy reliance on fantastic and supernatural elements; an obvious effort to avoid imitating The Tale of Genji as other late-Heian tales had done; and a most inventive ending. The discussion in the introduction briefly touches upon each of these features, and then focuses at some length on how characteristics associated with the poetic ideal of yoen inform the tale. Evidence relating to the date and authorship of the tale is explored in two appendixes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oAH6DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Tale+of+Matsura:+Fujiwara+Teika%27s+Experiment+in+Fiction+(Michigan+Monograph+Series+in+Japanese+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Industrial Policy Supporting Economic Transition in Central-Eastern Europe: Lessons from Slovenia (Policy Papers in International Affairs No 43)","description":"Industrial policy is tainted with bad reputation among policymakers and academics and is often viewed as the road to perdition for developing economies. Yet the success of the Asian Miracles with industrial policy stands as an uncomfortable story that many ignore or claim it cannot be replicated. Using a theory and empirical evidence, we argue that one can learn more from miracles than failures. We suggest three key principles behind their success: (i) the support of domestic producers in sophisticated industries, beyond the initial comparative advantage; (ii) export orientation; and (iii) the pursuit of fierce competition with strict accountability.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cKYZEAAAQBAJ&dq=Industrial+Policy+Supporting+Economic+Transition+in+Central-Eastern+Europe:+Lessons+from+Slovenia+(Policy+Papers+in+International+Affairs+No+43)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","description":"Title: EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning Description: THE NEWEST APPROACH TO ESTATE PLANNING: KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

With no jobs to be had and no rich relations to bankroll them, they decide to form a joint venture: Young Adventurers, Ltd. They re willing to go anywhere and do anything so long as the pay as right. Maybe, suggests Tuppence, a clergyman s daughter, they ll even get to steal a diamond necklace. Before Tommy can place their first advertisement, Tuppence gets a job offer. Mr. Whittington wants to send her to Paris for three months, all expenses paid. The catch is that she has to pretend to be someone else an American and she can t talk to anyone she knows while she s there. It sounds too good to be true, and when Tuppence tries to protect herself with a pseudonym  Jane Finn,  an odd name that Tommy recently overheard Whittington s reaction is equal parts anger and admiration. Accusing Tuppence of blackmail, he gives her fifty pounds and disappears. Of course, the Young Adventurers refuse to leave it at that. Setting out to find the mysterious Jane Finn, they stumble into a deadly conspiracy that stretches all the way back to the sinking of the Lusitania and now threatens to undo everything England won in the Great War. By transforming two of London s bright young things into fearless detectives, Agatha Christie s second novel revolutionized the mystery genre.

In some neo-conservative circles the word 'empire' is back in fashion, and a great republic that broke away from the British empire is now supposed to be proud of its new imperial role. This book explains how the neo-conservatives and the petro-military complex have hijacked US foreign policy. It examines the price that Americans will have to pay for this new era of unlimited US military might - a never ending fear of terrorism; mushrooming defence and security spending; the erosion of civil liberties at home and the deaths abroad of tens of thousands of civilians and military combatants. At the heart of this disturbing and timely book is the ultimate question. Previous empires have foundered on the rock of imperial overstretch - the costs of trying to run and protect empires eventually outstripping the capacity and willingness of the citizenry to pay for them. Is the US in danger of going down that road? Who around George 'Dubya' Bush is pushing him along that path?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=roJjDgAAQBAJ&dq=Imperial+Overstretch:+George+W.+Bush+and+the+Hubris+of+Empire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"30 Days in the South Pacific: True Stories of Escape to Paradise","description":"Few can resist the lure of pristine beaches, endless coral reefs, and blazing tropical suns.

Her books have sold millions of copies, and her characters and their stories have captured the imagination of readers around the globe. She passed away in 1998, but luckily for her fans, Cookson left behind several unpublished novels, among them the compelling Silent Lady. The story begins with a shocking revelation, delivered by a disheveled woman who presents herself at the offices of a respectable law firm in London. At first the receptionist suspects this mysterious woman is a vagrant; the clothes that hang on her frail body are filthy, and she seems unable to speak. When the woman requests to see the firm's senior partner, Alexander Armstrong, she is shown the door -- but when Mr. Armstrong learns the name of his visitor, all the office staff is amazed by his reaction. For Irene Baindor is a woman with a past, and her emergence from obscurity signals the unraveling of a mystery that had baffled the lawyer for twenty-six years. To those around her, Irene Baindor had been a young woman of class and musical talent, the wife of a wealthy and powerful man, and the mother to a beloved baby boy. But behind closed doors she was a woman with a dangerous husband, a husband who would one day act with such cruelty that Irene would be left without most of her voice and memory. It was then that Irene disappeared. What Irene had been doing, and where she had been, gradually emerges over the following weeks, as the unlikely benefactors who had befriended her step forward to reveal the remarkable life she has led. Fans of Cookson's novels, with their larger themes of romantic love and class conflict, will be delighted by the mystery and surprise of The Silent Lady. Drawing from her own firsthand experience of working-class life between two world wars and in the 1950s, Cookson once again displays the irresistible plotting, scene-setting, and characterization that have made her an icon of historical and romance fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0CS-kKrVti4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","description":"Guide on how to care for the hoofs of your horses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zv0EAAAACAAJ&dq=Making+Natural+Hoof+Care+Work+for+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Down to the Bonny Glen (Martha Years)","description":"With the arrival of her new governess, Miss Crow, Martha begins to see that her work is quite important and soon realizes she could learn a great deal from her if she only took the time to get to know her.

The three major instruments that guide United States foreign policy are the Treaty Power, the War Power, and the Spy Power. Within the category of Spy Power is the \\"Third Option\\" the use of covert action. Ever since the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947, the US has often turned to the third option in the conduct of its international relations. This controversial approach includes covert propaganda campaigns, subversive political activities, economic sabotage, and paramilitary operations ranging from clandestine warfare to the assassination of foreign leaders. From the beginning of the Cold War to the present day, America's intelligence and national security agencies have employed all of these \\"third option\\" tools in order to advance America's global interests. In The Third Option, the eminent national security scholar Loch Johnson provides a history of American covert warfare from 1947 to the present. In particular, he focuses on the morality and consequences of America's heavily veiled attempts to shape global affairs through its covert actions. Over the course of the book, a fundamental question comes into focus: Of what value has the Third Option been to the US as a complement to the nation's more open battlefield and diplomatic initiatives? Just as importantly, Johnson exposes the conflict between this controversial approach to achieving America's international objectives and the ideals that the US has always propounded: democracy, human rights, and liberalism. The Third Option closes with a sharp assessment of the policy, measuring its failures versus its successes. A richly detailed synthesis of America's covert action program ever since it became the world's preeminent power, this book serves as an ideal introduction for anyone interested in US foreign and national security policy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QbNLEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Realism in Our Time: Literature and the Class Struggle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ROKEAAAAIAAJ&dq=Realism+in+Our+Time:+Literature+and+the+Class+Struggle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relics","description":"The Jews usually burned the crosses used by the Romans after executions but following Jesus' crucifixion they quickly threw the Cross in a ditch to get it out of sight before the feast of Passover. That preserved the True Cross, and memory of the events preserved its location. Disgusted with continued Christian veneration of the spot, pagan Roman Emperor Hadrian erected on the Cross's burial site a statue to Venus, hoping thereby to obliterate their memory. It didn t work. Indeed, because of the statue, when the Empire became Christian, St. Helena knew the exact spot where she would find the very Cross on which Christ died. All relics from Christ's crucifixion have a similarly fascinating story, all of which are told here in this 1910 work by the enterprising Catholic investigator Charles Wall.

The author and compiler reveals how Indians once lived and what they believed in relation to spiritual principles. As we move further away from the time when Native Americans were living completely free and unencumbered in what was to become the United States, before the arrival of the white man, it becomes increasingly difficult to preserve or remember the way of life that they had. Seton preserves all of the most important information in this book, gathered from the best sources at a time when it could still be accurately found. Like other Bibles, it includes creation stories and mythology as well as the trials and tribulations of the people. Chapters include The Soul of the Red Man, covering spiritual beliefs; The Ancient Way is about family life, laws and medicine men; The Wisdom of the Old Men covers the ancient teachings and myths; and Prophets of the Red Race shares stories on 13 different prophets, including Hiawatha, Tecumseh, Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, Wabasha, Geronimo and Wovoka. The Epilogue, originally written shortly after the Great Depression, repeatedly emphasizes the failures of the white race due to money-madness, and how important it is to bring back an awareness that is not based so heavily on materialism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aABmgeR4C1cC&dq=The+Gospel+of+the+Redman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's the Girl Worth?","description":"Written by Rachael Denhollander, recipient of Sports Illustrated s Inspiration of the Year Award and one of Time s 100 Most Influential People (2018).  Who is going to tell these little girls that what was done to them matters? That they are seen and valued, that they are not alone and they are not unprotected?  Rachael Denhollander s voice was heard around the world when she spoke out to end the most shocking USA gymnastics scandal in history. The first victim to publicly accuse Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who sexually abused hundreds of young athletes, Rachael now reveals her full story for the first time. How did Nassar get away with it for so long? How did Rachael and the other survivors finally stop him and bring him to justice? And how can we protect the vulnerable in our own families, churches, and communities? What Is a Girl Worth? is the inspiring true story of Rachael s journey from an idealistic young gymnast to a strong and determined woman who found the courage to raise her voice against evil, even when she thought the world might not listen.

But now, apart from such absurd freaks of scholarship, we are confronted in a new way with the question whether we can know enough about Jesus to enable us to build a Christology upon Him. It is by challenging us with that question--not by giving us an assured result--that Form Criticism has become a momentous factor in creating the situation which exists for Christological thought to-day. It will make a great difference to the problem of Christology whether we accept or reject the claims of this new historical radicalism.\\"--Chapter 1, page 27","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wFMcAAAAMAAJ&dq=God+Was+in+Christ:+An+Essay+on+Incarnation+and+Atonement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War In Heaven","description":"Could spiritual warfare be an essential part of God's plan for each of us?

The answers to the basic questions of evil are rooted in this battle, as is the significance of Jesus' stunning victory over Satan on the cross. This heavenly war is all-encompassing, and no part of life remains untouched by it.

His accessible, in-depth exploration will help you identify the devil's unchanging tactics, seize your biblical weapons and learn to wage war against the forces of evil around you.

THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a4BvJRcTR8gC&dq=Existence+and+being&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There was one Anna","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A7aoGQAACAAJ&dq=There+was+one+Anna&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There's a Map on My Lap!: All About Maps (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","description":"The Cat in the Hat introduces beginning readers to mapsthe different kinds (city, state, world, topographic, temperature, terrain, etc.); their formats (flat, globe, atlas, puzzle); the tools we use to read them (symbols, scales, grids, compasses); and funny facts about the places they show us ( Michigan looks like a scarf and a mitten!

Typically, we recommend that the student take this course during the same year that he or she is taking prealgebra. Exploring Creation With Physical Science provides a detailed introduction to the physical environment and some of the basic laws that make it work. The fairly broad scope of the book provides the student with a good understanding of the earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. It also covers details on weather, motion, Newton's Laws, gravity, the solar system, atomic structure, radiation, nuclear reactions, stars, and galaxies. The second edition of our physical science course has several features that enhance the value of the course: * There is more color in this edition as compared to the previous edition, and many of the drawings that are in the first edition have been replaced by higher-quality drawings. * There are more experiments in this edition than there were in the previous one. In addition, some of the experiments that were in the previous edition have been changed to make them even more interesting and easy to perform. * Advanced students who have the time and the ability for additional learning are directed to online resources that give them access to advanced subject matter. * To aid the student in reviewing the course as a whole, there is an appendix that contains questions which cover the entire course.

She says: \\"Coast Salish art is relatively unknown to most people today as it was an almost lost art form after European contact -- the reason being that Salish lands were the first to be settled by Europeans. Because of this, over the years, I have spent a great deal of my time trying to revive traditional Coast Salish art -- and also attempting to educate the public to the fact that there was, and still is, another art indigenous to the central Pacific Northwest Coast\\". Point's striking and distinctive art -- from jewelry in precious metals to prints, paintings, and monumental pieces in wood and glass -- has won worldwide acclaim and a worldwide audience. An innovator with a strong personal style, she likes to express ancestral concepts and designs in media such as glass and bronze as well as the more traditional wood. \\"In creating my art\\", she says, \\"I feel a need to continually express my cultural background and beliefs yet, at the same time, my work continues to evolve with changes both within and outside of my community\\". Michael Kew describes the traditional art, culture, and beliefs of the central Coast Salish, which of all the Northwest Coast cultures is among the least familiar to the general public. Because much of the art was closely associated with private religious expression, it was seldom displayed or sold to collectors. Peter Macnair contributes an engaging and enlightening biography that looks at the artistic evolution of Susan Point. Bill McLennan briefly examines thetradition of housepost carving among the Coast Salish and Susan Point's interpretations of these large woodcarvings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3jCDQgAACAAJ&dq=Susan+Point:+Coast+Salish+Artist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Venerable One","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_35WAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Venerable+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead Leaves: Two Years in the Rhodesian War","description":"It is January, 1978.

In her years as an acting coach, Patsy Rodenburg has discovered the secrets to that elusive quality actors call 'it'. There are three basic ways human energy moves between people and you can be in any one of the 'three circles' in any situation. In the first, your focus is purely inward, in the third, all your energy is moving outward. In the second you are focused, you give energy out and you receive it. You communicate spontaneously and listen well, you are generous and people are generous in return. And by working on your breath, posture, voice, language, listening skills, focus, courage and trust you can access the second circle on a daily basis.

Drawn there in search of literary ghosts, of the poet Umberto Saba and the novelists Italo Svevo and James Joyce, Joseph Cary found instead a city with an imaginative life of its own, the one that rises, tantalizing from the pages of this book. The story of Cary's travels, A Ghost in Trieste, is also a tale of discovery and transformation, as the bustling world of port and airplane, baggage and trams and trains becomes the landscape of history and literature, language and art, psychoanalysis and the self. Here is the crossroads of East and West. A port held in turn by the Romans, the Venetians, the Austrians, the Germans, the Slavs, and finally the Italians, Trieste is the capital of nowhere, fertile source of a unique literary florescence before the First World War. At times an exile home and an exiled city. \\"I cannot claim to have walked across it all,:\\" wrote Saba, the poet of Trieste in 1910 of the city Cary crosses and recrosses, seeking the poetry of the place that inspired its literary giants. Trieste's cultural and historical riches, its geographical splendor of hills and sea and mysterious presence unfold in a series of stories, monologues and literary juxtapositions that reveal the city's charms as well as its seductive hold on the writer's imagination. Throughout, literary and immediate impressions alike are elaborated in paintings and maps, and in handsome line drawings by Nicholas Read. This \\"clownish and adolescent Parsifal,\\" this Trieste of the \\"prickly grace,\\" this place \\"impaled in my heart like a permanent point,\\" this symbol of the Adriatic, this \\"city made of books\\"   here the book remakes the city. The Trieste of allusions magically becomes a city of palpable allure, of warmth and trying contradictions and gritty beauty. Part travel diary, part guide book, part literary history, A Ghost in Trieste is a brilliant introduction to an extraordinary time and place. In Joseph Cary, Trieste has found a new poet, and readers, a remarkably captivating companion and guide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rv9P21kW8ygC&dq=A+Ghost+in+Trieste&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soothe Your Nerves : The Black Woman's Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Anxiety, Panic, and Fear","description":"Do you or someone you love suffer from \\"bad nerves\\"? ?Denise is constantly on edge.

With the aging of the population and its adverse impact on public pension systems, the shift of individual savings to institutional investors is likely to become even more marked in the coming years. This book provides a comprehensive economic assessment of institutional investment. It charts the development and performance of the asset management industry and analyzes the implications of rising institutionalized saving for the development of the securities trading industry, the financial sector as a whole, and the wider economy.

For centuries, Arabic literature mandated traditional, unchanging, highly structured language and forms. In the 1960s and 1970s, writers rebelled to write in a variety of vernaculars. Now, young Egyptian poets are inventing new ways of writing. Rejecting both traditional Arabic formalism and the vernacular rebellion--and, contradictorily, drawing equally on these traditions and others--they radically combine and recombine influences and bring new experiences into their poetry. They embrace experimentation. Rejected at first by the literary establishment, these poets founded their own magazines, one of which appropriated a derisive term that had been used to dismiss them: Locusts. Now one of Egypt's most honored translators and writers has joined with one of those Locusts to gather a selection of this postmodern writing in one place for the first time. With its edginess and play of styles, this collection showcases a dynamic, emergent scene.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i2Q4EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chasing the Wind: The Autobiography of Steve Fossett","description":"The former business executive describes his life and exploits as he became the first solo balloonist to fly non-stop around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_2xFAAAAYAAJ&dq=Chasing+the+Wind:+The+Autobiography+of+Steve+Fossett&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blaze and the Forest Fire (Billy and Blaze Books)","description":"Billy and Blaze race a forest fire in this installment of the classic, beloved Billy and Blaze series, from renowned author C.W.

Gorman examines Christian documents in their Greco-Roman context, concluding that Christians held a consistent position throughout the church's first four hundred years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CG9KAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kentucky is Wider & Other Short Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5Xe86bLAo2EC&dq=Kentucky+is+Wider&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Living thoughts of the prophet Muhammad (Living thoughts library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1xziugAACAAJ&dq=The+Living+thoughts+of+the+prophet+Muhammad+(Living+thoughts+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Value Propositioning: Book One -- Perception and Misperception in Decision Making","description":"\\"Value Propositioning\\" addresses the ways in which business decisions are actually made.

While it may seem like a harmless issue, grinding and clenching can result in serious issues for not only your oral health but also your overall health and wellbeing. In some cases, you may notice that you grind and clench your teeth during the day, but in most people, clenching your teeth at night while sleeping is the only time it occurs, so it may be difficult to tell if you are suffering from bruxism. This book aims to give a holistic understanding of teeth grinding and answers questions like: Why do we grind our teeth? How do you prevent bruxism? And what are simple exercises you can do to help release tension? Together we will go through the masticatory anatomy. We will talk about the connection between tension in the jaw and tension in other areas of your body, and how this contributes to TMJ tension. You will learn exercises including techniques from the yoga tradition and personal development tools to manage your stress. You will also learn about the physiology of stress.

Written for a non-military audience, this book chronicles and analyzes the twenty year struggle to maintain South Vietnamese independence. Joes tells the story with a sympathetic focus on South Viet Nam and is highly critical of U.S. military strategy and tactics in fighting this war. He claims that the fall of South Viet Nam was not inevitable, that an abrupt and public termination of U.S. aid provoked a crisis of confidence inside South Viet Nam that led to debacle. Students and scholars of military studies, South East Asia, U.S. foreign policy, or the general reader interested in this fascinating period in 20th-century history, will find The War for South Viet Nam invaluable reading. The book begins with an historical background to U.S. involvement in Viet Nam. Written with a keen understanding of political, historical, and military factors, The War for South Viet Nam supplies an assemblage of information that was, until now, widely scattered. Joes closely examines the geographical determinants of the war and discusses mistakes in U.S. strategy, including the Americanization of the war, overly destructive methods of combat, and the failure to resolve the problem of invasion through the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Joes maintains that future stragtegy must contain more sophisticated, less destructive anti-guerrilla tactics. The complicated factors involved in the Viet Nam War are here offered in a consolidated, objective form enabling the reader to consider the implications of U.S. experiences in South Viet Nam for future policy in other world areas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S5rtAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+War+for+South+Viet+Nam,+1954-1975:+Revised+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colonial Days: Discover the Past with Fun Projects, Games, Activities, and Recipes","description":"Over 40 fun, hands-on projects and activities from the days ofcolonial America Spend a year with the Mayhews, a family living in the Massachusettscolony of 1732.

The instructions were simple, but the results were extraordinary. \\"You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative.\\" It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously. The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them \\"graphic haiku,\\" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional. As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties -- our common humanity. Every day dozens of postcards still make their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every aspect of human experience. This extraordinary collection brings together the most powerful, personal, and beautifully intimate secrets Frank Warren has received -- and brilliantly illuminates that human emotions can be unique and universal at the same time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mft-Ms1C1zsC&dq=Secrets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FROM FAITH TO FAITH","description":"Now you can have a word of encouragement...a word of inspiration... a word of faith every day of the year!

To those who think they have heard all there is to hear about Marilyn Monroe, think again. Leaming's book tells a brand-new tale of sexual, psychological, and political intrigue of the highest order. Told for the first time in all its complexity, this is a compelling portrait of a woman at the center of a drama with immensely high stakes, a drama in which the other players are some of the most fascinating characters from the world's of movies, theater, and politics. It is a book that shines a bright light on one of the most tumultuous, frightening, and exciting periods in American culture. Basing her research on new interviews and on thousands of primary documents, including revealing letters by Arthur Miller, Elia Kazan, John Huston, Laurence Olivier, Tennessee Williams, Darryl Zanuck, Marilyn's psychiatrist Dr. Ralph Greenson, and many others, Leaming has reconstructed the tangles of betrayal in Marilyn's life. For the first time, a master storyteller has put together all of the pieces and told Marilyn's story with the intensity and drama it so richly deserves. At the heart of this book is a sexual triangle and a riveting story of betrayal that has never been told before. You will come away filled with new respect for Marilyn's incredible courage, dignity, and loyalty, and an overwhelming sense of tragedy after witnessing Marilyn, powerless to overcome her demons, move inexorably to her own final, terrible betrayal of herself. Marilyn Monroe is a book that will make you think--and will break your heart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cTVYdmsGxCIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BATTLEFIELDS AND PLAYGROUNDS (HB)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yd4uAQAAIAAJ&dq=BATTLEFIELDS+AND+PLAYGROUNDS+(HB)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","description":"This books is about Jesus, His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FJ3ADQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betrayals","description":"International Bestseller!

A dramatist, Ardrey's interest in the African discoveries sprang less from purely scientific grounds than from the radical new light they cast on the eternal question: Why do we behave as we do? Are we naturally inclined towards war and weapons? From 1955 to 1961, Ardrey commuted between the museums and libraries and laboratories of the North, and the games reserves and fossil beds of Africa trying to answer that question. Eventually, his investigation expanded to include nationalism and patriotism, private property and social order, hierarchy and status-seeking, even conscience. All revealed roots in our most ancient animal beginnings and parallels in primate societies. African Genesis is at once the story of an unprecedented personal search and a story of man that had never before been told. It is a shocking book in that it challenges assumptions of human uniqueness that color every segment of modern thought and every aspect of our daily life. While evolutionary science has advanced markedly since Ardrey's times, his insights on human behavior have a timeless quality and African Genesis remains a classic reference for anyone exploring life's biggest questions. Praise for the 1961 edition: \\"It is fate and fortune of some books to mark or make a turning point in science and culture. This I believe African Genesis will do.\\" Dr Harlow Shapley, Harvard University \\"The most enjoyable and stimulating book on the evolution of man that has been published for some time.\\" The Nation \\"What this sensational book presents is a new and radical interpretation of human behavior. Since Ardrey has written it with excitement, clarity and style, the book will undoubtedly be widely read and cause widespread controversy. But African Genesis also deserves the most serious attention on the part of scientists as well as laymen.\\" Dr Kenneth Oakley, Leading British Anthropologist, Senior Principal Scientific Officer, British Museum \\"Mr Ardrey's African Genesis is a fascinating drama played on a very broad and deep stage of space, time, biological evolution and ideas. The theme develops around man's striving to collect evidence and to understand the relational orders and timed sequences of living organisms. The search is for rational light on the true place of man himself in these biotic orders, and in the vast sweeps of the controlling environments. In this high drama the characters enter, leave relics and artifacts, act their roles as species, express their views and then exit. Among the characters are men of prehistory, nonhuman primates and the searching scientists themselves. The latter quarrel and dispute, cooperate and agree, strive for status and retreat from controversy. They are 'humans' as portrayed skillfully by Ardrey. Nevertheless, they contribute to the slowly advancing understanding of man in his living world or to what Ardrey describes as a revolution of biological conceptions.\\" C. R. Carpenter, Penn State University \\"This quarrel about the innate nature of man began outside the gates of Eden, was continued by Darwin and Wallace and now looms menacingly across the threshold of the United Nations. Mr Ardrey has peered into our inner human darkness with wisdom gained from discoveries of natural history.\\" Loren Eiseley, Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science, University of Pennsylvania","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YJ_ooQEACAAJ&dq=African+Genesis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy Money: The High-Rolling, Superflying, Drug-Powered World of the Spanish and Black \\"Mafias\\"","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UCyNwQEACAAJ&dq=Easy+Money:+The+High-Rolling,+Superflying,+Drug-Powered+World+of+the+Spanish+and+Black+%22Mafias%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yondering - The Louis L'amour Collection","description":" Over the years I have been proud to write about the men and women of the American frontier.

Although only twenty-eight years old, Alex was already one of the leading figures of British mountaineering's most successful era. His ascents included hard new routes on Himalayan giants like Dhaulagiri and Changabang and a glittering record of firsts in the Alps and Andes. Yet how Alex climbed was as important as what he climbed. He was a mountaineering prophet, sharing with a handful of contemporaries - including his climbing partner Voytek Kurtyka - the vision of a purer form of alpinism on the world's highest peaks. One Day As A Tiger, John Porter's revelatory and poignant memoir of his friend Alex MacIntyre, shows mountaineering at its extraordinary best and tragic worst - and draws an unforgettable picture of a dazzling, argumentative and exuberant legend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TS5hBAAAQBAJ&dq=One+day+as+a+tiger&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Book of Bible Crafts (Big Books)","description":"No matter which children's curriculum you use or what type of children's ministry program you have, Big Books will provide hours of creative Bible learning and fun!

James Oakes, New York Review of Books  Superb...A remarkable achievement, by far the best general account of the war now available. It is critical, insightful, and rooted in a wealth of archival sources; it brings far more of the Mexican experience than any other work...and it clearly demonstrates the social and cultural dynamics that shaped Mexican and American politics and military force.   Journal of American History It has long been held that the United States emerged victorious from the MexicanAmerican War because its democratic system was more stable and its citizens more loyal. But this award-winning history shows that Americans dramatically underestimated the strength of Mexican patriotism and failed to see how bitterly Mexicans resented their claims to national and racial superiority. Their fierce resistance surprised US leaders, who had expected a quick victory with few casualties. By focusing on how ordinary soldiers and civilians in both countries understood and experienced the conflict, The Dead March offers a clearer picture of the brief, bloody war that redrew the map of North America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jsIyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saddam's Iraq: Face-Off in the Gulf","description":"A complete briefing on the Iraq crisis and Saddam Hussein!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=96DtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Saddam%27s+Iraq:+Face-Off+in+the+Gulf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Models Secret (Multilingual Edition)","description":"Text analytics (TA) covers a very wide research area.

There is compelling evidence that contemporary merchants, who were widely and openly despised as immoral by the samurai, in fact acted in highly ethical ways in accordance with a well-articulated moral code. Japanese society was strictly stratified into four distinct and formally recognized classes: warrior, farmer, craftsman and merchant. From the warriors  perspective, the merchants, at the base of the social order, had no virtue, and existed only to skim profits as middlemen between producers and consumers. But were these accusations correct? Were the merchants really unethical beings who engaged in unfair business practices? There is ample evidence that negates the ubiquitous slanders of the warrior class and suggests that merchants  no less than the warriors  possessed and acted in accordance with a well-developed ethical code, a spirit that may be called shonindo or  The Way of the Merchant.  This book examines whether a comparison of shonindo, depicting the ethical point of view of the merchant class, and Bushido, embodying that of the warrior class, reveals that shonindo may have in fact surpassed Bushido in some aspects. Comparing contemporarily published historical documents concerning both shonindo and Bushido, as well as Inazo Nitobe s classic work Bushido: The Soul of Japan, published in 1900, the author examines how Bushido surpassed shonindo in that warriors were willing to die for their strict ethical code. Shonindo, however, may have surpassed Bushido in that merchants were liberal, willing to expand and extend application of their ethical beliefs into all aspects of everyday life for the overall benefit of society. This ethical code is compared with that of the conservative Bushido, which demonstrably proved not up to the task for the modernization and improved well-being of Japan. Ichiro Horide is professor emeritus of Reitaku University. Edward Yagi (Reitaku University) and Stanley J.

(alternative dispute resolution): An article from: Defense Counsel Journal","description":"Inter- and intra-clan conflicts in Northern Israel pit hundreds against each other in revenge cycles that take years to resolve and impact the entire community. The Sulha is a Shari a-based traditional conflict resolution process that works independently of formal legal systems and is widely practiced to manage such conflicts in the north of Israel, as well as throughout the Muslim and Arab worlds. The Sulha process works by effecting a gradual attitudinal transformation, from a desire for revenge to a willingness to forgive, through restoration of the victim s clan sense of honour. Muslim/Arab Mediation and Conflict Resolution examines the process of Sulha, as practiced by the Arab population of northern Israel, where it plays a central role in the maintenance of peace among Muslims, Christians, and Druze alike. It presents detailed analysis of every stage of this at times protracted process. It uses interviews with victims, perpetrators, Sulha practitioners, community leaders and lawyers, along with statistical analysis to examine how Sulha affects people s lives, how various sectors of society impact the practice, and how it coexists with Israel s formal legal system. Furthermore, it examines how Sulha compares to Western dispute resolution processes. This book offers the first comprehensive exploration of the entire Sulha process, and is a valuable resource for students and scholars of Middle East studies, Islamic studies and conflict resolution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R1mFCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","description":"A Newbery Medal Winner Professor William Waterman Sherman intends to fly across the Pacific Ocean.

Critics rightly applaud Rossettis metrical craftsmanship and song-like lyrical phrasings, but over-attention to formal felicities can impede proper interpretation of content. Through detailed readings of selected poems, this book demonstrates that Rossettis rigorously controlled use of language and innovative symbolism combine to create radical, hidden inter-textual levels of meaning beyond those attainable via biographical decoding, making her a singular bridge between Romanticism and Modernism. From earliest secular interactions with Romantic and Tractarian thought, through Goblin Market (1862) and The Princes Progress (1866), Rossettis verse resists straightforward interpretation by subtly interrogating and subverting the patriarchal traditions of writing that it simultaneously extends: love lyric, fairy tale, quest myth, and sonnet. Persuasively constructing a case for the inability of male-ordained poetics to cope with the expression of active female identity, Monna Innominata (1881) deconstructs lyric tradition, casting together medieval, renaissance, Romantic and Victorian ideologies. This groundbreaking sonnet cycle disturbs poetic conventions and forms the most concentrated, sustained demonstration of the struggle to articulate the female self to be found in Rossettis oeuvre, perhaps in literary history. The painful sense of irresolution and despair pervading Monna Innominata sheds important light upon Christina Rossettis exclusive production of devotional literature during her final years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z4FlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Asset Allocation Strategies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W3U4UTOfFs0C&dq=Simple+Asset+Allocation+Strategies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects, Ground Attack & Special Purpose Aircraft","description":"Presents technical descriptions and histories of aircraft types used for gound attacks and special purposes by the Luftwaffe during World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SY9WAAAACAAJ&dq=Luftwaffe+Secret+Projects,+Ground+Attack&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gourmet's Casual Entertaining: Easy Year-round Menus for Family and Friends","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Long Range Plan","description":"Provides a sample plan, guidelines, checklist and a Microsoft Word diskette containing worksheets for long-range preservation planning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0ewSAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Long+Range+Plan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Jeopardy","description":"Stone Barrington faces down danger on all sides in the latest thriller from perennial fan favorite Stuart Woods.

Thirteen year-old Johnny Merrimon had the perfect life: a warm home and loving parents; a twin sister, Alyssa, with whom he shared an irreplaceable bond. He knew nothing of loss, until the day Alyssa vanished from the side of a lonely street. Now, a year later, Johnny finds himself isolated and alone, failed by the people he'd been taught since birth to trust. No one else believes that Alyssa is still alive, but Johnny is certain that she is---confident in a way that he can never fully explain. Determined to find his sister, Johnny risks everything to explore the dark side of his hometown. It is a desperate, terrifying search, but Johnny is not as alone as he might think. Detective Clyde Hunt has never stopped looking for Alyssa either, and he has a soft spot for Johnny. He watches over the boy and tries to keep him safe, but when Johnny uncovers a dangerous lead and vows to follow it, Hunt has no choice but to intervene. Then a second child goes missing . . . Undeterred by Hunt's threats or his mother's pleas, Johnny enlists the help of his last friend, and together they plunge into the wild, to a forgotten place with a history of violence that goes back more than a hundred years. There, they meet a giant of a man, an escaped convict on his own tragic quest. What they learn from him will shatter every notion Johnny had about the fate of his sister; it will lead them to another far place, to a truth that will test both boys to the limit. Traveling the wilderness between innocence and hard wisdom, between hopelessness and faith, The Last Child leaves all categories behind and establishes John Hart as a writer of unique power.

In the past, humankind's choices of beliefs and religions have supported only the emotional body and the darker, material side of life. And truly, if humankind is going to remain on Earth, very drastic shifts of consciousness will be required in Earth's new four-dimensional reality. No matter how contrary to your current beliefs, this book contains methods for creating your spiritual lightbody for ascension, and it also explains your eternal journey in a way that was never before available to humankind.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fhk9eicTl1wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackout","description":"One hot summer night in the city, all the power goes out. The TV shuts off and a boy wails, \\"Mommm!\\" His sister can no longer use the phone, Mom can't work on her computer, and Dad can't finish cooking dinner. What's a family to do? When they go up to the roof to escape the heat, they find the lights--in stars that can be seen for a change--and so many neighbors it's like a block party in the sky! On the street below, people are having just as much fun--talking, rollerblading, and eating ice cream before it melts. The boy and his family enjoy being not so busy for once. They even have time to play a board game together. When the electricity is restored, everything can go back to normal . . . but not everyone likes normal. The boy switches off the lights, and out comes the board game again. Using a combination of panels and full bleed illustrations that move from color to black-and-white and back to color, John Rocco shows that if we are willing to put our cares aside for a while, there is party potential in a summer blackout.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=USaqvAEACAAJ&dq=Blackout&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of Terror","description":"This spine-tingling novel has more than enough fear factor for the most ardent fan of scary stories.

This formula will teach you to identify and neutralize harmful antiwhite ideas in yourself and your environment. Following this formula will enable you to access your true physical, mental, and spiritual potential as a Westman--the innate potential of our people, stifled in an age of antiwhiteism. Simply \\"waking up\\" (or getting so-called \\"red pilled\\") to various falsehoods in the dogma of modernity is not enough. These moments of realization are essential to the healing process, but they are largely superficial. You remain infected with subconsciously-driven meme-pathogens (MPs) that undermine your well-being and potential. With effort, you can Go Free of MPs. You can be better than you are. You can have purpose, safety, and happiness. You can access the Western Spirit within you, a power that has revolutionized the world with scientific discovery, conquered disease, charted the unknown, and triumphed in battle. Since its public debut, Go Free (along with K?hne's live Internet broadcast \\"Going Free\\") has rescued white men and women from many self-destructive behaviors, including drug and alcohol abuse, and even suicide. Others are climbing higher than they ever imagined, and some couples have given birth, secure in the knowledge that Go Free will inoculate their children against destructive antiwhite infections, such as white-guilt.

The Wall Street Journal At the dawn of the Cold War, the world s most important intelligence agencies the Soviet KGB, the American CIA, and the British MI6 appeared to have clear-cut roles and a sense of rising importance in their respective countries. But when Kim Philby, head of MI6 s Russian division and arguably the twenty-first century s greatest spy, was revealed to be a Russian mole along with British government heavyweights Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, everything in the Western intelligence world turned upside down. Here is the true story of how the American James Bond the colorful, foulmouthed, pistol-packing, alcoholic ex-FBI agent William  King  Harvey put the finger on Philby; how James Jesus Angleton, the chain-smoking poet of Yale University and the CIA s supposed  master spy  in charge of counterintelligence, began his descent into a paranoid wilderness of mirrors upon learning of family friend Kim Philby s ultimate betrayal; and the devastating consequences of the loss of MI6 prestige and the CIA s subsequent self-defeating witch hunts. Every revelation, every stranger-than-fiction twist and turn is all the more intriguing as truths become lies and unlikely scenarios are revealed as reality.

Adam was almost thrown out of the rowboat. He clung to the seat as it swung around. He saw blue skies and the glittering city. The boat swung back again, and he saw black clouds, and the Arizona, his father's ship, sinking beneath the water. -- from A Boy at War \\"He kept looking up, afraid the planes would come back. The sky was obscured by black smoke....It was all unreal: the battleships half sunk, the bullet holes in the boat, Davi and Martin in the water.\\" December 7, 1941: On a quiet Sunday morning, while Adam and his friends are fishing near Honolulu, a surprise attack by Japanese bombers destroys the fleet at Pearl Harbor. Even as Adam struggles to survive the sudden chaos all around him, and as his friends endure the brunt of the attack, a greater concern hangs over his head: Adam's father, a navy lieutenant, was stationed on the USS Arizona when the bombs fell. During the subsequent days Adam -- not yet a man, but no longer a boy -- is caught up in the war as he desperately tries to make sense of what happened to his friends and to find news of his father.

Eduardo Galeano s Memory of Fire Trilogy defies categorization or perhaps creates its own. It is a passionate, razor-sharp, lyrical history of North and South America, from the birth of the continent s indigenous peoples through the end of the twentieth century. The three volumes form a haunting and dizzying whole that resurrects the lives of Indians, conquistadors, slaves, revolutionaries, poets, and more. The first book, Genesis, pays homage to the many origin stories of the tribes of the Americas, and paints a verdant portrait of life in the New World through the age of the conquistadors. The second book, Faces and Masks, spans the two centuries between the years 1700 and 1900, in which colonial powers plundered their newfound territories, ultimately giving way to a rising tide of dictators. And in the final installment, Century of the Wind, Galeano brings his story into the twentieth century, in which a fractured continent enters the modern age as popular revolts blaze from North to South. This celebrated series is a landmark of contemporary Latin American writing, and a brilliant document of culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k1lQAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oort's Cloud","description":"It was once thought that our solar system ended at Saturn.

Sokal immediately confessed that the whole article was a hoax - a cunningly worded paper designed to expose and parody the style of extreme postmodernist criticism of science. The story became front-page news around the world and triggered fierce and wide-ranging controversy. Sokal is one of the most powerful voices in the continuing debate about the status of evidence-based knowledge.

'Whether my targets are the postmodernists of the left, the fundamentalists of the right, or the muddle-headed of all political and apolitical stripes, the bottom line is that clear thinking, combined with a respect for evidence, are of the utmost importance to the survival of the human race in the twenty-first century.'

Marco Polo, Ferdinand Magellan, David Livingstone, Amelia Earhart, Neil Armstrong: these are some of the greatest travelers of all time. This book chronicles their stories and many more, describing epic voyages of discovery and exploration, from the extraordinary migrations out of Africa by our earliest ancestors to the latest voyages into space. In antiquity, we follow Alexander the Great to the Indus and Hannibal across the Alps; in medieval times we trek beside Genghis Khan and Ibn Battuta. The Renaissance brought Columbus to the Americas and the circumnavigation of the world. The following centuries saw gaps in the global maps filled by Tasman, Bering, and Cook, and journeys made for scientific purposes, most famously by von Humboldt and Darwin. In modern times, the last inhospitable ends of the earth were reached including both poles and the world's highest mountain and new elements were conquered. Here are human stories of great triumph and success, but also of terrible hardships, tragedy, and astonishing courage in adversity. An incredible team of contributors from distinguished historians and writers to travelers and explorers bring firsthand experience to the journeys and places they describe. The contributors include Robert Ballard, Barry Cunliffe, Ranulph Fiennes, Pen Hadow, John Hemming, Robin Knox-Johnston, Christopher Ondaatje, and Simon Winchester.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2wEqEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nostradamus Ate My Hamster","description":"Robert wants to be a star in the movies.

Buchanan drew upon his own observations and conversations with hereditary chiefs, Buddhist priests, scribes, and others in an attempt to provide a comprehensive account of the country as he found it before the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16. Buchanan also drew from an earlier work by Colonel William Fitzpatrick, An Account of the Kingdom of Nepaul, published in London in 1811. In addition to maps and engravings, Buchanan's book includes two noteworthy scientific supplements: a register of the weather from February 1802 to March 1803 and an attempt by Buchanan's colleague, Colonel Crawford, to calculate the height of several Himalayan peaks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7bYRAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Night Little Leprechaun","description":"A day in the life of Liam, the littlest leprechaun, who is pursued by 2 humans before he rushes home to bed to tell his story.

This failure can compromise the effectiveness of health care and thereby adversely affect the health of cancer patients. Psychological and social problems created or exacerbated by cancer--including depression and other emotional problems; lack of information or skills needed to manage the illness; lack of transportation or other resources; and disruptions in work, school, and family life--cause additional suffering, weaken adherence to prescribed treatments, and threaten patients' return to health. Today, it is not possible to deliver high-quality cancer care without using existing approaches, tools, and resources to address patients' psychosocial health needs. All patients with cancer and their families should expect and receive cancer care that ensures the provision of appropriate psychosocial health services. Cancer Care for the Whole Patient recommends actions that oncology providers, health policy makers, educators, health insurers, health planners, researchers and research sponsors, and consumer advocates should undertake to ensure that this standard is met.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ugafAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set","description":"This beautiful gift edition of The Hobbit, J.R.R.

Like John Donne and Elizabeth Bishop, Gentry finds beauty, grandeur, and the suggestion of immortality in the smallest, most evanescent of details. A mother's clothes. Scents. Textures. The play of moonlight on rock. The chirp of crickets. A faded tintype of a great-grandfather's dog. The wedding of a drum majorette. A glimpse caught through an open door of a naked woman ironing. A scarecrow. The smell of Bible leather. Laundry drying on a clothesline. Stark, lovely, elegiac, gently surreal, Gentry's poems resonate and echo in the vast spaces of the heart.

It s clear that China is the world s next economic superpower. But what isn t so clear is how China will get there by the middle of this century. It now faces tremendous challenges such as fostering innovation, dealing with ageing problem and coping with a less accommodative global environment. In this book, economists from China s leading university and America s best-known think tank offer in depth analyses of these challenges. Does China have enough talent and right policy and institutional mix to transit from input-driven to innovation-driven economy? What does ageing mean, in terms of labor supply, consumption demand and social welfare expenditure? Can China contain the environmental and climate change risks? How should the financial system be transformed in order to continuously support economic growth and keep financial risks under control? What fiscal reforms are required in order to balance between economic efficiency and social harmony? What roles should the state-owned enterprises play in the future Chinese economy? In addition, how will technological competition between the United States and China affect each country s development? Will the Chinese yuan emerge as a major reserve currency, and would this destabilize the international financial system? What will be China s role in the international economic institutions? And will the United States and other established powers accept a growing role for China and the rest of the developing world in the governance of global institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, or will the world devolve into competing blocs? This book provides unique insights into independent analyses and policy recommendations by a group of top Chinese and American scholars. Whether China succeeds or fails in economic reform will have a large impact, not just on China s development, but also on stability and prosperity for the whole world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3XC1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tank Commander","description":"Bill Bellamy was a young officer in the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars from 1943 to 1955.

It s a title that was hard earned: Kate may have saved her people, but many were lost in the conflict, immortalized in the tattoos of fire that grace her arms. And it s a title that Kate never wanted. The rebellion may have made a home for themselves in a country that wants to cast them out, but the peace will never be safe while Edwin, the illegitimate king of Rime, sits upon its throne. And for that, the Wilder Queen must keep hers. Now war is brewing once again.

They dared to risk it all in a skiff of reeds or leather, on a ship of wood or steel, knowing the only thing between them and certain death was their ship. To explore, to seek out what lay beyond the close and comfortable, every explorer had to embrace danger. And as they did so, what arose was a mystical bond, a passion for the ships that carried them. From the very first time humans dared to warp the fabric of space, escaping from the ashes of the third World War, they also created ships. These vessels have become the icons of mankind's desire to rise above the everyday, to seek out and make the unknown known. And these ships that travel the stellar seas have stirred the same passions as the ones that floated in the oceans. While every captain has wished that their starship could be outfitted in the same manner as the sailing ship H.M.S. Beagle without weapons that proved untenable. From the start, Starfleet realized that each vessel, due to the limited range of the early warp engines, must be able to stand alone against any attack. Thus arose the idea, taken from the days of wooden sailing ships, that every Starfleet vessel must stand as a ship of the line. Through the actions of their captains and crews, countless starships have taken on that role. Here we remember some of those ships and their heroic crews. In celebration of one of science fiction's most beloved franchises, this updated edition of the acclaimed Ships of the Line hardcover collection now includes dozens of additional images brought together for the first time in book format spectacular renderings featured in the highly successful Star Trek: Ships of the Line calendar series. With text by Star Trek's own Michael Okuda, the story of each of these valiant starships now comes to life. ?, ?, & ? 2014 CBS Studios, Inc.

Fearless in the air, he won fame in Malta for his invaluable photo reconnaissance work at Taranto, Sicily and North Africa, So invaluable that he was ordered NOT to make detours to shoot down enemy planes, yet he shot down nine! A below-average misfit with 22 Squadron of Coastal Command Warby was sent to Malta to avoid trouble in the UK, and guided by an understanding Australian, quickly became famous. Known at first as a loner, he was given his head by AOC Air Vice Marshal Hugh Pughe Lloyd and the spectacular results he achieved enabled his unconventional behaviour to be over-looked. With his glamorous girl-friend Christina, the two became part of Malta's legend, symbols of the island's resistance. Still in Malta, Warby later became CO of first 69 Squadron and then 683 PR Squadron. After contributing greatly to the success of the Sicily landings, for which he was personally thanked by General Alexander, he commanded 336 PR Wing in North Africa. By then he was working closely with the Americans with whom he got on so well, as he did with the Canadians and South Africans. After a serious car accident, which caused him to be grounded, he returned to the UK and, thanks to his friendship with Elliott Roosevelt, the President's son, took up a liason job with the US PR Group at Mount Farm. On April 12, 1944 Warburton departed in an American aircraft on an unusual mission over Europe. Both plane and pilot disappeared without trace, giving rise to a host of rumours that his disappearance was intentional. Only now almost 60 years later, can the mystery be solved with the discovery of both aircraft and human remains near Munich in Germany. Based on interviews with nearly 150 of Warby's colleagues, and fully updated with recently unearthed information, Warburtons War paints a picture of a fascinating man, who over 350 operational missions from Malta alone became a living legend in that much bombed and beleaguered island.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v375AQAACAAJ&dq=Warburton%27s+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Number Theory for Computing","description":"Taking readers from elementary number theory, via algorithmic, to applied number theory in computer science, this text introduces basic concepts, results, and methods, before going on to discuss their applications in the design of hardware and software, cryptography, and security.

The author rectifies that with this comprehensive history of these fighters. With this book he describes in great detail the three main variants of the Lavochkin fighter series during the Second World War: the only partially successful LaGG-3 inline-engined fighter, the successful radial-engined La-5 fighter, and the superb radial engined La-7 fighter, one of the best piston-engined fighter aircraft of the entire Second World War. Both the design and history of these fighters are featured, including how the mediocre inline engined LaGG-3 was turned into a top notch fighter by the replacement of the Klimov inline engine by the Shvetsov M-82 radial engine. Besides describing the wartime designs he includes a section on the postwar successors to the Second World War fighters, the completely new all metal La-9 and La-11, which saw extensive postwar service. Accurate color profiles illustrate all variants.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8LVUDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Eman Poet Lib #17 (Everyman Poetry)","description":"One of Americas best loved poets, Longfellow drew on his own experience of domestic tragedy to produce some of the most moving and honest poems ever written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WHZ6PwAACAAJ&dq=Henry+Wadsworth+Longfellow+Eman+Poet+Lib&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eK48AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rodeo Man : Colorado Leather Meets Alabama Lace","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JoSRPQAACAAJ&dq=Rodeo+Man+:+Colorado+Leather+Meets+Alabama+Lace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Journey","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C_5pewAACAAJ&dq=Dangerous+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Generation of Vipers (Cardinal Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tphnAQAACAAJ&dq=Generation+of+Vipers+(Cardinal+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don Camillo and His Flock","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6XYnAEACAAJ&dq=Don+Camillo+and+His+Flock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A diary from Dixie,","description":"The original diary of Mary Chesnut, an important work that was repeatedly quoted during the famous television documentary The Civil War, provides an insightful look into how the war affected the daily lives of the people of the South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dGgbAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+diary+from+Dixie,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical mysticism;: A little book for normal people,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5x4NAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wall","description":" I can allow myself to write the truth; all the people for whom I have lied throughout my life are dead   writes the heroine of Marlen Haushofer s The Wall, a quite ordinary, unnamed middle-aged woman who awakens to find she is the last living human being.

Born in 1880, Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall was a young unwanted child when her parents put an end to their tempestuous marriage by filing for divorce. She had already made tentative forays into lesbian love when her father died, leaving her an heiress at eighteen. Her income assured, Hall moved out of her mother s house, renamed herself John in honor of her great-great-grandfather, and divided her time among hunting, traveling, and pursuing women. She began to write songs, poetry, prose, and short stories and achieved success as a novelist, but it was with the publication of The Well of Loneliness in 1928 that Radclyffe Hall became an internationally known figure. Dubbed the  bible of lesbianism,  the book caused a scandal on both sides of the Atlantic. Though moralistic in tone, because of its subject matter it was tried as obscene in America and in the United Kingdom, where it was censored under the Obscene Publications Act. The Trials of Radclyffe Hall is a fascinating, no-holds-barred account of the life of this controversial woman, including her torrid relationship with the married artist Una Troubridge, who was Hall s devoted partner for twenty-eight years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cVEuBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portraits of the Civil War","description":"Portraits of the Civil War in photographs, diaries, and letters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KzatAAAACAAJ&dq=Portraits+of+the+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Resources and Personnel Management","description":"This new and thoroughly revised edition of the best selling Personnel Management text by Stephen Bach provides an authoritative analysis of the latest developments in the field for students and professionals. new chapters reflect the importance of the EU dimension; the new diversity/race agenda led by Brussels; the extended, network organization; new training practices; and the growing importance of MNCs, both for the UK economy as a whole and as a guide to best practice; clearly and comprehensively explains the current complex HR scene with its different levels and layers","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WruDYHuqoTYC&dq=Human+Resources+and+Personnel+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hermetic Tarot","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OfgQAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hermetic+Tarot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cornelli","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=71APAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Lives","description":"Is there proof that \\"near death\\" and other spiritual experiences can cure afflictions of the body, mind, and spirit?

It's Christmas Eve Eve Eve Eve Eve in Manhattan--five days from the holiday Ground Zero--but Tad Leary, the most confused man on earth, doesn't know whether to celebrate or go crazy. He's just been fired, he's about to be evicted from his sublet, he's getting nowhere on his overdue folklore thesis, \\"Social Hierarchies of Imaginary Places,\\" and on top of everything else--or rather underneath everything else--at age thirty-four (older than Christ), he's five-foot-one and still baby-faced, so he's treated like a child wherever he goes. Nonetheless, he's been invited to seven (a magic number one of his rivals is writing a thesis about) different Christmas parties that day, and he decides to explore every one of them for possible work, apartments, love, and just plain distraction. Tad's a walking punch bowl of joy and fear, goodwill and alienation, running a constant mental argument with himself throughout his long marathon. By midnight, he will have visited all parts of his past--from brunch with his rumpled Boston Irish parents and arguably more successful brothers, to dinner with his beautiful Swedish ex-girlfriend, to a fancy, colossal uptown bash where, by now dangerously looped, he bumps into an ex-boyfriend (more confusion!) looking as \\"glorious and golden as a roast turkey.\\" A farcical, over-the-top feast of twisted one-liners and outrageous imagery, Let Nothing You Dismay depicts Tad's--and everyone's--struggle for survival, with a bracing combination of Darwinian theory and hallucinatory fairy-tale wonder. It's a Chekhov story told with P. G. Wodehouse flippancy, or a tale of Celtic mysticism as S. J. Perelman might have rendered it. Above all, the bright spots in this darkest night of the soul prove that comical epiphany isn't just for Christmas anymore.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hD0NDqG6moAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Child at Play: Birth to One Year","description":"This easy-to-read, delightfully illustrated book is organized in a month-by-month format.

Explores the seven \\"root races\\" representing the genetic gene pool of the human family and the phenomenon of soaring intelligence ? Explains the grand sweep of human evolution and the worldwide ascension of energy now occurring, which will take humanity to the next level of development According to prophecy, the fifth sun or fifth world of the Mayan calendar moves into a higher octave of vibration, or ascension, on December 21, 2012. This date represents a \\"gateway\\" of planetary development that will open humanity to new ways of living and new worlds of opportunity. Ancient traditions have foretold that our successful passage through this gateway depends on the \\"fifth root race\\"--new stock in the human gene pool--destined to help us through the exciting and massive changes ahead. In Beyond the Indigo Children P. M. H. Atwater illuminates the characteristics of the fifth root race, the capstone being the extraordinary \\"new children,\\" those brilliant and irreverent kids born since 1982. She explores the relationship of the new children to the prophecies in the Mayan calendar and other traditions, providing extensive background information about the seven root races (the sixth and seventh of which haven t yet appeared) and the great shifting of consciousness already underway. She reveals the connection of the seven root races to the seven chakras, and how the fifth chakra--the chakra of willpower--will be opened for humankind as the new children grow to maturity. She also discusses the phenomenon of soaring intelligence and undeveloped potential and provides concrete guidance and tools for those who seek to understand and help the new children achieve their full potential. Beyond the Indigo Children is the first major study of today's children, and their place in our rapidly changing world, that combines objective research with mystical revelation and prophecy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uuBcvwEACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Indigo+Children:+The+New+Children+and+the+Coming+of+the+Fifth+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time To Get Serious: Daily Devotions to Keep You Close to God","description":"Readers who are ready to get serious about their pursuit of God by getting deep into his Word will appreciate the lively daily devotionals in this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NFgTmQEACAAJ&dq=Time+To+Get+Serious:+Daily+Devotions+to+Keep+You+Close+to+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bookbinding,: And the care of books; a text-book for bookbinders and librarians (The Artistic Crafts Series of Technical Handbooks)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lec6AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The right to ignore the state (Freedom pamphlet)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GFFCAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decision At Doona","description":"Unaware that Doona is inhabited, the Terran government sends colonists, but when the catlike Hrrubans are discovered, the visitors from Earth must learn to get along with an alien race","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Aznt7icdjC0C&dq=Decision+At+Doona&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guyver Reborn (Battle Booster Armor Guyver)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NXDxHIpAKm0C&dq=Guyver+Reborn+(Battle+Booster+Armor+Guyver)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Write a Book in Forty Days and Get It Published!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UIUGAAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Write+a+Book+in+Forty+Days+and+Get+It+Published!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Modern Gang Reader","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u4LaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Modern+Gang+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of Daniel the Prophet","description":"The Book of Daniel is a prophecy given by God to Daniel 600 years before Christ that reaches clear down to the end of earth's history.

It is sent forth with an earnest prayer, that in the hands of the parents it may be the means of making the study of the Bible in the family a blessing to young and old; and that the teacher in the schoolroom may see precious rays of light flashing from its pages, pointing both teacher and pupil to the Great Divine Teacher.We trust that while its simplicity will attract many who might not be inclined to read a deep argumentative treatise, the most studious will find food for thought, and thus become better acquainted with the character of our Heavenly Father. Those who wish to enter into more comprehensive study, will find that the marginal references open up many veins of precious ore in the deep mines of God's Word.Throughout the entire book the special providence of God over those who are faithful to Him is brought out in clear contrast to the fate of those who ignore His guiding hand. The truth is the same, whether in the history of nations or individuals.As The Story of Daniel the Prophet goes forth on its mission of love for the Great Master, may it prove a blessing to all classes, young and old, rich and poor, learned and unlearned.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=taCXO1w2oqkC&dq=The+Story+of+Daniel+the+Prophet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Index Fossils of North America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8M0_AAAAIAAJ&dq=Index+Fossils+of+North+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"QuarkXPress 6 Killer Tips","description":"The hottest collection of cool tips and hidden secrets for the QuarkXPress pro who needs results FAST!

Dick is a fatherless boy and the only man in a household of nine. Anthony is your average Italian kid from Boyle Heights. He's courting Stevie's baby sister, Lucy. Stevie's a go-getter whose reality is carved by his father's sink or swim devotion to LA business. Frankie's a glamor guy attending USC and the privileged son of a notorious Sicilian gambling czar. His kid sister Anna fears the same fate as the Japanese. War was never part of the plan. But more than simple war ties them. Italian-Americans made up the largest ethnic group to serve, yet sadly, more than half a million of their relatives living stateside became \\"enemy aliens.\\" The Fight Abroad honors the military service of Los Angeles Italians, while The Fear Back Home centers on the hardships they faced along the California coast--property seizure, curfew and travel restrictions, forced relocation, shame, and even internment. The quiet stigma is no longer hidden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BCdhyAEACAAJ&dq=Fear+(Ome)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailor of fortune;: Adventures of an Irish sailor, soldier, pirate, pearl-fisher, gun-runner, rebel and Antarctic explorer,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gJ9OAQAAMAAJ&dq=Sailor+of+fortune%3B:+Adventures+of+an+Irish+sailor,+soldier,+pirate,+pearl-fisher,+gun-runner,+rebel+and+Antarctic+explorer,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Limits of Trust:Cryptography, Governments, and Electronic Commerce","description":"The book addresses the international regulation of cryptography and digital signatures both in terms of confidentiality (cryptography used to keep secrets) and authentication (cryptography used to verify information).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N0M6AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Limits+of+Trust:Cryptography,+Governments,+and+Electronic+Commerce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Market Yourself on the Internet: Jobsearch (Crisp Professional Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jzdUAAAAYAAJ&dq=How+to+Market+Yourself+on+the+Internet:+Jobsearch+(Crisp+Professional+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confidence (Notable American Authors)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V1WxAAAAIAAJ&dq=Confidence+(Notable+American+Authors)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Vida Del Cuore","description":"Recientemente se ha descubierto la gran riqueza de textos cientificos y filosoficos escritos en las lenguas vernaculas europeas durante la Edad Media.

On a windswept summer day, as the fog rolls across the San Francisco coastline, a solitary figure walks down the beach, a dog at her side. At eleven, Pip Mackenzie's young life has already been touched by tragedy; nine months before, a terrible accident plunged her mother into inconsolable grief. But on this chilly July afternoon, Pip meets someone who fills her sad gray world with color and light. And in her innocence and in his kindness, a spark will be kindled, lives will be changed, and a journey of hope will begin. From the moment the curly-haired girl walks up to his easel on the sand, Matt Bowles senses something magical about her. Pip reminds him of his own daughter at that age, before a bitter divorce tore his family apart and swept his children halfway across the world. With her own mother, Oph lie, retreating deeper into her grief, Pip spends her summer at the shore the way lonely children do: watching the glittering waters and rushing clouds, daydreaming and remembering how things used to be. That is, until she meets artist Matt Bowles, who offers to teach the girl to draw and can't help but notice her beautiful, lonely mother. At first, Oph lie is thrown off balance by her daughter's new companion until she realizes how much joy he is bringing into their lives, despite the sadness she sees in his eyes. As their newfound friend works his subtle magic, mother and daughter slowly begin to heal, to laugh again, to rediscover what they have lost. When summer ends, and Oph lie and Pip must leave the beach for the city, the season of healing continues. Gathering her newfound strength, Oph lie begins a volunteer job at a city outreach program, where she works with the homeless, and can no longer ignore the blessings in her own life. But as soul-sharing phone calls and autumn beach getaways deepen Oph lie and Matt's friendship, fate strikes another blow. Out of the blue, Matt must confront unfinished business from his past. Days later, Oph lie is struck by a stunning betrayal by someone she trusts. And as these events reverberate in two already wounded hearts, something extraordinary happens. Out of the darkness that has shadowed them both comes an unexpected gift of hope. With grace and compassion, Danielle Steel explores the fragile bonds between mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, family members and lifelong friends. Her haunting, impassioned novel takes us across the complex landscape of loss to the blessings that arise from even the darkest tragedies. At once a story of triumph and a moving elegy to those who suffer and survive, Safe Harbour is perhaps her most powerful and life-affirming novel to date.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OMR4YoLKu5gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic Cottage","description":"Step inside The Magic Cottage, another chilling classic from the Master of Horror James Herbert.

Jacqueline Grennon Brooks and Martin Brooks present a new set of images for educational settings, images that emerge from student engagement, interaction, reflection, and construction. They have considerable experience in creating constructivist educational settings and conducting research on those settings. Authentic examples are provided throughout the book, as are suggestions for administrators, teachers, and policymakers.

In the course of researching this book, the author interviewed hundreds of Russian mothers, living in Moscow, many corners of Russia, and quite literally all over the world. \\"Motherhood, Russian-style\\" takes readers on a very personal journey through all aspects on raising children, the \\"Russian\\" way. Despite their many individual approaches, there are some unifying elements of Russian motherhood, placing modern Russian mothers quite comfortably somewhere in between Asian tiger mums and the more laid-back parenting styles popular in America and Europe. A light read filled with many personal anecdotes, this book includes a glossary of classic Russian childhood words, and takes a close look at many of the aspects of raising children which make Russian mamas unique. From dachas to shapkas, kasha to borsch, chess to ballet, the trials and tribulations of raising Russian children make for an entertaining and enjoyable read.

The strikers sought to make the companies retreat from decades of antiunion repression, abide by the newly enacted federal labor law, and recognize their union. For two months a grinding struggle unfolded, punctuated by bloody clashes in which police, company agents, and National Guardsmen ruthlessly beat and shot unionists. At least sixteen died and hundreds more were injured before the strike ended in failure. The violence and brutality of the Little Steel Strike became legendary. In many ways it was the last great strike in modern America. Traditionally the Little Steel Strike has been understood as a modest setback for steel workers, one that actually confirmed the potency of New Deal reforms and did little to impede the progress of the labor movement. However, The Last Great Strike tells a different story about the conflict and its significance for unions and labor rights. More than any other strike, it laid bare the contradictions of the industrial labor movement, the resilience of corporate power, and the limits of New Deal liberalism at a crucial time in American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c6owDwAAQBAJ&dq=Strike!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Skiing (The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Sports, 23) (The Ultimate Guide to Weight Training for Sports, ...

This celebration of the Georgian sailor s diet reveals how the navy s administrators fed a fleet of more than 150,000 men, in ships that were often at sea for months on end and that had no recourse to either refrigeration or canning. Contrary to the prevailing image of rotten meat and weevily biscuits, their diet was a surprisingly hearty mixture of beer, brandy, salt beef and pork, peas, butter, cheese, hard biscuit, and the exotic sounding lobscouse, not to mention the Malaga raisins, oranges, lemons, figs, dates, and pumpkins which were available to ships on far-distant stations. In fact, by 1800 the British fleet had largely eradicated scurvy and other dietary disorders. While this scholarly work contains much of value to the historian, the author s popular touch makes this an enthralling story for anyone with an interest in life at sea in the age of sail.  Overall this is an excellent examination of this crucial aspect of British naval power, and I m certainly going to try out some of the recipes.

Swords in the Mist, book three in the Lankhmar series, thrusts our indentured, sword-swinging servants into the question of hate, its power, and its purpose. Times are lean in Lankhmar, illuminating the link between money and love. Luckily, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser don t always believe in love. When Lankhmar gets too gritty, our travelers take to their other, less harsh mistress, the sea. But the sea can play tricks on men, and so can the sea king. He can break a man, or worse yet, curse him. But when he is away, it s all play for the formidable swordsmen and the Triple Goddess . . . and two luscious sea queens. But luck may not always be there, as they discover on the way to see Ningauble, their wizard employer. After a long journey in defense of their control over their own fates, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser find themselves pawns in a life-and-death chess game, all of Lankhmar being the pieces. How many pawns will be left on the board before someone wins? Before The Lord of the Rings took the world by storm, Leiber s fantastic but thoroughly flawed antiheroes, Fafhrd and Gray Mouser, adventured deep within the caves of Inner Earth, albeit a different one. They wondered and wandered to the edges of the Outer Sea, across the Land of Nehwon and throughout every nook and cranny of gothic Lankhmar, Nehwon s grandest and most mystically corrupt city. Lankhmar is Leiber s fully realized, vivid incarnation of urban decay and civilization s corroding effect on the human psyche. Drawing on themes from Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, and H. P. Lovecraft, master manipulator Fritz Leiber is a worldwide legend within the fantasy genre and actually coined the term Sword and Sorcery that describes the subgenre he helped create.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t6YoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Law of Bound Hearts","description":"With Entering Normal and Leaving Eden, Anne LeClaire brilliantly probed the interior lives of womenfriends, mothers, daughtersbringing to vivid life the conflict, surprises, and resilience of their complex relationships.

Although the carcinogenicity of these preparations has been extensively investigated, the book stresses the many complex methodological issues that must be considered when interpreting findings and weighing results. Evidence of an association between use of these preparations and positive effects on health, including a reduced risk of some cancers, is also critically assessed. The first and most extensive monograph evaluates evidence of an association between the use of combined oral contraceptives and cancer at nine sites. Concerning breast cancer, the evaluation concludes that, even if the association is causal, the excess risk for breast cancer associated with patterns of use that are typical today is very small. Studies of predominantly high-dose preparations found an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of hepatitis viruses. Citing these findings, the evaluation concludes that there is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of combined oral contraceptives. The evaluation also found sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of some, but not all, combined preparations in animals. Combined oral contraceptives were classified as carcinogenic to humans. The evaluation also cites conclusive evidence that these agents have a protective effect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium. Progestogen-only contraceptives are evaluated in the second monograph, which considers the association with cancer at six sites. The evaluation found no evidence of an increased risk for breast cancer. Although the evaluation found sufficient evidence in animals for the carcinogenicity of medroxyprogesterone acetate, evidence for the carcinogenicity of progestogen-only contraceptives in humans was judged inadequate. Progestogen-only contraceptives were classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans. The third monograph, on post-menopausal estrogen therapy, considers evidence of an association with cancer at eight sites. Findings from a large number of epidemiological studies indicate a small increase in the risk of breast cancer in women who have used these preparations for five years or more. Studies consistently show an association between use of post-menopausal estrogen therapy and an increased risk for endometrial cancer. Data on the association with other cancers were either inconclusive or suggested no effect on risk. The evaluation concludes that post-menopausal estrogen therapy is carcinogenic to humans. The final monograph evaluates the association between the use of post-menopausal estrogen-progestogen therapy and cancer at four sites. The evaluation of limited data on breast cancer found an increased relative risk observed with long-term use. Data were judged insufficient to assess the effects of past use and of different progestogen compounds, doses, and treatment schedules. For endometrial cancer, the evaluation found an increase in risk relative to non-users when the progestogen was added to the cycle for 10 days or fewer. Post-menopausal estrogen-progestogen therapy was classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans. Concerning post-menopausal therapy in general, the book notes that evidence of carcinogenic risks must be placed in perspective of potential benefits. The prevention of osteoporotic fractures is cited as the best-established benefit. Evidence also suggests that estrogen prevents heart disease and may prevent memory loss and dementia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F8hrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Bearing+the+Big+H:+A+Hormonal+Journey+on+the+Hysterectomy+Highway&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mensaje en la camiseta.

Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent his entire life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass, revising it in several editions until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_27qoQEACAAJ&dq=Leaves+of+grass&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roots of Neuro Linguistic Programming","description":"'The Origins of Neuro Linguistic Programming' brings together the recollections and thoughts of some of the main protagonists from the very early days of NLP.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ae_fMgEACAAJ&dq=Roots+of+Neuro+Linguistic+Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bat-21","description":"When his electronic warfare plane, call sign Bat 21, was shot down on 2 April 1972, fifty-three-year-old Air Force navigator Iceal \\"Gene\\" Hambleton parachuted into the middle of a North Vietnamese invasion force and set off the biggest and most controversial air rescue effort of the Vietnam War.

It also examines the thorny debates arising from an operation that balanced one man's life against mounting U.S. and South Vietnamese casualties and material losses, the operation's impact on one of the most critical battles of the war, and the role played by search and rescue as America disengaged from that war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rjs9BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seventeenth Degree: How It Went, Vietnam, Hanoi, Medina, Sons of the Morning","description":"Based on interviews with her friends, former lovers, and associates, this biography of a twentieth-century American literary icon covers her days at the Partisan Review, her stormy marriage to critic Edmund Wilson, her novel The Group, and much more.

It explores mainstream, personal, and experimental narrative forms, surveying both American and international films. In a field where novelty often equals commercial success, scriptwriters frequently strive to create screenplays that are innovative and exceptional. Alternative Scriptwriting links scriptwriting to other forms of storytelling, and discusses issues including the three act structure, working with and against genre, character identification, and the implications of screenplay form. Key issues, examples, and case studies demonstrate what works, what doesn't, and why. Exercises encourage writers to explore new ways of viewing their work and to test the limits of their skills. Additions to the third edition include: * a comparative study of how two very different filmmakers handle different types of film. * a look at ways in which narrative tension, story structure, and perspective can be used when writing for the digital film * a study of adapting contemporary literature for film *Examines a wider variety of genres than ever before, including extreme forms such as the melodrama and the thriller *Includes a discussion of alternative film in the context of DVD technology *Features a new study of adaptation from contemporary literature","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9A7AwAEACAAJ&dq=Alternative+Scriptwriting:+Successfully+Breaking+the+Rules,+Third+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baensch Aquarium Atlas Vol. 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=thlOPgAACAAJ&dq=Baensch+Aquarium+Atlas+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Con Man's Daughter","description":"When Candice Curry was a little girl, she put her hand in her father's back pocket so that she wouldn't get lost in large crowds. Little did she know that as she followed him, he was plying his trade: conning people. Her family drove stolen cars, lived in stolen houses, and shopped with stolen credit cards. Drug use was regular, as were visits from strange people who were trying to track her father down. Though she eventually cut ties with her father, Candice could not ignore the scars that were left from her childhood. This is her story, one steeped in secrets but one that, ultimately, led her to a place of forgiveness and freedom. As she struggles to understand her criminal father, as well as her own imperfect life, Candice comes to realize that we are not defined by our circumstances but rather by how we react to those circumstances. She's found peace in the knowledge that God doesn't love us because we're perfect--but because he is.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hc_lDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API (3rd Edition)","description":"To build today's highly distributed, networked applications and services, you need deep mastery of sockets and other key networking APIs.

To remedy this situation, Western firms must approach their operations in Asia strategically, by questioning many of the traditional assumptions of Western business. While Japan has been the subject of much Western scrutiny, the other nations in the region South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, China, and Thailand have been virtually overlooked. Strategies for Asia Pacific, the culmination of two decades of research and direct professional experience, is written to provide Western companies with a hands-on approach to doing business in Asia Pacific. The authors first define the region's key characteristics, its role in the world economy, and key features of market and consumer behavior. The book then turns to an overview of the competitive market for developing business there, outlining what is required to design and manage joint-ventures. The final chapters examine the prospective pitfalls in managing Asia Pacific operations and the human resource issues associated with such operations before concluding with projections for future trends in the development of the region.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Aoxnd1yfsMQC&dq=Strategies+for+Asia+Pacific&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Woodbook","description":"A painstaking facsimile reproducing all specimen pages from the original volumes of Romeyn Beck Hough's American Woods, an indispensable reference work of breathtaking beauty that has set the standard for the study of trees and wood.

Leslie Toliver, a racecar driver in the pre-war years, eagerly joined the all-volunteer force for a chance to fight with his people against those who sought to murder them. When the war in Europe ends and the  savage continent  sits on the brink of continental civil war from chaos, terror, and famine, Leslie and the Brigade move to Tarvisio, Italy, a border triangle city perfect for covert action. While out searching for Holocaust survivors, Leslie undertakes vigilante missions in Soviet occupied Eastern Europe hunting down Nazis on the run for both vengeance and justice. With each Nazi found or refugee rescued, he looks for more information to complete his most personal mission: to find his mother and fianc e who went missing in the upheaval of the war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBQ-EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Holy Bible As Printed by Robert Aitken and Approved and Recommended by the Congress of the United States Of America in 1782","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T3d4AQAACAAJ&dq=The+Holy+Bible+As+Printed+by+Robert+Aitken+and+Approved+and+Recommended+by+the+Congress+of+the+United+States+Of+America+in+1782&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acid Tongues and Tranquil Dreamers: Eight Scientific Rivalries That Changed the World","description":"This volume builds on two recent developments in philosophy on the relationship between art and science: the notion of representation and the role of values in theory choice and the development of scientific theories. Its aim is to address questions regarding scientific creativity and imagination, the status of scientific performances such as thought experiments and visual aids and the role of aesthetic considerations in the context of discovery and justification of scientific theories. Several contributions focus on the concept of beauty as employed by practising scientists, the aesthetic factors at play in science and their role in decision making. Other essays address the question of scientific creativity and how aesthetic judgment resolves the problem of theory choice by employing aesthetic criteria and incorporating insights from both objectivism and subjectivism. The volume also features original perspectives on the role of the sublime in science and sheds light on the empirical work studying the experience of the sublime in science and its relation to the experience of understanding. The Aesthetics of Science tackles these topics from a variety of novel and thought-provoking angles. It will be of interest to researchers and advanced students in philosophy of science and aesthetics, as well as other subdisciplines such as epistemology and philosophy of mathematics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LszKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trojan War (Webster everyreaders)","description":"Pulitzer Prizewinning historian Barbara W. Tuchman, author of the World War I masterpiece The Guns of August, grapples with her boldest subject: the pervasive presence, through the ages, of failure, mismanagement, and delusion in government. Drawing on a comprehensive array of examples, from Montezuma s senseless surrender of his empire in 1520 to Japan s attack on Pearl Harbor, Barbara W. Tuchman defines folly as the pursuit by government of policies contrary to their own interests, despite the availability of feasible alternatives. In brilliant detail, Tuchman illuminates four decisive turning points in history that illustrate the very heights of folly: the Trojan War, the breakup of the Holy See provoked by the Renaissance popes, the loss of the American colonies by Britain s George III, and the United States  own persistent mistakes in Vietnam. Throughout The March of Folly, Tuchman s incomparable talent for animating the people, places, and events of history is on spectacular display.

It does not matter how old the child was or the circumstances of their death, a parent's grief feels unbearable. Every year, in the US alone, 44,226 parents lose a child under the age of 19. Worldwide, it's a staggering 6.3 million newly bereaved parents every year. Those numbers do not include parents who lose adult children, whose pain is no different than those who lose young children. These parents are all thrown into a world they never expected to be in and certainly don't want to be a part of. Yet they have no choice. No frame of reference. No idea how to navigate the storm. They are deeply in pain and often feel very alone and lost in their experience. Just as a lighthouse is a beacon, shedding light and guiding ships through the darkness, so is this book. It is a guide, a companion, a source of help and hope, to assist you and them in the most difficult journey of their life. This book is your lighthouse. It is for the parents who have had to say goodbye to their children, those who love them and support them, and those who work with them in a professional capacity. It is a source of truth, support, experience, explanation, validation, reassurance, and hope that they can and will get through their grief, this most difficult of experiences, without ever forgetting about their child or the love they shared. Whether you are a bereaved parent, family member, or, perhaps a friend, co-worker or professional who works with the bereaved, this book was written for you... a source of information, support, resources, and strategies for coping and healing after the death of a child. Wherever you are in your grief journey, you will find valuable information in these pages. It is a guide to help you find your way out of the darkness and into a place of color and light again, where you will weave your child's memory into the fabric of your life and hold them in your heart forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BCXDrQEACAAJ&dq=They+Died+in+the+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Walk In My Shoes","description":"I put my poems explaining a person in each one of them and somewhat into their life into their journey.

Poetry is a way of playing with words, role play so I scrambled them up, its information untold. I have it where some people are so clear and some need to be figured out. My wording is characterized to give a better sense of who these people are. So it's a game as well (who am I) on each page...not talking about anybody in particular, just a person in their circumstances. If you the reader are able to relate, find that I am telling your story, your life or someone else's through the words that I wrote then I nailed a lot of the people I wrote about.

Through this new friendship, he is introduced to the drawing-rooms of high society and finds love in an unexpected quarter. Then, suddenly, he vanishes without a trace.

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls \\"embodied interaction\\" an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-TRWc0PA9e4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Logic of Provability","description":"Boolos, a pre-eminent philosopher of mathematics, investigates the relationship between provability and modal logic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WekaT3OLoUcC&dq=The+Logic+of+Provability&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fighting Words: Writers Lambast Other Writers--From Aristotle to Anne Rice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qseSswEACAAJ&dq=Fighting+Words:+Writers+Lambast+Other+Writers--From+Aristotle+to+Anne+Rice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The revenge of Dracula","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A9DzAAAACAAJ&dq=The+revenge+of+Dracula&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English Grammar (American Linguistics, 1700-1900)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WcdZAAAAMAAJ&dq=English+Grammar+(American+Linguistics,+1700-1900)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Experience of Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7jJrkzEj8qAC&dq=The+Experience+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MONT BLANC WALKS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wMMQrgEACAAJ&dq=MONT+BLANC+WALKS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wine is a mocker: What the Bible says about alcohol","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wIfRHAAACAAJ&dq=Wine+is+a+mocker:+What+the+Bible+says+about+alcohol&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ingalls-Wilder homesites: A diary of visits 1972-81","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rPmuOwAACAAJ&dq=The+Ingalls-Wilder+homesites:+A+diary+of+visits+1972-81&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woody Allen and Philosophy: You Mean My Whole Fallacy Is Wrong?","description":"Fifteen philosophers representuing different schools of thought answer the question what is Woody Allen trying to say in his films?

It reports on careful and extensive case studies of two schools which taught mathematics in totally different ways. Three hundred students were followed over three years and the interviews that are reproduced in the book give compelling insights into what it meant to be a student in the classrooms of the two schools. The different school approaches are compared and analyzed using student interviews, lesson observations, questionnaires given to students and staff and a range of different assessments, including GCSE examinations. Questions are raised about the effectiveness of different teaching methods in preparing students for the demands of the 'real world' and the 21st century, the impact of setted and mixed ability teaching upon student attitude and achievement, and gender and learning styles. New evidence is provided for each of these issues. The book draws some radical new conclusions about the ways that traditional teaching methods lead to limited forms of knowledge that are ineffective in non-school settings. The book will be essential reading for math teachers, parents, and policy makers in education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1eklAQAAIAAJ&dq=Experiencing+School+Mathematics:+Teaching+Styles,+Sex,+and+Setting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nobilities in Transition 1550-1700: Courtiers and Rebels in Britain and Europe (Reconstructions in Early Modern History])","description":"Explores the transformation of the nobility in the late 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, examining political and social changes, the impact princely courts had on noblemen and women and their way of life and analyzes issues such as the 'refeudalization' of state and society in southern Europe or the increasing urbanization of noble elites in this time period.

They dared to risk it all in a skiff of reeds or leather, on a ship of wood or steel, knowing the only thing between them and certain death was their ship. To explore, to seek out what lay beyond the close and comfortable, every explorer had to embrace danger. And as they did so, what arose was a mystical bond, a passion for the ships that carried them. From the very first time humans dared to warp the fabric of space, escaping from the ashes of the third World War, they also created ships. These vessels have become the icons of mankind's desire to rise above the everyday, to seek out and make the unknown known. And these ships that travel the stellar seas have stirred the same passions as the ones that floated in the oceans. While every captain has wished that their starship could be outfitted in the same manner as the sailing ship H.M.S. Beagle without weapons that proved untenable. From the start, Starfleet realized that each vessel, due to the limited range of the early warp engines, must be able to stand alone against any attack. Thus arose the idea, taken from the days of wooden sailing ships, that every Starfleet vessel must stand as a ship of the line. Through the actions of their captains and crews, countless starships have taken on that role. Here we remember some of those ships and their heroic crews. In celebration of one of science fiction's most beloved franchises, this updated edition of the acclaimed Ships of the Line hardcover collection now includes dozens of additional images brought together for the first time in book format spectacular renderings featured in the highly successful Star Trek: Ships of the Line calendar series. With text by Star Trek's own Michael Okuda, the story of each of these valiant starships now comes to life. ?, ?, & ? 2014 CBS Studios, Inc.

Ann Tickner is ranked among the most influential scholars of international relations. As one of the founders of the field of feminist international relations, she is also among the most pioneering. In many ways her academic career has traced the development of the feminist subfield of IR, and it is no overstatement to say that the field today would look much different without her groundbreaking contributions. A Feminist Voyage through International Relations provides a compendium of Tickner's work as a feminist IR scholar, from the late 1980s through today. The book addresses the issue of methodology in feminist IR and the continuing challenge from traditional IR scholars that feminists don't perform legitimate scientific research. Tickner introduces and contextualizes her previous writings with new essays that trace her intellectual development as a feminist scholar. The chapters consider the introduction of women and gender into the conversation about IR, as well as feminist methodological interventions and conversations with the IR mainstream. The final section of the book includes some of Tickner's later writings on topics including race, imperialism, and religion. She ends with thoughts on the present currents of feminist IR and its place within the wider discipline. Given the way that her career has mirrored the evolution of the subfield, Tickner's book provides a methodological and epistemological story of feminist interventions in IR and a thoughtful reflection on where the field is headed in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2yFwAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earth Under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice Age","description":"In Earth Under Fire, Paul LaViolette investigates the connection between ancient world catastrophe myths and modern scientific evidence of a galactic destruction cycle, demonstrating how past civilizations accurately recorded the causes of these cataclysmic events, knowledge of which may be crucial for the human race to survive the next catastrophic superwave cycle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FRr231sanc4C&dq=Earth+Under+Fire:+Humanity%27s+Survival+of+the+Ice+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catcher in the rye : notes","description":"In an effort to escape the hypocrisies of life at his boarding school, sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield seeks refuge in New York City.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=431pzgEACAAJ&dq=Catcher+in+the+rye+:+notes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cryovac story: North America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GjehHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Cryovac+story:+North+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue remembered hills: A recollection","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C1pBlAEACAAJ&dq=Blue+remembered+hills:+A+recollection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas","description":"James Adams's unique approach to generating ideas and solving problems has captivated, inspired, and guided thousands of people from all walks of life.

Founded by Russian Jewish immigrant Albert Kanter at the dawn of the Golden Age of comics, the series used the comic-book form to introduce young readers to the works of Melville, Dickens, Stevenson, Twain and other authors. This work tells the story of Kanter's enterprise and examines the cultural significance of the most successful publication of its kind in the context of the times in which it was published. Attention is given to the evolving mission of Classics Illustrated to bring serious literature to popular culture; the publication's ability to stand up to the anti-comics hysteria of the early 1950s; the growth of subsidiary educational series encompassing folklore, mythology, history, and science; and the unsuccessful attempts to revive the series in the 1990s. The careers and contributions of each of the artists are covered, and the text is supplemented by quotations from exclusive interviews and correspondence with such illustrators as George Evans, Gray Morrow, Lou Cameron, Norman Nodel and Rudolph Palais. Detailed appendices provide artist attributions and the contents of each issue in every Classics Illustrated-related series. More than 200 illustrations offer a generous sample of what drew millions of readers to the World's Finest Juvenile Publication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o3FlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Castle+Dangerous+(Classics+Illustrated+No.+141,+November+1957)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Your Own Biscotti and Dunking Delights (First Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8QcxAQAAIAAJ&dq=Making+Your+Own+Biscotti+and+Dunking+Delights+(First+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marginal Gains: Monetary Transactions in Atlantic Africa (Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture Series)","description":"In America, almost all the money in circulation passes through financial institutions every day. But in Nigeria's \\"cash and carry\\" system, 90 percent of the currency never comes back to a bank after it's issued. What happens when two such radically different economies meet and mingle, as they have for centuries in Atlantic Africa? The answer is a rich diversity of economic practices responsive to both local and global circumstances. In Marginal Gains, Jane I. Guyer explores and explains these often bewildering practices, including trade with coastal capitalism and across indigenous currency zones, and within the modern popular economy. Drawing on a wide range of evidence, Guyer demonstrates that the region shares a coherent, if loosely knit, commercial culture. She shows how that culture actually works in daily practice, addressing both its differing scales of value and the many settings in which it operates, from crisis conditions to ordinary household budgets. The result is a landmark study that reveals not just how popular economic systems work in Africa, but possibly elsewhere in the Third World.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g1fwL5dVs9UC&dq=Marginal+Gains:+Monetary+Transactions+in+Atlantic+Africa+(Lewis+Henry+Morgan+Lecture+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue: Essays, A Play, Two Poems and a Prayer","description":"The first collection of writings from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Angels in America.

He quoted everyone from Machiavelli to HAL, Ana?s Nin to Yoda, Einstein to Gandhi. But along with the quirky writing, he consistently delivered sharp insights into technology trends and helped investors pick stocks with long-term potential. After years of studying countless winners and losers, Coburn has come up with a simple idea that explains why some technologies become huge hits (iPods, DVD players, Netflix), but others never reach more than a tiny audience (Segways, video phones, tablet PCs). He says that people are only willing to change when the pain of their current situation outweighs the perceived pain of trying something new. In other words, technology demands a change in habits, and that s the leading cause of failure for countless cool inventions. Too many tech companies believe in \\"build it and they will come\\"  build something better and people will beat a path to your door. But, as Coburn shows, most potential users are afraid of new technologies, and they need a really great reason to change. The Change Function is an irreverent look at how this pattern plays out in countless sectors, from computers to cell phones to digital TV recorders. It will be an invaluable book for people who create and invest in new technologies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y1AtjCszhCkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shot at Dawn: Executions in World War One by Authority of the British Army Act","description":"The issue of military executions during the war has always been controversial and embargoes have made it difficult for researchers to get at the truth.

On August 5, 1942, giant pillars of dust rose over the Russian steppe, marking the advance of the 6th Army, an elite German combat unit dispatched by Hitler to capture the industrial city of Stalingrad and press on to the oil fields of Azerbaijan. The Germans were supremely confident; in three years, they had not suffered a single defeat.The Luftwaffe had already bombed the city into ruins. German soldiers hoped to complete their mission and be home in time for Christmas. The siege of Stalingrad lasted five months, one week, and three days. Nearly two million men and women died, and the 6th Army was completely destroyed. Considered by many historians to be the turning point of World War II in Europe, the Soviet Army s victory foreshadowed Hitler s downfall and the rise of a communist superpower. Bestselling author William Craig spent five years researching this epic clash of military titans, traveling to three continents in order to review documents and interview hundreds of survivors. Enemy at the Gates is the enthralling result: the definitive account of one of the most important battles in world history. It became a New York Times bestseller and was also the inspiration for the 2001 film of the same name, starring Joseph Fiennes and Jude Law.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jh1ZCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","description":"An account of Abraham Lincoln's specific contributions to the Civil War discusses his creation of the role of the nation's commander in chief and his relationships with his military leaders, spies, and weapons pioneers.

Ethical sensitivities about the relationship between professionals and those they serve is a source of constant debate.

Some conflicts of interest arise because a profession takes on many roles while serving one goal; others take on one role but serve multiple goals. Some conflicts are internal to the profession; others (such as family or business connections) are external. The essays in this volume address such diverse conflicts in a comprehensive way, in an attempt to make useful comparisons across professions. Containing fifteen original chapters by noted scholars of applied ethics, this volume systematically explores professions including law, medicine, journalism, engineering, financial services, anthropology, film, physical therapy, and literary criticism. An introductory chapter surveys and contextualizes work on the topic, while the concluding chapter offers us a new way to compare conflicts of interest across professions and occupations.

In the first two novels of this profoundly innovative masterpiece, Lawrence Durrell explored two sides of a romantic quadrangle involving several inhabitants of prewar Alexandria. Now that geometry is seen from a startling new angle through the clinical eye of a British diplomat, for whom love is only another form of statecraft. Like its predecessors, Mountolive is a novel of vertiginous disclosures, in which the betrayer and the betrayed share secret alliances and an adulterous marriage turns out to be a vehicle for the explosive passions of the modern Middle East.  Durrell is almost without peer in conveying atmosphere and mood. Even if his Alexandria never existed on this earth, it is now as real as Hawthorne s Rome, Proust s Paris, Loti s Constantinople. . . . Mountolive is dazzlingly cohesive, beautifully controlled from beginning to end.  Saturday Review  A work of splendid craft and troubling veracity.

Distorted by the biased accounts written by a subjugated people, many believe it was the English who ultimately won the battle, since the Normans became assimilated into the English way of life. Drawing on a wealth of contemporary sources, David Howarth gives us memorable portraits of the kings: Edward the Confessor, Harold of England, William of Normandy, as well as the leading political figures of the time.

But this doesn t mean the writer should just type words until the pages are filled. Rambling freeform narratives are not what most writing instructors hope to see. There is a better method, and it can be found in this short booklet. This booklet explains everything the writer needs to generate a successful narrative essay in step-by-step fashion.

The Phillies were having a spectacular season in which everything was going right. They held a 6 1/2 game lead at the conclusion of play on September 20. With just 12 games to play, they seemingly had it made. But the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals never gave up, and when the Phillies lost ten consecutive games, it became a thrilling pennant race for Cardinals and Reds fans, but a horrific collapse for Phillies fanatics. But wait a minute. When it was seemingly too late, the Phillies finally won a game???and the first-place Cardinals lost two games to the lowly New York Mets, so on the last day of the season there was the distinct possibility of a three-way tie for first place. It would have been a first in baseball history. On the final day of the season, the Phillies beat the Reds handily, 10-0. All eyes and ears were fixed on the Mets-Cardinals game. Could the Mets knock off the first-place Cardinals for a third straight game? The Mets carried a 3-2 lead into the bottom of the fifth inning, but finally succumbed, 11-5. But what a season for Phillies fans. Jim Bunning had thrown the first perfect game in the last 84 years of NL history. The hero of the 1964 All-Star Game was the team's right fielder Johnny Callison, who brought the National League victory with the third walk-off home run in the history of the All-Star Game. The team also boasted the electrifying NL Rookie of the Year - the team's slugging third baseman Richie Allen (later called Dick Allen). St. Louis won the pennant, and went on to beat the Yankees in the World Series. But in Philadelphia, the '64 campaign left an ache that lasted for years. The 1964 Phillies not only \\"lost\\" the pennant but, following 1964, they got steadily worse. This book sheds light on the facts for the reader to determine answers to lingering questions they may still have about the Phillies team in the 1964 season???but any book about a team is really about the players.

Van Zaalen and Reichel, internationally renowned experts about cluttering, have drawn on their extensive experience in working with people who clutter to prepare a comprehensive guide that covers everything a clinician needs to know about cluttering, from theory to diagnosis to treatment and beyond. The book includes personalized explanations that help readers truly understand the complicated disorder known as cluttering, along with numerous therapy activities and exercises that can be directly incorporated into treatment for people who clutter. Potentially confusing topics are presented with clarity, controversies are explained in accessible terms, and the varied presentations of the condition are sorted so clinicians can approach their clients in an orderly and organized fashion. Examples of the types of information presented include: defining cluttering (including historical perspectives), differential diagnosis between cluttering and stuttering (as well as numerous other conditions), public awareness and perceptions of cluttering, a wide range of key symptoms for clinicians to evaluate, detailed diagnostic procedures that examine more than just overt speech behaviors, and a careful consideration of therapy development and planning. It should be comforting for clinicians to recognize that they can receive such comprehensive guidance from these expert clinician/researchers, and I am confident that all who work with people who clutter will appreciate having access to this important new resource.\\" -J.

Vaneetha Risner contracted polio as an infant, was misdiagnosed, and lived with widespread paralysis. She lived in and out of the hospital for ten years and, after each stay, would return to a life filled with bullying. When she became a Christian, though, she thought things would get easier, and they did: carefree college days, a dream job in Boston, and an MBA from Stanford where she met and married a classmate. But life unraveled. Again. She had four miscarriages. Her son died because of a doctor's mistake. And Vaneetha was diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, meaning she would likely become a quadriplegic. And then her husband betrayed her and moved out, leaving her to raise two adolescent daughters alone. This was not the abundant life she thought God had promised her. But, as Vaneetha discovered, everything she experienced was designed to draw her closer to Christ as she discovered \\"that intimacy with God in suffering can be breathtakingly beautiful.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1bzWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"D.

After fifteen years of operating a successful automotive supplier company, much to Ford s advantage, John and Horace Dodge again changed the face of the automotive market in 1914 by introducing their own car. The Dodge Brothers automobile carried on their names even after their untimely deaths in 1920, with the company then remaining in the hands of their widows until its sale in 1925 to New York bankers and subsequent purchase in 1928 by Walter Chrysler. The Dodge nameplate has endured, but despite their achievements and their critical role in the early success of Henry Ford, John and Horace Dodge are usually overlooked in histories of the early automotive industry. Charles K. Hyde s book The Dodge Brothers: The Men, the Motor Cars, and the Legacy is the first scholarly study of the Dodge brothers and their company, chronicling their lives from their childhood in Niles, Michigan, to their long years of learning the machinist s trade in Battle Creek, Port Huron, Detroit, and Windsor, Ontario and examining their influence on automotive manufacturing and marketing trends in the early part of the twentieth century. Hyde details the brothers  civic contributions to Detroit, their hiring of minorities and women, and their often anonymous charitable contributions to local organizations. Hyde puts the Dodge brothers  lives and accomplishments in perspective by indicating their long-term influence, which has continued long after their deaths. The most complete and accurate resource on John and Horace Dodge available, The Dodge Brothers uses sources that have never before been examined. Its scholarly approach and personal tone make this book appealing for automotive historians as well as car enthusiasts and those interested in Detroit s early development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P9NPkoZWSpwC&dq=The+Dodge+Brothers:+The+Men,+the+Motor+Cars,+and+the+Legacy+(Great+Lakes+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Psychology, The Penguin","description":"The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology has become a byword for demystifying the language of this complex subject.

In the case of fractures of the proximal humerus, early range of motion is the main aim of treatment. If a fracture modifies the anatomy or function of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints, the surgeon must adhere meticulously to treatment principles in order to ensure a satisfactory outcome. Humeral shaft fractures are frequent, accounting for 1% to 3% of all fractures in adults; while excellent functional results have been reported with nonoperative management, open reduction and internal fixation is preferred in specific clinical settings. In contrast, intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus are frequently complex and full functional recovery is difficult to achieve. This volume clearly explains the concepts that are central to an understanding of humeral fractures from the proximal to the distal tip. Indications for different forms of treatment, including nonsurgical, are presented in detail, and all of the commonly used fixation techniques are described with the help of high-quality illustrations. Further important aspects such as complications, rehabilitation, and treatment of sequelae are also fully considered. This book will be an invaluable and comprehensive aid for all surgeons who treat humeral fractures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6f-JBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everest, the Unclimbed Ridge","description":"Adrenaline Classics continues to bring to the fore the work of the father of modern mountaineering, the celebrated climber and writer, Sir Chris Bonington.

And he has no choice but to see them all wed in haste. Like a heroine in an ancient tale, Vivienne waited in the highest chamber of Kinfairlie's tower for her fated lover. In the darkness he came for her, cloaked and hooded so that she would not see his face. He loved her sweetly, thoroughly and Vivienne knew she had met her destiny. But in the morning light, her dream is shattered. Erik Sinclair of Blackleith is no romantic hero but a disinherited warrior who arranged her abduction to regain his own legacy. Outraged by Erik's insistence that he needs her solely to beget a son, yet ensnared by the passion he awakens, Vivienne realizes that there is more merit in her taciturn spouse than he would admit. Erik is skeptical of her growing faith in his honour and her desire to recapture his stolen birthright Little does he suspect that his rare gem of a bride intends to capture his barricaded heart as well. ***** I ve written many series set in my fictional medieval Scottish world of Ravensmuir, Kinfairlie and Inverfyre. This is the order in which the stories take place, although you can start with any series. I recommend you read each series in order. There s a tab on my website for ALL books in this world: http://delacroix.net/ravensmuir/ I. The Rogues of Ravensmuir This is the first series to take place in this world. These three books are a bit more gothic in tone and less tightly linked to each other than the books in subsequent series. 1. The Rogue Merlyn and Ysabella s story is a second chance romance with a bit of intrigue and suspense. Their relationship is a class war - he s the laird and she s a village girl - but there s an immediate attraction between them. Can Merlyn trust in love at first sight? Can Ysabella trust her rogue of a husband when he returns five years after their parting to ask for her help? This is the first book featuring Ravensmuir and in it, we learn the story of its sister holding, Kinfairlie. 2. The Scoundrel Can a notorious bad boy like Merlyn s brother Gawain be redeemed by love? In this story, Gawain meets his match, the enticing Eglantine, who is not just as adept a thief as he is but is prepared to seduce him to regain the prize she desires. This is cat-and-mouse story of action, adventure and intrigue takes us from York to the highlands of Scotland, to Eglantine s home at Inverfyre. 3. The Warrior At the end of The Scoundrel, Inverfyre is lost to the notorious MacLaren clan, but years later, Eglantine and Gawain s son Michael - the Hawk of Inverfyre - returns to reclaim his legacy. He has need of an heir so he abducts Aileen to be his bride, never guessing that these two have shared a great passion in their past lives. At Inverfyre, Aileen is plagued by visions and fears she is going mad, while the Hawk is uncertain whether his beguiling new bride can be trusted or whether she has let the MacLarens in the gate. This medieval Scottish romance has some fantasy elements as it s a reincarnation story. II. The Jewels of Kinfairlie At the end of The Warrior, there is a family gathering at Inverfyre. We briefly meet Merlyn and Ysabella s son Roland, his wife Catherine, and their eight children. This series begins several years later, after Roland and Catherine s tragic death, when their oldest son Alexander suddenly becomes laird. The treasury is empty. The harvest will be poor. Alexander needs to see his sisters married as quickly as possible, but they wish to wed for love. 1. The Beauty Bride Alexander arranges an auction for the hand of his defiant sister, intending to manage the list of bidders - but a notorious mercenary, Rhys fitzHenry, pays the highest price. This arranged marriage doesn t begin well, as Madeline is a runaway bride, but Rhys pursues her, saves her, and tries to court her. I love that Rhys tells Madeline stories to win her heart, and that she quickly figures out that each choice of story reveals one of her husband s secrets. 2. The Rose Red Bride Alexander thinks he s learned his lesson and is thrilled when Vivienne s former suitor, Nicholas Sinclair, wants to claim her hand. It s a little uncommon that Nicholas wants to abduct his bride, but Alexander is sure that Vivienne will think that a romantic gesture, and when the wedding is held in the morning, all will be well. But the highlander seeking Alexander s agreement isn t Nicholas - it s his brother Erik in disguise, a man who needs a wife only because he needs a son to claim his legacy. He s not counting on Vivienne stealing his heart, too. 3. The Snow White Bride It s Christmas at Kinfairlie and a mysterious noblewoman seeks refuge in the chapel. When the sisters learn that she s a widow in need of protection, they decide to play a trick on Alexander and arrange his marriage. Eleanor thinks husbands are all the same, so is agreeable, although she isn t counting on Alexander s youth, charm, and desire to claim her heart. When her past catches up to her and Kinfairlie is at risk, how much will Eleanor sacrifice to see her new husband safe? What price will Alexander pay to defend his bride? 4. The Ballad of Rosamunde Rosamunde, the pirate queen and aunt of the siblings at Kinfairlie, was adopted by Gawain in The Scoundrel and trapped in the realm of the Fae in The Rose Red Bride. In this short story, a friends-to-lovers story, Padraig rescues Rosamunde, his valor making her realize that she loves him, too. III. The True Love Brides At the end of The Snow White Bride, Alexander decrees that his remaining sisters will marry for love. The portal to the realm of the Fae has been opened, though, and the Fae king Finvarra desires Elizabeth. Finvarra agrees that he will abandon his suit if four of the siblings marry their true loves, although Elizabeth knows that the portal to the Fae realm has to be closed as well. 1. The Renegade s Heart Isabella is smitten with a rogue knight, come to Kinfairlie to demand the return of his family s stolen treasure. She takes Murdoch s cause against that of her brother, then learns that Murdoch has been claimed by the Fae queen - who holds his heart still. Can a mortal maiden defeat an immortal queen by winning Murdoch s love for her own? 2. The Highlander s Curse Garrett is cursed to hear the thoughts of others as clearly as his own, a spell intended to make him an outcast so his legacy could be stolen. He finds solace in the company and the touch of gentle Annelise. Can Annelise s love heal him so he can recover his stolen legacy and give her the home - and the husband - she deserves? 3. The Frost Maiden s Kiss Malcolm returns to Ravensmuir after years as a mercenary with a hoard large enough to finance the rebuilding of his legacy and his soul due to the Fae. When pregnant Catriona arrives at Ravensmuir, Malcolm knows he can give her a future with a marriage of convenience that makes her child heir to Ravensmuir. Catriona expects nothing of men, but Malcolm s kindness and strength earns her love - and makes her determined to save his soul, regardless of the price. 4. The Warrior s Prize The mercenary Rafael thinks his companion s sister, Elizabeth, could be an angel come to earth, and one who will hold him accountable for his sins. Challenged by her and enticed by her, Rafael offers himself instead of his comrade Malcolm and begins to change his life with his choices. Can he save Elizabeth from Finvarra? He s determined to try, no matter what the risk to himself - and Elizabeth cannot resist a man who chooses nobly, just for her. IV. The Brides of Inverfyre There is one sibling left unmarried (Ross) and we follow him to Inverfyre, where the children of the Hawk and Aileen also need to be married. 1. The Mercenary s Bride This Scottish medieval romance is a Christmas novella, the story of a knight returning to Inverfyre to keep his promise to the laird s daughter. Having been attacked and left for dead, Quentin is no longer the man he was and he blames the Hawk for the change in his fortunes. But his bitterness melts before the admiration of Mhairi, for the maiden he admired has become a beauty he would die to serve. 2. The Runaway Bride Even though Aiofe is a beauty and an heiress, she wants to marry for love. Her marriage is arranged to the oldest son of the Hawk of Inverfyre, but she chooses to flee instead, hoping that his cousin, Ross, will be sent after her. Aiofe intends to claim Ross s heart, no matter the price, for she knows with one glimpse that he s the man for her.

The goal of Catholic liberal arts education is to understand how everything humans can ever know fits together in a coherent image of God's universe and how He wants us to live in it. Such learning must be lived and carried into the heart as well as the mind. Since love and knowledge grow together, Literature and History are at the heart of our curriculum. These subjects detail man's greatest hopes, and loves, and failings, when taught at any grade level. Beyond ideas are the great men and women whose lives change millions of others by their correspondence to grace. When we come to know man's history, we are humbled and inspired by how God provided for our ancestors, both by revelation and the natural law. We learn to admire their greatness even while we are cautioned by their errors, for they tell us so much about our own time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iTeQzgEACAAJ&dq=He+went+with+Christopher+Columbus,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angels In The Fire: A POWERFUL STORY OF OVERCOMING","description":"It is a powerful story of one man overcoming rejection and tragedy and being saved from thefires by guardian anfels sent from God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BuX5PAAACAAJ&dq=Angels+In+The+Fire:+A+POWERFUL+STORY+OF+OVERCOMING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Presidents' Own White House Cookbook","description":"More than 250 First Family recipes; a historic treasury of American cooking.

One of USA Today's Best Books of 2020  A haunted house story with a twist .[Sager] does not hold back (Rolling Stone) in this chilling thriller from the author of Final Girls and Survive the Night. Every house has a story to tell and a secret to share. Twenty-five years ago, Maggie Holt and her parents moved into Baneberry Hall, a rambling Victorian estate in the Vermont woods. Three weeks later they fled in the dead of night, an ordeal her father recounted in a memoir called House of Horrors. His story of supernatural happenings and malevolent spirits became a worldwide phenomenon, rivaling The Amityville Horror in popularity and skepticism. Maggie was too young to remember any of the horrific events that supposedly took place, and as an adult she doesn t believe a word of her father s claims. Ghosts, after all, don t exist. When she inherits Baneberry Hall after his death and returns to renovate the place and sell it, her homecoming is anything but warm. The locals aren t thrilled that their small town has been made infamous, and human characters with starring roles in House of Horrors are waiting in the shadows. Even more unnerving is Baneberry Hall itself a place where unsettling whispers of the past lurk around every corner. And as Maggie starts to experience strange occurrences ripped from the pages of her father s book, the truth she uncovers about the house s dark history will challenge everything she believes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kzc7EAAAQBAJ&dq=Reading+Books+for+Pay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's San Antonio & Austin","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Finding Ways: Recovering from Rheumatoid Arthritis Through Alternative Medicine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aTYGAAAACAAJ&dq=Finding+Ways:+Recovering+from+Rheumatoid+Arthritis+Through+Alternative+Medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inca Fire!

And everywhere in The Night in Question, we are reminded that truth is deceptive, volatile, and often the last thing we want to know.

A soldier in Vietnam goads his lieutenant into sending him on increasingly dangerous missions. An impecunious mother and son go window-shopping for a domesticity that is forever beyond their grasp.

One of the most remote places in the world, Bhutan is rich in natural beauty, exotic landscapes, and ancient wisdom, where people are genuinely happy with very few material possessions and the government embraces \\"Gross National Happiness\\" instead of Gross National Product. As one of the few Americans to have lived in Bhutan, Linda Leaming offers a rare glimpse at the peaceful mountain kingdom so many have only dreamed of. For over ten years, Leaming has lived and taught in the small town of Thimphu, where there are fewer than 100,000 people and no traffic lights. \\"If enlightenment is possible anywhere,\\" she writes, \\"I think it is particularly possible here.\\" The Bhutanese way of life quieter, slower, and more tranquil can seem daunting to most Westerners, consumed with time, dates, speed, and efficiency. In Bhutan, people rarely check their e-mail and take their time answering their telephones. But, as Leaming shows us, a little patience over a cup of warm tea and friendly conversation can help soothe the most distressed mind and soul. In this funny, magical memoir, Leaming takes us with her on her travels through South Asia, sharing her experiences as she learns the language, customs, and religion; folklore of a revered Tibetan holy man who gave blessings to the people by whacking them on the head with a big wooden phallus; her unlikely romance with a Buddhist artist; and her discoveries about the unexpected path to happiness and accidental enlightenment, where true bliss resides. Married to Bhutan is a reminder that following our dreams is the way to be truly happy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=twEszupCmA4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russian cooking,","description":"Celebrated Portland chef Bonnie Frumkin Morales brings her acclaimed Portland restaurant Kachka into your home kitchen with a debut cookbook enlivening Russian cuisine with an emphasis on vibrant, locally sourced ingredients.

Masters of Craft looks at the renaissance of four such trades: bartending, distilling, barbering, and butchering. In this engaging book, Richard Ocejo takes you into the lives and workplaces of these people to examine how they are transforming once-undesirable jobs into  cool  and highly specialized upscale occupations. He shows how they find meaning in these jobs by enacting a set of  cultural repertoires,  resulting in a new form of elite taste-making. Focusing on cocktail bartenders, craft distillers, upscale men s barbers, and whole-animal butcher shop workers in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and upstate New York, Masters of Craft provides new insights into the stratification of taste, the spread of gentrification, and the evolving labor market in today s postindustrial city.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MXSYDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Master+of+Craft&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","description":"The gripping history of electricity and how the fateful collision of Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse left the world utterly transformed. In the final decades of the nineteenth century, three brilliant and visionary titans of America s Gilded Age Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse battled bitterly as each vied to create a vast and powerful electrical empire. In Empires of Light, historian Jill Jonnes portrays this extraordinary trio and their riveting and ruthless world of cutting-edge science, invention, intrigue, money, death, and hard-eyed Wall Street millionaires. At the heart of the story are Thomas Alva Edison, the nation s most famous and folksy inventor, creator of the incandescent light bulb and mastermind of the world s first direct current electrical light networks; the Serbian wizard of invention Nikola Tesla, elegant, highly eccentric, a dreamer who revolutionized the generation and delivery of electricity; and the charismatic George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh inventor and tough corporate entrepreneur, an industrial idealist who in the era of gaslight imagined a world powered by cheap and plentiful electricity and worked heart and soul to create it. Edison struggled to introduce his radical new direct current (DC) technology into the hurly-burly of New York City as Tesla and Westinghouse challenged his dominance with their alternating current (AC), thus setting the stage for one of the eeriest feuds in American corporate history, the War of the Electric Currents. The battlegrounds: Wall Street, the 1893 Chicago World s Fair, Niagara Falls, and, finally, the death chamber Jonnes takes us on the tense walk down a prison hallway and into the sunlit room where William Kemmler, convicted ax murderer, became the first man to die in the electric chair.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BKX5UYWzVyQC&dq=Empires+of+Light:+Edison,+Tesla,+Westinghouse,+and+the+Race+to+Electrify+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jumping Jack The Grasshopper (Bend a Bug)","description":"Jack is a lonely grasshopper who will do anything to find a friend.

The classical philosopher and the computer programmer share share a suspicion of infinity, an acceptance of necessary limitations on human achievement, and a belief that results are more important than motives. Although Bolter fears that the growing use of computers may well diminish out culture's sense of the historical and intellectual context of human endeavor, he contends that the computer also offers new ways of looking at intellectual freedom, creativity, and the conservation of precious resources.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2LdMAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The age of reason (Books that have changed man's thinking)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hhmAvwEACAAJ&dq=The+age+of+reason+(Books+that+have+changed+man%27s+thinking)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of Civilization","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OOeKjgEACAAJ&dq=The+Philosophy+of+Civilization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stranded at Plimoth Plantation 1626","description":"Christopher Sears, a thirteen-year-old orphan stranded at Plimouth Plantation, describes daily life in the colony.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LwsuHQAACAAJ&dq=Stranded+at+Plimoth+Plantation+1626&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Feudal Lord","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0o8sAAAAIAAJ&dq=My+Feudal+Lord&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right","description":"September 11, 2001, focused America's attention on the terrorist threat from abroad, but as the World Trade Center towers collapsed, domestic right-wing hate groups were celebrating in the United States. \\"Hallelu-Yahweh! May the WAR be started! DEATH to His enemies, may the World Trade Center BURN TO THE GROUND!\\" announced August Kreis of the paramilitary group, the Posse Comitatus. \\"We can blame no others than ourselves for our problems due to the fact that we allow ...Satan's children, called jews (sic) today, to have dominion over our lives.\\" The Terrorist Next Door reveals the men behind far right groups like the Posse Comitatus - Latin for \\"power of the county\\" -- and the ideas that inspired their attempts to bring about a racist revolution in the United States. Timothy McVeigh was executed for killing 168 people when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995, but The Terrorist Next Door goes well beyond the destruction in Oklahoma City and takes readers deeper and more broadly inside the Posse and other groups that comprise the paramilitary right. From the emergence of white supremacist groups following the Civil War, through the segregationist violence of the civil rights era, the right-wing tax protest movement of the 1970s, the farm crisis of the 1980s and the militia movement of the 1990s, the book details the roots of the radical right. It also tells the story of men like William Potter Gale, a retired Army officer and the founder of the Posse Comitatus whose hate-filled sermons and calls to armed insurrection have fueled generations of tax protesters, militiamen and other anti-government zealots since the 1960s. Written by Daniel Levitas, a national expert on the origins and activities of white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups, The Terrorist Next Door is painstakingly researched and includes rich detail from official documents (including the FBI), private archives and confidential sources never before disclosed. In detailing these and other developments, The Terrorist Next Door will prove to be the most definitive history of the roots of the American militia movement and the rural radical right ever written.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aS2L9yeTYb4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Machine Cryptography and Modern Cryptanalysis (Artech House Telecom Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G6yfcQAACAAJ&dq=Machine+Cryptography+and+Modern+Cryptanalysis+(Artech+House+Telecom+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Struggle For Power in Syrian: Politics and Society Under Asad and the Ba'th Party","description":"In the midst of turmoil in the Middle East, and in the face of protests and demonstrations from Homs to Damascus and other places all over Syria, the Ba'th Party and Bashar al-Asad are truly caught up in a struggle to hold onto power in Syria.

Tony Hillerman, New York Timesbestselling author In the darkest hours of communist rule, Father Merhum fought to protect the sanctity of the Orthodox Church. Now the Soviet Union is gone, but the bureaucracy survives, and within it lurk men who would do anything to undermine the fragile new Russian democracy. Father Merhum is on his way to Moscow to denounce those traitors when he is struck with an ax and killed. As police inspectors Porfiry Rostnikov and Emil Karpo dig into the past of this celebrated village priest, they uncover strange church secrets and a conspiracy to carry the vile corruption of the former regime on into the twenty-first century. But if they don t watch their steps, someone may need to say the last rites for them. With the Edgar Awardwinning Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov series,  Stuart Kaminsky evokes Russian life like a born Muscovite. . . . Don t miss this one. It s even better than his Edgar-winning A Cold Red Sunrise.   The Philadelphia Inquirer  Kaminsky moves closer to becoming the Ed McBain of Mother Russia . . . The usual strengths of the series ingenious plotting, solid police procedure, and Rostnikov s shrewdly perceptive presence are joined here by casually effective glimpses of the old Soviet Union in chancy transition. It all adds up to Rostnikov s best outing since A Cold Red Sunrise.

The causes which precipitated the conflict between the sections and the momentous events which attended the struggle have been recounted by writers competent to the task. But descriptions of battles and civil convulsions do not exhibit the full condition of the South in the crisis. To complete the picture, social characteristics and incidents of private life are indispensable lineaments. It occurs to the author that a plain and unambitious narrative of her recollections of Washington society during the calm which preceded the storm, and of Virginia under the afflictions and sorrows of the fratricidal strife, will not be without interest in the retrospect of that memorable era. The present volume recalls that era in the aspect in which it appeared to a woman rather than as it appeared to a statesman or a philosopher. - Preface.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tCaSue7wctIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Inside: A Memoir","description":"The patient is an ascetically pretty 15?-year-old white female. She is intelligent, fearful, extremely anxious, and depressed. Her rage is poorly controlled and inappropriately expressed. Diagnostic Impression: Program for social recovery in a supportive and structured environment appears favorable. Life Inside In 1967, three months before her sixteenth birthday, Mindy Lewis was sent to a state psychiatric hospital by court order. She had been skipping school, smoking pot, and listening to too much Dylan. Her mother, at a loss for what else to do, decided that Mindy remain in state custody until she turned eighteen and became a legal, law-abiding, \\"healthy\\" adult. Life Inside is Mindy's story about her coming-of-age during those tumultuous years. In honest, unflinching prose, she paints a richly textured portrait of her stay on a psychiatric ward -- the close bonds and rivalries among adolescent patients, the politics and routines of institutional life, the extensive use of medication, and the prevalence of life-altering misdiagnoses. But this memoir also takes readers on a journey of recovery as Lewis describes her emergence into adulthood and her struggle to transcend the stigma of institutionalization. Bracingly told, and often terrifying in its truths, Life Inside is a life-affirming memoir that informs as it inspires.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MFDujBuIygIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heart's Shout: Perfect and Urgent Wisdom from the Living Heart of Reality, the Incarnate Divine Person","description":"The Hearts Soul is a comprehensive introduction to Avatar Adi Da Samraj - to his Divine realisation, to his Transmission of the Divine, which can awaken anyone to the same Realisation, and his Wisdom-Teaching, which illuminates every area of human and spiritual growth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qdUQAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Heart%27s+Shout:+Perfect+and+Urgent+Wisdom+from+the+Living+Heart+of+Reality,+the+Incarnate+Divine+Person&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enchanted Realms: Tales by Masters of Fantasy","description":"The worst MonstersLive under your Skin.Red Daim is a girl who shrouds herself in mystery.

The founding of the modern Swedish welfare state was based in large part on the belief that it was necessary for the state to intervene in society in order to improve the situation of the family. Of great concern was the low birthrate, which was seen as a threat to the very survival of Swedes as a national population group. The Social Democrats pioneered welfare measures that aimed to strengthen the family, to alleviate its worst trials and tribulations, and to make possible harmonious living. With the Social Democrats remaining in power continuously until 1976, a period of almost forty-five years, Sweden went on to implement governmental \\"family policies\\" that are among the most comprehensive (and expensive) in the world. In view of this major policy goal of family improvement, the actual situation of the Swedish family today presents a genuine irony; some have claimed that Swedish welfare state policies have had consequences that are the opposite of those originally intended. Comparing contemporary Swedish family patterns with those of other advanced nations, one finds a very high family dissolution rate, probably the highest in the Western world, and a high percentage of single-parent, female headed families. Even marriage seems to have fallen increasingly out of favor, with Sweden having the lowest marriage rate and latest age of first marriage, and the highest rate of children born out-of-wedlock. The early pronatalist aspirations of the Swedish government have been spectacularly unsuccessful, as Sweden continues to have one of the world's lowest birthrates and smallest average family sizes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LeGrAAAAQBAJ&dq=Disturbing+the+Nest:+Family+Change+and+Decline+in+Modern+Societies+(Social+Institutions+and+Social+Change)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ralph Compton: Blood and Gold: A Ralph Compton Novel","description":"An inexperienced cowpuncher with a solid work ethic, Dusty Hannah has earned the respect of his boss.
