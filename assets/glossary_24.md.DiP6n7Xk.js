In particular, certain people inside organizations \\"outsiders on the inside\\" are key to driving innovation, adaptation, and real change. Using examples from leading companies in MIT's Leaders for Manufacturing (LFM) and System Design and Management (SDM) Partnership -- such as Boeing, Intel, Motorola, Alcoa, Ford, Kodak, and others -- she shows how employees at all levels can learn how to become \\"an outsider on the inside,\\" and be in the right place at the right time to discover opportunities to \\"pull\\" into their organization. Throughout, we grow to understand the perspectives of numerous \\"outsiders on the inside,\\" by hearing their voices and observing their actions.

These women left comfortable homes & often deferred marriage or put aside the demands of families, if not careers, in response to what they perceived as a divine call. They faced prejudice, ridicule, abuse, & sometimes violence at the hands of Southern whites for whom education of black people was an unthinkable challenge to a racist political & social system that dated back two-&-a-half centuries. As Selleck shows, while by our standards these women were not always free from the prejudice they worked to overcome, they certainly were far in advance of the overwhelming majority of their contemporaries. Quakers may have recognized the evil of slavery earlier than their neighbors, but once they \\"cleared\\" themselves of it, their patterns of reluctance to admit black members, & their segregation of those they did admit, were little different from the practice of the larger society. This is also a contribution to women's history. In many ways, the women described were building a long-established tradition of feminine benevolence that was hardly unique to Friends; in others they foreshadowed the civil rights activists who went south in the 1960s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eXkMOAAACAAJ&dq=Gentle+Invaders:+Quaker+Women+Educators+and+Racial+Issues+During+the+Civil+War+and+Reconstruction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tokyo Cancelled","description":"Thirteen passengers are stranded at an airport. Tokyo, their destination, is covered in snow and all flights are cancelled. To pass the night they form a huddle by the silent baggage carousels and tell one another stories. Thus begins Rana Dasgupta's Canterbury Tales for our times. In the spirit of Borges and Calvino, Dasgupta's writing combines an energetically modern landscape with a timeless, beguiling fairy-tale ethos, while bringing to life a cast of extraordinary individuals-some lost, some confused, some happy-in a world that remains ineffable, inexplicable, and wonderful. A Ukrainian merchant is led by a wingless bird back to a lost lover; Robert De Niro's son masters the transubstantiation of matter and turns it against his enemies; a man who manipulates other people's memories has to confront his own past; a Japanese entrepreneur risks losing everything in his obsession with a doll; a mute Turkish girl is left alone in the house of a German man who is mapping the world.

Innis, the mother of three young children, has found that marriage to handsome Michael Tarrant is utterly different from the idyll she expected. And Biddy has become only too accustomed to being a wealthy widow who keeps herself aloof from both the life she once knew and her dead husband's family. But though the sisters' lives seem set, they are destined to change once more. For Innis, a temptation to a better life may have to come too late--and for Biddy, courted by an ardent new suitor, happiness may have come at last.

In 2005 he and his wife Linda traveled to Viet Nam with a group led by a psychotherapist who works with veterans affected by Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). From the Mekong Delta in the south, to Hanoi in the north, it was a life-changing journey. Art's story is not unusual. He was a sergeant in the Marine Corps in 1968, a radio repairman stationed at Da Nang during the Tet offensive. He saw only one day of combat, but that day affected every aspect of his life for 35 years. Many veterans suffer from their memories of their time at war. They may bury them, or deny them, or run from them, or act out in other areas of their lives. Alcoholism, drug addiction and suicide rates are higher than average, as are failed relationships and chronic unemployment. Art decided to return to Viet Nam, to overlay the memories of the young man during a terrible time with those of a man in late middle age. It was a good choice for him - and for his family.

Philip Ball describes how scientists are currently inventing thousands of new materials, ranging from synthetic skin, blood, and bone to substances that repair themselves and adapt to their environment, that swell and flex like muscles, that repel any ink or paint, and that capture and store the energy of the Sun. He shows how all this is being accomplished precisely because, for the first time in history, materials are being \\"made to measure\\": designed for particular applications, rather than discovered in nature or by haphazard experimentation. Now scientists literally put new materials together on the drawing board in the same way that a blueprint is specified for a house or an electronic circuit. But the designers are working not with skylights and alcoves, not with transistors and capacitors, but with molecules and atoms. This book is written in the same engaging manner as Ball's popular book on chemistry, Designing the Molecular World, and it links insights from chemistry, biology, and physics with those from engineering as it outlines the various areas in which new materials will transform our lives in the twenty-first century. The chapters provide vignettes from a broad range of selected areas of materials science and can be read as separate essays. The subjects include photonic materials, materials for information storage, smart materials, biomaterials, biomedical materials, materials for clean energy, porous materials, diamond and hard materials, new polymers, and surfaces and interfaces.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0909EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Costa Rican Wildlife: An Introduction to Familiar Species (International Nature Guides)","description":"\\"Featuring a good selection of common and/or interesting species, The Wildlife of Costa Rica is the most authoritative and most useful general guide to its subject.

With these recent discoveries, medical science is now poised to reach for an understanding of the causes of the various forms of Alzheimer's disease which, in turn, will inevitably lead to rational attempts to treat and prevent Alzheimer's. This fascinating medical detective story of modern science's promising assault on \\"the disease of the century\\" continues to unfold with suspense and to inform and inspire through the final word. In Hannah's Heirs, neurologist Dr. Dan Pollen himself tells the compelling story of Hannah's family and their monumental contributions to the fight against Alzheimer's. We are there in 1985 when Charles presents Pollen with three decades' worth of family medical records as well as data from studies that even Pollen and his associates did not then know existed. We see the selfless acts of Hannah's descendants in their struggle against Alzheimer's: great-grandson Jeff's conviction that after his death his brain be used for all possible research; great-granddaughter Lucy's decision to overcome her dread of flying in order to reach the research center for testing; and Charles's continued research in the face of a disease that might strike him at any moment. Pollen sets this gripping story within the larger context of the efforts to solve the mysteries of Alzheimer's. He presents the foundations of modern genetic research, from Gregor Mendel's classic discovery of genes, to Alois Alzheimer's work on the brains of presenile dementia victims, to Watson and Crick's double helix model for the structure of DNA. He narrates the latter-twentieth-century efforts of scientists to systematically narrow down the causes of Alzheimer's: Carlton Gajdusek's research excluding slow viruses as a cause of Alzheimer's; and the stunning discovery of Peter St. George-Hyslop's group in Toronto in June, 1995 identifying Hannah's gene and thereby opening a new era in understanding the origins of Alzheimer's disease. At the same time, Pollen offers a penetrating look at the ongoing conflicts involved in scientific research, revealing how intense competition for prestige and funding has driven some scientists to hoard precious cell lines. These practices have impeded efforts to discover both the causes and the treatment of Alzheimer's in the shortest possible time. As Hannah's great-grandson Ben has written, \\"This is a story that had to be told. Aspirations were transcendent, but because it involved people it could not be told without tears.\\" Written by a physician-scientist who has been a central figure in the study of familial Alzheimer's, Hannah's Heirs is an inspiring portrait of the efforts of a courageous family to confront and overcome a \\"personal biological Holocaust,\\" and an encouraging look at the advances in science that have created the basis for the eventual understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

As it tells one of Mowat's most personal and moving stories, this book becomes an impassioned plea to save a species that seems doomed to extinction. A classic nature book now back in print. In the 1960s, Farley Mowat was living in the tiny fishing community of Burgeo on the southwest coast of Newfoundland. When an 80-ton fin whale became trapped in a nearby saltwater lagoon, Mowat rejoiced: here was the first chance to study at close range one of the most magnificent animals in creation. Some local villagers thought otherwise, blasting the whale with rifle fire and hacking open her back with a motorboat propeller. Mowat appealed desperately to the authorities, but it was too late-ravaged by an infection resulting from her massive wounds, the whale died. A plea for the end of commercial hunting of the whale, this moving account blends all the tension of the life-and-death struggle for one animal's survival with the drama of man's wanton destruction of life-bearing creatures and the environment itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vhiWBQAAQBAJ&dq=A+Whale+for+the+Killing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unfading Beauty","description":"In Unfading Beauty, Keith Sharp has given a comprehensive examination of woman as she ought to be; a balanced, insightful and Scriptural view on the role of women in all aspects of their lives, including the scriptural references he has drawn from. \\"Physical beauty perishes, but inward beauty never fades.\\"--2 Cor 4:16.

Not just another literary school, it was an artistic and social revolution. William S. Burroughs proclaimed that the Beat writers were  real architects of change. There is no doubt that we re living in a freer America as a result of the Beat literary movement, which is an important part of the larger picture of cultural and political change in this country during the last forty years, when a four-letter word couldn t appear on the printed page and minority rights were ridiculous.  Anne Waldman, a renowned poet and longtime friend of many of these writers, has gathered in this volume a range of the best and most exemplary writings of the Beat poets and novelists. Selections from the Beat classics appear, as well as more recent prose and poetry demonstrating the continued vitality of the Beat experiment. Included are short biographies of the contributors, an extensive bibliography of Beat literature, and a unique guide to  Beat places  around the world from Kerouac s hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, where his novel Dr. Sax takes place, to Tangier, where Burroughs wrote parts of Naked Lunch.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=USV9ec9I5lQC&dq=The+Beat+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mack Bolan: Return to Vietnam","description":"A rescue mission takes Mack Bolan back to Vietnam to the hellground where \\"the Executioner\\" was born.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IfCHNQAACAAJ&dq=Mack+Bolan:+Return+to+Vietnam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ratman's notebooks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WBA8AAAAIAAJ&dq=Ratman%27s+notebooks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pleasant Hurricanes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Isis Rising","description":"Sequel to the popular Return to Isis, this stirring romantic fantasy continues the adventures of Whir and Kali, as they rebuild Isis from the ashes.

Gause examines the interplay of Islamic fundamentalism, tribalism, and, most importantly, oil wealth that has determined the power structure of the Gulf monarchies. He shows what influences really drive politics in the Middle East as well as how U.S. foreign policy must respond to them in order to forge more meaningful ties with each country and preserve the stability of a fragile region that is vital to U.S. interests.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=emlbeh-24ogC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Historical Statistics of the States of the United States: Two Centuries of the Census, 1790-1990","description":"This volume is a census-focused compilation of state-level population, agriculture, and manufacturing data for the fifty states and the District of Columbia.

The U.S. housing market is roughly $10 trillion, making it one of the largest segments of the bond market. Roughly 70 percent of the American population has a mortgage, and for most people, the mortgage is the most important financial instrument in their lives.

Given the $188 billion government bailout of the two firms the most expensive bailout in history the politics surrounding housing are worse than they've ever been, and the two gigantic firms sit in limbo.

But first Calandryll and his companions must travel a kingdom racked by civil war, cross the rolling prairie of the fierce horse clans, and finally venture into the forbidden wastes and uncharted territories beyond.

Beginning with premises that were sometimes controversial, such as that every human action is caused by the agent s desire for his own good, Hobbes derived shocking conclusions, such as that the civil government enjoys absolute control over its citizens and that the sovereign has the right to determine which religion is to be practiced in a commonwealth. Hobbes s contemporaries recognized the power of arguments in Leviathan and many of them wrote responses to it; selections by John Bramhall, Robert Filmer, Edward Hyde, George Lawson, William Lucy, Samuel Pufendorf, and Thomas Tenison are included in this edition. This revised Broadview Edition of Hobbes s classic work of political philosophy includes the full text of Part I (Of Man), Part II (Of Commonwealth), and the Review and Conclusion. The appendices, which set the work in its historical context, include a rich selection of contemporary responses to Leviathan.

Actions may be temporarily deceiving, but ultimately our outward behavior will reflect what's inside, because our internal attitudes form who we really are. Those inner attitudes are also what God deems most important. In this book one of Christianity's most respected Bible teachers and pastors examines the foundational attitudes, or \\"pillars,\\" of Christian character as outlined in God's Word. Pillars such as genuine faith, obedience, humility, selfless love, forgiveness, self-discipline, gratitude, and worship. To some degree each trait, on its own, marks a person as one of God's own and reveals an active, living faith. Each is an essential element of mature Christianity. But there is transforming power when you combine them in your everyday living as God commands. Your character will be grounded in godliness; you will see things from an eternal perspective; and your faith, your actions, your witness to others will be revitalized from the inside out.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qnqm9XWh5wQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Edisons Of Fort Myers: Discoveries of the Heart","description":"In 1885, Thomas Edison, age thirty-nine and already a world-famous inventor, met the two great loves of his life: Mina Miller and Fort Myers, Florida.

Other tomes tell the global account of Thomas Edison, the American icon named by Life magazine as the \\"Man of the Millennium.\\" This book offers a look at his life in his tropical retreat, his \\"jungle,\\" where for forty-six years he and his bride sought refuge from the cold winters and the demanding lifestyle of his New Jersey home, laboratory, and business complex. While in Fort Myers he watched over his extensive botanical gardens, fished from both his boat and his long dock, interacted with the locals, and labored for many hours in his laboratory. Henry Ford and his family lived next door and many dignitaries came to visit, including President-elect Hoover and Harvey Firestone. The Edisons became an essential part of the Fort Myers story. They made lifelong friendships with townsfolk and joined in local activities until the love affair of the Edisons was cut short by the death of Thomas in 1931. Mina continued to live out her love for Fort Myers and its people until her death in 1947.

The story describes both indigenous corruption and Imperial bigotry. John Flory is a white timber merchant in 1920s Burma. Disillusioned by imperial life, Flory defies orthodoxy and befriends Indian Dr. Veraswami. The doctor is being pursued by a corrupt magistrate, U Po Kyin, who is orchestrating his downfall. The only thing that can save his reputation is membership in the all-white Club, and Flory is in a position to help.

Aries traces the evolution of the concept of childhood from the end of the Middle Ages, when the child was regarded as a small adult, to the present child-centered society, by means of diaries, paintings, games, and school curricula. Ironically, he finds that individualism, far from triumphing in our time, has been held in check by the family, and that the increasing power of the tightly-knit family circle has flourished at the expense of the rich-textured communal society of earlier times.

Although he focuses on a particular region and period, Clayton also meditates on how representations of land and people, and studies of the past, serve and shape specific interests, and how the dawn of Native-Western contact in this part of the world might be studied 200 years later, in the light of ongoing struggles between Natives and non-Natives over land and cultural status. Between the 1770s and 1850s, the Native people of Vancouver Island were engaged by three sets of forces that were of general importance in the history of Western overseas expansion: the West's scientific exploration of the world in the Age of Enlightenment; capitalist practices of exchange; and the geopolitics of nation-state rivalry. Islands of Truth discusses these developments, the geographies they worked through, and the stories about land, identity, and empire stemming from this period that have shaped understanding of British Columbia's past and present. Clayton questions premises underlying much of present B.C. historical writing, arguing that international literature offers more fruitful ways of framing local historical experiences. Islands of Truth is a timely, provocative, and vital contribution to post-colonial studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wr57pJXyglYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All about beer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IuIGPmikzDQC&dq=All+about+beer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gold comes in bricks ([Dell Books 25 cent series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=85NEngEACAAJ&dq=Gold+comes+in+bricks+(%5BDell+Books+25+cent+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Monster Books Set","description":"One night, when Ethan reaches under his bed for a toy truck, he finds this note instead: \\"Monsters!

Read this book and you will be inspired, convicted and thinking differently about using what God has given you for Kingdom impact.\\"  Peter Greer, President & CEO of HOPE International and coauthor of Mission Drift \\"In God and Money, Baumer and Cortines challenge Christian readers to consider afresh what generosity looks like in light of the Scripture's radical teaching and the day of affluence in which we live. Whether or not you agree with all their conclusions or personal practices, you will be challenged and inspired.\\"  Robert L. Plummer, Ph.D., Professor of New Testament Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary \\"I greatly enjoyed reading God and Money! God used the framework Greg and John described to challenge my perspective and practice of generosity. I realized in reading their book that my personal bias is more saver and spender than servant. What I truly desire to be is a fully surrendered servant of Jesus. This book gave me practical frameworks to move in that direction.\\"  Todd Harper, President, Generous Giving \\"The mission of Harvard Business School is \\"to educate leaders who make a difference in the world,\\" and in John and Greg that mission has been fulfilled abundantly. It has been my privilege to be their teacher, their colleague and now their friend; and I wish them Godspeed as they take the transformative message found in God and Money out to their community and to the world beyond.

The writers, activists, essayists, and artists who contribute to this volume consider how Asian American racial identity and queer sexuality interconnect in mutually shaping and complicating ways. Their collective aim (in the words of the editors) is \\"to articulate a new conception of Asian American racial identity, its heterogeneity, hybridity, and multiplicity -- concepts that after all underpinned the Asian American moniker from its very inception.\\" Q & A approaches matters of identity from a variety of points of view and academic disciplines in order to explore the multiple crossings of race and ethnicity with sexuality and gender. Drawing together the work of visual artists, fiction writers, community organizers, scholars, and participants in roundtable discussions, the collection gathers an array of voices and experiences that represent the emerging communities of a queer Asian America. Collectively, these contributors contend that Asian American studies needs to be more attentive to issues of sexuality and that queer studies needs to be more attentive to other aspects of difference, especially race and ethnicity. Vigorously rejecting the notion that a symmetrical relationship between race and homosexuality would weaken lesbian/gay and queer movements, the editors refuse to \\"believe that a desirably queer world is one in which we remain perpetual aliens -- queer houseguests -- in a queer nation.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G4Zq3CfbaYgC&dq=Out+in+All+Directions:+Almanac+of+Gay+and+Lesbian+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Covered Wagon","description":"Young children will love to read this historically-accurate, personal account of pioneers heading west on the Oregon Trail during the mid-1800s.

In this book, Eileen Reeves brings an art historical perspective to this story as she explores the impact of Galileo's heavenly observations on painters of the early seventeenth century. Many seventeenth-century painters turned to astronomical pastimes and to the depiction of new discoveries in their work, yet some of these findings imposed controversial changes in their use of religious iconography. For example, Galileo's discovery of the moon's rough topography and the reasons behind its secondary light meant rethinking the imagery surrounding the Virgin Mary's Immaculate Conception, which had long been represented in paintings by the appearance of a smooth, incandescent moon. By examining a group of paintings by early modern artists all interested in Galileo's evidence for a Copernican system, Reeves not only traces the influence of science on painting in terms of optics and content, but also reveals the painters in a conflict between artistic depiction and dogmatic representation. Reeves offers a close analysis of seven works by Lodovico Cigoli, Peter Paul Rubens, Francisco Pacheco, and Diego Vel zquez. She places these artists at the center of the astronomical debate, showing that both before and after the invention of the telescope, the proper evaluation of phenomena such as moon spots and the aurora borealis was commonly considered the province of the painter. Because these scientific hypotheses were complicated by their connection to Catholic doctrine, Reeves examines how the relationship between science and art, and their mutual production of knowledge and authority, must themselves be seen in a broader context of theological and political struggle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QjlKMqlo26oC&dq=Painting+the+Heavens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Education and the Social Order","description":"Despite the disastrous failure of his one practical attempt to create a perfect school, Russell constantly strove to invent a system of education free from repression.

In a remarkably short period of time, Bill Moyers's Healing And The Mind has become a touchstone, shaping the debate over alternative medical treatments and the role of the mind in illness and recovery in a way that few books have in recent memory. With almost half a million copies in print, it is already a classic -- the most widely read and influential book of its kind. In a series of fascinating interviews with world-renowned experts and laypeople alike, Bill Moyers explores the new mind/body medicine. Healing And The Mind shows how it is being practiced in the treatment of stress, chronic disease, and neonatal problems in several American hospitals; examines the chemical basis of emotions, and their potential for making us sick (and making us well); explores the fusion of traditional Chinese medicine with modern Western practices in contemporary China; and takes an up-close, personal look at alternative healing therapies, including a Massachusetts center that combines Eastern meditation and Western group therapy, and a California retreat for cancer patients who help each other even when a cure is impossible. Combining the incisive yet personal interview approach that made A World Of Ideas a feast for the mind and the provocative interplay of text and art that made The Power Of Myth a feast for the imagination, Healing And The Mind is a landmark work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G4wHYbyZQF8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romani Culture and Gypsy Identity","description":"Romany culture is perhaps the most Indo-European of all.

Their sense of safety is shattered, however, when Adrienne and Skye find the body of one of Adrienne's best friends, Julianna, in a once-elegant, now abandoned hotel named La Belle Riviere. La Belle has a long history of misfortunes, but Julianna's murder is the most gruesome. Evidence indicates Julianna that had a secret lover whom she met regularly in the hotel, and who could have been with her in her final moments. The only person who knows this lover's identity is the hotel caretaker, Claude Duncan. But Claude is quickly silenced-drugged and burned to death in his small cottage on the grounds of La Belle the night after Julianna's death. One by one, people close to Adrienne are brutally murdered, and it looks as though she and Skye are the next targets of a fierce killer with a shocking secret.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EeXSHicXZwgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Developing e-Commerce Sites: An Integrated Approach","description":"This work describes how various existing and emerging Web technologies can be integrated to build a state-of-the-art website to sell products over the Internet.

However, a growing number of potters, particularly those who use electric kilns, are firing to a middle-range temperature, of which cone 6 is typical. Using middle range temperatures saves fuel and expense, reduces wear on electric elements, and yet allows the potter to achieve features shared by earthenware and stoneware. Because of the popularity of this technique, pottery suppliers have recently begun developing clay bodies and glazes suitable for the temperature range. In Glazes Cone 6 Mike Bailey surveys the growing trend in middle-temperature firing and guides the reader by practical knowledge. He discusses a range of different glazes, including special effects, glaze stains, and underglaze colors, giving both recipes and tips for ensuring success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JuyGek9KBoMC&dq=Glazes+Cone+6:+1240+C+/+2264+F+(Ceramics+Handbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strangers Nowhere in the World: The Rise of Cosmopolitanism in Early Modern Europe","description":"The mingling of aristocrats and commoners in a southern French city, the jostling of foreigners in stock markets across northern and western Europe, the club gatherings in Paris and London of genteel naturalists busily distilling plants or making air pumps, the ritual fraternizing of \\"brothers\\" in privacy and even secrecy Margaret Jacob invokes all these examples in Strangers Nowhere in the World to provide glimpses of the cosmopolitan ethos that gradually emerged over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Jacob investigates what it was to be cosmopolitan in Europe during the early modern period. Then as now being cosmopolitan meant the ability to experience people of different nations, creeds, and colors with pleasure, curiosity, and interest. Yet such a definition did not come about automatically, nor could it always be practiced easily by those who embraced its principles. Cosmopolites had to strike a delicate balance between the transgressive and the subversive, the radical and the dangerous, the open-minded and the libertine. Jacob traces the history of this precarious balancing act to illustrate how ideals about cosmopolitanism were eventually transformed into lived experiences and practices. From the representatives of the Inquisition who found the mixing of Catholics and Protestants and other types of \\"border crossing\\" disruptive to their authority, to the struggles within urbane masonic lodges to open membership to Jews, Jacob also charts the moments when the cosmopolitan impulse faltered. Jacob pays particular attention to the impact of science and merchant life on the emergence of the cosmopolitan ideal. In the decades after 1650, modern scientific practices coalesced and science became an open enterprise. Experiments were witnessed in social settings of natural inquiry, congenial for the inculcation of cosmopolitan mores. Similarly, the public venues of the stock exchanges brought strangers and foreigners together in ways encouraging them to be cosmopolites. The amount of international and global commerce increased greatly after 1700, and luxury tastes developed that valorized foreign patterns and designs. Drawing upon sources as various as Inquisition records and spy reports, minutes of scientific societies and the writings of political revolutionaries, Strangers Nowhere in the World reveals a moment in European history when an ideal of cultural openness came to seem strong enough to counter centuries of chauvinism and xenophobia. Perhaps at no time since, Jacob cautions, has that cosmopolitan ideal seemed more fragile and elusive than it is today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UvWhDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Wired Up: Wire Techniques For the Beadworker and Jewelry Maker (Beadwork How-To)","description":"The step-by-step techniques featured in this richly illustrated book take the beginner who knows little about wirework on a journey to creating artistic and unique free-form jewelry.

Devoted to the art of medieval Europe, The Cloisters is a twentieth century museum designed in a style evocative of medieval architecture. Its combination of medieval and modern architectural elements, organized around arcades of five medieval cloisters, creates a unique and sympathetic context for the exhibition of sculpture, metalwork, textiles, and painting. This contextual approach has been enormously influential in introducing medieval art to the American public. The opportunity for both visitor and scholar to examine works of art in evocative settings has informed and inspired viewers since the Museum's opening in 1938. The collection continues to grow in a wide-ranging fashion, as exemplified by the recently acquired Langobardic reliefs and fourteenth-century stained glass from the Austrian castle chapel at Ebreichsdorf, which are examined here. A two-day scholarly symposium marked the fiftieth anniversary of The Cloisters, bringing together fifteen distinguished scholars from Europe and North America. Jointly sponsored by The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the International Center of Medieval Art, the symposium offered discussions of The Cloisters' history as well as concise papers emphasizing new research on specific works of art in the collection. Keynote papers by Ilene H. Forsyth and Willibald Sauerlander presented provocative critical reviews of the present state of research on Romanesque and Gothic art--the predominant strengths of the collection. Their appraisals and proposals for new directions of research confirm the rapidly changing and challenging state of medieval art scholarship. Symposium participants have revised their papers for publication, and contributions by members of the Museum's staff have been added. The twenty-two studies presented in this commemorative volume demonstrate the methodological diversity confronting the field of medieval art history. As a group, they offer an extraordinary tribute to the significance of The Cloisters Collection.

Unique in concept and content, Cultural Tourism: The Partnership Between Tourism and Cultural Heritage Management examines the relationship between the sectors that represent opposite sides of the cultural tourism coin. While tourism professionals assess cultural assets for their profit potential, cultural heritage professionals judge the same assets for their intrinsic value. Sustainable cultural tourism can only occur when the two sides form a true partnership based on understanding and appreciation of each other's merits. The authors--one, a tourism specialist, the other, a cultural heritage management expert--present a model for a working partnership with mutual benefits, integrating management theory and practice from both disciplines. Cultural Tourism is the first book to combine the different perspectives of tourism management and cultural heritage management. It examines the role of tangible (physical evidence of culture) and intangible (continuing cultural practices, knowledge, and living experiences) heritage, describes the differences between cultural tourism products and cultural heritage assets, and develops a number of conceptual models, including a classification system for cultural tourists, indicators of tourism potential at cultural and heritage assets, and assessment criteria for cultural and heritage assets with tourism potential. Cultural Tourism examines the five main constituent elements involved in cultural tourism: cultural and heritage assets in tourism sites such as the Royal Palace in Bangkok, the Cook Islands, and Alcatraz Prison in San Francisco. tourism--what it is, how it works, and what makes it a success five different types of cultural tourists consumption of products, value adding, and commodification integrating the first four elements to satisfy the tourist, meet the needs of the tourism industry, and conserve the intrinsic value of the asset Though tourism and cultural heritage management professionals have mutual interests in the management, conservation, and presentation of cultural and heritage assets, the two sectors operate on parallel planes, maintaining an uneasy partnership with surprisingly little dialogue. Cultural Tourism provides professionals and students in each field with a better understanding of their own roles in the partnership, bridging the gap via sound planning, management, and marketing to produce top-quality, long-lasting cultural tourism products.

While the puzzling deaths of village pets may raise some idle gossip over a pint or two at the Deer Leap, the village pub, this hardly seems a case for Superintendent Jury of Scotland yard. Nor does it seem much of a challenge for the combined deductive powers of Jury and Melrose, the affable former Earl of Caverness. It is his mystery-writing, amethyst-eyed friend, Polly Praed, who drags Plant and Jury to Ashdown Dean. The impatient Polly, having yanked open a call box in the pouring rain, is ill-prepared for what lands at her feet.

Robert Schenkkan's 1992 Pulitzer-Prize winning play The Kentucky Cycle once again adopted these stereotypes, recasting the American myth as a story of repeated failure and poverty--the failure of the American spirit and the poverty of the American soul. Dismayed by national critics' lack of attention to the negative depictions of mountain people in the play, a group of Appalachian scholars rallied against the stereotypical representations of the region's people. In Back Talk from Appalachia, these writers talk back to the American mainstream, confronting head-on those who view their home region one-dimensionally. The essays, written by historians, literary scholars, sociologists, creative writers, and activists, provide a variety of responses. Some examine the sources of Appalachian mythology in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century literature. Others reveal personal experiences and examples of grassroots activism that confound and contradict accepted images of \\"\\"hillbillies.\\"\\" The volume ends with a series of critiques aimed directly at The Kentucky Cycle and similar contemporary works that highlight the sociological, political, and cultural assumptions about Appalachia fueling today's false stereotypes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kx8FNbtA7CQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black Stranger: And Other American Tales (The Works of Robert E.

Originally published in Japanese in 1959, this classic novel by Yasushi Inoue takes place during the Japanese Warring Era (1467-1573) a time when a fractured Japan was ruled by three powerful young warlords: Takeda Shingen, Iwagawa Yoshimoto and Hojo Ujiyasu. The story focuses on Takeda Shingen and his one-eyed, crippled strategist, Yamamoto Kansuke. The brilliant strategies of Kansuke, inspired by his passion for war and his admiration for his enemies' war tactics, are beautifully expressed throughout this book. Takeda Shingen a proud and confident warlord wants to expand his territory. When he retains the ambitious and mysterious Yamamoto Kansuke a masterless, unheralded samurai as his war strategist, he discovers a bold and cunning collaborator. Kansuke's talents at diplomacy and his prescient understanding of war strategy leads Shingen's clan to great success, a path which leads the pair to Princess Yuu. When Kansuke discovers her among the ruins of a castle he has just captured, she is about to commit ritual suicide, jigaki. Kansuke falls under her spell and convinces her to live to carry on her family's lineage. The conflicting ambitions of Shingen, Kansuke, and Princess Yuu are at the heart of this complex and intensely dramatic story. Each of the three needs the others in order to attain their goals. In the end, the lines between who is using whom are blurred beyond understanding. Though there's some doubt as to whether Kansuke really existed, the historical narrative and depictions of daily life present a unique and engaging look at the end of the feudal era in Japan.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mSvRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Existence and Enlightenment in the Lankavatara Sutra: A Study in the Ontology and Epistemology of the Yoga Cara School of Mahayana Buddhism (S U N Y Series in Buddhist Studies)","description":"This book offers a systematic analysis of one of the most important concepts characterizing the Yogacara School of Buddhism (the last creative stage of Indian Buddhism) as outlined and explained in one of its most authoritative and influential texts, Lankavatara-sutra. Compiled in the second half of the fourth-century A.D., this sutra not only represents a comprehensive synthesis of both early and late religio-philosophical ideas crucial to the understanding of Buddhism in India, but it also provides an insight into the very early roots of the Japanese Zen Buddhism in the heart of the South Asian esotericism. The first part of the book outlines the three-fold nature of Being, as conceptualized in Buddhist metaphysics. The author uses an interpretive framework borrowed from the existentialist philosophy of Heidegger, in order to separate the transcendental Essence of Being from its Temporal manifestation as Self, and from its Spatial or Cosmic dimension. The second part clarifies the Buddhist approach to knowledge in its religious, transcendental sense and it shows that the Buddhists were actually first in making use of dialectical reasoning for the purpose of transcending the contradictory dualities imbedded in the common ways of perceiving, thinking, and arguing about reality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mSxX3yBFHkQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cappuccino in the Winter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n2u3AAAACAAJ&dq=Cappuccino+in+the+Winter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design for Six Sigma : A Roadmap for Product Development","description":"The Latest Tools and Guidance Needed to Implement Design for Six Sigma in New Product and Service Development!

Thrown into poverty at age four, Konosuke Matsushita (Mat-SOSH-ta) struggled with the early deaths of family members, an apprenticeship which demanded sixteen-hour days at age nine, all the problems associated with starting a business with neither money nor connections, the death of his only son, the Great Depression, the horror of World War II in Japan, and more. Yet John P. Kotter shows in this fascinating and instructive book how, instead of being ground down by these hardships, Matsushita grew to be a fabulously successful entrepreneur and business leader, the founder of Japan's General Electric: the $65 billion a year Matsushita Electric Corporation. His accomplishments as a leader, author, educator, philanthropist, and management innovator are astonishing, and outshine even Soichiro Honda, J.C. Penney, Sam Walton, and Henry Ford. In this immensely readable book, Kotter relates how Matsushita created a large business, invented management practices that are increasingly being used today, helped lead his country's economic miracle after World War II wrote dozens of books in his latter years, founded a graduate school of leadership, created Japan's version of a Nobel Prize, and gave away hundreds of millions to good causes. The Matsushita story expands our notion of the possible, even for a sickly youngster who did not have the benefit of a privileged background, education, good looks, or a charismatic presence. It tells us much about leadership, entrepreneurship, a drive for lifelong learning, and their roots. It demonstrates the power of a longterm outlook, idealistic goals, and humility in the face of great success. Matsushita Leadershipis both a biography and a set of lessons for careers and corporations in the 21st century. An inspirational story and a business primer, the implications are powerful, for organizations and for living a meaningful life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mWmY1kGrGccC&dq=Matsushita+Leadership&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hitler's Home Front: Wurttemberg under the Nazis","description":"This is a groundbreaking new study of an overlooked area of Second World War History.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rn6rr3bjG3EC&dq=Hitler%27s+Home+Front:+Wurttemberg+under+the+Nazis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Born Free","description":"The fiftieth anniversary edition of the classic story of Elsa the lioness and the woman who cared for her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6HsISJQpPpYC&dq=Born+Free&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Real Analysis","description":"Using an extremely clear and informal approach, this book introduces readers to a rigorous understanding of mathematical analysis and presents challenging math concepts as clearly as possible.

This theoretical approach is illustrated with examples primarily taken from Hungary, with a special focus in two chapters on the role of gender in nationalism. The state of politics and society in Hungary is also examined in a way that steps beyond the usual simplistic, flat narratives of 'what Hungarians are like', by stressing the broad variety of viewpoints current in Hungarian society, the milieu in which a small minority of extreme nationalists are able to make their voice heard out of proportion to their numbers or political support. The theory offered by National Narcissism has wide-ranging implications for the future study of extremist nationalism in nation-states throughout the world. Sociologists, anthropologists, nationalism studies specialists, social-psychologists, and historians of the recent past in Hungary will find that this theoretical book, richly illustrated with examples from Hungarian society, challenges positive and negative stereotypes about nationalism, extremism, post-communism, central and eastern Europe, the European Union and, not least, about Hungarians themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5CQ3verpakQC&dq=National+Narcissism:+The+Intersection+of+the+Nationalist+Cult+And+Gender+in+Hungary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Data Base Systems (The Systems programming series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qr2ExwEACAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Data+Base+Systems+(The+Systems+programming+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries, Ancient and Modern","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XcAUAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holding up a Mirror : How Civilizations Decline","description":"This penetrating analysis traces a parallel evolution across four different civilisations, Ancient Greece and Rome, Medieval Christendom and modern England.

My goal before reviewing it was to \\"peruse\\" it and stop now and then when a particular passage caught my attention. Just read enough to do an honest review. But I sat down early in the morning and began actually reading the book. Just to get started. Page one lead to page two and to page three and page 4 etc. and soon I was into the book. I stopped to eat breakfast but I couldn't wait to get back to the story. Garry says the book is not a \\"cruising handbook\\". Maybe not but it's certainly a \\"cruiser primer\\" in my opinion. I can't think of much he leaves out in terms of the life of a cruiser. Maybe Pirates. But that is it. I like the way Carol writes her own accounts of the adventure. It's good to see two perspectives of the same situation and experience. The psychological aspect of long-distance cruising can be as interesting as the pragmatic side of keeping a boat going. Carol and Garry both give you great insights into this very personal side of the adventure. If I were to criticize the book I'd say from a designers perspective, I would have liked to see some more descriptions of the other boats Garry and Carol encountered on their voyage. That's just me.

In 1935, she published her masterpiece, Spring Came on Forever, a novel of two Nebraska pioneer families from settlement to the 1930s. Elsewhere an artist of the romance, here Aldrich turns romance on its head. The heroine is Amalia Holmsdorfer, one of a band of German immigrants who settle on the prairie. From her late teens to her mid-eighties she confronts and defeats the forces of nature and society that discourage or ruin others. Her life might be a modest triumph but for one detail: she married the wrong man. Quickly paced and precisely drawn, this novel is Aldrich's greatest tribute to the complexity, humor, endurance, and intelligence of the people who settled the prairie.

Here one man must pierce the military's impenetrable wall of silence to prove that even in the midst of a world war, murder is still a crime. The Advocate On a chalky bluff overlooking the windswept English Channel, an old man watches a horrifying spectacle unfold. Within a matter of seconds, one American P-47 Thunderbolt fires on another, mercilessly driving the crippled plane into the sea. And the old man, his cottage strafed, barely escapes with his life. The year is 1943: The Russians have defeated Hitler at Stalingrad. North Africa has fallen to the Allies. And the Americans, after two disastrous years, are winning the war in the Pacific. Now, in England, American fliers wage a bitter air war against the Luftwaffe. But what really happened in the skies above the Channel is something no one--least of all the military--is prepared to have revealed. To find out the truth, the Judge Advocate's office calls on a brilliant, cynical, homesick lawyer. The last thing Harry Voss wanted was a case that had every indication of becoming a political powder keg. But Harry, a man of honor, cannot turn his back on the possibility that the incident over the Channel may not have been an accident--but an act of cold-blooded murder. Harry has no idea what he is getting into. For his investigation will lead through a labyrinth of military politics, where ambitious, powerful men guard their turf and soldiers guard their secrets with an unbreakable code of silence. For Harry, the case becomes his own personal war, as he uncovers a series of murderous events that detonate up the chain of command. He only wants justice for a crime. And he is willing to risk his own career and life to get it, as he begins a dangerous journey into the dark heart of war. It is here that Harry Voss will dare to enter a world where heroes are killers, wrong becomes right, and even angels must dip their wings into the fire of hell itself From the Hardcover edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MRQDK5bmUR4C&dq=The+Advocate:+A+Novel+of+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Falsehood in War-Time: Containing an Assortment of Lies Circulated Throughout the Nations During the Great War","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pOVmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Falsehood+in+War-Time:+Containing+an+Assortment+of+Lies+Circulated+Throughout+the+Nations+During+the+Great+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trace Of Innocence (Silhouette Bombshell)","description":"Trace Of Innocence by Erica Orloff released on Jan 10, 2006 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=toQJk6cLlQQC&dq=Trace+Of+Innocence+(Silhouette+Bombshell)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After Goodbye: A Daughter's Story of Grief and Promise","description":"Friesen shares the spiritual journey through the last years of her mother's life, encouraging readers to explore their own stories of caregiving and grieving.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=utIH_Con5WQC&dq=After+Goodbye:+A+Daughter%27s+Story+of+Grief+and+Promise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rochester's story","description":"Best known for the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, Rochester's rich history holds so much more beyond medical excellence.

Compared with even twenty years ago, more white women, people of color, disabled persons, new and recent immigrants, gays and lesbians, and intergenerational mixes now work in America. The way in which government employers embrace this opportunity of diversity will clearly distinguish effective and efficient organizations from those which are unproductive and unable to meet the demands and necessities of the American people in the new century. This book addresses the demographic changes to the labor force and workplace and the ways in which government employers are managing the imminently diverse populations that now fill public sector jobs.

Shameless A visceral look at the bizarre entanglement of destructive and creative forces, Live Through This is a collection of original stories, essays, artwork, and photography. It explores the use of art to survive abuse, incest, madness and depression, and the often deep-seated impulse toward self-destruction including cutting, eating disorders, and addiction. Here, some of our most compelling cartoonists, novelists, poets, dancers, playwrights, and burlesque performers traverse the pains and passions that can both motivate and destroy women artists, and mark a path for survival. Taken together, these artful reflections offer an honest and hopeful journey through a woman's silent rage, through the power inherent in struggles with destruction, and the ensuing possibilities of transforming that burning force into the external release of art.

With this anthology, Thomas Oden provisionally declares S?ren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813-1855)--despite his enduring stereotype as the melancholy, despairing Dane--as, among philosophers, the most amusing. Kierkegaard not only explored comic perception to its depths but also practiced the art of comedy as astutely as any writer of his time. This collection shows how his theory of comedy is integrated into his practice of comic perception, and how both are integral to his entire authorship. Kierkegaard's humor ranges from the droll to the rollicking; from farce to intricate, subtle analysis; from nimble stories to amusing aphorisms. In these pages you are invited to meet the wife of an author who burned her husband's manuscript and a businessman who, even with an abundance of calling cards, forgot his own name. You will hear of an interminable vacillator whom archeologists found still pacing thousands of years later, trying to come to a decision. Then there is the emperor who became a barkeeper in order to stay in the know. The Humor of Kierkegaard is for anyone ready to be amused by human follies. Those new to Kierkegaard will discover a dazzling mind worth meeting. Those already familiar with his theory of comedy will be delighted to see it concisely set forth and exemplified. Others may have read Kierkegaard intensively without having ever really noticed his comic side. Here they will find what they have been missing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=el3sDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Molly Gallagher","description":"Her lover's obsession with vengeance threatens to keep him and Molly forever apart","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KoYmAAAACAAJ&dq=Molly+Gallagher&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Coming of Civilization (Cambridge Introduction to World History)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Assignment: The Girl in the Gondola (Sam Durell, No. 19)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=APkuAQAAIAAJ&dq=Assignment:+The+Girl+in+the+Gondola+(Sam+Durell,+No.+19)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yellow Brick Road (1978 Special Arrangement Collectors edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"21 Things I Wish My Broker Had Told Me: Practical Advice for New Real Estate Professionals.","description":"\\"Frank Cook shows new agents, those who might want to be agents, and those who want to be better agents, the road to success.\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bZJ-6Arl0ooC&dq=21+Things+I+Wish+My+Broker+Had+Told+Me:+Practical+Advice+for+New+Real+Estate+Professionals.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hospitality Marketing: An Introduction","description":"Hospitality Marketing: an introduction takes a unique approach to outlining marketing processes in the hospitality industry.

Most of us rally around the glory of the Allies' victory over the Nazis in World War II. The story is often told of how the good fight was won by an astonishing array of manpower and stunning tactics. However, what is often overlooked is how the intersection between Adolf Hitler's influential personality and his military strategy was critical in causing Germany to lose the war. With an acute eye for detail and his use of clear prose, Bevin Alexander goes beyond counterfactual \\"What if?\\" history and explores for the first time just how close the Allies were to losing the war. Using beautifully detailed, newly designed maps, How Hitler Could Have Won World War II exquisitely illustrates the important battles and how certain key movements and mistakes by Germany were crucial in determining the war's outcome. Alexander's harrowing study shows how only minor tactical changes in Hitler's military approach could have changed the world we live in today. Alexander probes deeply into the crucial intersection between Hitler's psyche and military strategy and how his paranoia fatally overwhelmed his acute political shrewdness to answer the most terrifying question: Just how close were the Nazis to victory?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OpDdKx1Z1QMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Up from slavery;: An autobiography (World's classics)","description":"Deals partly with the establishment of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xN45ZsUMgKEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ice Blade, Vol. 2: Snow Country","description":"Three thousand years of glory, dust and earth, eight thousand miles of journey; Yun and Yue!

Regarded as Freud's most significant work, this classic text helped establish the discipline of psychology and is the foundational work in the field of psychoanalysis. Highly readable and engaging, the book both provides a semi-autobiographical look into Freud s personal life  his holidays in the Alps, spending time with his children, interacting with friends and colleagues  and delves into descriptions and analyses of the dreams themselves. Freud begins with a review of literature on dreams written by a broad range of ancient and contemporary figures  concluding that science has learned little of the nature of dreams in the past several thousand years. Although the prevailing view was that dreams were merely responses to  sensory excitation,  Freud felt that the multifaceted dimensions of dreams could not be attributed solely to physical causes. By the time Freud began writing the book he had interpreted over a thousand dreams of people with psychoses and recognised the connection between the content of dreams and a person s mental health. Among his conclusions were that a person s dreams: Prefer using recent impressions, yet also have access to early childhood memories Unify different people, places, events and sensations into one story Usually focus on small or unnoticed things rather than major events Are almost always  wish fulfilments  which are about the self Have many layers of meaning which are often condensed into a single image The Interpretation of Dreams: The Psychology Classic is as riveting today as it was over a century ago. Anyone with interest in the workings of the unconscious mind will find this book an invaluable source of original insights and foundational scientific concepts. This edition includes an insightful Introduction by Sarah Tomley, a psychology writer and practicing psychotherapist. Tomley considers paints a picture of Freud's life and times, reveals the place of The Interpretation of Dreams in the context of Freud's other writings, and draws out the key points of the work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ylrRDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+interpretation+of+dreams+(The+Classics+of+psychiatry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicago Modern, 1893-1945: Pursuit of the New.","description":"Chicago s fine arts have long languished in the shadow of the city s architectural riches, but their time has finally come, most prominently as the focus of the final major exhibition at Chicago s Terra Museum of American Art. The attendant catalog of the Terra Museum s fall 2004 exhibition, \\"Chicago Modern, 1893-1945: Pursuit of the New\\", is the first-ever survey by a major art museum of early American modernist works created by Chicago artists. At the opening of the twentieth century, Chicago was regarded as the quintessential modern city that would provide fertile soil for a new national art. The debut of impressionism at the World s Columbian Exposition of 1893 bore early witness to this expectation as it marked the arrival of modern art in Chicago. In the midst of great local controversy, and echoing debates raging at the time in New York and Paris, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago incorporated modernism into its curriculum, a move that led Chicago-trained artists to experiment in and reinterpret the prominent art movements of their time. Here, for the first time, this work is showcased. This volume focuses on the rich body of artistic work produced during the city s artistic  golden age,  the period from the 1893 Exposition through the end of World War II. Noted art scholars contribute to the volume with essays that explore how Chicago painters created a unique niche in these transformative international art movements from the impressionism of the 1800s to the social realism and surrealism of the 1930s and 1940s and forged a regional consciousness through experimental means. This detailed and lavishly illustrated catalog examines the larger issues and concerns that shaped art in Chicago during this period, offering a new and valuable addition to regional American art scholarship and a fitting farewell for one of Chicago s most beloved art museums.

Those disparities are caused not only by fundamental differences in health status across segments of the population, but also because of inequities in factors that impact health status, so-called determinants of health. Only part of an individual's health status depends on his or her behavior and choice; community-wide problems like poverty, unemployment, poor education, inadequate housing, poor public transportation, interpersonal violence, and decaying neighborhoods also contribute to health inequities, as well as the historic and ongoing interplay of structures, policies, and norms that shape lives. When these factors are not optimal in a community, it does not mean they are intractable: such inequities can be mitigated by social policies that can shape health in powerful ways. Communities in Action: Pathways to Health Equity seeks to delineate the causes of and the solutions to health inequities in the United States. This report focuses on what communities can do to promote health equity, what actions are needed by the many and varied stakeholders that are part of communities or support them, as well as the root causes and structural barriers that need to be overcome.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AIKPDgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Living+Races+of+Man:+This+Companion+Volume+to+the+Origin+of+Races+is+a+Complete+Survey+of+the+Racial+Composition+of+All+Peoples+of+the+World,+Based+on+New+Evidence+Drawn+From+Genetic+and+Other+Sciences+With+Many+Surprising+Conclusions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing Feature Articles, Fourth Edition (Journalism Media Manual)","description":"Hennessy's classic text tells you everything you need to know about writing successful features.

It has been edited with the needs of English-speaking users in mind students, teachers, business people, and casual linguists. What is furigana and why is it so important? Furigana refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to show the pronunciation of the Chinese character. With furigana superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other dictionaries either provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all of the Japanese words and sentences. In the past, romanized dictionaries were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Now, however, an increasing number of influential curriculums around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers studying under such curriculums will inevitably feel more comfortable with a dictionary such as Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with familiar and authentic kana script. FEATURES ? More than 14,000 entries comprising the most commonly used words in English ? Furigana pronunciation guides added to all kanji ? Semantic and usage differences between Japanese words and expressions explained clearly in English ? Thousands of full-length example sentences illustrate typical usage in natural Japanese ? Idioms, phrases, and common expressions help expand vocabulary and sentence building skills ? Many encyclopedic entries offer useful background information on Japanese history and culture ? Includes many current terms such as artificial intelligence and internet ? Hundreds of scientific and medical terms with full Japanese equivalents With its sister publication, Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary, this dictionary makes the perfect reference for all students of Japanese. The two books are combined in Kodansha's Furigana Japanese Dictionary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L55NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Living+Language+Japanese+Dictionary+(English+and+Japanese+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asshur and the land of Nimrod;: Being an account of the discoveries made in the ancient ruins of Nineveh, Asshur, Sepharvaim, Calah, Babylon, ...

Bombers tells the story of the bomber with a blend of narrative and personal accounts, recording the history of the principle bombing raids and the skill and courage of those who flew them. David Wragg begins with a brief overview of the origins of the concept of aerial bombardment, which astonishingly go back several thousand years. He then describes the early raids of the First World War and the use of the bomber between the wars by the Germans in the Spanish Civil War, the Italians in Abyssinia and by the Japanese in China. The Second World War marked the massive deployment of the bomber by the main combatants as a major tactical and strategic weapon and, bringing this in-depth study up to date, Wragg examines the United States controversial campaign of extensive bombing in Vietnam during the 1960s and 70s. He also discusses whether, with the growing use of cruise missiles, the manned bomber may soon be the first element of air power to be made redundant in this age of high technology. Fully illustrated with a wide selection of photographs, Bombers will appeal to all with an interest in this key weapon of twentieth-century warfare.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o0AeDQAAQBAJ&dq=Bombers:+From+the+First+World+War+to+Kosovo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Americas: From Prehistory Through the Age of Columbus (Discovery of the Americans)","description":"\\"The Maestros do a real service here in presenting the more familiar explorers in the context of all the migrations that have populated the Western Hemisphere....An outstanding introduction.\\"--Kirkus Reviews. \\"The dazzlingly clean and accurate prose and the exhilarating beauty of the pictures combine for an extraordinary achievement in both history and art.\\"--School Library Journal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XxWrEkJj0SYC&dq=The+Discovery+of+the+Americas:+From+Prehistory+Through+the+Age+of+Columbus+(Discovery+of+the+Americans)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whos a Pest","description":"Although called a pest by his sisters, Homer refuses to believe it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6Lj-wAEACAAJ&dq=Whos+a+Pest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Donde el camino se corta: Nuevos poemas para reirse","description":"A collection of humorous poems and drawings by Shel Silverstein, including rhymes about a boy who turns into a television set, and a girl who eats a whale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xu2MzQEACAAJ&dq=Donde+el+camino+se+corta:+Nuevos+poemas+para+reirse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemical warfare; a study in restraints,","description":"In the aftermath of 9/11, the potential terror of weapons of mass destruction--from nuclear, biological, and chemical to dirty bombs--preoccupies national security experts. In Chemical Warfare, Frederic J. Brown, presents a cogent, innovative framework for understanding the historical forces that have restrained the use of WMD and how they continue to have relevance today. Analyzing both world wars, he argues that the restraints on use were complex and often unpredictable and ranged from the political to the technological. The author offers a detailed examination of American chemical warfare policy as it was shaped by industry and public sentiment, as well as national and military leaders. The organization of the book into three parts reflects the importance of battlefield experiences during the First World War and of international political restraints as they evolved during the interwar years and culminated in \\"\\"no first use\\"\\" policies by major powers in World War II. Part I examines the use of chemical weapons in World War I as it influenced subsequent national policy decisions. Part II focuses on the evolution of political, military, economic, and psychological restraints from 1919 to 1939. Part III discusses World War II during two critical periods: 1939 to early 1942, when the environment of the war was being established largely without American influence; and during 1945, when the United States faced no credible threat of retaliation to deter its strategic and battlefield use of chemical weapons. Written at the height of controversy about the U.S. use of chemicals in Vietnam, Chemical Warfare offers a valuable historical perspective, as relevant now in its analysis of chemical and also nuclear policy as it was when first published.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ptwzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lonely Londoners","description":"Looking for a better life a group of West Indians face harsh conditions in London, including racism, bad weather, loneliness, and hard times","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=61RbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Lonely+Londoners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret of Escape","description":"Back for their third adventure, siblings Peter and Mary journey back in time to Egypt, where Moses fights for the Israelites' freedom and plagues wreak havoc.

On a wild frontier, he sought a fortune. Instead, he found blood, betrayal, and the beginning of a legend. Armed only with a knife, surrounded by a fierce Blackfoot war party, the young man was forced to kill a warrior chief in an act of audacious courage. But when a grizzly bear attack left him half-dead, he could no longer protect himself. By the time the Blackfeet found him again, he had been abandoned and doublecrossed, with only one last trick up his sleeve: the ability to talk himself out of an impossible situation -- and into a battle for his life. So began William Johnstone's masterful saga of the courageous loner who would become known as Preacher. Because when he was alone and desperate, he drew on a preacher's skills -- and a mountain man's cunning -- to give his enemies hell.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ea5_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Blur of Mass Motion: Reaching into the Poetry Written by a Teenager as She Battled Manic Depression--The Poetry and Writings of Erin Winona Flowers","description":"The poetry and writings of Erin Winona Flowers, compiled and annotated by Phyllis Jean Flowers, reaches into the poetry written by a teenager as she battled manic depression.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JD_mdvOOvFwC&dq=A+Blur+of+Mass+Motion:+Reaching+into+the+Poetry+Written+by+a+Teenager+as+She+Battled+Manic+Depression--The+Poetry+and+Writings+of+Erin+Winona+Flowers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What does your cup reveal?","description":"Ryder Cup Revealed: Tales of the Unexpected is the previously-untold, behind-the-scenes story of golf's most iconic team contest.

In this challenging collection of fifteen essays, most of which originally appeared in October, she explores the ways in which the break in style that produced postmodernism has forced a change in our various understandings of twentieth-century art, beginning with the almost mythic idea of the avant-garde. Krauss uses the analytical tools of semiology, structuralism, and poststructuralism to reveal new meanings in the visual arts and to critique the way other prominent practitioners of art and literary history write about art. In two sections, \\"Modernist Myths\\" and \\"Toward Postmodernism,\\" her essays range from the problem of the grid in painting and the unity of Giacometti's sculpture to the works of Jackson Pollock, Sol Lewitt, and Richard Serra, and observations about major trends in contemporary literary criticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D5-C2w8n5NwC&dq=The+Originality+of+the+Avant-garde+and+Other+Modernist+Myths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Nonfiction","description":"A remarkable series of lectures on the art of creating effective nonfiction by one of the 20th century's most profound writers and thinkers--now available for the first time in print. Culled from sixteen informal lectures Ayn Rand delivered to a select audience in the late 1960s, this remarkable work offers indispensable guidance to the aspiring writer of nonfiction while providing readers with a fascinating discourse on art and creation. Based on the concept that the ability to create quality nonfiction is a skill that can be learned like any other, The Art of Nonfiction takes readers through the writing process, step-by-step, providing insightful observations and invaluable techniques along the way. In these edited transcripts, Rand discusses the psychological aspects of writing, and the different roles played by the conscious and unconscious minds. From choosing a subject to polishing a draft to mastering an individual writing style--for authors of theoretical works or those leaning toward journalistic reporting--this crucial resource introduces the words and ideas of one of our most enduring authors to a new generation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ThwKSLHGrX8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bone Parade","description":"Ashley Stassler is not your average artist.

He assigns each family a number, and now he's up to number nine. What's in store for family #9? Cruelty and savagery that you can't even imagine . . . The Bone Parade introduces a villain who is as methodical, calculating, and detached as any found in the best fiction. It's gripping. It's chilling.

As the millennium turned and he set out to cover his eighth presidential campaign, however, the veteran photojournalist sensed something missing. In his words, \\"I had the uneasy feeling that I couldn't focus only on the story at hand while bypassing the texture of life that surrounds it.... This time I wouldn't speed across that covered bridge to get to the big event on the other side, but instead I would slow down a bit, maybe even pause to take a picture of the bridge.\\" Photo du Jour is Kennerly's visual diary of \\"the texture of life\\" at the start of the twenty-first century. As he traveled more than a quarter of a million miles across thirty-eight states and seven countries, Kennerly took a picture every single day in the year 2000, using just one camera and one lens. Some offer candid, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the men who would be president--John McCain, Al Gore, and George W. Bush. Most of the photographs, though, seek to capture not the big, historic moments but rather the ordinary, even whimsical moments when the essence of a person or a place reveals itself to the observer who takes the time and has the heart to really see. Travel with him from Beijing to Boston, Moose to Miami, and Whynot to Weimea in Photo du Jour, and you'll quickly discover that David Kennerly is just such an observer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4gyd1uBoCSgC&dq=Photo+du+Jour:+A+Picture-a-Day+Journey+through+the+First+Year+of+the+New+Millennium+(Focus+on+American+History+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drilling Mud and Cement Slurry Rheology Manual","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j5DpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passtrak Series 7: General Securities Representative : License Exam Manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DuAJAAAACAAJ&dq=Passtrak+Series+7:+General+Securities+Representative+:+License+Exam+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives Technology","description":"Supplying more than 300 helpful tables, figures, and equations, Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives Technology explores current industrial problems and their practical solutions...evaluates the similarities and differences in the manufacture and application of common plastics and adhesives versus PSA...discusses the scientific basis, raw materials, and properties of PSA and their laminates...explains the manufacture of the adhesive and the laminate, and the testing and application of these materials...describes both the adhesive and carrier components, as well as the way to combine them...and much more.

The Makunouchi Bento, or traditional Japanese lunchbox, is a highly lacquered wooden box divided into quadrants, each of which contains different delicacies. It is also one of the most familiar images of Japan's domestic environment. When presented to the diner, the Japanese lunchbox seems straightforward enough; each of four food portions resides in its own compartment, apparently obeying a strict lunchbox geometry. So far, just food. But Kenji Ekuan reveals that a much deeper reading is possible, one that sees the lunchbox as nothing less than a key to an understanding of Japanese civilization, the spirit of form, and the aesthetic ideal in which the many are reduced to one. Ekuan reads the Japanese lunchbox as both object and metaphor. It is one of this book's many charms that he is able to see it as both simultaneously. He compares the visual pleasures of the Zen lunchbox to an aerial view of the Japanese archipelago; he invites us to savor its quadripartite structure as we savor the four seasons. In so doing, he unlocks the secrets of ancient Japanese rituals, celebrates the aesthetics of Japanese design, explores the contours of Japanese landscapes and technology, and delineates the forty-eight rules of the etiquette of Japanese form. With an agility more characteristic of poetry than of design criticism, he connects everything from food, television, motorcycles, package tours, and department stores to landscape, ecology, computers, and radios, all the while keeping his eye on his subject. In this book of magical transformations, nothing is what it first appears, but everything is deepened by \\"lunchbox theory.\\" Consider the influence of the lunchbox on TV viewing, for example: chopsticks are used to stroll through a meal, just as remote control devices are used to browse TV channels. This book reveals a world of secret connections between its covers, in the spirit of the lunchbox itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cLxNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Aesthetics+Of+The+Japanese+Lunchbox&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MORTAL FEAR.","description":"A commodities trader by day, at night Harper Cole serves as a systems operator for an on-line service that caters to the rich and famous, but when a stranger penetrates the security system, brutally murdering six clients, Harper is falsely accused of the crimes.

This far-reaching study -- illustrated with more than five hundred original architectural diagrams and archival photographs -- employs what Eisenman calls critical and textual reading of both buildings. He attempts to broaden the definition of the formal from a narrow aesthetic and compositional view to include first the conceptual and then the textual. It is through this idea of the textual that Eisenman begins to define an idea of the critical in architecture. Eisenman's methodology is wholly removed from traditional approaches -- social, historical, aesthetic, functional. Instead, the various articulations and openings on the facades constitute a set of marks, notations that provide the basis for his analysis. In the Casa del Fascio, for example, each of the four sequential design schemes records the previous state, encoding the process of transformation in the final building. In the Casa Giuliani-Frigerio it is instead the process of decomposition that generates the facades. Also included in the book are an essay by Terragni and a critique by Manfredo Tafuri. In the end, it is the dual protagonists -- the architect and the author -- who together establish a new theoretical and analytical framework.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=17v1kQEACAAJ&dq=Giuseppe+Terragni:+Transformations,+Decompositions,+Critiques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jigsaw (Harlequin Intrigue)","description":"Romance the Western way!

For thousands of years, people of all cultures have made and used clocks, from the city sundials of ancient Rome to the medieval water clocks of imperial China, hourglasses fomenting revolution in the Middle Ages, the Stock Exchange clock of Amsterdam in 1611, Enlightenment observatories in India, and the high-precision clocks circling the Earth on a fleet of GPS satellites that have been launched since 1978. Clocks have helped us navigate the world and build empires, and have even taken us to the brink of destruction. Elites have used them to wield power, make money, govern citizens, and control lives and sometimes the people have used them to fight back. Through the stories of twelve clocks, About Time brings pivotal moments from the past vividly to life. Historian and lifelong clock enthusiast David Rooney takes us from the unveiling of al-Jazari s castle clock in 1206, in present-day Turkey; to the Cape of Good Hope observatory at the southern tip of Africa, where nineteenth-century British government astronomers moved the gears of empire with a time ball and a gun; to the burial of a plutonium clock now sealed beneath a public park in Osaka, where it will keep time for 5,000 years. Rooney shows, through these artifacts, how time has been imagined, politicized, and weaponized over the centuries and how it might bring peace. Ultimately, he writes, the technical history of horology is only the start of the story. A history of clocks is a history of civilization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rgIDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailor Moon, Vol. 4","description":"\\"A new group calling themselves Black Moon is after Usagi and the rest of the Sailor Guardians, wielding a new power known only as the Malefic Black Crystal.

We claim that the average boy or girl of twelve years who has been educated till then at one of our schools knows at least as much as the finished High School product of several years  seniority, and the achievement has been at no cost of pain or distortion to body or mind. Rather are our pupils equipped in their whole being for the adventure of life, accustomed to the free exercise of will and judgment, illuminated by imagination and enthusiasm. Only such pupils can exercise rightly the duties of citizens in a civilised commonwealth. The first four chapters are mainly psychological, showing the changed personality with which the teacher has to deal at six years of age, and the need for a corresponding change of approach. The secret of success is found to lie in the right use of imagination in awakening interest, and the stimulation of seeds of interest already sown by attractive literary and pictorial material, but all correlated to a central idea, of greatly ennobling inspiration the Cosmic Plan, in which all, consciously or unconsciously, serve the great Purpose of Life. It is shown how the conception of evolution has been modified of late through geological and biological discoveries, so that self-perfection now has to yield precedence to service among the primary natural urges. The next eight chapters show how the Cosmic Plan can be presented to the child, as a thrilling tale of the earth we live in, its many changes through slow ages when water was Nature s chief toiler for accomplishment of her purposes, how land and sea fought for supremacy, and how equilibrium of elements was achieved, that Life might appear on the stage to play its part in the great drama. Illustrated as it must be by fascinating, charts and diagrams, the creation of earth as we now know it unfolds before the child s imagination, and always with emphasis on the function each agent has to perform in Nature s household, whether consciously or unconsciously, failure in this alone leading to extinction. So the talc proceeds till Palaeolithic Man appears, most significantly traced by the tools he used on his environment rather than by physical remains of so slight a creature. The new element of mind is brought to creation by man, and from that time the children are helped to see the great acceleration that has taken place in evolution. They learn to reverence the earliest pioneers, who toiled for purposes unknown to them but now to be recognised. Nomadic men and settlers alike contributed to build up early communities, and by interchanges of war and peace to share and spread social amenities. From chapter thirteen brief descriptions are given of some of the earliest civilizations, particularly with a view to their impacts on each other, showing human society as slowly organising itself towards unity, just as, in the individual human being, organs are built around separate centres of interest, to be later connected by the blood-circulatory system and the nerves, into an integrated human organism. So the child is led, by review of some of the most thrilling epochs of world-history, to see that so far humanity has been in an embryonic stage, and that it is just now emerging into true birth, able to consciously realise its true unity and function. The last chapters go back to the psychological point of view, urging on educators the supreme importance, to the nation and to the world, of the tasks imposed on them. Not in the service of any political or social creed should the teacher work, but in the service of the complete human being, able to exercise in freedom a self-disciplined will and judgment, unperverted by prejudice and undistorted by fear.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eaxyCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darkness Weaves","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eJSwAAAACAAJ&dq=Darkness+Weaves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Savages","description":"Running a lucrative marijuana operation in Laguna Beach, environmentalist Ben and mercenary Chon confront an adversary in the Mexican Baja cartel who kidnaps their playmate and confidante Ophelia, compelling the duo to plot negotiations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j7tdoNePPZMC&dq=Savages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Play Guitar With...Black Sabbath","description":"(Music Sales America).

Different accounts coexist in myth, literature and folktale. Canonical texts deify Sita while regional variations humanize her. Folk songs and ballads connect her timeless predicament to the daily lives of rural women. Modern-day women continue to see themselves reflected in films, serials and soap operas based on Sita s narrative. Sacrifice, self denial and unquestioning loyalty are some of the ideals associated with popular perceptions of Sita. But the Janaki who symbolized strength, who could lift Shiva s mighty bow, who courageously chose to accompany Rama into exile and who refused to follow him back after a second trial, is often forgotten. However she is remembered, revered or written about, Sita continues to exert a powerful influence on the collective Indian psyche. In Search of Sita presents essays, conversations and commentaries that explore different aspects of her life. It revisits mythology, reopening the debate on her birth, her days in exile, her abduction, the test by fire, the birth of her sons and, finally, her return to the earth offering fresh interpretations of this enigmatic figure and her indelible impact on our everyday lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YTknAgAAQBAJ&dq=Sita&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eclipses: Predicting World Events & Personal Transformation (Special Topics in Astrology Series)","description":"A nationally recognized astrologer reveals how eclipses act as cosmic telegrams about the current state of the world, personal lives, and relationships, illustrating how recent and historical events can be linked directly to eclipses.

Our Solarian Legacy is a call to action unlike any other you may have encountered before. According to cultural historian and cosmologist Paul Von Ward, the time has come for human beings to reassess just about everything we believe about our ancestry and global past. Drawing upon forgotten prehistory, clues from the world's esoteric traditions, new research in consciousness, and subtle energies and sound reasoning, Von Ward asserts we are more powerful beings than either science or religion has led us to believe. He extols us to embrace a bold, new model of human existence, one that explains our celestial origins, multidimensional capacities and destiny as conscious cocreators of a self-learning and self-correcting universe. With great insight and clarity, Von Ward envisions that discovery of our true legacy will inspire a global renaissance of inner knowing and unprecedented social progress. Beyond earthly evolution, he sees humanity assuming its place as part of a universal community of conscious beings and fulfilling our potential to serve as galactic leaders. Expanding our individual and collective consciousness will be an open-ended process, Von Ward says, and will require self-initiation, self-instruction, and self-learning in resonance with the universe. Our Solarian Legacy is a brilliant guide to this new and essential process in human spiritual evolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gPQdmAEACAAJ&dq=Our+Solarian+Legacy:+Multidimensional+Humans+in+a+Self-Learning+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The JUKEBOX QUEEN OF MALTA: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy (Harper Torchbooks / Academy Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j4xQwgEACAAJ&dq=Personal+Knowledge:+Towards+a+Post-Critical+Philosophy+(Harper+Torchbooks+/+Academy+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is Love?

Smith takes readers inside the minds and lives of the rescuers at Ground Zero as he shares stories about these heroic individuals and the effect their loss had on their families and their companies.  It is,  says Smith,  the real and living history of the worst day in America since Pearl Harbor.  Written with drama and urgency, Report from Ground Zero honors the men and women who in America s darkest hours redefined our understanding of courage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KJ9FQNecnVUC&dq=Report+from+Ground+Zero:+The+Story+of+the+Rescue+Efforts+at+the+World+Trade+Center&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Voices: Words That Shaped Our Souls Wisdom to Guide Our Future","description":"100 Voices is a gathering of wisdom both influential and inspirational.

Sean Carroll, with his genius for making complex notions entertaining, presents in his uniquely lucid voice the fundamental ideas informing the modern physics of reality. Physics offers deep insights into the workings of the universe but those insights come in the form of equations that often look like gobbledygook. Sean Carroll shows that they are really like meaningful poems that can help us fly over sierras to discover a miraculous multidimensional landscape alive with radiant giants, warped space-time, and bewilderingly powerful forces. High school calculus is itself a centuries-old marvel as worthy of our gaze as the Mona Lisa. And it may come as a surprise the extent to which all our most cutting-edge ideas about black holes are built on the math calculus enables. No one else could so smoothly guide readers to grasping the very equation Einstein used to describe his theory of general relativity. In the tradition of the legendary Richard Feynman lectures presented sixty years ago, this book is an inspiring, dazzling introduction to a way of seeing that will resonate across cultural and generational boundaries for many years to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3bFVEAAAQBAJ&dq=Time+and+the+Universe+(Whats+the+Big+Idea)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Office 97: Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access, Outlook (Quick Reference Guide)","description":"The essentials of Microsoft Office 97 are at your fingertips with this complete Microsoft Office 97 Professional Quick Reference.

In Freud's view, the family romance was a way for individuals to fantasize about their place in the social order. Hunt uses the term more broadly, to describe the images of the familial order underlying revolutionary politics. She investigates the narratives of family relations that structured the collective political unconscious. Most Europeans in the eighteenth century thought of their rulers as fathers and of their nations as families writ large. The French Revolution violently disrupted that patriarchal model of authority and raised troubling questions about what was to replace it. The king and queen were executed after dramatic separate trials. Prosecutors in the trial of the queen accused her of exerting undue influence on the king and his ministers, engaging in sexual debauchery, and even committing incest with her eight-year-old son. Hunt focuses on the meaning of killing the king-father and the queen-mother and what these ritual sacrifices meant to the establishment of a new model of politics. In a wide-ranging account that uses novels, engravings, paintings, speeches, newspaper editorials, pornographic writing, and revolutionary legislation about the family, Hunt shows that politics were experienced through the grid of the family romance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JSpEn_SvVyAC&dq=The+Family+Romance+of+the+French+Revolution+(Centennial+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"'Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy 2002 Day-To-Day Calendar","description":"The Advocate is a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) monthly newsmagazine.

The story opens in 1906 in New Rochelle, New York, at the home of an affluent American family.

And almost magically, the line between fantasy and historical fact, between real and imaginary characters, disappears. Henry Ford, Emma Goldman, J. P.

I wanted to write this book because for the first time in my fifty-two years, everyone on the planet was going through the same thing at the same time. We were all feeling the same fear, heartsickness, worry, and sadness, but due to the nature of the virus, it was hard to connect. I connect through cooking, and I noticed that s what many others were doing as well. We took to the kitchen to share something of ourselves and cooking became the discipline, diversion, and devotion that got us through.  You may think you know Rachael Ray after decades of TV appearances and dozens of books, but 2020 changed us all and it changed her, too her life and her direction. During the early months of the pandemic in upstate New York, far away from her New York City television studio, Rachael Ray and her husband, John, went to work in their home kitchen hosting the only cooking show on broadcast TV. At her kitchen counter, with the help of her iPhone cameraman (John), Rachael produced more than 125 meals everything from humble dishes composed of simple pantry items (One-Pot Chickpea Pasta or Stupid Good, Silly Easy Sausage Tray Bake) to more complex recipes that satisfy a craving or celebrate a moment (Porcini and Greens Risotto or Moroccan Chicken Tagine).

Gustave Niebaum's Inglenook Estate, started in 1879, was one of the Napa Valley's first established vineyards and the birthplace of its premium wine industry. Generations after Niebaum's death, the vineyard was sold to Heublein, the wine and spirits monolith, who broke up the land and changed the Inglenook brand from a premium, connoisseur wine to a mass-market jug wine. In 1975, Francis Coppola bought the Niebaum residence and the surrounding estate. Along with the original estate's reputation, he also brought back some of its original workers, including Rafael Rodriquez, who, in h is late seventies, now serves as the vineyard manager and historian. Coppola overcame naysayers, red tape, and financial turmoil to reestablish the winery as a defender of quality, producing wine under four different labels, including the revered wine Rubicon.

In viaggio focuses on and recycles seven major communicative functions, the punti chiave, throughout this Intermediate-level Italian textbook: describing, comparing, reacting and recommending, narrating in the past, expressing likes and dislikes, hypothesizing, and talking about the future. What is unique about this approach and these materials is the idea of narrowing the focus of instruction to seven communicative functions, all of which appear in every chapter from the very first day of the course. The functions are moved to the forefront of the course so students are consciously forced to look at grammar in a different way.

But, unknown even to Toromon's desperate leaders, was the fact that behind the berserk computer lurked the unearthly mind of a real enemy - a foe from the most distant realm of space, intent on making the Earth the first victim of galactic conquest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9LSkmu62YHEC&dq=City+of+a+thousand+suns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Republican: A Biography of Robert A.

The seven meditation manuals included here are some of the greatest treasures of the Zen tradition.   The Treatise on the Supreme Vehicle is attributed to Hongren (602675), who is known as the Fifth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism in China. The method taught in this manual is basic and quintessential in theory and practice, setting the stage for the texts that follow.   Models for Sitting Meditation was composed by Chan Buddhist Master Cijiao of Changlu in late eleventh-century China. Little is known of Cijiao, except that he was not only a master of the powerful Linji school of Chan Buddhism but also a patriarch of popular Pure Land Buddhism. The combination of Chan and Pure Land Buddhism, especially in the domain of concentration technique, is commonly found in the records of early meditation schools of China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, and Vietnam.   Guidelines for Sitting Meditation was written by Foxin Bencai, a younger contemporary of Cijiao. The instructions of Foxin and Cijiao, both quite brief, address problems of deterioration in the quality of meditation practices and prescribe simple remedies to counteract confusion and misalignment in order to foster the proper state of mind.   One of the main concerns of Dogen s teaching activity was to alert people to the shortcomings and dangers of incomplete Zen meditation and partial Zen experience. In A Generally Recommended Mode of Sitting Meditation, one of Dogen s first written works, reflects this concern and outlines an approach to its resolution.   Secrets of Cultivating the Mind was composed by Chinul (11581210), founder of the Chogye order of Korean Buddhism. Ordained as a monk at the age of eight, Chinul had no teacher. His first awakening occurred as he read a Chan Buddhist classic when he was twenty-five years old. After that, Chinul went into seclusion in the mountains. Later he perused the whole Buddhist canon and went back into solitude in a mountain fastness. During this period, Chinul experienced another awakening while reading the letters of one of the great Chinese masters. Based on classical teachings, Chinul s Secrets of Cultivating the Mind is a highly accessible primer of basic Buddhist meditation, defining and contrasting the principles and methods of sudden and gradual enlightenment.   An Elementary Talk on Zen is attributed to Man-an, an old adept of a Soto school of Zen who is believed to have lived in the early seventeenth century. Man-an s work is very accessible and extremely interesting for the range of its content. In particular, it reflects a modern trend toward emphasis on meditation in action, which can be seen in China particularly from the eleventh century, in Korea from the twelfth century, and in Japan from the fourteenth century.   Also included in this collection is Absorption in the Treasury of Light, written by Dogen s main student, Ejo (11981282). Born into an ancient noble family, Ejo became a Buddhist monk at the age of eighteen. Reflecting Ejo s background in the esoteric branch of Tendai Buddhism as well as his classical Zen studies, this work shows how to focus on the so-called Dharmakaya, or Reality Body teaching of Buddhism, underlying a wide variety of symbolic expressions. This type of meditation, using scriptural extracts, poetry, and Zen koans (teaching stories) to register a specific level of consciousness, is called sanzen. There is a great deal of Zen literature deriving from centuries of sanzen, among which Ejo s Absorption in the Treasury of Light represents a very unusual blend of complexity and simplicity, depth and accessibility.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dk-eZLd3VOIC&dq=Minding+Mind:+A+Course+in+Basic+Meditation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Virtue and Magnificence: Art of the Italian Renaissance (Abrams Perspectives)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Pnume - Planet of Adventure #4","description":"Together for the first time in one omnibus edition--City of the Chasch, Servants of the Wankh, The Dirdir, and The Pnume.

Why, then, in this era of intense globalization, has there been a proliferation of violence, of ethnic cleansing on the one hand and extreme forms of political violence against civilian populations on the other? Fear of Small Numbers is Arjun Appadurai s answer to that question. A leading theorist of globalization, Appadurai turns his attention to the complex dynamics fueling large-scale, culturally motivated violence, from the genocides that racked Eastern Europe, Rwanda, and India in the early 1990s to the contemporary  war on terror.  Providing a conceptually innovative framework for understanding sources of global violence, he describes how the nation-state has grown ambivalent about minorities at the same time that minorities, because of global communication technologies and migration flows, increasingly see themselves as parts of powerful global majorities. By exacerbating the inequalities produced by globalization, the volatile, slippery relationship between majorities and minorities foments the desire to eradicate cultural difference. Appadurai analyzes the darker side of globalization: suicide bombings; anti-Americanism; the surplus of rage manifest in televised beheadings; the clash of global ideologies; and the difficulties that flexible, cellular organizations such as Al-Qaeda present to centralized,  vertebrate  structures such as national governments. Powerful, provocative, and timely, Fear of Small Numbers is a thoughtful invitation to rethink what violence is in an age of globalization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QGiTnirfw-kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imposter (The Last Gunfighter)","description":"THE GREATEST WESTERN WRITERS OF THE 21ST CENTURY The New York Times bestselling author William W.

The categories named in the subtitle encompass knights, nobles, rulers, clerics, fictional characters, literary works, chansons de geste, castles, battles, treaties, legal terms, and the authors whose works historical and fictional have transmitted the medieval heritage to later ages. Largely confining his scope to Anglo-Norman chivalry and politics, Broughton describes and analyzes the roles people, events, and places played in a colorful and bloody age. Within articles cross-references to other entries in this volume and the Concepts and Terms volume are nearly as thick as the rain of arrows from battlements during battle. This thorough cross-referencing is especially helpful to the casual reader who approaches these books without a background knowledge of knighthood and its social, political, and military dimensions. Together these two dictionaries offer modern readers the means to understand the medieval world. Wilson Library Bulletin This work, a companion volume to the Dictionary of Medieval Knighthood and Chivalry: Concepts and Terms (Greenwood Press, 1986), is designed to help the uninitiated reader understand more easily the development and growth of chivalry and knighthood in the medieval age. Focusing primarily on people, places, and events in France and England, Broughton provides a brief biography of major historical knights and other personages of note, descriptions of important literary knightly characters and the works in which they appear, identification of castles and other places of geographical interest, and accounts of major battles during the period 1050-1400. The entries are all arranged alphabetically, and virtually all include a reference to the primary scholarly works on the subject. Frequent cross references are made to the Concepts and Terms volume and to related entries in the present volume, enabling the researcher to find materials of interest easily. Broad in scope, the dictionary covers issues ranging from the Battle of Hastings, which brought the concept of knighthood to England in 1066, to the battle of Crecy (1346) and Poiters (1356) and the legendary Knights of King Arthur's Round Table. A significant contribution to the study of medieval history and literature, this volume will be an indispensable aid to students pursuing research in this area.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H1RmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+Medieval+Knighthood+and+Chivalry:+Concepts+and+Terms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dying Well: A Lady Margaret Priam Mystery (Lady Margaret Priam Mysteries)","description":"It's Dr. Dale Reeve's fiftieth birthday party, but Lady Margaret Priam is uneasy because the guest list includes Dr. Reeve's mistress, his wife, her lover, and the couple's spoiled children.

Also going back a long way, each lives in history. These cities have their points in common, each wanting to rule the world and establiRome of the Caesars, Constantinople of the Emperors, and Moscow of the Tsars were also the Rome of St. Peter, the Constantinople of the Patriarchs, and the Moscow of the Orthodox Metropolitans. These were cities on earth that aspired to heaven, kingdoms that succeeded each other as standard-bearers of Christianity from the fourth century on. Indeed, the Russian monk declared to the Tsar: \\"Two Romes have fallen, but the third stands, and a fourth shall never besh the kingdom of heaven on earth. People, recognizing this, link them together as the Three Romes. These cities differ, though, in their understanding of man's nature and business. The Three Romes are three places and also states of mind. Now, with a new introduction which describes the contemporary significance to these cities this book will be assessable to the modern reader at all levels. This fascinating book weaves the past and present in a narrative that is sometimes harrowing, always vivid, and even, at times, amusing. Russell Fraser shows the reader each city as he himself saw it. He shuttles easily between today and yesterday, between today's Central Committee and Ivan the Great, between Turkish Istanbul and the golden Constantinople of Justinian, between today's Roman politics and the splendid Caesars. Great historical events, intellectual concerns, and artistic riches define the three Romes. Fraser goes beyond the faades, images, and myths to lay bare the three great psychologies still vying for the mind of man. The Three Romes is an utterly original book--a celebration of the past and an urbane guide to the present. Russell Fraser is Austin Warren Professor Emeritus of English Literature and Language, University of Michigan. Among his books are Moderns Worth Keeping and Shakespeare: A Life in Art, both available from Transaction, and Singing Masters, 1500 to the Present, and A Mingled Yarn: The Life of R. P.

In its place would be a more decentralized client/server model built upon the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) networking architecture. However, client/server never fully realized all of its promises, and OSI floundered. Now, instead of client/server and OSI, we have the Web-based model and TCP/IP. Together, Web-oriented technologies (i.e., browsers, web servers, HTML, Java) and TCP/IP are completely changing how the enterprise views its network. Instead of serving as primarily an internal utility, the enterprise network is now a vital means of delivering products and services and of tying an enterprise more closely to its customers, partners and suppliers. The impact to the very structure of the enterprise network could not be more profound. Providing extensive coverage of planning, networking, LANs, systems management, communications issues and trends, Communications Systems Management Handbook, 6th Edition is your most reliable source for solid, dependable solutions to real-world data communications problems. The tips, strategies, and case-studies provided do more than just save you time and money. They also save your data communications network, and with it your professional life. This new edition of the Communications Systems Management Handbook provides you with detailed information on the different facets of change in the enterprise network: Enterprise network architectures LAN and campus networking Remote access WAN Data centers Client and servers Security Network Management What's more, the New Edition is dramatically restructured, providing a more logical grouping of articles into discrete sections that bring focus to a particular enterprise networking topic. In addition, the content of this edition has been substantially updated. Almost three-quarters of the articles are new to this edition. The common theme throughout the handbook is the change that the enterprise network is undergoing and how to manage it. The handbook's generous use of illustrations simplifies the technical workings of networks and communications systems. The comprehensive index makes it easy to find the topics you want and related topics. And because each chapter is written by an expert with first-hand experience in data communications, no other book gives you such a full range of perspectives and explanations of the technical, planning, administrative, personnel, and budget challenges of the communication manager's job. Covering everything from electronic commerce to multimedia, from system design and cost allocation to Ethernet switches and the impact of virtual private networks, this is your one-stop source for the best, most essential data communications expertise to be found anywhere.

At the age of five, Ludlow Washington is given up by his parents to a brutal white-run state institution for blind African American children, where everyone is taught music--the only trade by which they are expected to make a living. Ludlow is a prodigy on the horn and at fifteen is \\"purchased\\" out of the Home by a bandleader in the fictive Southern town of New Marsails. By eighteen, he is married with a baby daughter, but as his reputation spreads, he seeks to grow musically, leaving his budding family for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in New York City. Navigating the worlds of music and race and women, Ludlow's career follows an arc towards collapse, a nervous breakdown, recovery, a long-delayed public recognition, only for him to finally abandon the spotlight and return to his roots and find solace in the black church. A Drop of Patience is a brilliant portrayal of a jazz musician. It stands apart as an exemplary parable of African American history, of racial politics, and of musical creative genius.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w5QFEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+drop+of+patience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quest for Gillian's Heart","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kPVCPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Quest+for+Gillian%27s+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rich Hall's Vanishing America/Audio Cassette/#20090","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QOcgAQAAMAAJ&dq=Rich+Hall%27s+Vanishing+America/Audio+Cassette/&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Privatizing Public Lands (Environmental Ethics & Science Policy)","description":"In the United States, private ownership of land is not a new idea, yet the federal government retains title to roughly a quarter of the nation's land, including national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. Managing these properties is expensive and contentious, and few management decisions escape criticism. Some observers, however, argue that such criticism is largely misdirected. The fundamental problem, in their view, is collective ownership and its solution is privatization. A free market, they claim, directs privately owned resources to their most productive uses, and privatizing public lands would create a free market in their services. This timely study critically examines these issues, arguing that there is no sense of \\"productivity\\" for which it is true that greater productivity is both desirable and a likely consequence of privatizing public lands or \\"marketizing\\" their management. Lehmann's discussion is self-contained, with background chapters on federal lands and management agencies, economics, and ethics, and will interest philosophers as well as public policy analysts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EjxGWRf2d9AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mutt Dog!","description":"Mutt dog!

'I've stirred the facts around too much,' he told Robert Fraser. 'It simply can't be done.' Eliot wrote of his 'genius'. Yeats thought him the most interesting poet of his generation. Dylan Thomas envied his power over women. War trapped him in Japan. In America he conducted one of the most celebrated love affairs of the century. He fathered fifteen children in several countries, three during one battle-torn summer. By the 1950s he was the toast of Soho. Barker was Catholic and bohemian, frank and elusive, tender and boisterous. In Eliot's phrase, he was 'a most peculiar fellow.' Robert Fraser's biography offers both a portrait of a talented, tormented and irresistibly entertaining man, and a broad cultural landscape. Around the central figure cluster painters like Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Johnny Minton and the 'Roberts' Colquhoun and MacBryde; writers such as Dylan Thomas, Walter de la Mare and Elizabeth Smart, whose By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept hymns their liaison; the lugubrious humorist Jeffrey Bernard.

Roosevelt transform an American nation in crisis. They were the junior officers of the New Deal. Thomas G. Corcoran, Benjamin V. Cohen, William O. Douglas, Abe Fortas, and James Rowe helped FDR build the modern Democratic Party into a progressive coalition whose command over power and ideas during the next three decades seemed politically invincible. This is the first book about this group of Rooseveltians and their linkage to Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and the Vietnam War debacle. Michael Janeway grew up inside this world. His father, Eliot Janeway, business editor of Time and a star writer for Fortune and Life magazines, was part of this circle, strategizing and practicing politics as well as reporting on these men. Drawing on his intimate knowledge of events and previously unavailable private letters and other documents, Janeway crafts a riveting account of the exercise of power during the New Deal and its aftermath. He shows how these men were at the nexus of reform impulses at the electoral level with reform thinking in the social sciences and the law and explains how this potent fusion helped build the contemporary American state. Since that time efforts to reinvent government by \\"brains trust\\" have largely failed in the U.S. In the last quarter of the twentieth century American politics ceased to function as a blend of broad coalition building and reform agenda setting, rooted in a consensus of belief in the efficacy of modern government. Can a progressive coalition of ideas and power come together again? The Fall of the House of Roosevelt makes such a prospect both alluring and daunting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G0usAgAAQBAJ&dq=Mammoths,+Sabertooths,+and+Hominids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whatever It Takes: Women on Women's Sport","description":"Looks at women's thoughts on and experiences in sports, focusing on the strength and participation to learn how to shape an athletic legacy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kBA4WvUxRiMC&dq=Whatever+It+Takes:+Women+on+Women%27s+Sport&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social Theory and Methodology: From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology (International Library of Sociology)","description":"First published in 2007.

Now Derek Wilson examines a set of relationships that more vividly illustrate just how dangerous life was in the court of the Tudor lion. He tells the interlocking stories of six men-all, curiously enough, called Thomas-whose ambitions and principles brought them face to face with violent death, as recorded in a simple mnemonic: 'Died, beheaded, beheaded, Self-slaughtered, burned, survived.' Thomas Wolsey was an accused traitor on his way to the block when a kinder death intervened. Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell, whose convictions and policies could scarcely have been more different, both perished beneath the headman's axe. Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, would have met the same end had the king's own death not brought him an eleventh hour reprieve. Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, and Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, though outliving the monarch, perished as a result of that war of ambitions and ideologies which rumbled on after 1547. Wriothesley succumbed to poison of either body or mind in the aftermath of a failed coup. Cranmer went to the stake as a heretic at the insistence of Mary Tudor, who was very much the daughter of the father she hated. In the Lion's Court is an illuminating examination of the careers of the six Thomases, whose lives are described in parallel-their family and social origins, their pathways to the royal Council chamber, their occupancy of the Siege Perilous, and the tragedies that, one by one, overwhelmed them. By showing how events shaped and were shaped by relationships and personal destinies, Derek Wilson offers a fresh approach to the political narrative of a tumultuous reign.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UPXIBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"47th Street Black: A Novel","description":"The prize-winning debut of an incendiary new voice in contemporary American fiction, 47th Street Black is the story of JC and Mookie, whose rise in the gangster-driven ghettos of Chicago is as swift as it is brutal. In the early sixties, 47th street is the heart of black Chicago, where recent migrants from the South come to move up in the world. JC and Mookie are high school dropouts, playing stickball in the street when they stumble upon the dead body of the area's black liaison to the mafia. Where others would run, Mookie sees opportunity, and in no time he and JC are working for Salvie, the local boss. Within a year, they are the most infamous figures on 47th Street, best friends and partners with flashy cars, clothes, and women. As they alternate telling their stories, the balance of power shifts: smooth, charismatic Mookie becomes the de facto leader and small, violent JC the enforcer roles that send JC to jail for a murder they commit together. In the 15 years he's away, JC gains an education and a resentment he can't control, while Mookie gains power over the entire South Side. By the time JC is paroled, both the neighborhood and the two men's lives are on an inexorable path to an explosive confrontation with simmering injustice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cJbQHpj6zWsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weird Science (Ripley's Believe It or Not!)","description":"Presents information from many branches of science and technology, and challenges readers with multiple choice and true-and-false questions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jc7IsCKWATgC&dq=Weird+Science+(Ripley%27s+Believe+It+or+Not!)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emissary of Light: My Adventures With the Secret Peacemakers","description":"Emissaries of Light is a secret society, said to have existed for thousands of years, and is dedicated to the eternal flame of peace and the banishment of fear and mistrust from the world.

If, unlike their counterparts in physics, biologists are generally wary of a grand, overarching theory, at what kinds of explanation do biologists aim? How will we know when we have made sense of life? Such questions, Evelyn Fox Keller suggests, offer no simple answers. Explanations in the biological sciences are typically provisional and partial, judged by criteria as heterogeneous as their subject matter. It is Keller's aim in this bold and challenging book to account for this epistemological diversity--particularly in the discipline of developmental biology. In particular, Keller asks, what counts as an explanation of biological development in individual organisms? Her inquiry ranges from physical and mathematical models to more familiar explanatory metaphors to the dramatic contributions of recent technological developments, especially in imaging, recombinant DNA, and computer modeling and simulations. A history of the diverse and changing nature of biological explanation in a particularly charged field, Making Sense of Life draws our attention to the temporal, disciplinary, and cultural components of what biologists mean, and what they understand, when they propose to explain life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h5azikQF1h0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rule of the Bone: A Novel","description":"When we first meet him, Chappie is a punked-out teenager living with his mother and abusive stepfather in an upstate New York trailer park.

For them, the inherent drive to cross-dress is often more powerful than sexual drive itself. This phenomenon has often been confronted with both ignorance and prejudice. Transvestites have been subjected not only to discrimination but also to criminal prosecution for following what, for them, was an inborn inclination. Dr. Hirschfeld created this book to establish a body of knowledge about an often misunderstood topic and to strip away long held prejudices. This classic gender study, first published in Germany in 1910 and newly translated, explores all aspects of transvestism: social, physical and emotional. Transvestism is a firmly rooted psychological phenomenon and cultural tradition, in spite of religious, legal and social sanctions. Written 80 years ago, this book was and still is the most comprehensive treatise on the subject of transvestism, illustrating that while styles have changed, the enthusiasm of devotees has not. Part I introduces transvestites with sympathetic, often amusing case histories, defines symptoms, and explains their basic, erotic character. Part II explores the forceful drive to cross-dress and examines clothing as a form of expression of personality. Part III addresses the historical, legal, anthropological, and social aspects of transvestism, and includes fascinating chapters on transvestism as it relates to the Bible, law and criminality, and women in the military. This book conclusively demonstrates that transvestism is a natural extension of the infinite variations of human personality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fffZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Transvestites&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gettysburg 1863: Campaign of Endless Echoes","description":"Examines this pivotal battle from the marshalling of Confederate forces in Virginia to the doomed final charge on Cemetery Ridge, and explores the contributions of the ordinary men and women who played their own part in the battle","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AMV2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Gettysburg+1863:+Campaign+of+Endless+Echoes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Merry Hall;","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eighty Years And More: Reminiscences 1815-1897 (Women's Studies)","description":"This vivid autobiography by one of the leaders in the fight for woman suffrage is a stirring depiction of the early struggles of American women toward equality. The new introduction and afterword written for the revised edition interpret Elizabeth Cady Stanton's positions and strategies for today's readers, detail the significance of the autobiography and situate it within the body of Stanton's writings and activities, bring current scholarship to the appraisal of her importance, and reflect on the last part of her life. Elizabeth Cady Stanton writes about her life from childhood into her eighties. She recalls the discontent that led her to launch the woman suffrage movement at Seneca Falls in 1848 and the frustration of still having no voice in her own government after a half century of hard work. In lively and opinionated prose, Stanton conveys all the passion that made her a guiding force in the women's movement. She provides an affectionate picture of her friend and political partner, Susan B. Anthony, and other leaders in the abolitionist and woman suffrage movements. She describes the immeasurable pleasure of winning converts to her cause and the satisfaction of silencing opponents through the force of her argument. Sometimes humorous, sometimes touching, filled with resolve throughout, Eighty Years and More is a compelling portrait of this remarkable leader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jAu9wAEACAAJ&dq=Eighty+Years+And+More:+Reminiscences+1815-1897+(Women%27s+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ELEMENTS OF NEWTONIAN MECHANICS.","description":"In the third edition a number of minor misprints that appeared in the second edition have have been corrected.

Here is a compelling book that provides you with a thorough examination of how HIV/AIDS is characterized and portrayed in film and how this portrayal affects American culture. The AIDS Movie: Representing a Pandemic in Film and Television uncovers the primary ways that films about HIV/AIDS influence American ideology and contribute to society's view of the disease. In The AIDS Movie, professors and scholars in the areas of popular culture, film, sociology, and gay and lesbian studies will discover cross-cultural approaches that can be used to analyze the representation of AIDS in American films made in the first two decades of the pandemic. Giving you insight into the production and circulation of social meanings pertaining to HIV/AIDS, this study explores the social ramifications of such representations for gay men in American society, as well as for the rest of the population. Interesting and informative, The AIDS Movie: Representing a Pandemic in Film and Television examines the ways that AIDS has been represented in American movies over the past two decades, defines and proposes criteria for identifying an  AIDS movie  and explores how these images shape social opinions about AIDS and gay men. The AIDS Movie discusses several character types such as  innocent victims  and  guilty villains  and the process of victim-blaming that occurs in AIDS movies. Defining an  AIDS movie  as a film with at least one character who either has been infected with HIV, has developed AIDS, or is grieving the recent death of a loved one from AIDS, this guide bases standards for these movies on several works, including: Chocolate Babies It's My Party Jeffrey The Living End Grief An Early Frost Men in Love A Place for Annie Philadelphia The Ryan White Story Gia Boys on the Side The AIDS Movie: Representing a Pandemic in Film and Television is compelling and insightful as it cleverly reveals how AIDS is portrayed in cinema and television, and how that portrayal affects American culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4cq3AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding History, and Other Essays","description":"Call number of original: B1649.R93U49.

Yet the past looms heavy over these quotidian activities: the canal was built by Gulag inmates at the height of Stalinism and thousands died in the process. In this wide-ranging book, Cynthia Ruder argues that the construction of the canal physically manifests Stalinist ideology and that the vertical, horizontal, underwater, ideological, artistic and metaphorical spaces created by it resonate with the desire of the state to dominate all space within and outside the Soviet Union. Ruder draws on theoretical constructs from cultural geography and spatial studies to interpret and contextualise a variety of structural and cultural products dedicated to, and in praise of, this signature Stalinist construction project. Approached through an extensive range of archival sources, personal interviews and contemporary documentary materials these include a diverse body of artefacts - from waterways, structures, paintings, sculptures, literary and documentary works, and the Gulag itself. Building Stalinism concludes by analysing current efforts to reclaim the legacy of the canal as a memorial space that ensures that those who suffered and died building it are remembered. This is essential reading for all scholars working on the all-pervasive nature of Stalinism and its complex afterlife in Russia today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xxOJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blair's Nightmare","description":"The Stanley kids and their stepsister try to keep secret a dog that Blair finds, keep David out of the clutches of the school bully, and find out if some escaped convicts really are nearby.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=txJQBAAAQBAJ&dq=Blair%27s+Nightmare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Start Your Own Car Wash","description":"Start generating cash by the carload!

Decisions made during the early conceptual stages of design have a great effect on subsequent stages. In fact, quite often more than 70% of the manufacturing cost of a product is determined at this conceptual stage, yet manufacturing is not involved. Through this book, designers will gain insight that will allow them to assess the impact of their proposed design on manufacturing difficulty. The vast majority of components found in commercial batch-manufactured products, such as appliances, computers and office automation equipment are either injection molded, stamped, die cast, or (occasionally) forged. This book emphasizes these particular, most commonly implemented processes. In addition to chapters on these processes, the book touches upon material process selection, general guidelines for determining whether several components should be combined into a single component or not, communications, the physical and mechanical properties of materials, tolerances, and inspection and quality control. In developing the DFM methods presented in this book, he has worked with over 30 firms specializing in injection molding, die-casting, forging and stamping.

It draws a sharp contrast between occupation policies in Odessa and Transnistria, under Romanian administration, and those of Nazi-occupied areas of the Soviet Union. Originally prepared as a Rand Corporation report, it is essential reading for anyone interested in the occupation of Soviet territory during World War II and its consequences. Alexander Dallin provides a detailed study of the Romanian administration in Transnistria, illustrating important aspects of the development of this Soviet territory after the removal of the Communist system. Dallin argues that \\"The relative success of the Romanians (in contrast to German-held areas of the USSR) supports the thesis that the specific nature of the occupation policy and behavior mattered a good deal in determining the response of the subject population.\\" He adds that \\"the Transnistrian experiment rapidly gained popular confidence through higher living standards and an atmosphere of greater relaxation. The absence of terror and forced labor, and greater opportunities for self-expression, both economic and cultural, go far to explain the overwhelming popular preference for Romanian over German rule.\\" A noted expert in Soviet history, Alexander Dallin (1924-2000) was a former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies and professor emeritus of international history and political science at Stanford University in California. His other books include German Rule in Russia, 1941-1945. The book includes an introduction by Larry L. Watts, an American specialist on the history of Romania during World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4P5oAAAAMAAJ&dq=Odessa,+1941-1944:+A+Case+Study+of+Soviet+Territory+Under+Foreign+Rule&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Pray for Spiritual Growth: A Practical Handbook of Inner Healing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wKBEWEDkc7cC&dq=How+to+Pray+for+Spiritual+Growth:+A+Practical+Handbook+of+Inner+Healing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arizona golf guide (TeeBox comprehensive golf course guides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gEo7cAAACAAJ&dq=Arizona+golf+guide+(TeeBox+comprehensive+golf+course+guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PILGRIM HEART: THE INNER JOURNEY HOME","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An author's guide to children's book promotion","description":"Writing for kids can be fun and rewarding-- if you can break into the competitive world of children's book publishing.

What he knows is that in his whole life nothing has touched him so deeply as the novels of Marshall France, a reclusive author of fabulous children's tales who died at forty-four. Now Thomas and Saxony have come to France's hometown, the dreamy Midwestern town of Galen, Missouri, to write France's biography. Warned in advance that France's family may oppose them, they're surprised to find France's daughter warmly welcoming instead.

The title \\"Quo Vadis\\" is translated from Latin as \\"Where are you going?\\" The quote is a reference to the New Testament verse John 13:36, which states \\"Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.\\" Sienkiewicz exhaustively researched the Roman Empire and the result is an incredibly detailed and believable story. The novel is one of contrasts: the violence of ancient Rome and its gladiators contrasted with the sweet and touching love story between Marcus and Lygia, and the contrast between the piety, poverty, and spirituality of the early Christians with the decadence and waste of Nero and his court. \\"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero\\" is a captivating and timeless tale of love and devotion amid violence and ruin.

This third edition of Bryan A. Garner's modern classic delivers the same invaluable guidelines with even more supporting evidence. Covering everything from the rules for planning and organizing a brief to openers that can capture a judge's attention from the first few words, these tips add up to the most compelling, orderly, and visually appealing brief that an advocate can present. In Garner's view, good writing is good thinking put to paper. \\"Never write a sentence that you couldn't easily speak,\\" he warns - and demonstrates how to do just that. Every tip begins with a set of quotable quotes from experts, followed by Garner's masterly advice on building sound paragraphs, drafting crisp sentences, choosing the best words (\\"Strike pursuant to from your vocabulary.\\"), quoting authority, citing sources, and designing a document that looks as impressive as it reads. Throughout, Garner shows how to edit for maximal impact, using vivid before-and-after examples that apply the basics of rhetoric to persuasive writing. In this much-expanded third edition, Garner has perfected the text with nine new tips, hundreds of new examples, and amplified explanations throughout-all in his trademark style. Among the new sections are tips on understanding judges' reading habits, answering opponents' arguments, writing effective reply briefs, using authorities persuasively, and organizing arguments based on statutes and contracts. Quotable quotes, which Garner carefully assembled after years of wide reading and close study, have been expanded and improved throughout the book. There is also a new appendix on a remarkable brief that some consider the best ever written (\\"a beautiful marriage of rhetorical skill, thorough research, and humane lawyering\\"). Perhaps the biggest change to this edition is that every tip now ends with a summary checklist that recaps and crystalizes the subpoints just covered, with further ideas for improvement. Garner conceived these checklists in part as a way to help readers approach his book as a set of 100 tutorials. Reviewing and practicing each tip will offer brief-writers a degree of mastery that more cavalier colleagues will find difficult to equal. An invaluable resource for attorneys, law clerks, judges, paralegals, law students and their teachers, The Winning Brief has the qualities that make all of Garner's books so popular: authority, accessibility, and page after page of techniques that work. If you're writing to win a case, this book shouldn't merely be on your shelf--it should be open on your desk.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tfA1nwEACAAJ&dq=The+Winning+Brief:+100+Tips+for+Persuasive+Briefing+in+Trial+and+Appellate+Court&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White columns in Georgia","description":"Relates interesting facts and incidents associated with historic antebellum Georgia houses, many of which are portrayed in photographs","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VkoTAAAAYAAJ&dq=White+columns+in+Georgia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Build Plastic Aircraft Models","description":"H?ndbog og vejledning i bygning af modelfly i plastic","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zvKOXhGGiTEC&dq=How+to+Build+Plastic+Aircraft+Models&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fab British Rock 'N' Roll Invasion of 1964","description":"Traces the development of rock music in England, looks at its roots in American blues and rock music, and offers profiles of the early British singers, musicians, and groups","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wgzwHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Fab+British+Rock+%27N%27+Roll+Invasion+of+1964&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. John Feet, Fins and Four Wheel Drive","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qjriAAAACAAJ&dq=St.+John+Feet,+Fins+and+Four+Wheel+Drive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watching the Tree: A Chinese Daughter Reflects on Happiness, Tradition and Spritual Wisdom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1Ib_zgEACAAJ&dq=Watching+the+Tree:+A+Chinese+Daughter+Reflects+on+Happiness,+Tradition+and+Spritual+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Donkeys (Animal World)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_LKGAAAACAAJ&dq=Donkeys+(Animal+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Language of Landscape","description":"This eloquent and powerful book combines poetry and pragmatism to teach the language of landscape. Anne Whiston Spirn, author of the award-winning The Granite Garden: Urban Nature and Human Design, argues that the language of landscape exists with its own syntax, grammar, and metaphors, and that we imperil ourselves by failing to learn to read and speak this language. To understand the meanings of landscape, our habitat, is to see the world differently and to enable ourselves to avoid profound aesthetic and environmental mistakes. Offering examples that range across thousands of years and five continents, Spirn examines urban, rural, and natural landscapes. She discusses the thought of renowned landscape authors--Thomas Jefferson, Frank Lloyd Wright, Frederick Law Olmsted, Lawrence Halprin--and of less well known pioneers, including Australian architect Glenn Murcutt and Danish landscape artist C. Th. S?rensen. She discusses instances of great landscape designers using landscape fluently, masterfully, and sometimes cynically. And, in a probing analysis of the many meanings of landscape, Spirn shows how one person's ideal landscape may be another's nightmare, how Utopian landscapes can be dark. There is danger when we lose the connection between a place and our understanding of it, Spirn warns, and she calls for change in the way we shape our environment, based on the notions of nature as a set of ideas and landscape as the expression of action and ideas in place.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pRyh6iVkWj8C&dq=The+Language+of+Landscape&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The End of the Trail: Western Stories (The Works of Robert E.

Robbins awakened a generation to the drama, tragedy, and heroism of some of history s greatest battles. Now he delivers a gripping and authentic story set against one of our greatest wartime achievements: the Red Ball Express, six thousand trucks and twenty-three thousand menmost of them African-Americanwho forged a lifeline of supplies in the Allied struggle to liberate France. June 1944. The Allies deliver a staggering blow to Hitler s Atlantic fortress, leaving the beaches and bluffs of Normandy strewn with corpses. The Germans have only one chance to stop the immense invasionby bottling up the Americans on the Cotentin Peninsula. There, in fields crisscrossed with dense hedgerows, many will meet their death while others will search for signs of life. Among the latter are two very different men, each with his own demons to fight and his own reasons to risk his life for his fellow man. Joe Amos Biggs is an invisible  colored  driver in the Red Ball Express, the unheralded convoy of trucks that serves as a precious lifeline to the front. Delivering fuel and ammunition to men whose survival depends on the truckers, Joe Amos finds himself hungering to make his mark and propelled into battle among those who don t see him as an equalbut will need him to be a hero. A chaplain in the demoralized 90th Infantry, Rabbi Ben Kahn is a veteran of the first great war and old enough to be the father of the GIs he tends.

Correspondents include librettists Ronald Duncan (The Rape of Lucretia), Eric Crozier (Albert Herring, Saint Nicolas, The Little Sweep) and E. M. Forster (Billy Budd); conductor Ernest Ansermet and composer Lennox Berkeley; publishers Ralph Hawkes and Erwin Stein of Boosey & Hawkes; and the celebrated tenor Peter Pears, Britten's partner. Among friends in the United States are Christopher Isherwood, Elizabeth Mayer and Aaron Copland, and there is a significant meeting with Igor Stravinsky. This often startling and innovative period is vividly evoked by the comprehensive and scholarly annotations, which offer a wide range of detailed information fascinating for both the Britten specialist and the general reader. Donald Mitchell contributes a challenging introduction exploring the interaction of life and work in Britten's creativity, and an essay examining for the first time, through their correspondence, the complex relationship between the composer and the writer Edward Sackville-West.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=22OPd1_ISNsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The white Cad cross-up","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UxQdGQAACAAJ&dq=The+white+Cad+cross-up&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare New Evid Pap","description":"The New Oxford Shakespeare is a landmark print and online project, which for the first time provides fully edited and annotated texts of all extant versions of all Shakespeare's works, including collaborations, revisions, and adaptations. Based on a fresh examination of the surviving original documents, it draws upon the latest interdisciplinary scholarship, supplemented by new research undertaken by a diverse international team. Although closely connected and systematically cross-referenced, each part can be used independently of the others. The New Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works: Critical Reference Edition collects the same versions of the same works found in the Modern Critical Edition, keyed to the same line-numbering. But the Critical Reference Edition emphasizes book history and the documentary origins of each text. It preserves the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, abbreviations, typographical contrasts, ambiguities, and inconsistencies of the early documents. Introductions focus on early modern manuscript and print culture, setting each text within the material circumstances of its production, transmission, and early reception. The works are arranged in the chronological order of the surviving texts: the first volume covers documents manufactured in Shakespeare's lifetime, and the second covers documents made between 1622 and 1728. The illustrated general introduction presents an overview of the texts available to editors and describes how they define Shakespeare. An essay on error surveys kinds of error characteristic of these early text technologies. It is followed by a general introduction to the music of Shakespeare's plays. Introductions to individual works and an extensive foot-of-the-page textual apparatus record and discuss editorial corrections of scribal and printing errors in the early documents; marginal notes record press variants and key variants in different documents. Original music notation is provided for the songs (where available). Because the plays were written and copied within the framework of theatrical requirements, casting charts identify the length and type of each role, discuss potential doubling possibilities, and note essential props. The New Oxford Shakespeare consists of four interconnected publications: the Modern Critical Edition (with modern spelling), the Critical Reference Edition (with original spelling), a companion volume on Authorship, and an online version integrating all of this material on OUP's high-powered scholarly editions platform. Together, they provide the perfect resource for the future of Shakespeare studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2_VQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bible Studies Life Excellence","description":"There is no other book like the book of James in the entire Bible.

Her father, who fled political terror in in his youth, is frail and often dreaming. So it falls to Elise's older sister, who has never left home, to maintain family order. Unraveled by alcohol and her own longing for escape, \\"Aunt,\\" as Elise's sister is simply known, is further disturbed by the child's illness and his mother's irresponsibility.

It shows systems analysts and designers how use cases can provide solutions to the most challenging requirements issues, resulting in effective, quality systems that meet the needs of users. Use Cases, Second Edition: Requirements in Context describes a three-step method for establishing requirements an iterative process that produces increasingly refined requirements. Drawing on their extensive, real-world experience, the authors offer a wealth of advice on use-case driven lifecycles, planning for change, and keeping on track. In addition, they include numerous detailed examples to illustrate practical applications. This second edition incorporates the many advancements in use case methodology that have occurred over the past few years. Specifically, this new edition features major changes to the methodology's iterations, and the section on management reflects the faster-paced, more \\"chaordic\\" software lifecycles prominent today. In addition, the authors have included a new chapter on use case traceability issues and have revised the appendixes to show more clearly how use cases evolve. The book opens with a brief introduction to use cases and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). It explains how use cases reduce the incidence of duplicate and inconsistent requirements, and how they facilitate the documentation process and communication among stakeholders. The book shows you how to: Describe the context of relationships and interactions between actors and applications using use case diagrams and scenarios Specify functional and nonfunctional requirements Create the candidate use case list Break out detailed use cases and add detail to use case diagrams Add triggers, preconditions, basic course of events, and exceptions to use cases Manage the iterative/incremental use case driven project lifecycle Trace back to use cases, nonfunctionals, and business rules Avoid classic mistakes and pitfalls The book also highlights numerous currently available tools, including use case name filters, the context matrix, user interface requirements, and the authors' own \\"hierarchy killer.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQ-QmAnu0HUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great ideas from the great books (A Washington Square Press book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oYyJAQAACAAJ&dq=Great+ideas+from+the+great+books+(A+Washington+Square+Press+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theological Lexicon of the New Testament (3 Volume Set)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jAB8vQEACAAJ&dq=Theological+Lexicon+of+the+New+Testament+(3+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Campo Indian Landfill War: The Fight for Gold in California's Garbage","description":"The Campo Indian Landfill War explores the timely and controversial topic of \\"environmental justice\\" through the story of an Indian tribe's struggle to develop its isolated and impoverished reservation by building a commercial garbage facility to serve the cities of Southern California. The environmental justice movement was born out of the conviction that the waste industry has targeted minority communities for facilities it can no longer locate in the backyards of those with greater access to political power. The Campo case is therefore an anomaly: The tribe is unified in supporting the landfill, while the project is opposed by their mostly white neighbors out of concern that it could contaminate the aquifer that is the sole source of drinking water for 400 square miles, and thereby render the entire region uninhabitable. The environmental justice community, including many Indians, charges that the waste industry is trying to exploit the poverty of the Campos and other tribes, making them offers they can't refuse for projects no one else wants, projects no one should want. The Campos admit the danger of exploitation, but contend that it is paternalistic - indeed racist - to assume that Indians are not smart enough to protect themselves in dealings with whites or wise enough to guard their reservation environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eUXzvQypQG8C&dq=The+Campo+Indian+Landfill+War:+The+Fight+for+Gold+in+California%27s+Garbage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emanuel Law Outlines: Criminal Law","description":"The most trusted name in law school outlines, Emanuel Law Outlines were developed while Steve Emanuel was a student at Harvard Law and were the first to approach each course from the point of view of the student.

(IMF working paper)","description":"Although a centerpiece of the reform process in Central and Eastern Europe, large-scale privatization cannot be undertaken all at once and policymakers inevitably face the choice of privatizing some sectors before others, This paper analyzes the allocative efficiency implications of alternate sequences of privatization in a reforming planned economy with two sectors--an input-producing upstream sector and a final goods-producing downstream sector. The model focuses on the link, through a market for intermediate inputs, between the two sectors. The impact of exogenous shocks to the two sectors are highlighted to show how the inflexibility of public firms in responding to shocks constrains the production response of private firms operating in perfectly as well as imperfectly competitive markets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g8zrzgEACAAJ&dq=Does+sequencing+of+privatization+matter+in+reforming+planned+economies%3F+(IMF+working+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Beagle (Essential (Howell))","description":"Owning a Beagle is rewarding and fun!

The paper develops an integrated accounting framework for the measurement of implicit and explicit taxes on the banking system and applies that framework to the Italian experience during the 1980s. Pointing to a lack of transparency in the yield and incidence of the reserve requirement tax, the results reinforce the case for lowering the attendant burden on the Italian banking system. It is estimated that that burden could be halved at a cost to the budget of no more than 0.2 percent of GDP.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KnjrzgEACAAJ&dq=Reserve+requirements+on+bank+deposits+as+implicit+taxes:+A+case+study+of+Italy+(IMF+working+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transitions Southern Africa","description":"Why is societal transition not simply a matter of change management or normal policy design? South Africa is living proof of the ability of a society to reinvent and reinstall itself. With the advent of new societal challenges, came the need for real societal innovation, especially in sectors where it was never deemed necessary or possible before. This book asks: What type of governance is helpful for developing new societal institutions and systems that can overcome systemic crises in emerging economies and fragile communities? What emerges is a compilation of chapters that introduce different parts of a solution which can be used in developing both a growing body of practices of ?governed? societal transitions and the associated transition of governance. The Governance of Transitions ? The Transitions of Governance, in part, aims to provide building blocks which government and society could use to develop strategies for creating sustainable outcomes. It considers what kind of leadership, organisation or methods for accountability enable new types of governance and what the most important barriers are.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SyGADwAAQBAJ&dq=Transitions+Southern+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Program Development in Java: Abstraction, Specification, and Object-Oriented Design","description":"Written by a world-renowned expert on programming methodology, and the winner of the 2008 Turing Award, this book shows how to build production-quality programs--programs that are reliable, easy to maintain, and quick to modify. Its emphasis is on modular program construction: how to get the modules right and how to organize a program as a collection of modules. The book presents a methodology effective for either an individual programmer, who may be writing a small program or a single module in a larger one; or a software engineer, who may be part of a team developing a complex program comprised of many modules. Both audiences will acquire a solid foundation for object-oriented program design and component-based software development from this methodology. Because each module in a program corresponds to an abstraction, such as a collection of documents or a routine to search the collection for documents of interest, the book first explains the kinds of abstractions most useful to programmers: procedures; iteration abstractions; and, most critically, data abstractions. Indeed, the author treats data abstraction as the central paradigm in object-oriented program design and implementation. The author also shows, with numerous examples, how to develop informal specifications that define these abstractions--specifications that describe what the modules do--and then discusses how to implement the modules so that they do what they are supposed to do with acceptable performance. Other topics discussed include: Encapsulation and the need for an implementation to provide the behavior defined by the specification Tradeoffs between simplicity and performance Techniques to help readers of code understand and reason about it, focusing on such properties as rep invariants and abstraction functions Type hierarchy and its use in defining families of related data abstractions Debugging, testing, and requirements analysis Program design as a top-down, iterative process, and design patterns The Java programming language is used for the book's examples. However, the techniques presented are language independent, and an introduction to key Java concepts is included for programmers who may not be familiar with the language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I0xnnSTMyjwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touchpoints: The Essential Reference--Your Child's Emotional and Behavioral Development","description":"Based on over three decades of continuous practice and internationally recognized research, Touchpoints is the only childcare reference by a pediatrician who has both medical and psychoanalytic training, and who offers parents a complete understanding of child development from a physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral point of view.

Sheldon Annis addresses these questions from the perspective of San Antonio Aguas Calieutes, an Indian village in the highlands of midwestern Guatemala. Annis skillfully blends economic and cultural analysis to show why Protestantism has taken root. The key \\"character\\" in his drama is the village Indian's tiny plot of corn and beans, the milpa, which Annis analyzes as an \\"idea\\" as well as an agronomic productive system. By exploring \\"milpa logic,\\" Annis shows how the economic, environmental, and social shifts of the twentieth century have acted to undercut \\"the colonial creation of Indianness\\" and, in doing so, have laid the basis for new cultural identities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H352CgAAQBAJ&dq=God+and+Production+in+a+Guatemalan+Town+(Texas+Pan+American+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To the Baltic With Bob","description":"In the summer of 2002, two profoundly amateur sailors, Griff and Bob, set off in an elderly yacht for Russia, because, on the map, it looked easier than sailing to Cornwall. They took Baines with them, as he knew how to mend the engine. And this is their story. Over four long months of applied bickering in a vessel no bigger than a London taxi, they visited most of the geographically interesting restaurants on the Baltic seaboard. They sailed, over, and, even at one point, onto the mysterious heart of the Nordic world. They pushed themselves to the very limits of human endurance, before finally agreeing to wash their sleeping bags on a cool cycle at number six. To the Baltic with Bob is the full account of their stirring journey through the longest heat wave the frozen north has ever suffered; of three men in search of the answer to a troubling question: can you really outmanoeuvre a mid-life crisis by running away to sea?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x4C10G0H81UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aftermath;: A supplement to The golden bough,","description":"A supplement to Frazer's The Golden Bough, this 1936 work remains an important text for scholars of religion and anthropology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1X1sAAAAQBAJ&dq=Aftermath%3B:+A+supplement+to+The+golden+bough,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of Silence: An Autistic Boy's Journey into Language and Communication","description":"In a work of extraordinary luminosity, Russell Martin takes on the science of language, probing this most profound and complex of human traits in a spellbinding narrative about his once-outgoing nephew, Ian Drummond, trapped at a young age within a mute cage of wordlessness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=65ROPgAACAAJ&dq=Out+of+Silence:+An+Autistic+Boy%27s+Journey+into+Language+and+Communication&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laboratory Procedures for Veterinary Technicians, 4e","description":"Reinforce the essential information you need with the Laboratory Manual for Laboratory Procedures for Veterinary Technicians, 6th Edition.

A British secret agent pays the ultimate price to deliver early warning of the F hrer s secret plan to harness the awesome power of the occult to conquer Great Britain by launching a supernatural assault that no defending military force could possibly deflect. British Intelligence operative Col. John  Gray  Graham of MI6 is not only a valuable player in the great game of wartime espionage, he is also a practitioner of the ancient occult arts.

Along with her own rich experience as a pastor's wife, Lorna Dobson draws on the results of a survey she conducted with pastors' wives from all over the world. I'm More Than the Pastor's Wife opens a window on the lives of women who faithfully support their husbands' ministries 24 hours a day, yet have succeeded in nurturing a separate family and personal identity. 'Contentment,' says one woman who responded to the survey, 'comes in knowing struggle is normal.' Serious advice and common-sense good humor walk side by side in the responses of Dobson's peers: 'You will destroy yourself trying to please everyone.' 'Have fun being a minister's wife, enjoy being whom God made you.' But . . . 'Don't have a key to anything.' Whether put on a pedestal or trampled under foot, pastors' wives everywhere will be able to relate to the adventures and advice of these committed women. They will be encouraged in knowing they're not alone when it seems they are walking a narrow balance beam, managing their Christian commitment to serve and their personal commitment to themselves and their families.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_2jRJWjYIFEC&dq=I%27m+More+Than+the+Pastor%27s+Wife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Painting on Porcelain","description":"KPM Plaques: Gaining an Insight into the Art of Painting on Porcelain covers a broad variety of questions and concepts never-before addressed in any literature.

On the one hand individuals and groups have claimed access to assisted reproduction as a right, and some have also claimed that this access should be available free of charge. As well as clinically infertile heterosexual couples, this right has been claimed by single women, gay couples, post-menopausal women, and couples who wish to delay having children for various reasons. Others have argued that a desire to have children does not make it a human right, and, moreover, that there are some people who should not be assisted to become parents, on grounds of age, sexuality, or lifestyle. Mary Warnock steers a clear path through the web of complex issues underlying these views. She begins by analysing what it means to claim something as a 'right', and goes on to discuss the cases of different groups of people. She also examines the ethical problems faced by particular types of assisted reproduction, including artificial insemination, in-vitro fertilization, and surrogacy, and argues that in the future human cloning may well be a viable and acceptable form of treatment for some types of infertility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hsA39HX9u7cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Language of Flowers: Penhaligon's Scented Treasury of Verse and Prose","description":"Penhaligon's fourth and most exquisite gift volume focuses on the romance of flowers.

In these seemingly unlikely settings, American photographer Jayne Hinds Bidaut found the subjects for a compelling new body of work. In her words,  I watched the horrors and dramas of [the animals], of their lives within a container.  Her meditative, sometimes haunting photographs of  everybody in their prison  are at once beautiful works of art and powerful statements about the human ignorance and cruelty that causes us to treat animals as commodities. Bidaut s images of cats and dogs, lizards and snakes, birds, fish, and mice evoke in the viewer an amazing range of emotions, from wonder at the innocence of these small lives to anxiety and foreboding at their caged condition. They draw us into the unsuspected  horrors and dramas  of the familiar pet shop and, like all real art, compel us to experience the depths and ambiguities beneath the surface of everyday life. This volume presents some fifty photographs from Jayne Hinds Bidaut s  Animaleries  series. Accompanying the images is an essay by John Wood, who provides a critical appreciation of Bidaut s work. He establishes her connections to nineteenth-century photographers and naturalists, with whose work she shares affinities of both technique and subject matter. Wood describes why Bidaut chose to work in tintype and stereograph for her beautiful portraits of insects and Victorian-inspired nude studies. And he probes the nexus between art and political statement that gives the images in Animaleries both poetry and potency.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1y-6SQHeeS4C&dq=Animalerie+(Wittliff+Gallery+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Better Class of Murder (Lady Margaret Priam Mysteries)","description":"For the first time, the heroines of Joyce Christmas's two series -- Betty Trenka and Lady Margaret Priam -- join forces to solve murder Manhattan style.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fid6TXrUjTIC&dq=A+Better+Class+of+Murder+(Lady+Margaret+Priam+Mysteries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Practical Study of Argument","description":"A PRACTICAL STUDY OF ARGUMENT gives you the tools you need to understand informal logic and formulate a good argument.

Mart n examines the rise and fall of popular saints and saint-like figures in the borderlands of the United States and Mexico. Focusing specifically on Teresa Urrea (La Santa de Cabora), Pancho Villa, C sar Ch vez, Subcomandante Marcos, and Santa Muerte, she traces the intersections of these figures, their devotees, artistic representations, and dominant institutions with an eye for the ways in which such unofficial saints mirror traditional spiritual practices and serve specific cultural needs. Popular spirituality of this kind engages the use and exchange of relics, faith healing, pilgrimages, and spirit possession, exemplifying the contradictions between high and popular culture, human and divine, and secular and sacred. Mart n focuses upon a wide range of Mexican and Chicano/a cultural works drawn from the nineteenth century to the present, covering such diverse genres as the novel, the communiqu , drama, the essay or cr nica, film, and contemporary digital media. She argues that spiritual practice is often represented as narrative, while narrative whether literary, historical, visual, or oral may modify or even function as devotional practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PtYyAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Information Plus Gun Control May 2003 (Information Plus Reference: Gun Control)","description":"Americans have a deeply ambivalent relationship to guns. The United States leads all nations in rates of private gun ownership, yet stories of gun tragedies frequent the news, spurring calls for tighter gun regulations. The debate tends to be acrimonious and is frequently misinformed and illogical. The central question is the extent to which federal or state governments should regulate gun ownership and use in the interest of public safety. In this volume, David DeGrazia and Lester Hunt examine this policy question primarily from the standpoint of ethics: What would morally defensible gun policy in the United States look like? Hunt's contribution argues that the U.S. Constitution is right to frame the right to possess a firearm as a fundamental human right. The right to arms is in this way like the right to free speech. More precisely, it is like the right to own and possess a cell phone or an internet connection. A government that banned such weapons would be violating the right of citizens to protect themselves. This is a function that governments do not perform: warding off attacks is not the same thing as punishing perpetrators after an attack has happened. Self-protection is a function that citizens must carry out themselves, either by taking passive steps (such as better locks on one's doors) or active ones (such as acquiring a gun and learning to use it safely and effectively). DeGrazia's contribution features a discussion of the Supreme Court cases asserting a constitutional right to bear arms, an analysis of moral rights, and a critique of the strongest arguments for a moral right to private gun ownership. He follows with both a consequentialist case and a rights-based case for moderately extensive gun control, before discussing gun politics and advancing policy suggestions. In debating this important topic, the authors elevate the quality of discussion from the levels that usually prevail in the public arena. DeGrazia and Hunt work in the discipline of academic philosophy, which prizes intellectual honesty, respect for opposing views, command of relevant facts, and rigorous reasoning. They bring the advantages of philosophical analysis to this highly-charged issue in the service of illuminating the strongest possible cases for and against (relatively extensive) gun regulations and whatever common ground may exist between these positions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fAk1DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wellsprings of Life","description":"An outstanding guide to the book of Proverbs.

Their books and journals became the \\"gold standard\\" in many academic fields for tenure, promotion, and merit pay. Their basic business model was successful, since this diverse collection of presses had a unique value proposition. They dominated the scholarly publishing field with preeminent sales in three major markets or channels of distribution: libraries and institutions; college and graduate school adoptions; and general readers (i.e., sales to general retailers).Yet this insulated world changed abruptly in the late 1990s. What happened? This book contains a superb series of articles originally published in The Journal of Scholarly Publishing, by some of the best experts on scholarly communication in the western hemisphere, Europe, Asia, and Africa. These authors analyze in depth the diverse and exciting challenges and opportunities scholars, universities, and publishers face in what is a period of unusual turbulence in scholarly publishing.The topics given attention include: copyrights, the transformation of scholarly publishing from a print format to a digital one, open access, scholarly publishing in emerging nations, problems confronting journals, and information on how certain academic disciplines are coping with the transformation of scholarly publishing.

The book begins in colonial America as the first Europeans arrived, lured by the promise of financial profit, driven by religious piety and accompanied by diseases which would ravage the native populations. It explores the tensions inherent in a country built on slave labour in the name of liberty, one forced to assert its unity and reassess its ideals in the face of secession and civil war, and one that struggled to establish moral supremacy, military security and economic stability during the financial crises and global conflicts of the twentieth century. Woven through this richly crafted study of America's shifting social and political landscapes are the multiple voices of the nation's history: slaves and slave owners, revolutionaries and reformers, soldiers and statesmen, immigrants and refugees. These voices help define the United States at the dawn of a new century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7IOWeia8G5YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Beginning Was Information","description":"Information - it s one of the most fundamental parts of our world, yet we don t often think about it.

It is by no means a new ?eld of study and has actually been around, initially as quantitative physiology and partly as colloid science, for over a hundred years. For a long time, biophysics has been taught and practiced as a research discipline mostly in medical schools and life sciences departments, and excellent biophysics textbooks have been published that are targeted at a biologically literate audience. With a few exceptions, it is only relatively recently that biophysics has started to be recognized as a physical science and integrated into physics departments  curr- ula, sometimes under the new name of biological physics. In this period of cryst- lization and possible rede?nition of biophysics, there still exists some uncertainty as to what biophysics might actually represent. A particular tendency among phy- cists is to associate biophysics research with the development of powerful new te- niques that should eventually be used not by physicists to study physical processes in living matter, but by biologists in their biological investigations. There is value in that judgment, and excellent books have been published that introduce the int- ested reader to the use of physical principles for the development of new methods of investigation in life sciences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qr3KWd2hJWcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Game Developer's Marketplace","description":"CD-ROM contains: Searchable database of industry resources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=846ilPyTMvQC&dq=Game+Developer%27s+Marketplace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recent Advances in Polymer Chemical Physics","description":"The Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences has become one of the world's premiere centers for studies of polymeric materials; in use, during processing, and in harsh environments.

In 1862, recently widowed and with two small children to support, British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens agrees to serve as governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam (present-day Thailand), unaware that her years in the royal palace will change not only her own life, but also the future of a nation. Her relationship with King Mongkut, famously portrayed by Yul Brynner in the classic film The King and I, is complicated from the start, pitting two headstrong personalities against each other: While the king favors tradition, Anna embraces change. As governess, Anna often finds herself at cross-purposes, marveling at the foreign customs, fascinating people, and striking landscape of the kingdom and its harems, while simultaneously trying to influence her pupils especially young Prince Chulalongkorn with her Western ideals and values. Years later, as king, this very influence leads Chulalongkorn to abolish slavery in Siam and introduce democratic reform based on the ideas of freedom and human dignity he first learned from his beloved tutor. This captivating novel brilliantly combines in-depth research author Margaret Landon drew from Siamese court records and Anna s own writings with richly imagined details to create a lush portrait of 1860s Siam. As a Rodgers & Hammerstein Broadway musical and an Academy Awardwinning film, the story of Anna and the King of Siam has enchanted millions over the years. It is a gripping tale of cultural differences and shared humanity that invites readers into a vivid and sensory world populated by unforgettable characters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VgVeDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elementary Greek Exercises (Focus Classical Reprints)","description":"This book comprises a set of exercises based around a simple, common vocabulary and basic grammatical forms that students should have after a year of introductory Greek.

The first substantive Okinawan-English lexicon in more than a century, it represents a much-needed addition to the library of reference materials on the language. The Wordbook opens to lay user and linguist alike an area heretofore accessible almost exclusively in Japanese works and adds to the general body of scholarship on various Ryukyuan languages and dialects by providing a succinct but comprehensive picture of modern colloquial Okinawan. The current work comprises nearly 10,000 entries, many with encyclopedic discussion, drawn from a wide variety of sources in addition to the author s native knowledge and from numerous areas of interest, with emphasis on the cultural traditions of Okinawa. Entries reflect both contemporary Naha usage and archaisms and areal variants when these are of cultural, historical, or linguistic interest. Thus, in addition to being a comprehensive portrait of the modern Okinawan language, the Wordbook serves as an implicit introduction to the rich field of Japanese dialect studies. Prefatory material discusses the phonology of Okinawan and the romanization scheme employed in the book, with particular attention to phonological features of the language likely to be unfamiliar to native English speakers and those acquainted only with Japanese. A general introduction to the conjugation of verbs and adjectives in Okinawan is made as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8guTfpBKm5kC&dq=Okinawan-English+Wordbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gems of Japanized English: \\"Is That an 'L' As in Rome?\\" \\"No, It's 'R' As in London.\\" (Yenbooks)","description":"If you've ever had the uneasy feeling that the Japanese do things better, this book may be the ideal antidote. Even the Japanese are quick to admit that despite their enthusiasm for learning it, they still have a certain amount of difficulty with the English language. This is no new phenomenon. Shortly after Japan opened her ports to foreign traders, one doctor advertised himself as \\"a Specialist in the Decease of Children\\"; eggs were sold as \\"extract of fowl\\"; and a notice advised that \\"Tomorrow, from midnight to 12 noon, you will receive dirty water.\\" Fortunately, things are improving, but very slowly. A more recent English-language newspaper reported that someone's \\"wedding was consummated in the garden of the American consul's home,\\" while a road sign was posted near a busy intersection that commanded drivers to \\"Have many accidents here.\\" Long-time Tokyo resident Miranda Kenrick has collected these and hundreds of other delightful anecdotes to form a lighthearted, but unabashedly affectionate, portrait of the Japanese at home.

Although evidence on the true prevalence of food allergy is complicated by insufficient or inconsistent data and studies with variable methodologies, many health care experts who care for patients agree that a real increase in food allergy has occurred and that it is unlikely to be due simply to an increase in awareness and better tools for diagnosis. Many stakeholders are concerned about these increases, including the general public, policy makers, regulatory agencies, the food industry, scientists, clinicians, and especially families of children and young people suffering from food allergy. At the present time, however, despite a mounting body of data on the prevalence, health consequences, and associated costs of food allergy, this chronic disease has not garnered the level of societal attention that it warrants. Moreover, for patients and families at risk, recommendations and guidelines have not been clear about preventing exposure or the onset of reactions or for managing this disease. Finding a Path to Safety in Food Allergy examines critical issues related to food allergy, including the prevalence and severity of food allergy and its impact on affected individuals, families, and communities; and current understanding of food allergy as a disease, and in diagnostics, treatments, prevention, and public policy. This report seeks to: clarify the nature of the disease, its causes, and its current management; highlight gaps in knowledge; encourage the implementation of management tools at many levels and among many stakeholders; and delineate a roadmap to safety for those who have, or are at risk of developing, food allergy, as well as for others in society who are responsible for public health.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sjrKDgAAQBAJ&dq=Allergies+A+to+Z:+Practical+Advice+on+Living+With+Allergies+(Library+of+Health+and+Living)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deathwalker","description":"Enter a powerful realm of legend, dark sorcery, and conquest, where the mighty Drenai warrior Druss faces his most deadly opponent . . .

But Garen-Tsen, the sadistic power behind the Gothir throne, also seeks the gems. To control them, he will send five thousand men against a handful of savages, Talisman, and the one Drenai warrior.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pbFLVSYIt0kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Fencing: A Comprehensive Manual for the Foil, the Epee, the Sabre","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JWbPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Modern+Fencing:+A+Comprehensive+Manual+for+the+Foil,+the+Epee,+the+Sabre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bambi","description":"The classical tale of a young fawn's growing maturity and independence as he learns to face the hardships of his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8J3h1VRWFQkC&dq=Bambi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legendary Chinese Healing Herbs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UstsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Legendary+Chinese+Healing+Herbs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Go 2003: Spain & Portugal","description":"A budget guide to the region describes the sights, nightlife, and food, and offers tips on saving money on travel and accommodations","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fGpie-adnd8C&dq=Let%27s+Go+2003:+Spain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rush Hour Cook's Weekly Wonders: 19 Weekly Dinner Menus Complete with Grocery Lists for Today's Busy Family","description":"A CEO, mom, wife, daughter, volunteer, church-goer, author and speaker Brook brings her Weekly Wonder Menus to you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V6n1PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Rush+Hour+Cook%27s+Weekly+Wonders:+19+Weekly+Dinner+Menus+Complete+with+Grocery+Lists+for+Today%27s+Busy+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Penguin's Tale","description":"Searching for fun in his snowy polar world, Little Penguin dances with the gooney birds, cavorts at the Walrus Polar Club, and narrowly escapes being eaten by a whale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7KjRwCSJUosC&dq=Little+Penguin%27s+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kerouac, the Word and the Way: Prose Artist as Spiritual Quester","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fraud","description":"A one-of-a-kind resource walking you through one complete fraud investigation, from the original tip to conviction in court Anatomy of a Fraud Investigation is an engrossing read and a valuable resource for fraud investigators, auditors, or anyone who suspects fraud may be occuring in their organizations and is unsure as to how to act.

Through a comparison of vital statistics and demography, Schweber describes how the English government embraced statistics, using probabilistic interpretations of statistical data to analyze issues related to poverty and public health. The French were far less enthusiastic. Political and scientific  lites in France struggled with the  reality  of statistical populations, wrestling with concerns about the accuracy of figures that aggregated heterogeneous groups such as the rich and poor and rejecting probabilistic interpretations. Tracing the introduction and promotion of vital statistics and demography, Schweber identifies the institutional conditions that account for the contrasting styles of reasoning. She shows that the different reactions to statistics stemmed from different criteria for what counted as scientific knowledge. The French wanted certain knowledge, a one-to-one correspondence between observations and numbers. The English adopted an instrumental approach, using the numbers to influence public opinion and evaluate and justify legislation. Schweber recounts numerous attempts by vital statisticians and demographers to have their work recognized as legitimate scientific pursuits. While the British scientists had greater access to government policy makers, and were able to influence policy in a way that their French counterparts were not, ultimately neither the vital statisticians nor the demographers were able to institutionalize their endeavors. By 1885, both fields had been superseded by new forms of knowledge. Disciplining Statistics highlights how the development of  scientific  knowledge was shaped by interrelated epistemological, political, and institutional considerations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yp8GHhnXQngC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Highwayman: A Novel Inspired by Alfred Noyes' Poem","description":"To compete in the new millennium we must now design our business and digital strategies together.

Clearly, Tannen's insights into how and why women and men so often misunderstand each other when they talk has touched a nerve. For years a highly respected scholar in the field of linguistics, she has now become widely known for her work on how conversational style differences associated with gender affect relationships. Her life work has demonstrated how close and intelligent analysis of conversation can reveal the extraordinary complexities of social relationships--including relationships between men and women. Now, in Gender and Discourse, Tannen has gathered together six of her scholarly essays, including her newest and previously unpublished work in which language and gender are examined through the lens of \\"sex-class-linked\\" patterns, rather than \\"sex-linked\\" patterns. These essays provide a theoretical backdrop to her best-selling books--and an informative introduction which discusses her field of linguistics, describes the research methods she typically uses, and addresses the controversies surrounding her field as well as some misunderstandings of her work. (She argues, for instance, that her cultural approach to gender differences does not deny that men dominate women in society, nor does it ascribe gender differences to women's \\"essential nature.\\") The essays themselves cover a wide range of topics. In one, she analyzes a number of conversational strategies--such as interruption, topic raising, indirection, and silence--and shows that, contrary to much work on language and gender, no strategy exclusively expresses dominance or submissiveness in conversation--interruption (or overlap) can be supportive, silence and indirection can be used to control. It is the interactional context, the participants' individual styles, and the interaction of their styles, Tannen shows, that result in the balance of power. She also provides a fascinating analysis of four groups of males and females (second-, sixth-, and tenth-grade students, and twenty-five year olds) conversing with their best friends, and she includes an early article co-authored with Robin Lakoff that presents a theory of conversational strategy, illustrated by analysis of dialogue in Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage. Readers interested in the theoretical framework behind Tannen's work will find this volume fascinating. It will be sure to interest anyone curious about the crucial yet often unnoticed role that language and gender play in our daily lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VGR2CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The emotional terrorist and the violence-prone","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qogzNAAACAAJ&dq=The+emotional+terrorist+and+the+violence-prone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attila: The Scourge Of God","description":"A tremendous story . . . the incursion into the empire of the strangest and most frightening of the barbarian invaders - and he tells it with great verve and vigour. His prose has a pace, he has a keen eye for the significant detail, and manages the big scenes confidently' - Allan Massie, The Scotsman Early fifth century AD. The Western Roman Empire has been overrun by German tribes. Too weak to expel them, the Imperial government has been forced to grant federate status to the invaders. Aetius, the last of the great Roman generals, becomes the virtual ruler of the West over the heads of a weak and vicious emperor and his ambitious mother. In a series of brilliant campaigns, he takes on the German tribes and forces them to settle peacefully. Meanwhile, his old friend Attila, leader of the Huns, launches a devastating attack on the Eastern Empire, before turning on the West. He is confronted by Aetius, now his bitter enemy. In the epic battle that ensues, the stakes for Attila and Aetius could not be higher as the fates of empires of both Romans and Huns hang in the balance. This arresting novel deals with the rivalry between two great men whose friendship turns to enmity. Attila becomes corrupted by power, while Aetius is ennobled by it. Ross Laidlaw's masterful portrayal of these two figures is based on his extensive knowledge of the period and is written in a narrative style that vividly evokes the brutality, decadence and desperation of this fascinating time in European history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vNO8BQAAQBAJ&dq=Attila:+The+Scourge+Of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Applying Empirically Supported Techniques in Your Practice","description":"Proven to be highly effective for the treatment of a wide range of problems, cognitive-behavior therapy is the most widely used psychotherapeutic technique.

With brilliant immediacy, Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brings to life a towering literary figure whose dual persona symbolized the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth morality and freewheeling ambition. As Mark Twain, he was the Mississippi riverboat pilot, the satirist with a fiery hatred of pretension, and the author of such classics as Tom Sawyer andHuckleberry Finn. As Mr. Clemens, he was the star who married an heiress, built a palatial estate, threw away fortunes on harebrained financial schemes, and lived the extravagant life that Mark Twain despised. Kaplan effectively portrays the triumphant-tragic man whose achievements and failures, laughter and anger, reflect a crucial generation in our past as well as his own dark, divided, and remarkably contemporary spirit. Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brilliantly conveys this towering literary figure who was himself a symbol of the peculiarly American conflict between moral scrutiny and the drive to succeed. Mr. Clemens lived the Gilded Life that Mark Twain despised. The merging and fragmenting of these and other identities, as the biography unfolds, results in a magnificent projection of the whole man; the great comic spirit; and the exuberant, tragic human being, who, his friend William Dean Howells said, was  sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.

Spanish is the main, usually the sole official language of twenty-one countries,} and it is set fair to overtake English by the year 2000 in numbers 2 of native speakers. This vast geographical and political diversity ensures that Spanish is a good deal less unified than French, German or even English, the latter more or less internationally standardized according to either American or British norms. Until the 1960s, the criteria of internationally correct Spanish were dictated by the Real Academia Espanola, but the prestige of this institution has now sunk so low that its most solemn decrees are hardly taken seriously - witness the fate of the spelling reforms listed in the Nuevas normas de prosodia y ortograjia, which were supposed to come into force in all Spanish-speaking countries in 1959 and, nearly forty years later, are still selectively ignored by publishers and literate persons everywhere. The fact is that in Spanish 'correctness' is nowadays decided, as it is in all living languages, by the consensus of native speakers; but consensus about linguistic usage is obviously difficult to achieve between more than twenty independent, widely scattered and sometimes mutually hostile countries. Peninsular Spanish is itself in flux.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6UT0BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The War Against Proslavery Religion: Abolitionism and Northern Churches, 1830-1865","description":"Reflecting a prodigious amount of research in primary and secondary sources, this book examines the efforts of American abolitionists to bring northern religious institutions to the forefront of the antislavery movement. John R. McKivigan employs both conventional and quantitative historical techniques to assess the positions adopted by various churches in the North during the growing conflict over slavery, and to analyze the stratagems adopted by American abolitionists during the 1840s and 1850s to persuade northern churches to condemn slavery and to endorse emancipation. Working for three decades to gain church support for their crusade, the abolitionists were the first to use many of the tactics of later generations of radicals and reformers who were also attempting to enlist conservative institutions in the struggle for social change. To correct what he regards to be significant misperceptions concerning church-oriented abolitionism, McKivigan concentrates on the effects of the abolitionists' frequent failures, the division of their movement, and the changes in their attitudes and tactics in dealing with the churches. By examining the pre-Civil War schisms in the Presbyterian, Baptist, and Methodist denominations, he shows why northern religious bodies refused to embrace abolitionism even after the defection of most southern members. He concludes that despite significant antislavery action by a few small denominations, most American churches resisted committing themselves to abolitionist principles and programs before the Civil War. In a period when attention is again being focused on the role of religious bodies in influencing efforts to solve America's social problems, this book is especially timely.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i6JhDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+War+Against+Proslavery+Religion:+Abolitionism+and+Northern+Churches,+1830-1865&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spook","description":"Draws on the achievements of scientists, engineers, and mediums to consider the feasibility of life after death, from a reincarnation researcher's experimentation with out-of-body experiences to laboratory investigations into ghosts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9S2yrVKkzicC&dq=Spook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Todos Los Fuegos El Fuego/All Fires the Fire (Spanish Edition)","description":" One of the most adventurous and rewarding collections since the publication of Cort zar s own Blow-up.

Throughout, Wheatcroft delves beneath stereotypes, looking incisively at how images, ideas, language, and technology (from the printing press to the Internet), as well as politics, religion, and conquest, have allowed each side to demonize the other, revive old grievances, and fuel across centuries a seemingly unquenchable enmity. Finally, Wheatcroft tells how this fraught history led to our present maelstrom.

In 1968 Daniel Odier left Europe for the Himalayas, searching for a master who could help him go where texts and intellectual searching could no longer take him. He wanted everything: the wisdom and spirituality gained from the life of an ascetic and the beauty, love, and sensuality of a life of passion. He found both in Shivaic Tantrism, the secret spiritual path that seeks to transcend ego and rediscover the divine by embracing the passions. In an isolated Himalayan forest Odier met Devi, a great yogini who would take him on a mystical journey like none he had ever imagined. At times taking him beyond the limits of sexual experience, at times threatening him with destruction, she taught him what it is to truly be alive and to know the divine nature of absolute love. This is the personal memoir of one of France's most honored writers. Tantrism is the only ancient philosophy to survive all historical upheavals, invasions, and influences to reach us intact by uninterrupted transmission from master to disciple, and the only one to retain the image of the Great Goddess as the ultimate source of power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nmAoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The tragedie of Julius Caesar,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W-Y9AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PI School: How To Become A Private Detective","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cooking the Roman Way : Authentic Recipes from the Home Cooks and Trattorias of Rome","description":"Rome is the most beloved city in Italy, if not the world.

If Christ should condemn the payment of tribute to Caesar, then they could accuse Him of being a trai tor; but if, on the other hand, He sanctioned it as an obligation, they could denounce Him for treach ery to His race and to His religion.

It considers questions of evolution, contents and size, and motives for book ownership, during a century when growing markets for both new and second-hand books meant that books would be found, in varying numbers, in the homes of all kinds of people from the humble to the wealthy. Book ownership by women, and by non-professional households, is explicitly explored. Other topics include the balance of motivation between books for use, or for display; the relationship between libraries and museums; and cultures of collecting. While presenting a wealth of information in this field, conveniently brought together, this volume also advances methodologies for book history, and makes extensive use of material evidence such as bookbindings. It challenges received wisdom around priorities for studying private libraries, and the terminology which is appropriate to use. In addition, the list of owners, detailed in the Appendix, make this book a work of permanent reference, alongside its value in advancing book history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fnEWEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Presbyterians: People of the Middle Way--For Adult Inquirers and New","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blossoms in Winter","description":"After Pearl Harbor the Canadian government confiscates the possessions of all Japanese families and they are forcibly moved to small impoverished communities, including ten-year-old Michiko, her parents, and the new baby on the way.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-YWn5RfYjo0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English-Sicilian dictionary","description":"Features a concise Sicilian grammar and a bilingual dictionary with pronunciation guide.

Rothchild's scenario deliciously underscores the bizarre quality of Florida.\\"--Publishers Weekly \\"A story of rapacity and gall told with bemused admiration for the waves of visionaries and scamps who have left their mark on the Sunshine State . . . a tale of the wild, wild South in which motives, loyalties, and identities are lost in a tangle of crime and counterinsurgency.\\"--Time A wandering Floridian who made his way home in the early 1970s, John Rothchild writes about the state with the savvy of a native and the perspective of an outsider. His personal and historical travelogue reads alternately like a litany of 20th-century ills and a Monty Python rendering of the Great American Dream. In Florida, both versions are true. Settled through the chicanery of a few enterprising brokers and real estate wizards, Rothchild's Florida is a civilization built from scratch, out of the most unusual ingredients. While much of the state seems younger than many of its inhabitants, he observes, it hosts all the modern demographic, economic, and social problems. Still, those ills don't dispel the magic of its sunshine, beaches, and exotic fauna or undermine its status as a great American myth. Told within the framework of Rothchild's travels from Miami to the Everglades, around the state and back again, Up for Grabs is part history, part travelogue, part journalism, part autobiography--a humorous and appreciative tour of a society fabricated from a state of mind and erected on land that was \\"ninety percent underwater ninety percent of the time.\\" John Rothchild , a former editor of Washington Monthly, columnist for Time and Fortune, and contributor to Esquire, Rolling Stone, Harper's Magazine, and the New York Times Magazine, is author or coauthor of nine books, including A Fool and His Money and Voice of the River, the autobiography of Marjory Stoneman Douglas.

Swinging from poignant drama to edgy satire to farce, Albert s moving and funny first novel pairs an awkward orphaned adolescent immersed in 1950s rock  n  roll and an unconventional  kept  woman. In 1957, confused, taciturn and fat 15-year-old Harold Abelstein, survivor of a car crash that killed his parents, goes to live with his Aunt Enid, a Palm Springs, Calif., cocktail waitress whose flowery perfumes, loud talk and constant pinching and touching make him uncomfortable. Enid s rent and car are provided gratis by her part-time lover, incredibly self-absorbed Archie Blatt, a St. Louis garment manufacturer who pops in a few times a year to escape his invalid wife and teenage daughters. Though resenting her dependence, Enid faces a bigger problem when her manipulative, self-pitying father, Abe, who walked out on the family 25 years ago, suddenly reappears, shabby, reeking of whiskey and terminally ill. Tensions snap as Abe grows ever sicker and then Archie shows up, forcing four disparate souls to fitfully coexist under one roof. With a fine ear for dialogue, Albert perfectly captures a time and place and the emotional chafing between family members who can't help but care for one another, despite themselves.

The book takes its shape and direction from a tenet of Japanese Sumi painting: If you depict a bird, give it space to fly. Padma Hejmadi explores the human spaces surrounding language, landscape, literacy and illiteracy, music, dance, legend, the cadence of ancient craft, and the ceaselessly unfolding layers of family relationships. Part autobiography, part lively meditation, Room to Fly represents a new genre with an old diction. Hejmadi's spare, luminous prose combines lyricism with humor and intellectual rigor, drawing us from Bombay to the Bahamas, from Japan to New England, the Greek Isles to New Mexico.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uNEN6EsPqugC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The black tulip (Everyman's library.

In a reader-friendly, enthusiastic style, Langstroth addresses every aspect of beekeeping: bee physiology; diseases and enemies of bees; the life-cycles of the queen, drone, and worker; bee-hives; the handling of bees; and many other topics.
