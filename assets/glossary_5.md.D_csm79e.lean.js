Kwaadaardige politici spelen in op angst bij een deel van de bevolking. De mensen reageren erop met keuzes die irrationeel lijken, en levensgevaarlijk zijn: zoals voor een Brexit, voor presidentskandidaat Donald Trump, of voor het idee om  de grenzen dicht te gooien . Angst en woede vormen de drijfveer, destructiedrift en negativisme zijn het gevolg. Ze dreigen onze maatschappij te ontwrichten. En de vraag is: hoe is het mogelijk? Pankaj Mishra beschrijft in Tijd van woede op een beknopte en briljante manier de geschiedenis van woede als politieke drijfveer. Met verrassende historische parallellen laat hij zien dat deze tijd niet uniek is: ook het begin van de twintigste eeuw was vol van destructiedrift, nationalisme en terrorisme. Dat is geen geruststellende gedachte en Tijd van woede is dan ook een alarmerend boek: er zal een mentaliteitsverandering nodig zijn om onze vrijheid, welvaart en stabiliteit te behouden.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2vqnDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slovak, Beginning","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6QVhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Slovak,+Beginning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Higher Mythology","description":"Holl, Keith Doyle s best friend, has finally tied the knot with his beloved, Maura in the Little Folks  new home, Hollow Tree Farm.

We haven't read long in the psalms before we realize that the authors were altogether human, with a massive catalog of troubles, inconsistencies, and questions. Their lives were marked by breathtaking highs and lows, with sometimes only a few paragraphs between. But with all of that, they were saints. They left us with the greatest collection of prayers in the possession of our human race. What was their secret? I believe it was the quality of their friendship with God. And of course the language of that friendship is prayer. The psalmists don't give us any formula for effective praying. They don't offer a set of rules. But if we read their prayers carefully, we will learn something of their secret, the secret of the Ultimate Friendship. I hope through this book to start us on that special journey. ---- J.

This reader collects the texts, videos, and computer programs many of them now almost impossible to find that chronicle the history and form the foundation of the still-emerging field of new media. General introductions by Janet Murray and Lev Manovich, along with short introductions to each of the texts, place the works in their historical context and explain their significance. The texts were originally published between World War II when digital computing, cybernetic feedback, and early notions of hypertext and the Internet first appeared and the emergence of the World Wide Web when they entered the mainstream of public life. The texts are by computer scientists, artists, architects, literary writers, interface designers, cultural critics, and individuals working across disciplines. The contributors include (chronologically) Jorge Luis Borges, Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, Ivan Sutherland, William S. Burroughs, Ted Nelson, Italo Calvino, Marshall McLuhan, Jean Baudrillard, Nicholas Negroponte, Alan Kay, Bill Viola, Sherry Turkle, Richard Stallman, Brenda Laurel, Langdon Winner, Robert Coover, and Tim Berners-Lee. The CD accompanying the book contains examples of early games, digital art, independent literary efforts, software created at universities, and home-computer commercial software. Also on the CD is digitized video, documenting new media programs and artwork for which no operational version exists. One example is a video record of Douglas Engelbart's first presentation of the mouse, word processor, hyperlink, computer-supported cooperative work, video conferencing, and the dividing up of the screen we now call non-overlapping windows; another is documentation of Lynn Hershman's Lorna, the first interactive video art installation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DQYXoRx9CcEC&dq=The+New+Media+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Place Called Wiregrass","description":"Erma Lee is on the run . . .

What Annie doesn't count on is the untimely death of ambitious Mint Julep Press publisher Kenneth Hazlitt. Hazlitt arrives at the Festival peddling a proposal for Song of the South, a trashy roman clef that details the indiscretions of some famous Southern authors at a writers' conference--writers who more than resemble the Dixie Festival Medallion winners. When Hazlitt drops dead after drinking a hit of bourbon from his private stock, the evidence points to Annie--the fatal glass is imprinted with her fingerprints. As more and more evidence points her way, Annie and Max must act fast to catch a wily killer...before the police throw the book at Annie!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yp3ci-Hh3FAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Haunted Husband (Silhouette Romance)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wLGaYmvB33MC&dq=Haunted+Husband+(Silhouette+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Works of George Herbert","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_xCtmFfgShgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chronicles of Alexander: Land of Eternal Darkness","description":"Bradley tells the tale of a young boy whose dreams of high adventure come true, much to his own chagrin.

From 1957 to 1972 the artistic and political movement known as the Situationist International (SI) worked aggressively to subvert the conservative ideology of the Western world. The movement's broadside attack on \\"establishment\\" institutions and values left its mark upon the libertarian left, the counterculture, the revolutionary events of 1968, and more recent phenomena from punk to postmodernism. But over time it tended to obscure Situationism's own founding principles. In this book, Simon Sadler investigates the artistic, architectural, and cultural theories that were once the foundations of Situationist thought, particularly as they applied to the form of the modern city. According to the Situationists, the benign professionalism of architecture and design had led to a sterilization of the world that threatened to wipe out any sense of spontaneity or playfulness. The Situationists hankered after the \\"pioneer spirit\\" of the modernist period, when new ideas, such as those of Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche, still felt fresh and vital. By the late fifties, movements such as British and American Pop Art and French Nouveau Ralisme had become intensely interested in everyday life, space, and mass culture. The SI aimed to convert this interest into a revolution at the level of the city itself. Their principle for the reorganization of cities was simple and seductive: let the citizens themselves decide what spaces and architecture they want to live in and how they wish to live in them. This would instantly undermine the powers of state, bureaucracy, capital, and imperialism, thereby revolutionizing people's everyday lives. Simon Sadler searches for the Situationist City among the detritus of tracts, manifestos, and works of art that the SI left behind. The book is divided into three parts.

While some might say that theology after the death of God is like biology after the end of life - a discipline without a subject - 'Postmodern Theologies' identifies four general patterns of postmodernisms in theology today: constructive theologies (with Helmut Peukert, David Ray Griffin, and David Tracy cited as examples); postmodernisms of dissolution (Thomas J. J. Altizer, Mark C. Taylor, and Edith Wyschogrod); postliberal theologies (George Lindbeck); and communal praxis (exemplified by Gustavo Gutierrez and other Latin American theologians, and James Wm. McClendon and Sharon Welch among North Americans). These theologies eschew debates on traditional religious foundations to define true religion as the result of - rather than the impetus to - living one's beliefs. As these disparate approaches to theology are not directly comparable, the final chapter of 'Postmodern Theologies' instead analyzes how each one accounts for the plurality of religions. Exploring the postmodern strategies for coping with one of the most difficult questions in any theological age offers a fascinating way to assess their inherent strengths and weaknesses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t1ZLAwAAQBAJ&dq=Postmodern+Theologies:+The+Challenge+of+Religious+Diversity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conan the Defender","description":"As revolution brews in the shadowy streets of Belverus, Conan braves the traps and treacheries of the Royal Palace of the Dragon.

This newest AFI volume contains over 4,300 entries for feature-length films produced in the United States in the 1940s. The decade was an important and transitional one for filmmakers. Societal changes from the war years were reflected in films, and in the late 1940s the rise of television, the Hollywood blacklist, and the breakup of studio-owned theater chains greatly affected the number and types of films produced. Among films newly viewed for the book are such well-known classics as Citizen Kane, The Best Years of Our Lives, and Casablanca, along with less heralded films such as Fighting Men of the Plains and The Strange Death of Adolf Hitler. Entries include complete cast and crew credits, extensive plot summaries, and notes and sources for further study.

Previously used extensively in native-speaking countries, Language Arts has been taken up in the past decade in many parts of Asia. Language Arts uses intrinsically motivating materials such as literature, drama and popular culture to help students develop mastery of written and spoken language and text-types. In recent years, Language Arts has embraced media and multiliteracies, as well as critical and creative thinking, intercultural sensitivity, civics and ethics. This volume offers a breadth of topics, which embody methodologically sophisticated and contemporary language arts research. These include multimodal analysis, virtual environments, the use of comics, anime and film in second language teaching, and learners  experiences of drama and literary tourism. The use of literature and the arts in humanist education has a long history within Europe. It was traditionally appreciated for its ability to instil ethics and finer sensibilities and teach leadership. But the traditional program was marred by its function in inculcating and preserving elitist, high-culture voices, texts and values. The post-colonial incarnation of Language Arts has been informed by critical and linguistic theory, helping it to embrace a popular scope, and include a wide array of authentic social and media texts. The movement of English-language teaching beyond native-speaker shores has given rise to a vibrant variety of World Englishes, whose literary and media works are now represented within Language Arts. The explosion of media over the past few decades has given rise to an increasing array of media to use in language teaching. These trends invite scholarly analysis, and this is clearly reflected in the chapters in this volume. Linguistics has long had a connection to, and a natural role to play in, analysing the creative verbal and visual arts. As a paradigm, Language Arts now takes an inclusive view of the continuum of spoken, written and performed languages and texts. Cutting edge Language Arts research is now also supported through the new journal Language Arts and Linguistics (Taylor and Francis).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FsoxBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Thermodynamics (Dover Books on Physics)","description":"Clear treatment of systems and first and second laws of thermodynamics features informal language, vivid and lively examples, and fresh perspectives.

Three books of the collected works, which are characterized as \\"school-discussion problems and solutions on nature,\\" are commonly cited as Alexander's Quaestiones. The first book of the Quaestiones and the first half of the second book, here translated, are concerned with physics, metaphysics, psychology, and divine providence. Inspired by discussions of Aristotle's works among Alexander and associates of his, the Quaestiones illuminate the functioning of a philosophical school in the early third century A.D. In their emphasis on resolving apparent anomalies and contradictions, they exemplify the process by which Aristotle's thought came to be regarded as \\"Aristotelianism,\\" and they reveal the influence of the doctrines of Hellenistic philosophy. The translation of some of these first into Arabic and then into Latin played and important role in the transmission of ancient Greek philosophy to the medieval world. Of more than historical interest, Alexander's Quaestiones cast light on Aristotle's views on such issues as the problem of universals and the relation between form and matter. The Quaestiones have received increasing attention in recent years; this volume, along with its projected sequel, will make all of the text available for the first time in modern language. Students and scholars in the fields of ancient philosophy, classics, and medieval studies will warmly welcome it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0U1RAAAAYAAJ&dq=Quaestiones+1.1-2.15+(Ancient+Commentators+on+Aristotle)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Charge of the Light Brigade","description":"Treasury of verse by the great Victorian poet includes the famous long narrative poem, Enoch Arden, plus \\"The Lady of Shalott,\\" \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" \\"Break, break, break,\\" \\"Flower in the crannied Wall\\" and more.

Of the many world religions, only one claims that its founder returned from the grave. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the very cornerstone of Christianity. But a dead man coming back to life? In our sophisticated age, when myth has given way to science, who can take such a claim seriously? Some argue that Jesus never died on the cross. Conflicting accounts make the empty tomb seem suspect. How credible is the evidence for--and against--the resurrection? Focusing his award-winning skills as a legal journalist on history's most compelling enigma, Lee Strobel retraces the startling findings that led him from atheism to belief. He examines: The Medical Evidence: Was Jesus' death a sham and his resurrection a hoax? The Evidence of the Missing Body: Was Jesus' body really absent from his tomb? The Evidence of Appearances: Was Jesus seen alive after his death on the cross? Written in a hard-hitting journalistic style, The Case for Easter probes the core issues of the resurrection. Jesus Christ, risen from the dead: superstitious myth or life-changing reality? The evidence is in.

The Virtual Future employs theories and methods from social science to explore nine very different virtual futures: The Matrix Online, Tabula Rasa, Anarchy Online, Entropia Universe, Star Trek Online, EVE Online, Star Wars Galaxies, World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade, and The Chronicles of Riddick. Each presents a different picture of how technology and society could evolve in coming centuries, but one theme runs through all of them, the attempt to escape the Earth and seek new destinies among the stars. Four decades after the last trip to the moon, a new conception of spaceflight is emerging. Rather than rockets shooting humans across vast physical distances to sterile rocks that lack the resources to sustain life, perhaps robot space probes and orbiting telescopes will glean information about the universe, that humans can then experience inside computer-generated environments much closer to home. All nine of these fantastically rich multiplayer masterpieces have shown myriads of people that really radical alternatives to contemporary society could exist, and has served as a laboratory for examining the consequences. Each is a prototype of new social forms, a utopian subculture, and a simulation of technologies that have yet to be invented. They draw upon several different traditions of science fiction and academic philosophy, and they were created in several nations. By comparing these nine role-playing fantasies, we can better consider what kind of world we want to inhabit in the real future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WPcSFaXcEd4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creature Comforts: People and Their Security Objects","description":"Presents photographs and text to examine the special relationships that can develop with certain objects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lc-8gCcls0AC&dq=Creature+Comforts:+People+and+Their+Security+Objects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My years with General Motors","description":"The must-read summary of Alfred P.

These methods all record direct or indirect measures of brain activity and correlate the activity patterns with behavior. But to go beyond the correlations established by these techniques and prove the necessity of an area for a given function, cognitive neuroscientists need to be able to reverse engineer the brain i.e., to selectively remove components from information processing and assess their impact on the output. This book is about transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a technique that emerged during the same period as neuroimaging and has made it possible to reverse engineer the human brain's role in behavioral and cognitive functions. The subject areas that can be studied using TMS run the gamut of cognitive psychology attention, perception, awareness, eye movements, action selection, memory, plasticity, language, numeracy, and priming. The book presents an overview of historical attempts at magnetic brain stimulation, ethical considerations of the technique's use, basic technical and practical information, the results of numerous TMS studies, and a discussion of the future of TMS in the armamentarium of cognitive neuropsychology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eL9NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Transcranial+Magnetic+Stimulation:+A+Neurochronometrics+of+Mind+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (2nd Edition)","description":"A clear and accessible introduction to theory and applications of quantum mechanics for junior/senior undergraduate students of physics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=82FjDwAAQBAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Quantum+Mechanics+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be a Better Reader (Level a)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s9tSw0-8TNkC&dq=Be+a+Better+Reader+(Level+a)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Food For Kids: Your Essential Guide to Nutrition for all Children from age 2 to 6","description":"Offers a collection of nutritious recipes for children, along with a guide on pediatric nutrition, advice on what foods to feed children at particular ages, and a discussion about nutritional ailments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3i4dRwAACAAJ&dq=Better+Food+For+Kids:+Your+Essential+Guide+to+Nutrition+for+all+Children+from+age+2+to+6&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Prayer Book Office","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c7HN0r3F8vsC&dq=The+Prayer+Book+Office&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fashions from the Loom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vrAvAAAAYAAJ&dq=Fashions+from+the+Loom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love, with Noodles: An Amorous Widower's Tale","description":"Grieving over the death of his beloved wife, sixty-year-old stockbroker Dan Gelder is unexpectedly attracted to four different women, travels to Jerusalem, and struggles with his son's engagement to a non-Jewish woman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aPhwpIVsYWkC&dq=Love,+with+Noodles:+An+Amorous+Widower%27s+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Lilith to Lilith Fair : The Authorized Story","description":"With a foreword by Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards Girls Rock! explores the many ways women have defined themselves as rock musicians in an industry once dominated and controlled by men. Integrating history, feminist analysis, and developmental theory, the authors describe how and why women have become rock musicians -- what inspires them to play and perform, how they write, what their music means to them, and what they hope their music means to listeners. As these musicians tell their stories, topics emerge that illuminate broader trends in rock's history. From Wanda Jackson's revolutionary act of picking up a guitar to the current success of independent artists such as Ani DiFranco, Girls Rock! examines the shared threads of these performers' lives and the evolution of women's roles in rock music since its beginnings in the 1950s. This provocative investigation of women in rock is based on numerous interviews with a broad spectrum of women performers -- those who have achieved fame and those just starting bands, those playing at local coffeehouses and those selling out huge arenas. Girls Rock! celebrates what female musicians have to teach about their experiences as women, artists, and rock musicians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bZUfBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The lives and times of the Kings of Israel and Judah, (Men of the Bible)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iNjYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+lives+and+times+of+the+Kings+of+Israel+and+Judah,+(Men+of+the+Bible)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macromedia Dreamweaver UltraDev 4 Fast & Easy Web Development","description":"This title explains and demonstrates the features new to Dreamweaver UltraDev 4, including using live objects and the integrated text editor.

With no emotional compass to guide them, the Walkers retreat to an old cottage near Cape May, New Jersey, where, separated from the daily reminders of their numbing loss, they hope to reenter the world of the living.

At once pessimistic and exhilarating, Bernhard's work depicts the corruption of the modern world, the dynamics of totalitarianism, and the interplay of reality and appearance. In this stunning translation of The Voice Imitator, Bernhard gives us one of his most darkly comic works. A series of parable-like anecdotes some drawn from newspaper reports, some from conversation, some from hearsay this satire is both subtle and acerbic. What initially appear to be quaint little stories inevitably indict the sterility and callousness of modern life, not just in urban centers but everywhere. Bernhard presents an ordinary world careening into absurdity and disaster. Politicians, professionals, tourists, civil servants the usual victims of Bernhard's inspired misanthropy succumb one after another to madness, mishap, or suicide. The shortest piece, titled \\"Mail,\\" illustrates the anonymity and alienation that have become standard in contemporary society: \\"For years after our mother's death, the Post Office still delivered letters that were addressed to her. The Post Office had taken no notice of her death.\\" In his disarming, sometimes hilarious style, Bernhard delivers a lethal punch with every anecdote. George Steiner has connected Bernhard to \\"the great constellation of Kafka, Musil, and Broch,\\" and John Updike has compared him to Grass, Handke, and Weiss. The Voice Imitator reminds us that Thomas Bernhard remains the most caustic satirist of our age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bg9eDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's All-Time Favorite Songs: P/V/G (Library of Series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eDYhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travels in Arabia Deserta","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kgspAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Home Design Using Ikea Home Furnishings","description":"With an emphasis on the clean and simple style with which IKEA has made its name, this book takes the mystery out of planning and decorating a home.

Robin Timariot has set out that morning on what he has planned as a six-day tramp along part of Offa's Dyke. At the close of his first day's walk he encounters an elegant middle-aged woman who seems strangely out of place among the sheep and gorse of Hergest Ridge. They exchange only a few words of conversation, but their talk is enigmatic - and unforgettable. A few days later, at the end of his walk, Timariot returns home to learn from the newspapers that, just a few hours after their meeting, the woman, whose name was Louise Paxton, was raped and then murdered, along with an artist, Oscar Bantock, who lived near by.A man is swiftly charged and convicted of the crime, but a string of inexplicable events begins to convince Timariot - and others - that all is not what it seems.

Combining his expertise in social science with historical evidence, and his insight into contemporary religion's appeal, Stark finds that early Christianity attracted the privileged rather than the poor, that most early converts were women or marginalized Jews and ultimately \\"that Christianity was a success because it proved those who joined it with a more appealing, more assuring, happier, and perhaps longer life\\" (Andrew M.

As a student in Toronto in the 1920 s, she was tutored by Group of Seven members Arthur Lismer, A.Y. Jackson, J.E.H. MacDonald, and others; as a teacher, she inspired a generation of younger artists, among them Joyce Wieland. This captivating memoir of her early years is the first installment of her warm and intimate biography. It describes the fortunes of an artist striving to establish herself in the art world of the thirties and forties and the odyssey of a spirited girl searching for her own path to fulfillment. Against the backdrop of those eventful decades, she writes of studying art in pre-war London, winning a teaching position in the depths of the Depression and roughing it on painting expeditions to northern Ontario, the Maritimes and the Rockies. She tells of her personal life: of breaking loose from a disapproving mother, building her own home on the bluffs above Lake Ontario, and of finding love in unexpected places. Written with disarming candour and wit, and drawing on the diary she has kept since childhood, her story illuminates timeless themes: the youthful longing for independence, the nature of friendships between girls and women, the exhilaration of artistic creation, and the irresistible pull of nature and the Canadian landscape. A Fool in Paradise charms and enthralls with its unforgettable portrait of a young woman in search of herself. The Good Wine, An Artist Comes of Age, delivered the next stage of her life from the age of 40 from 1950 to 1991. It recounts her year of full-time painting in Europe; encounters with Dorothy Sayers and Arnold Toynbee; friendships with Bora Laskin and Boyd Neel.

This will never happen as long as our citizens are armed as provided for in our Constitution. Unfortunately, most citizens are immersed in their day-to-day activities to provide for their families and do not have the time to sift through and analyze the wealth of information provided by modern technology. Those that have the time to monitor the internet and other media are flooded with information, much of which is disinformation. This causes uncertainty, fear, worry and stress on our citizens. This Decision Paper puts together seven situations that, if not acted upon and corrected, will destroy this great nation. All nations should realize that if America, as the world knows it is destroyed, the free world will cease to exist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lIUe9pzZW9YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Third Day - Offerings: Ready to Play: Ready to Play Series","description":"(Brentwood-Benson Keyboard).

Here he expounds the message of the Old Testament in a manner that is faithful to the Old Testament itself -- as an account of the mighty acts of God rather than a series of abstract doctrines. A theology of the Old Testament is not simply a study of God, however. Old Testament theology also encompasses teaching about the world and humanity, about life and death, about origin, nature, and destiny. And Old Testament theology must also take into account the New Testament, which confirms what is announced in Israel's Scripture and thus is part of it. Barth elucidates the importance of the Old Testament for the New Testament and hence for Christians, surveys God's redemptive acts as recorded in the confessional summaries of history in the Old and New Testaments, and offers contemporary applications of these biblical themes. Working his way through the Old Testament, Barth treats nine key topics, each of which deals with one of the divine acts that are the essential subject matter of Israel's Scripture: creation, election of the patriarchs, exodus, wilderness wandering, Sinai revelation, gift of Canaan, election of David (kingship), election of Jerusalem and sending of prophets. He has divided each of the nine chapters into sections on one main aspect of the topic, considering theological, anthropological, soteriological, and eschatological points as well. Throughout his examination of each theme Barth pays special attention to its scriptural context. God With Us is an excellent textbook for introductory or survey courses in the Old Testament: each section begins with a thesis statement, summarizing its contents, and details are treated in small-print sections. Barth originally wrote his Old Testament theology in Indonesian and later rewrote the entire book in English; Geoffrey Bromiley has condensed the original four volumes in this edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lruHJq7Ui4sC&dq=God+With+Us:+A+Theological+Introduction+to+the+Old+Testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cure of imperfect sight by treatment without glasses,","description":"Dr. Bates 1st, Original book in Antique 1920 Print.

They describe his photographs as being \\"wonderful\\" and \\"like visiting the best art gallery.\\" Often they don't know exactly why they like his pictures which they find so entrancing. One fan writes, \\"In a world that has forgotten what beauty is, Bob Lamb has an eye for drawing (it) into the open.\\" In a life that is filled with photography, his files bulge with thousands upon thousands of negatives and digital images always full of variety and more than likely, displaying strong imagination. The American Boy is only a small sampling of those pictures, some which were taken when he was but sixteen. \\"I took lots of pictures of interesting subjects and very photogenic people. Sometimes I'd ask total strangers if I could take their picture.\\" For that reason every picture is natural, but unique, and seems to tell a story enhanced by the model, his activity, pose or location.

MIDI is now the most prevalent representation of music, but what it represents is based on hardware control protocols for sound synthesis. Programs that support sound input for graphics output necessarily span a gamut of representational categories. What is most likely to be lost is any sense of the musical work. Thus, for those involved in pedagogy, analysis, simulation, notation, and music theory, the nature of the representation matters a great deal. An understanding of the data requirements of different applications is fundamental to the creation of interchange codes. The contributors to Beyond MIDI present a broad range of schemes, illustrating a wide variety of approaches to music representation. Generally, each chapter describes the history and intended purposes of the code, a description of the representation of the primary attributes of music (pitch, duration, articulation, ornamentation, dynamics, and timbre), a description of the file organization, some mention of existing data in the format, resources for further information, and at least one encoded example. The book also shows how intended applications influence the kinds of musical information that are encoded. Contributors David Bainbridge, Ulf Berggren, Roger D.

The mother she has, the mother she wants, the mother she misses, the mother she didn't know. We carry our mothers with us. Sometimes we carry her in our hearts, in our heads-or on our backs. Sometimes we are connected to our mothers with the thick, strong cords of intertwined love and true acceptance; other times the bonds are stretched thin and taut, scratching against our consciousness, rubbing raw the sore spots in our souls. But we are always linked to our mothers: both to the dreams of the mothers we wish for and the realities of the mothers we have. Even if our mother has been gone for years-for decades-the relationship is still very much alive. Mom is still with us: offering advice, encouragement, criticism, appreciation, rejection, solace. What we daughters do with this ongoing commentary-whether we unknowingly incorporate it into our reality, or consciously and carefully review it, deciding what to keep and what to put away-is fundamental to how fully we lead our own lives. In Dear Mom: Women's Letters of Love, Loss, and Longing, you meet women who have stripped away pretenses, societal constraints, and basic fears to uncover and express their most private truths about their relationship with their mothers. You get to peer over the shoulders of the women, share in their laughter, and experience their struggles. You see how other women cast light on this most complicated, rewarding, and sometimes frustrating relationship. You witness women at different stages of their lives reflecting on the legacies their mothers (knowingly or unconsciously, but always powerfully) left them. You hear how other women experience the glories and the scars, the hurt and the healing that make up this most primal of connections. You also get to meet the women behind the letters, since each Dear Mom letter is followed by a profile of the contributor. You learn about the surprises, satisfactions, and challenges they faced in writing down their most private truths. The 25 Dear Mom contributors include women from a variety of backgrounds, careers, religions, and lifestyles. They include (present and former) teachers, business owners, homemakers, real estate agents, artists, secretaries, social workers, journalists, and government officials. Some are accomplished professionals, well-known in their fields and public figures in their communities. They are married, single, divorced, widowed. Many, though not all, are mothers themselves. Many contributors are baby boomers, in their 40s and 50s. Others are in their 60s, 70s, and 80s. (The oldest contributor is over 90; her conversation with her mother continues!)","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m4VvJ2os5NkC&dq=On+the+Way+to+over+the+Hill+:+A+Guide+to+Aging+Gracefully&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tom's Town","description":"The Pendergast machine rose to power riding the industrial and business boom of the 1920s, strengthened its grip during the chaos of the depression years, and grew fat and arrogant during the spending spree that followed. It fell apart in a fantastic series of crimes, including voting fraud and tax evasion, that shocked the nation and resulted in the incarceration of Tom Pendergast in a federal prison in 1939. Now available in paperback with a foreword by Charles Glaab, William M. Reddig's political and social history of Kansas City from the mid-1800s to 1945, focusing on the lives of Alderman Jim Pendergast and especially his younger sibling, Big Tom Pendergast, chronicles both the influence of the brothers on the growing metropolitan area and the national phenomenon of bossism. \\"The story of the Pendergasts has been told ... in many places and in many ways. It has hardly been told anywhere, however, with more fascinating detail and healthy irony than in this volume of William M. Reddig.\\" --New York Times \\"Reddig has written his history of the Pendergast machine in a reportorial style which manages to combine plain city desk prose with a great deal of humor, irony, and insight. He has dwelt with obvious delight on the local characters, the factions, and feuds, and has given several brilliant personality sketches.\\" --Saturday Review of Literature","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4JYaFuw9vQIC&dq=Tom%27s+Town&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2000 Miller GAAP Implementation Manual - Restatements and Analysis of Other Current FASB, EITF, and AICPA Pronouncements","description":"This guide delivers mandatory pronouncements on GAAP implementation in a clear, concise, easy-to-follow Miller format.

William Foote Whyte's account of the Italian American slum he called \\"Cornerville\\"--Boston's North End--has been the model for urban ethnography for fifty years. By mapping the intricate social worlds of street gangs and \\"corner boys,\\" Whyte was among the first to demonstrate that a poor community need not be socially disorganized. His writing set a standard for vivid portrayals of real people in real situations. And his frank discussion of his methodology--participant observation--has served as an essential casebook in field research for generations of students and scholars. This fiftieth anniversary edition includes a new preface and revisions to the methodological appendix. In a new section on the book's legacy, Whyte responds to recent challenges to the validity, interpretation, and uses of his data. \\"The Whyte Impact on the Underdog,\\" the moving statement by a gang leader who became the author's first research assistant, is preserved. \\"Street Corner Society broke new ground and set a standard for field research in American cities that remains a source of intellectual challenge.\\"--Robert Washington, Reviews in Anthropology","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LouxQgAACAAJ&dq=Street+Corner+Society:+The+Social+Structure+of+an+Italian+Slum&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel Oracle Deck: Let the Healing Energy of Angels into Your Life","description":"Angels have immense power to touch us with their protection, guidance, andlove.

In this volume, internationally known poet Red Hawk offers poetic reflections on these much-loved ancient sutras.

Each poem invites the reader to bring this wisdom to his or her daily practice of self observation and self remembering. The poet begs for a return to the true Self, which he symbolizes as the place of the Mother within. Our Mother has no words, She is Silence, She is the present, herenow. To be here-now, in this body, is to return to Our Mother . . . This volume is a companion and completion to the author s two previous volumes Self Observation: The Awakening of Conscience.

If your kids are getting restless on the drive around Cornwall, they suggest a stop at the legendary Last Labyrinth at Land's End, where they can scramble through the maze.

The intertwining of these stories demonstrates the ways in which particular technological projects can be understood in a world of complex contexts. Law works to upset the binary between the modernist concept of knowledge, subjects, and objects as having centered and concrete essences and the postmodernist notion that all is fragmented and centerless. The structure and content of Aircraft Stories reflect Law s contention that knowledge, subjects, and particularly  objects are  fractionally coherent : that is, they are drawn together without necessarily being centered. In studying the process of this particular aircraft s design, construction, and eventual cancellation, Law develops a range of metaphors to describe both its fractional character and the ways its various aspects interact with each other. Offering numerous insights into the way we theorize the working of systems, he explores the overlaps between singularity and multiplicity and reveals rich new meaning in such concepts as oscillation, interference, fractionality, and rhizomatic networks. The methodology and insights of Aircraft Stories will be invaluable to students in science and technology studies and will engage others who are interested in the ways that contemporary paradigms have limited our ability to see objects in their true complexity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Chz2rM0HVIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Focus Group Interviews in Education and Psychology","description":"While there are many books that address focus groups, most are directed at business and marketing.

It is much more common than was previously thought, with up to 2 million people being affected in the UK. Sufferers experience intrusive thoughts and anxieties resulting in compulsive behaviour that can seem bizarre to those that have no experience of the disorder. Why would someone feel compelled to touch the four walls of a room in a clockwise fashion as soon as he enters it? Why would someone look at an object 3 times with his right eye, followed by his left eye?OCD sufferers are aware that these rituals are excessive and irrational, but they cannot control their behaviour. They are plagued by intrusive thoughts that they cannot banish from their mind and are often tormented by these thoughts which they find profoundly disgusting or upsetting. The cause of OCD is still not known, but it does appear to run in families and can occur together with other disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and Tourette s syndrome.Dr Frederick Toates, an experimental psychologist relates his own experiences of obsessional neurosis and his successful quest for a cure in th","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mOH0L6NYg6kC&dq=Obsessive+Compulsive+Disorder:+Practical+Tried-and-Tested+Strategies+to+Overcome+OCD+(Class+Health)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AN INQUIRY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.","description":"A landmark of enlightenment though, HUme's An Enquiry Concerning Human understanding is accompanied here by two shorter works that shed light on it: A Letter from a Gentlemen to His Friend in Edinburgh, hume's response to those accusing him of atheism, of advocating extreme scepticism, and of undermining the foundations of morality; and his Abstract of A Treatise of HUman Nature, which anticipates discussions developed in the Enquiry.

Send email correspondence to Sgrice@southernco.com. SEE THE SARA HARVEY EXCERPT BELOW Growin' old is a funny thing. If you haven't gotten there already, you'll soon understand what I mean. The oddest things put a spark in your brain and drag you down memory lane whether you want to go there or not. You start talking about the things you remember, and halfway through your story, some disrespectful young pup, reminds you that you've already told the story before. I have a story to tell that I've probably told fifty times. No, better make that a hundred times. No matter how many times I repeat it, I'm not usually interrupted. People listen when I tell it because it's a fantastic story. It's not so fantastic because I embellish it, because believe you me some things need embellishing and some things don't. This story is so wonderful because it's one of those that don't. I suppose it's well received because it's the truth. As I was growing up, my mama used to say, \\"Truth is the truth today, it was truth yesterday, and it's sure to be the truth tomorrow. Believin' it or not believin' it don't do a thing to change that.\\" I do believe Mama was right on the money. For me, it's not the telling that's so delightful. It's the fact that no matter what you believe when I'm done telling the story, there is no force on earth that can change the fact that it did happen. Now, I suppose I should begin by telling you my name. I'm known around these parts as Ms. Sara. Most people know who I am because I've lived here all my life. I was born in the spring of 1919 and what happened all those years ago still sends chills up my spine and makes me wonder how we ever got through it. Now, back in those days, there was a miserable-looking woman who reeked of stale liquor and lived in back of what used to be old man Gresham's sawmill. She was certainly a pitiful-looking soul with eyes as red as blood and loosely worn flesh that made one think of rumpled sheets after a hard night's rest. Adding to her mysteriousness was the fact that she walked with great difficulty, dragging that left foot as though it were a small child throwing a tantrum, not wanting to go where the rest of the body went. As I remember it, she was somewhat of a vagabond, who consistently adorned herself in tattered dresses with faded floral prints that looked as though they may have been beautiful at one time or another. There was nothing necessarily strange about that, until you got down to her feet and found them stuffed into thick black combat boots with the laces untied. And how can I tell this story well without mentioning that coat, a heavy winter overthrow, which she rarely took off, even in the dead of summer. Even odder still, was the fact that this woman was often known to carry on a conversation with two or three invisible friends, all of whom seemed to say the funniest things that sent her twisting into hysterical laughter whenever anyone walked by and stared too hard. In the small town of Louise, Mississippi, in 1930, when I was still eleven years old, it was then that I came to know the woman folks in these parts called Crazy Alice. Although she seemed quite harmless to most people, I recall being enormously afraid of her. You see, there were many fabrications, tall tales if you will, circulating among the youngsters that Alice was particularly fond of eating little girls. Now that I know better, I realize how ridiculous that","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=k3w3AwAACAAJ&dq=The+Memoirs+of+Sara+Harvey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whats the Big Idea?: Animal Rights","description":"The authors of this book offer practical help to teachers in making day-to-day provision for the gifted and talented pupils in their classroom.

With three months left in the first author's sabbatical, and thanks to the encouragement from our editor at Kluwer, Gary Folven, we took to the task of writing this book. The merging in this book of the description of a new intellectual space, and the write-up of the results from our MMT studies have created a unique blend of very attractive reading material.

Academia rarely views the ancient world from such a wide-angle lens, but an honest writer cannot ignore his own conclusions. All civilized thought was focused on the pantheon of gods who struggled against each other while explaining the unexplainable. Then, from nowhere, a misplaced tribe began a movement with a new perspective. This revolutionary belief system, seemingly doomed by external pressures, would survive to irrevocably change the course history. But how? Why did monotheism erupt in Canaan at approximately 2,000 BCE? Was it an idea whose time had come? Or was there a catalyst that drove it? Circumstantial evidence is all we have, and this compelling story puts the beginnings of monotheism into historical perspective. It is not just another book about Atlantis; rather it is a time-travelling sojourn into the ancient world from an array of different viewpoints.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QUKhPAAACAAJ&dq=Atlantis+Continued%7C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Follies: A New Musical","description":"A fateful encounter with their enemies changes the Tree People's attitude about the Followers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d0-fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Follies:+A+New+Musical&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Face-off at the summit","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kBY2PQAACAAJ&dq=Face-off+at+the+summit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Twin Ghost and Others","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tkA3AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reorienting Economics (Economics as Social Theory)","description":"Contemporary economics is characterized by a mismatch between its methods of analysis and the nature of the world it seeks to interpret.

The text is based exclusively on French eyewitness accounts which give an inside view of the immediate aftermath of the battle and carry the story through to the army's disbandment in late 1815. Many French officers and soldiers wrote more about the retreat than they did about the catastrophe of Waterloo itself. Their recollections give a fascinating insight to the psyche of the French soldier. They also provide a firsthand record of their experiences and the range of their reactions, from those who deserted the colors and made their way home, to those who continued to serve faithfully when all was lost. Napoleons own flight from Waterloo is an essential part of the narrative, but the main emphasis is on the fate of the beaten French army as it was experienced by eyewitnesses who lived through the last days of the campaign.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hM0nDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edgar Rice Burroughs: The Exhaustive Scholar's and Collector's Descriptive Bibliography of American Periodical, Hardcover, Paperback, and Re","description":"In creating some of the most enduring characters in 20th century literature, Burroughs (1875-1950) left a complex bibliographic record of editions, and a long chain of fascinated collectors.

Rosemary Sullivan, award-winning literary biographer, has penned The Red Shoes: Margaret Atwood Starting Out, the first portrait of Canada's most famous novelist, focusing on her childhood and formative years as a writer and the generation she grew up in. When Margaret Atwood was a little girl in 1949, she saw a movie called The Red Shoes. It is the story of a beautiful young woman who becomes a famous ballerina, but commits suicide when she cannot satisfy one man, who wants her to devote her entire life to her art, and another who loves her, but subjugates her to become his muse and inspiration. She struggles to choose art, but the choice eventually destroys her. Margaret Atwood remembers being devastated by this movie but unlike many young girls of her time, she escaped its underlying message. Always sustained by a strong sense of self, Atwood would achieve a meteoric literary career. Yet a nurturing sense of self-confidence is just one fascinating side of our most famous literary figure, as examined in Rosemary Sullivan's latest biography. The Red Shoes is not a simple biography but a portrait of a complex, intriguing woman and her generation. The seventies in Canada was the decade of fierce nationalist debate, a period during which Canada's social imagination was creating a new tradition. Suddenly everyone, from Robertson Davies to Margaret Laurence was talking, and writing, about a Canadian cultural identity. Margaret Atwood was no exception. For despite her tremendous success that transcends the literary community, catapulting into the realm of a \\"household name,\\" Margaret Atwood has remained very much a private person with a public persona. Rosemary Sullivan reveals the discrepancy between Atwood's cool, acerbic, public image and the down-to-earth, straight-dealing and generous woman who actually writes the books. Throughout, she weaves the issues of female creativity, authority and autonomy set against the backdrop of a generation of women coming of age during one of the most radically shifting times in contemporary history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z5yC-qcCuAUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Window of Time: A Story","description":"While exploring the basement of his new house in Westminster, Maryland, Ben puts on an old jacket and boots that he finds and is suddenly transported back to the time of the Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3z0iPQAACAAJ&dq=Window+of+Time:+A+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Book of Shiatsu","description":"A one-of-a-kind guide to shiatsu, providing step-by-step instructions for performing this unique and effective therapy.

Patrick Radden Keefe, New York Times bestselling author of Say Nothing and Empire of Pain From a rising star New Yorker staff writer, the incredible and gripping true story of John Barker, a psychiatrist who investigated the power of premonitions and came to believe he himself was destined for an early death On the morning of October 21, 1966, Kathleen Middleton, a music teacher in suburban London, awoke choking and gasping, convinced disaster was about to strike. An hour later, a mountain of rubble containing waste from a coal mine collapsed above the village of Aberfan, swamping buildings and killing 144 people, many of them children. Among the doctors and emergency workers who arrived on the scene was John Barker, a psychiatrist from Shelton Hospital, in Shrewsbury. At Aberfan, Barker became convinced there had been supernatural warning signs of the disaster, and decided to establish a  premonitions bureau,  in conjunction with the Evening Standard newspaper, to collect dreams and forebodings from the public, in the hope of preventing future calamities. Middleton was one of hundreds of seemingly normal people, who would contribute their visions to Barker s research in the years to come, some of them unnervingly accurate. As Barker s work plunged him deeper into the occult, his reputation suffered. But in the face of professional humiliation, Barker only became more determined, ultimately realizing with terrible certainty that catastrophe had been prophesied in his own life. In Sam Knight s crystalline telling, this astonishing true story comes to encompass the secrets of the world. We all know premonitions are impossible and yet they come true all the time. Our lives are full of collisions and coincidence: the question is how we perceive these implausible events and therefore make meaning in our lives. The Premonitions Bureau is an enthralling account of madness and wonder, of science and the supernatural. With an unforgettable ending, it is a mysterious journey into the most unsettling reaches of the human mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nrZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Premonitions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surgeon's Surgeon: Theodor Billroth, 1829-1894","description":"Billroth, Theodor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vx9rAAAAMAAJ&dq=Surgeon%27s+Surgeon:+Theodor+Billroth,+1829-1894&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roadmap to the Virginia SOL: EOC Earth Science (State Test Preparation Guides)","description":"Roadmap to the Virginia SOL EOC Earth Science includes strategies that are proven to enhance student performance.

They are filtered, moreover, through a lens ground with both the bleakness and brightness of human history. The messages point to faith in and hope for a better world by taking the Virtuous Path of God, a Path Ringed with Garlands of Goodness. There is much mystery in the biblical text.

This is the second book in a multi-volume set that finally brings al-K sh  s groundbreaking textbook to English audiences in its entirety. As soon as it was studied by modern researchers, it changed some false assumptions about the history of certain topics in mathematics. Written as a textbook for students of mathematics, astronomy, accounting, engineering, and architecture, Miftah covers a wide range of topics in arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. By sharing al-K sh  s most comprehensive work with a wider audience, this book will help establish a more complete history of mathematics, and extend al-K sh  s influence into the 21st century and beyond. The book opens by briefly recounting al-K sh  s biography, so as to situate readers in the work s rich historical context. His impressive status in the kingdom of Ulugh Beg is detailed, as well as his contributions to both mathematics and astronomy. As a master calculator and astronomer, al-K sh  s calculations of 2  and sin(10) were by far the most accurate for almost two centuries. His law of cosines is still studied in schools today. This translation contributes to the understanding and appreciation of al-K sh  s esteemed place in the scientific world. A side-by-side presentation of the source manuscript one of the oldest known copies and the English translation is provided on each page. Detailed footnotes are also provided throughout, which will offer readers an even deeper look at the text s mathematical and historical basis. Researchers and students of the history of mathematics will find this volume indispensable in filling in a frequently overlooked time period and region. This volume will also provide anybody interested in the history of Islamic culture with an insightful look at one of the mathematical world s most neglected figures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BZYMEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collectible Teapot and Tea Calendar: 2000","description":"'Tea and Tourism' outlines the social, political and developmental contexts of using tea culture for tourism.

A lacerating satire, an exorcism of demons, a grotesque cabinet of horrors, it is the Black Book of the Beat Generation, the forerunner of the psychedelic counterculture, and a progenitor of postmodernism and the digital age. A work of excoriating laughter, linguistic derangement, and transcendent beauty, it remains both influential and inimitable. This is the first book devoted in its entirety to William Burroughs  masterpiece, bringing together an international array of scholars, artists, musicians, and academics from many fields to explore the origins, writing, reception, and complex meanings of Naked Lunch. Tracking the legendary book from Texas and Mexico to New York, Tangier, and Paris, Naked Lunch@50 significantly advances our understanding and appreciation of this most elusive and uncanny of texts.

When he committed suicide at the age of 36, Dor  was naturally devastated, suffering the intense anguish of a mother s loss. But she was determined to seek for healing and reconciliation. This book is the first-hand account of how Dor  Deverell made contact with Richard after his death. Encountering the work of the spiritual teacher Rudolf Steiner, she discovered methods by which she could communicate with her son s spirit. Suicides, she learnt, often experience great suffering and regret as a consequence of their premature death. But Dor  was taught how to alleviate Richard s pain, and finally to metamorphose it. These practical steps are described here in an accessible way to aid anybody who finds themselves in a similar tragic situation. In the unexpected conclusion to this extraordinary tale, Dor  finds the person who, she believes, embodies Richard s reincarnated soul. Her work is rewarded with new hope, and Richard s soul is given a chance to learn and develop on earth once again.

The three psuedonymous poets, the Bront? sisters went on to unprecedented success with such novels as Wuthering Heights, Agnes Grey, and Jane Eyre, all published in the following year. As children, these English sisters had begun writing poems and stories abotu an imaginary country named Gondal, yet they never sought to publish any of their work until Charlotte's discovery of Emily's more mature poems in the autumn of 1845. Charlotte later recalled: \\"I accidentally lighted on a MS. volume of verse in my sister Emily's handwriting....I looked it over, amd something more than surprise seized me -- a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear they had also a peculiar music -- wild, melancholy, and elevating.\\" The renowned Hatfield edition of The Complete Poems of Emily Jane Bront? includes the poetry that captivated Charlotte Bront? a century and a half ago, a body of work that continues to resonate today. This incomparable volume includes Emily's verse from Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell as well as 200 works collected from various manuscript sources after her death in 1848. Some were deited and preserved by Charlotte and Arthur Bell Nichols; still others were discovered years later by Bront? scholars. Originally released in 1923, Hatfield's collection was the result of a remarkable attempt over twenty years to isolate Emily's poems from her sisters' and to achieve chronological order. Accompanied by an interpretive preface on \\"The Gondal Story\\" by Miss Fannie E. Ratchford, author of The Bront?'s Web of Childhood, the edition is the definitive collection of Emily Bront?'s poetical works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=remXZrCcGl0C&dq=The+Complete+Poems+of+Emily+Jane+Bront&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Schull and Skibbereen Tramway and Light Railway (Locomotion papers)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jXldGQAACAAJ&dq=The+Schull+and+Skibbereen+Tramway+and+Light+Railway+(Locomotion+papers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attack of the Political Cartoonists","description":"Daryl Cagle presents a collection of political cartoons that contain world views of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States.

By 1939, thousands of Italian intellectuals, teachers and lawyers, journalists and scientists, had fled Mussolini's fascist government and found refuge in Paris. There, amidst the poverty and difficulty of  migr  life, they joined the Italian resistance, founding an underground press that smuggled news and encouragement back to their lost homeland. In Paris, in the winter of 1939, a murder/suicide at a lovers' hotel hits the tabloid press. But this is not a romantic tragedy, it is the work of OVRA, Mussolini's fascist secret police, and meant to eliminate the editor of Liberazione, a clandestine newspaper published by Italian  migr s. Carlo Weisz, who has fled from Trieste and found work as a foreign correspondent for the Reuters bureau, becomes the new editor. Weisz is, at that moment, in Spain, reporting on the tragic end of the Spanish civil war, but, as soon as he returns to Paris, he is pursued by the French Surete, by agents of OVRA, and by officers of the British Secret Intelligence Service. In the desperate politics of Europe on the edge of war, a foreign correspondent is a pawn, worth surveillance, or blackmail, or murder. The Foreign Correspondent is the story of Carlo Weisz and a handful of anti-fascists -- the army officer known as Colonel Ferrara, who fights for a lost cause in Spain, Arturo Salamone, the shrewd leader of a resistance group in Paris, and the woman who becomes the love of his Weisz's life, herself involved in a doomed resistance underground in Berlin, at the heart of Hitler's Nazi empire.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5ojC5oRL_r8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Church Mouse of Saint Nicholas, The","description":"Relates how the song \\"Silent Night\\", was actually inspired by an underweight church mouse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QVFsGwAACAAJ&dq=Church+Mouse+of+Saint+Nicholas,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Artists' Guide to the Gimp","description":"As a full-featured, free alternative to Adobe Photoshop, GIMP is one of the world's most popular open source projects.

Resilience Across Contexts: Family, Work, Culture, and Community presents papers--written by leading scholars in varied disciplines including economics, developmental and educational psychology, education, and sociology--discussing factors that influence resilience development. The authors' research focuses on emerging issues that have significant implications for policy and practice in such areas as employment and new technologies; maternal employment and family development; family structure and family life; immigration, migration, acculturation, and education of children and youth; and social and human services delivery.

With victims, perpetrators and heroes, the Berlin Wall has joined the Holocaust as an essential part of German collective memory. Key Wall anniversaries have become signposts marking German views of the past, its relevance to the present, and the complicated project of defining German national identity. Considering multiple German approaches to remembering the Wall via memorials, trials, public ceremonies, films, and music, this revelatory work traces how global memory of the Wall has impacted German memory policy. It depicts the power and fragility of state-backed memory projects, and the potential of such projects to reconcile or divide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9nrCwwEACAAJ&dq=After+the+Wall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kingdoms Of Elfin -","description":"Chronicles the history of the Elfin kingdoms across Europe, their different peoples, and their varied ways of life, which parallel those of mortals","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DGlbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Kingdoms+Of+Elfin+-&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Italian: Level 1 (Learn in Your Car) (Italian Edition)","description":"If you have always wanted to Learn Italian but have no time, keep reading!

In The Wicked Queen, Chantal Thomas presents the history of the mythification of one of the most infamous queens in all history, whose execution still fascinates us today. Almost as soon as Marie-Antoinette, archduchess of Austria, was brought to France as the bride of Louis XVI in 1771, she was smothered in images. In a monarchy increasingly under assault, the charm and horror of her feminine body and her political power as a foreign intruder turned Marie-Antoinette into an alien other. Marie-Antoinette's mythification, argues Thomas, must be interpreted as the misogynist demonization of women's power and authority in revolutionary France.In a series of pamphlets written from the 1770s until her death in 1793, Marie-Antoinette is portrayed as a spendthrift, a libertine, an orgiastic lesbian, and a poisoner and infant murderess. In her analyses of these pamphlets, seven of which appear here in translation for the first time, Thomas reconstructs how the mounting hallucinatory and libelous discourse culminated in the inevitable destruction of what had become the counterrevolutionary symbol par excellence. The Wicked Queen exposes the elaborate process by which the myth of Marie-Antoinette emerged as a crucial element in the successful staging of the French Revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5s5nAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Wicked+Queen:+The+Origins+of+the+Myth+of+Marie-Antoinette&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex in Elizabethan England Hb","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AdVmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sex+in+Elizabethan+England+Hb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lucky Baseball Bat","description":"Marty loses his lucky baseball bat, and his confidence along with it, and wonders if he will recover both in time to help the Tigers win the championship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o21fAkesWlQC&dq=The+Lucky+Baseball+Bat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bungalow: the Ultimate Arts & Crafts Home","description":"Dissecting the \\"bungalow,\\" the author presents the basics of Arts & Crafts style through hundreds of color photographs, focusing on the unique furniture and lamp designs, as well as the materials used to construct them. 15,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NbiPbKNhGIsC&dq=Bungalow:+the+Ultimate+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jew and His Home: A Guide to Jewish Family Life (2 Volumes)","description":"Intimidated by the thought of taking Western civ?

Attorney Denis Clifford shows you how to: avoid probate leave property through a will or trust use life insurance to provide for your loved ones name a guardian for your minor children leave property to a young person plan for incapacity implement strategies specific to business owners reduce estate taxes make final arrangements This book is for seniors doing end-of-life planning, parents planning for their young children s futures, adult children helping their parents make end-of life plans, as well as readers of any age who want to learn about estate planning. No matter what category you fit into, if you re like most people, you understand that estate planning is a good idea. You know that estate planning ensures that your property will pass to the right people with minimal delay, red tape, and cost. And if you do have young children, you likely know that you need an estate plan to have a say in who will care for your children if you re not around to do it. Perhaps you even know that you can use your estate plan to leave specific instructions about your finances and medical care in case you become incapacitated and unable to make those decisions for yourself. Although you may know all of that, it s all too easy to put off actually sitting down and making your plan. We understand. Estate planning is not easy first, because it forces you to think about your mortality, and second, because of the legal complications and legal fees that often come with it. Plan Your Estate is here to help. This book explains estate planning in plain English, step by step, option by option. Once you know your choices, you can confidently move toward making an estate plan that fits your circumstances and wishes. Plan Your Estate covers these estate planning goals: Leaving property. If you are not wealthy, you might use a simple will or living trust, or both. You can also use co-ownership, transfer-on-death accounts, or beneficiary designations. If you have a large estate, you might also leave property to beneficiaries in more complicated ongoing trusts. No matter how you leave your property, it is better to have a plan if you die without one, state law will decide who gets what. Providing for young children. If you have young children, you ll want to ensure that they will be well cared for if you die before they become adults. In your will, you can name guardians to raise them and managers to look after their inheritance. You ll also likely want to buy life insurance to make sure that your kids have money after you re gone. Planning for incapacity. Part of estate planning is preparing for what would happen if you ever became unable to make medical and financial decisions for yourself. You can use a health care directive to name someone who will make medical decisions on your behalf and to express your wishes about end-of-life care. You can also prepare a durable power of attorney that gives a trusted person control of your finances. Preparing these documents can save your family much heartache. Avoiding probate. Probate is a court-run process for wrapping up an estate. It s often expensive and time-consuming, yet rarely provides any benefit to the beneficiaries. Thankfully, with a little planning, probate is fairly easy to avoid. Trusts, pay-on-death accounts, joint tenancy, and other probate avoidance methods can keep most or all of your estate out of probate, saving your loved ones time and money. Reducing estate tax. Most people won t owe federal estate tax. But if you expect to leave over $11 million (or $22 million as a married couple), you ll probably want to use your estate plan to reduce the tax that your estate could owe after your death. If all this sounds overwhelming, please keep in mind that many people need only a simple estate plan. You may be able to prepare all your documents yourself. Or you might discover that you have some pretty complicated estate planning needs that will require advice from a lawyer. Most likely, you ll find yourself somewhere in between. No matter what your situation, with Plan Your Estate on your side you can go forward informed and empowered to make a smart and effective estate plan. Estate planning is an invaluable gift to yourself and to your loved one. It will feel great to get it done, and you can start right here with Plan Your Estate.

Robert Wilder s hilarious and boldly candid essays about the realities of parenting go down like gin and tonic on a hot summer afternoon.  People A Santa Fe dad shares heartwarming, comic, often ludicrous tales of raising a family in this laugh-out-loud book perfect for anyone who enjoys the edgy humor of David Sedaris or the whimsical commentary of Dave Barry. Waxing both profound and profane on issues close to a father s heart from exploding diapers to toddler tantrums, from the horrors of dressing up as Frosty the Snowman to the moments that make a father proud Robert Wilder brilliantly captures the joys and absurdities of being a parent today. With an artist wife and two kids a daughter, Poppy, and a son, London Robert Wilder considers himself as open-minded as the next man. Yet even he finds himself parentally challenged when his toddler son, London, careens around the house in the buff or asks the kind of outrageous, embarrassing questions only a kid can ask. A high school teacher who sometimes refers to himself jokingly as Mister Mom (when his wife, Lala, is busy in her studio), Wilder shares warmly funny stories on everything from sleep deprivation to why school-sponsored charities can turn otherwise sane adults into blithering and begging idiots. Whether trying to conjure up the perfect baby name ( Poppy  came to his wife s mother in a dream) or hiring a Baby Whisperer to get some much-needed sleep, Wilder offers priceless life lessons on discipline, potty training, even phallic fiddling (courtesy of young London). He describes the perils of learning to live monodextrously (doing everything with one hand while carrying your child around with the other) and the joys of watching his daughter morph into a graceful, wise, unique little person right before his eyes. By turns tender, irreverent, and hysterically funny, Daddy Needs a Drink is a hilarious and poignant tribute to his family by a man who truly loves being a father.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3WsKAU3PAjMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bobbsey Twins on a Houseboat","description":"Freddie, Flossie, Nan, and Bert set sail for fun in this exciting Bobbsey Twins adventure.

Jason Calliner, a tall, attractive man, with dreams of becoming the first Black CEO of Macheaux, Inc., is haunted by a childhood marred by brutal poverty that results in a deep-rooted insecurity. The devastating failure of his formula for success further compounds his inner fears and doubts.

Om aansluiting te vinden op school heeft ze de neiging de waarheid een klein beetje te verdraaien  en te verfraaien. Haar moeder heeft haar op het hart gedrukt nooit de vervloekte lamp van Bharata aan te steken, maar wanneer Aru haar klasgenoten ervan wil overtuigen dat ze geen leugenaar is, heeft ze geen keus. En inderdaad, ze sprak de waarheid, maar daardoor heeft ze nu wel een slapende demon wakker gemaakt die alles en iedereen wil vernietigen.

One of the guests notes an anomaly in the fabric of the venerable edifice: a blackened post that has been carefully built into a trim new window frame. Thereby hangs a tale, one that, as the wise old grandfather who has lived all his life in the house proceeds to tell it, takes one chilling turn after another, while his audience listens in appalled silence. Featuring a cruelly overbearing lord of the manor and the oppressed villagers who must render him service, an irreverent young woman who will stop at nothing, a mysterious stranger with a red beard and a green hat, and, last but not least, the black spider, the tale is as riveting and appalling today as when Jeremias Gotthelf set it down more than a hundred years ago. The Black Spider can be seen as a parable of evil in the heart or of evil at large in society (Thomas Mann saw it as foretelling the advent of Nazism), or as a vision, anticipating H. P.

Dat er een mythe van \`onbegrijpelijk mysterieus omheen is geweven. Dat als ze \`een foutje maken, daar enigszins lacherig over verteld wordt. Dat ze ons uitzuigen en met genoegen laten doodvallen.

Als schepper van nieuwe literaire vormen was hij een unicum. Hij beheerste eigenlijk alle stijlvormen en stortte zich onvermoeibaar van het ene onderwerp op het andere. Hij was zeer bedreven in het samenstellen van kruiswoordpuzzels, schreef hoorspelen, toneelstukken en maakte palindromen. En hij publiceerde een van de merkwaardigste autobiografie?n uit de moderne literatuur: W of de jeugdherinnering. In twee met elkaar parallel lopende verhalen slaagt Perec erin zijn autobiografie te produceren en die tegelijk te doorbreken met fictie die de authenticiteit van de autobiografie niet aantast maar juist versterkt. Centraal staat het verhaal van de achtjarige Gaspard Winckler, een doofstom jongetje dat verdwenen is bij een schipbreuk bij Kaap Hoorn. Iemand die toevallig ook Gaspard Winckler heet gaat naar dat verdwenen jongetje op zoek. Het enige spoor dat wordt gevonden leidt naar het mythische eiland W, een staat waar stringente, maniakale Olympische regels heersen. Maar ook daar worden geen overlevenden van de schipbreuk aangetroffen. De draad in het boek, die over W lijkt te lopen naar de verteller toe, blijkt steeds meer het verslag te zijn van een nachtmerrieachtige jeugd tijdens en na de oorlog. Daarbij gaat het niet om de zoveelste verbeelding van een detail van de holocaust, maar om het beeld van een voor altijd in de vroegste jeugd aangeslagen generatie.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SEwrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cestus Deception: Star Wars (Clone Wars): A Clone Wars Novel","description":"WHAT LIES BENEATH Dispatched as a Republic envoy to the Outer Rim planet Ord Cestus in a bid to halt the sale of potentially deadly  bio-droids  to the Confederacy Obi-Wan Kenobi finds himself enlisted in a mission more desperate, and dangerous, than diplomatic. The once self-contained world has long since been co-opted by unscrupulous offworlders, whose plunder of a vital natural resource has enabled the rise of a powerful corporation that controls the economy. Ord Cestus s native population, the X Ting, are now mere second-class citizens in their own society. Enter the Jedi Knight, with news that a legal technicality has turned the tables and the corrupt forces with a stranglehold on Ord Cestus are now at the mercy of the X Ting. Circumstances, however, are more dire than the Republic suspected. In the wake of a devastating plague, the X Ting s benevolent rulers are dead, and the once tightly knit race has splintered into battling factions. Reunification can only come with the rise of new royals, whom all X Ting are bound by blood to serve. But the eggs that will spawn those sovereigns lie out of reach, secured in a secret chamber and booby-trapped by those whose knowledge died with them in the plague. Now, to salvage a people s destiny, Obi-Wan will risk a veritable descent into hell: braving the unknown horrors in the forgotten depths of an alien world, on a perilous quest from which none who went before have ever returned.

Posner s book gives a remarkable insight, from a family perspective, into the lives of many of the top Nazis and vilest criminals\\"  Sunday Express \\"A mesmerizing, blood-chilling book . . . The contrast between innocent childhood experience, and the awful understanding of that experience that came with time, is enough to make you weep\\"  Los Angeles Times \\"Fascinating . . . A compelling look at the conflicting emotions felt by children of prominent Nazis\\"  Cleveland Plain-Dealer \\"They were the architects of terror but they were also fathers. Now, for the first time, their children speak out . . . a fascinating book\\"  Sunday Mail G?ring. Hess. Mengele. D?nitz. Names that conjure up dark memories of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. They were the architects of the Third Reich. And they were fathers. Gerald Posner convinced eleven sons and daughters of Hitler s inner circle to break their silence. Hitler s Children is a riveting and intimate look inside the families of top Nazis. Based on exclusive and in-depth interviews, Gerald Posner provides an unforgettable portrait of some children ravaged by anger and hatred while others are riven with guilt and plead for forgiveness. This second generation of perpetrators in Hitler s Children struggle with their Third Reich inheritance. In grappling with memories of good and loving fathers who were later charged with war crimes, these heirs to the Nazi legacy add a fresh and important perspective to understanding the complexity of what historian, Hannah Arendt, dubbed  the banality of evil.  Hitler s Children is much more, however, than a series of startling family interviews. It is also a spellbinding insider s look at some of the men whose names have become synonymous with terror. This is a classic book about the second generation of Nazi perpetrators (the only one ever to have family interviews with Hess, Mengele, Donitz, and G?ring.) No other book author or documentarian ever got those children to talk again. And Norman Frank, the eldest son of war criminal Hans Frank, also never spoke to anyone but Posner. Hitler s Children serves as a vivid reminder to all of us of the dangers of ignoring anti-Semitism or thinking it will go away or can't get any worse. These are the children who saw their fathers corrupted by the insidious, centuries-old hatred, and their accounts serve as a clarion warning to us today that all decent people must redouble their efforts against racial and religious hatred. The book, perhaps more timely today than when it was published in 1991, includes a new introduction, explaining why this book is particularly important during a time of rising international anti-Semitism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gQiiDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"International Guide Qualif Education","description":"A comprehensive survey of the education systems of 170 countries and an equivalence evaluation of the qualifications they offer.

More recently, recognition that reasoning in science is probabilistic generated intense debate about whether and how it should be constrained so as to ensure the practical certainty of the conclusions drawn. These debates brought to light issues of a philosophical nature which form the core of many scientific controversies today. Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction presents these debates through clear and comparative discussion of key figures in the history of science. Key chapters critically discuss * Galileo's demonstrative method, Bacon's inductive method, and Newton's rules of reasoning * the rise of probabilistic \`Bayesian' methods in the eighteenth century * the method of hypotheses through the work of Herschel, Mill and Whewell * the conventionalist views of Poincar  and Duhem * the inductivism of Peirce, Russell and Keynes * Popper's falsification compared with Reichenbach's enumerative induction * Carnap's scientific method as Bayesian reasoning The debates are brought up to date in the final chapters by considering the ways in which ideas about method in the physical and biological sciences have affected thinking about method in the social sciences. This debate is analyzed through the ideas of key theorists such as Kuhn, Lakatos, and Feyerabend.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SqTl0LVoH_QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Battle of Arnhem (Great battles of the modern world)","description":"World War 2 account of the tragic nine-day struggle by British and Polish paratroopers to seize and hold the bridge at Arnhem, Holland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dVRnAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Battle+of+Arnhem+(Great+battles+of+the+modern+world)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motorcycling's golden age of the fours","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MwKemgEACAAJ&dq=Motorcycling%27s+golden+age+of+the+fours&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Data Analysis, Regression and Forecasting (Managerial Decision Analysis Series)","description":"This book contains many classic Harvard cases and offers contemporary concept development.

Living in Berlin, behind enemy lines, was full of adventure. Declared fugitives, you had to expect arrest around every corner. There were many confrontations and last minute get-aways. Suspense never ceased. Food and shelter were difficult to obtain. Were it not for some courageous citizens daring to oppose Nazi law, the task would have been impossible. Even with assistance, our little group subsided on the verge of starvation. There was never a dull moment. The Gestapo after us on the ground and the Allied air force in the sky above saw to that.

As his starting point, Peake examines the widespread historical belief that the mid-brain s pine-cone shaped pineal gland activates the third eye described by mystics and seers. Through careful analysis of ancient religious texts and artifacts, he gives evidence that the spiritual properties of the pineal gland have been embedded in myths and cultures across the globe.

Yet the common people knew little of the goings-on there, even though court affairs greatly affected their lives. In this book, we unveil the secrets of the Chinese palace. You will learn about the physical palaces of the various dynasties of China although most of them no longer exist. Meet the occupants of the palace: the emperors, empresses, imperial concubines and siblings, eunuchs and many others, and find out how the notable ones altered the course of history. You will be surprised to know that although authority was vested in the emperor, there were numerous occasions when others, such as the empress, concubines, eunuchs and even imperial siblings around him, supplanted his power. Renowned cartoonist Tian Hengyu now relives these stirring tales with the deft strokes of his pen to shed new insights into Chinese history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ftt6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhode Island","description":"This legendary work consists of alphabetically arranged genealogical tables of approximately 500 Rhode Island families, representing thousands of descendants of pre--1690 settlers, all carried to the third generation, and some--about 100 families-- carried to the fourth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LA7ntaS11ocC&dq=Rhode+Island&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theological Anthroplogy (Sources of Early Christian Thought)","description":"\\"Treated thematically under the headings 'The Gnostic Movement,' 'Christian Platonism,' and 'Fourth Century Developments,' it is possible to see how different ideas of humanity could lead to varieties of theological interpretation.\\"--Donald Skyes","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-wgLngEACAAJ&dq=Theological+Anthroplogy+(Sources+of+Early+Christian+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The bent twig,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UGhHWw6XFtgC&dq=The+bent+twig,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Power in the 21st Century","description":"America wields a combination of military, economic and cultural power that many consider unprecedented. The way America uses this power has repercussions on every major issue of world affairs, including the prospects of regional security, the spread of democratic governance, and the provision of global public goods in economic and environmental domains. This volume explores the questions raised by American power from a variety of perspectives. Is the emphasis laid on military power likely to be self-defeating for the United States in the long run? Is \\"soft power\\" or persuasion a more effective way to promote American interests and goals? How is American predominance perceived in Europe, China and the Arab world? Will it last or will other powers coalesce to resist US hegemony? The authors address these and other fundamental questions in rigorous and historically sensitive analyses of this critical juncture in global politics. The book will be of great interest to students and scholars in political science and international relations, as well as all those concerned with and by one of the key topics of our time. Contributors include: Robert Cooper, Michael Cox, Zhiyuan Cui, Abdelwahab El-Affendi, G. John Ikenberry, Robert Kagan, Mary Kaldor, Joseph S.

Many pamphlets, booklets and even books have been produced over the past century to help with old handwriting and abbreviations, but this new work, written by an author who has for years run courses on the subject, is the most practical and comprehensive yet for family and local historians. There are examples, from the 1400s to the 1700s, of a wide range of hands found in the most usual categories of record used by family historians, such as parish registers, wills and court rolls, and in many others which disclose helpful information on families and localities. Those who use this book will not need to be persuaded of the great enjoyment to be derived from pursuing research into family or local history and the pleasures of piecing together evidence to throw new light on old times. They may also find great enjoyment in the deciphering of documents, the means to that end. For the solitary searcher or a member of a class or local society, this will be the standard work upon which to rely for many decades to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lo1wKQEACAAJ&dq=Palaeography+for+Family+and+Local+Historians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Quarterbacks of Pro Football","description":"It may be true that defense wins championships, but it's quarterbacks who put their stamp on the NFL like no one else.

To this end, the often complex adoption process is simplified to help moms and dads describe \\"what happened\\" to their children. The authors believe that adoptive families should tell their own story in a sensitive but open dialogue. Thus the story is punctuated with several questions to elicit imaginative responses from children about what they think the little girl might do when she gets older.

He is given minimal aid by the governor of the vast territory that is proudly named New France but is in reality still ruled by the Huron, Iroquois, and Algonkin tribes who have roamed it since the dawn of time and whom the French call Savages. His mission is to reach and bring salvation to an isolatied Huron tribe decimated by disease in the far north before incoming winter closes off his path to them.

Eminent French historian Robert Mantran has written of Lewis's work: \\"How could one resist being attracted to the books of an author who opens for you the doors of an unknown or misunderstood universe, who leads you within to its innermost domains: religion, ways of thinking, conceptions of power, culture--an author who upsets notions too often fixed, fallacious, or partisan.\\" In Islam and the West, Bernard Lewis brings together in one volume eleven essays that indeed open doors to the innermost domains of Islam. Lewis ranges far and wide in these essays. He includes long pieces, such as his capsule history of the interaction--in war and peace, in commerce and culture--between Europe and its Islamic neighbors, and shorter ones, such as his deft study of the Arabic word watan and what its linguistic history reveals about the introduction of the idea of patriotism from the West. Lewis offers a revealing look at Edward Gibbon's portrait of Muhammad in Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (unlike previous writers, Gibbon saw the rise of Islam not as something separate and isolated, nor as a regrettable aberration from the onward march of the church, but simply as a part of human history); he offers a devastating critique of Edward Said's controversial book, Orientalism; and he gives an account of the impediments to translating from classic Arabic to other languages (the old dictionaries, for one, are packed with scribal errors, misreadings, false analogies, and etymological deductions that pay little attention to the evolution of the language). And he concludes with an astute commentary on the Islamic world today, examining revivalism, fundamentalism, the role of the Shi'a, and the larger question of religious co-existence between Muslims, Christians, and Jews. A matchless guide to the background of Middle East conflicts today, Islam and the West presents the seasoned reflections of an eminent authority on one of the most intriguing and little understood regions in the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=br74_99YqSIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cairo Geniza","description":"The amazing adventure story of one of the most important discoveries in modern religious scholarship.

Yet, little is known about the reverse role of life expectancy or proximity to death, as opposed to age, for religiousness. This paper provides evidence for the distinct role of expected remaining life years for the importance of religion in individuals' lives. We combine individual survey response data for more than 311,000 individuals from 95 countries over the period 1994-2014 with information from period life tables. Contrary to wide-held beliefs, religiousness decreases with greater expected proximity to death. The findings have important implications regarding the consequences of population aging for religiousness and associated outcomes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KvzkzQEACAAJ&dq=Proximity+to+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture and Power in England, 1585-1685 (Social History in Perspective (St Martins Paperback))","description":"\\"This book integrates recent work by historians and scholars into an original interpretation of how political culture developed during this eventful period.

A second believes she took her own life. The first is her husband, Warren, an aging surgeon who has lost his medical license because of his morphine addiction. The second is her son, Ben, a husband and father who struggles every day to remain sober and avoid bankruptcy. Warren has entered into an arrangement with his son that has since kept Ben financially afloat and Warren supplied with morphine. Ben's wife, Emma, desperately seeks to distance her husband from Warren before their relationship destroys her family. Opposing her efforts is Victor Javier, the mastermind of the arrangement, an immigrant whose cruelty masks a hope for his mother's deliverance. Though Linda Bascomb was once the true connection between Warren and Ben, her memory becomes the specter that polarizes them. As the pain of unresolved history accumulates, their embittered agreement collapses, and in the process destroys one life, changes another forever, and drives both from the emotional and chemical shelters in which they hide. In the inevitable reckoning, Ben and Warren are forced to acknowledge the power the dead exert on the living, the elusive nature of redemption, and the ways the things we lose define us. Sometimes shocking, always incisive, Keith Dixon's brilliant debut novel is a harsh but compassionate portrayal of love and need.

How, then, explain the fact that, after 14 centuries of barely noticeable scientific progress, virtually all of the major discoveries that formed the foundation of modern science were made within a few years of 1600? In It Started with Copernicus, social theorist Howard Margolis answers with a controversial new theory of the psychological roots of the Scientific Revolution. Margolis points out that Copernicus's great discovery was not that the Earth revolved around the sun--since Aristarchus had proposed it 1,800 years earlier--but that entertaining such a seemingly unlikely idea would solve other problems. Thus, he provided a model for Kepler, Galileo, Steven, Gilbert, and others who would go on to lay the foundations of modern science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=utYQAQAAIAAJ&dq=It+Started+With+Copernicus:+How+Turning+the+World+Inside+Out+Led+to+the+Scientific+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slow Burn (Arabesque)","description":"These divas represent the voices of past and future generations, such as Tyra Banks, Terry McMillan, Harriette Cole, Maya Angelou, Iyanla Vanzant, Nikki Giovanni, Dawn Davis, Adrienne Ingrum, Carol Mackey, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks, Shirley Chisholm, Coretta Scott King, Zora Neal Hurston, and Octavia Butler.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jdCAQJwYeXMC&dq=Slow+Burn+(Arabesque)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sax Rohmer's the Island of Fu Manchu","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IrkQAAAACAAJ&dq=Sax+Rohmer%27s+the+Island+of+Fu+Manchu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to play your best golf all the time (Crest book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iSIYzwEACAAJ&dq=How+to+play+your+best+golf+all+the+time+(Crest+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Casey Jones","description":"After loosing his temper, Raphael goes for a walk and meets someone more out of control than he had been.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=glXaBhtk4HIC&dq=Casey+Jones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antiquities of Indian Tibet -2 vols.","description":"Vol. I: Personal Narrative Of A Journey In 1910 From Simla To Srinagar; Through Kinnaur, Spiti And Ladakh.

Situated at the very heart of Europe, Austria has been from time immemorial the meeting-place of East and West. Her sphere of interest extended from Spain to Russia and from Italy to the Netherlands. Vienna was not only the residence of the Holy Roman Emperors, and later the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but it was also a European metropolis. Out of the ashes of 1945 Austria has again risen to be the meeting-place between East and West, politically as well as culturally. Austria's cultural contribution is second to none, notably Baroque architecture and in music the great classical tradition represented by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, and Bruckner. - Back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u-xzAAAAIAAJ&dq=A+Brief+Survey+of+Austrian+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How I Work As a Poet and Other Essays-Plays-Stories.","description":"\\"In Narcissus Sous Rature, Jody Norton argues that Contemporary American poetry's characteristic problematic is the subject's contestation of hir discursive condition. While self-comprehension is a central, recurrent concern in post-literate poetry, most poetries in English since the Enlightenment have conceived their lyric subjects in accordance with the foundational Western philosophical assumption of the rationality of being. However, after Freud, Heisenberg, Saussure, Derrida, and Lacan, conceptions of the lyric \\"I\\" as representative of a more or less permanent, self-conscious, and self-possessed personality, inhabiting an ontologically dependable natural and historical world in a consistent way are no longer credible.\\" \\"The problems of how to conceptualize the psycho-linguistic structuration of the male (putatively masculine) subject and hir relation to hir cultural environment, and of how to represent both the subject and hir relations in a medium - language - that is complexly involved in the construction of both the subject and hir representation (and, in a certain sense, of the subject as representation) emerge, for Contemporary poets, out of an historic moment particularly strongly marked by theoretical developments in extra-literary fields. Norton asserts that the lyric speaker in Contemporary American poetry cannot be understood unless the explicit and implicit dialogic relations between religious, philosophical, psychological, linguistic, aesthetic, critical and poetic texts are made central to the interpretive project.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Although there are a number of publications on case related issues, there is no volume such as the present one, which exclusively looks at case marking, competition and variation from a cross-linguistic perspective and within the context of different contemporary theoretical approaches to the study of language. In addition to chapters with broad conceptual orientation, the volume offers detailed empirical studies of case in a number of diverse languages including: Amharic, Basque, Dutch, Hindi, Japanese, Kuuk Thaayorre, Malagasy and Yurakar . The volume will be of interest to researchers and advanced students in the cognitive sciences, general linguistics, typology, historical linguistics, formal linguistics, and psycholinguistics. The book will interest scholars working within the context of formal syntactic and semantic theories as it provides insight into the properties of case from a cross-linguistic perspective.

While although Spanish piano music is well documented owing to the reputation of such composers as Isaac Alb niz, Enrique Granados, and Manuel de Falla, our knowledge of compositions in the tradition of Portuguese piano music has not fared as well, barring the work of Carlos Seixas (17041742). This obscurity, however, reflects poorly on the history of early piano music in light of the many compositions written for fortepiano on behalf of the Portuguese court during the first half of the 18th century. Indeed, it was in the royal halls of King John V during his reign from 1706 to 1750 where the early fortepiano was frequently heard. In Portuguese Piano Music, Harper explores this rich musical tradition, offering a brief introduction to the pianistic history of Portugal and overviews of Portugal s contributions to solo piano music, piano in instrumental chamber music, piano concerti, piano for multiple pianists including with works with electronics, and didactic piano. While paying close attention to female composers, Harper adds an annotated and graded bibliography that presents readers with a comprehensive inventory of compositions. Appendixes include a selected discography, list of publishers, and other types of critical source information. To further illustrate its contents, Portuguese Piano Music contains a CD on which Harper performs representative repertoire, some of which are world premieres. This work is aimed at pianists, teachers, pupils, musicologists, and music lovers seeking to discover the remarkable world of Portuguese piano music.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qdNqAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Came as Angels","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4qDKAAAACAAJ&dq=We+Came+as+Angels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intolerance.","description":"Tolerance currently occupies a very high place in Western societies: it is considered gauche, even boorish, to question it. In The Intolerance of Tolerance, however, questioning tolerance -- or, at least, contemporary understandings of tolerance -- is exactly what D. A . Carson does. Carson traces the subtle but enormous shift in the way we have come to understand tolerance over recent years -- from defending the rights of those who hold different beliefs to affirming all beliefs as equally valid and correct. He looks back at the history of this shift and discusses its implications for culture today, especially its bearing on democracy, discussions about good and evil, and Christian truth claims. Using real-life examples that will sometimes arouse laughter and sometimes make the blood boil, Carson argues not only that the \\"new tolerance\\" is socially dangerous and intellectually debilitating but also that it actually leads to genuine intolerance of all who struggle to hold fast to their beliefs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fl5gMQEACAAJ&dq=Intolerance.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ideology and utopia;: An introduction to the sociology of knowledge, (International library of psychology, philosophy and scientific method)","description":"The Routledge Companion to the Professions and Professionalism is a state-of-the-art reference work which maps out the current developments and debates around the sociology of the professions, and how they relate to management and organizations.

Along with cognitions, drives, and behavior, affects are one of the modalities that must be interpreted by theory and embraced by therapy in understanding both normal and pathological personality development. Here, John Omaha synthesizes a vast range of information about affect regulation and presents for readers an intervention, Affect Management Skills Training (AMST), that can be used with clients to regulate affects. The first four chapters of this book assemble current empirical and theoretical information about affect into an overall picture of how self-structure emerges in infancy, and what can happen when the infant-caregiver dyad malfunctions. The second part of the book is the center of Omaha's work where he presents clinical skills for psychotherapeutic interventions for affect regulation that are the focus of the book. The seven basic and several ancillary AMST interventions are designed to help clients remediate deficits in affect regulation and to promote the emergence of a more adaptive, positively functioning self. AMST, a bilateral stimulation protocol derived from EMDR, will be of interest to all clinicians working with clients who need to work on affect regulation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UZOTQgAACAAJ&dq=Psychotherapeutic+Interventions+for+Emotion+Regulation:+EMDR+and+Bilateral+Stimulation+for+Affect+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kate's House","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BcuAHAAACAAJ&dq=Kate%27s+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The open mind;: [lectures]","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gRy9AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+open+mind%3B:+%5Blectures%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"5 Underworld 6","description":"Poetry.

This volume is the first modern full length alternative history written about the Waterloo campaign but it does not stop there. First, the narrative seeks to examine and explain the logic behind the French emperor's decisions and, to a lesser extent, those made by his famous enemies. Then, the change in history is seamlessly inserted into the overall context of the campaign and followed to its dramatic climax at the battle of Ohain on June 19, 1815. The campaign of Waterloo was a series of opportunities taken and missed by both sides and the volume shows how a single decision could have changed the course of history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5dmjPwAACAAJ&dq=Napoleon%27s+Waterloo+Campaign:+An+Alternate+History:+Volume+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In a Summer Season (Isis Series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_IDFOyo293wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man O' War","description":"Before Secretariat and Seabiscuit, Man o  War set the standard for horse racing. Walter Farley, the creator of the Black Stallion, chronicles the mightiest racer ever seen on an American racetrack from his surging power and blistering speed to his overwhelming desire to run! Here is the unofficial biography of the  red giant,  from the moment he was foaled through all of his racing triumphs. Winning an astonishing 20 of his 21 starts, Man o  War became a legend, and captured the heart of a nation before he retired in 1920 to sire Hard Tack, the father of Seabiscuit, and Triple Crown winner War Admiral. With his seamless storytelling, Farley tells the life story of the horse most horse lovers continue to regard as America s greatest thoroughbred. Told through the eyes of a fictional stableboy, Danny Ryan, Farley makes the intricate world of the  Sport of Kings  accessible and exciting to horse lovers and racing fans of all ages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BTjl1yJdi40C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Ancestors","description":"Viscount Medardo is bisected by a Turkish cannonball on the plains of Bohemia; Baron Cosimo, at the age of twelve, retires to the trees for the rest of his days; Charlemagne's knight, Agiluf, is an empty suit of armour.

Frustrated by sketchy guidebooks while on a golfing tour, authors Louise and Rick Miracle decided to compile their own definitive guide to Irish links. In addition to its practical travel tips, this book offers insightful essays -- including several by leading figures in Irish golf -- that explain the history and particular character of golfing in Ireland. Vacation planners will especially love the book's extensive, geographically balanced coverage of individual golf courses, presented by way of two whimsically named lists. The Trolleys List contains thorough summaries of 153 courses, including small maps and directions for getting there, scorecard data, descriptions of each course's layout and club facilities, and recommendations on local restaurants and hotels. The Squibs List offers basic information -- addresses, phone numbers, brief descriptions -- about 138 additional golf courses. With Trolleys and Squibs, you can plan a detailed itinerary and make your reservations, even before landing on Irish shores (though armchair travelers as well will gain immense enjoyment from the colorful portraits of the courses and countryside).","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=maLt1kabqFgC&dq=Trolleys+and+Squibs:+A+Golfer%27s+Guide+to+Irish+Links&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Gorgon Graham: More letters from a self-made merchant to his son","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4IE3EAAAQBAJ&dq=Old+Gorgon+Graham:+More+letters+from+a+self-made+merchant+to+his+son&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mafia Fix (The Destroyer)","description":"The Mafia is making a power play on US soil, smuggling in four shipping containers full of the finest Turkish heroin right under the Feds' noses.

It is here that a macabre experiment takes place. Conducted by geneticists at the university, the test consists of the resurrection of two lost souls, both murdered in their times: Jula, a first-century gladiatrix, and Cloudio del Nero, the eighteenth-century composer who met his fate in Lee s acclaimed first volume of the Secret Books of Venus series. An unexplained catastrophe occurs, claiming several lives. Was it merely an accident, computer failure, or has the trial unleashed an airborne virus? Or is there an even more sinister danger afoot, a force from beyond that threatens the survival of Venus itself? To answer these questions, a traveler from the surface is forced to confront mysteries in his own past that have remained buried, and to reveal the connection that ties him to the unavenged spirits wreaking havoc on the doomed city.  The last of the four Secret Books of Venus is a tale of suspense and mystery.

The story of that morning's violence spans the decades and ripples across state lines. It is a story of our nation's racial divide; of southern prison farms and an act of grace; of festering hate and missed opportunities to stop a man going mad. For its coverage of the shootings and the manhunt that followed, the Seattle Times won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for breaking news. Now the newspaper's staff goes deeper, telling the story of a charismatic felon, a minister with his eyes on the White House, and what can lie on the other side of mercy. So often, when someone does something shocking, people want to know: What was he thinking? What was Timothy McVeigh thinking? What about those kids at Columbine? In western Washington, in the fall of 2009, Maurice Clemmons planned to do something shocking. And he left no doubt what he was thinking. The Other Side of Mercy draws upon a stunning trove of records-including a hundred-plus hours of Clemmons' recorded telephone conversations-to describe in remarkable detail Clemmons' past and the steps he took along the way to committing one of the worst crimes in the modern history of the Pacific Northwest. The Other Side of Mercy recounts Clemmons' childhood in a small Arkansas town that had descended into chaos and economic ruin. Racial hostilities were such that sniper bullets flew and buildings were firebombed. Clemmons turned to burglary and robbery, and, at the age of seventeen, was shipped off to a prison farm system so notorious that it was memorialized in the movie Brubaker. Drawing upon a prison file eighteen-hundred pages thick, The Other Side of Mercy takes readers inside the prison barracks and into the fields, as Clemmons racks up enemies, extorting other inmates and waging fights with makeshift weapons. Clemmons makes a plea for mercy to Mike Huckabee, the Arkansas governor who later runs for president. After managing to win his freedom, Clemmons moves to Washington state and becomes both predator and prey, dealing drugs while dreaming of wealth through a variety of fantastical enterprises. He believes Donald Trump will make him rich. That he can game the Bank of America. That a self-proclaimed prophet in New York City holds the key to prosperity. Clemmons descends into madness, while making plans of striking back at the people he blames for his lost youth and uncertain future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ms5s4g_e6zEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Combat cameraman","description":"OVER THE TARGET... The movie camera in my hands was ready as we entered our run over the oil fields of Ploesti.

Through the camera s lens I saw a B-24 fly into a barrage balloon cable. The plane spun, corkscrewed to the ground and exploded. Beyond, I saw another smash into a smokestack and instantly dissolve into a fireball. The heat from the storage tank fires turned the Witch into an oven, searing my hair and eyebrows. I swung the camera to see planes crisscrossing, exploding in air, being swallowed up in the raging fires and curling black smoke.

They just accepted me and permitted me to take their photographs without any self-consciousness.   Roy DeCarava. The Sweet Flypaper of Life is a  poem  about ordinary people, about teenagers around a jukebox, about children at an open fire hydrant, about riding the subway alone at night, about picket lines and artist work spaces. This renowned, life-affirming collaboration between artist Roy DeCarava and writer Langston Hughes honors in words and pictures what the authors saw, knew, and felt deeply about life in their city. Hughes s heart-warming description of Harlem in the late 1940s and early 1950s is seen through the eyes of one grandmother, Sister Mary Bradley. As she guides the reader through the lives of those around her, we imagine the babies born, families in struggle, children yet flourishing. We experience the sights and sounds of Harlem as seen through her learned and worldly eyes, expressed here through Hughes s poetic prose. As she states,  I done got my feet caught in the sweet flypaper of life and I ll be dogged if I want to get loose.  DeCarava s photographs lay open a world of sense and feeling that begins with his perception and vision. The ruminations go beyond the limit of simple observation and contend with deeper meanings to reveal these individuals as subjects worthy of art. While Hughes states  We ve had so many books about how bad life is, maybe it s time to have one showing how good it is,  the photographs bring us back to this lively dialogue and a complex reality, to a resolution that stands with the optimism of the photographic medium and the certainty of DeCarava s artistic moment. In 1952 DeCarava became the first African American photographer to win a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. The one-year grant enabled DeCarava to focus full time on the photography he had been creating since the mid-1940s and to complete a project that would eventually result in The Sweet Flypaper of Life, a moving, photo-poetic work in the urban setting of Harlem. DeCarava compiled a set of images from which Hughes chose 141 and adeptly supplied a fictive narration, reflecting on life in that city-within-a-city. First published in 1955, the book, widely considered a classic of photographic visual literature, was reprinted by public demand several times. This fourth printing, the Heritage Edition, is the first authorized English-language edition since 1983 and includes an afterword by Sherry Turner DeCarava tracing the history and ongoing importance of this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OTnNuAEACAAJ&dq=The+sweet+flypaper+of+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Radon Transform and Some of Its Applications","description":"Of value to mathematicians, physicists, and engineers, this excellent introduction to Radon transform covers both theory and applications, with a rich array of examples and literature that forms a valuable reference.

The authors explore the thermodynamic cycle with calculation, operation regimes and economic indicators and GHG emissions of a vapor compression heat pump. They go on to examine substitution strategies of non-ecological refrigerants and types of compressors and heat pumps, before delving into the different GSHP systems, as well as their compared economic, energy and environmental performances using classical and optimized adjustment for various operating modes. Surface water heat pumps and ground water heat pumps are covered, and special focus is given to both vertical and horizontal ground-coupled heat pump systems, for which modelling and simulation is discussed, and experimental systems are described. Due to its advanced approach to the subject, this book will be especially valuable for researchers, graduate students and academics, and as reference for engineers and specialists in the varied domains of building services. Explores fundamentals and state-of-the-art research, including ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) systems. Includes performance assessment and comparison for different types of GSHP, numerical simulation models, practical applications of GSHPs with details on the renewable energy integration, information on refrigerants, and economic analysis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xk3XCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Howl-A-Ween","description":"Hear the demons wail in the night,","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9sQZMy19bVkC&dq=Howl-A-Ween&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maltese-English/English-Maltese Dictionary and Phrasebook (Dictionary & Phrasebook)","description":"This book includes an introduction to basic grammar, a pronunciation guide, and phrases on all topics a visitor to Malta might need to know.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tbbhk91GH60C&dq=Maltese-English/English-Maltese+Dictionary+and+Phrasebook+(Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spiritual Direction of Saint Claude de la Colombire","description":"A revised, updated edition of this classic work on the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Dr. Tim O'Donnell examines the doctrinal roots of the devotion to the Sacred Heart in Scripture and in the Apostolic and Patristic ages; charts its growth and development through the Middle Ages; explains the enormous contribution of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque; and unfolds the teachings of the Papal Magisterium on the Sacred Heart, including Vatican II and John Paul II. The book also includes photographs illustrating the development of the devotion. Devotion to the Sacred Heart is intimately linked to our response in love to the Eucharistic Christ. It lies at the core of Catholic spiritual life and is the key to effective renewal of individuals, the Church and the world. For those who haven't yet lived this devotion--or who want to understand and live it more fully--they will discover its richness and beauty in Heart of the Redeemer. Years of careful research have produced a one volume synthesis of how the devotion to the Heart of Jesus has developed over the centuries. The result is a moving overview of how the love for Jesus Christ has grown in the hearts of the faithful from Calvary to the present day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Do9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Masters of The Modern Essay","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t0MYMQAACAAJ&dq=Ten+Masters+of+The+Modern+Essay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Practical Navigator, An Epitome of Navigation (Volume II)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tRDIngEACAAJ&dq=American+Practical+Navigator,+An+Epitome+of+Navigation+(Volume+II)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selecting Books for the Elementary School Library Media Center: A Complete Guide","description":"Offers advice on establishing selection criteria, incorporating diversity in elementary collections, and evaluating picture books, fiction, poetry, informational literature, reference materials, and professional books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MZkVAQAAIAAJ&dq=Selecting+Books+for+the+Elementary+School+Library+Media+Center:+A+Complete+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Choral Classics: European Sacred Music","description":"The Oxford Choral Classics gathers together over three hundred of the world's choral masterpieces into a unique series of seven volumes that span the whole of Western choral literature.

He can write with more minuteness of detail, and with a fresher and more life-like coloring. He can write with more confidence, and, drawing from his own experience and observation, is in this respect more trustworthy. On the other hand, he is more liable to be warped by prejudice, to see only the excellences and none of the defects of those with whom he has been identified, and only the defects and none of the excellences of those to whom he has been opposed, to be a partizan rather than a judge, and to make his narration little more than the reflection of his personal opinions or his personal sympathy and affection, hostility and spite. \\"The Church History of Isaac Backus has all the above-named excellences. To a large extent he was an eye-witness of that which he describes; and where not an eye-witness, he placed himself in closest possible connection with it by personal acquaintance with the actors, and by immediate and most diligent and thorough examination of records and other evidence. While it may be too much to say that he absolutely avoided the defects above named, yet his sound judgment, his natural candor and honesty and his elevated Christian principle, have made him as nearly free from them as perhaps any author who has written in similar circumstances.\\" --from the Editor's Preface","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bz5IEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charlie:The Improbable Life and Times of Charles MacArthur","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VbY7xgEACAAJ&dq=Charlie:The+Improbable+Life+and+Times+of+Charles+MacArthur&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The King's peace, 1637-1641","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ARegAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+King%27s+peace,+1637-1641&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Child's First Book of Poems","description":"Contains a collection of poems directed towards children which include, Summer sun, The swan, Three little trees, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MtKY8Zl22h8C&dq=Child%27s+First+Book+of+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let It Shine: Stories of Black Women Freedom Fighters","description":"Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus and sparked a boycott that changed America.

Het oudste boek over manieren:  De instructies van Ptah Hotep , toegeschreven aan de oude Egyptenaren, geeft de instructies weer van een vader aan zijn zoon voor goed gedrag. Elk volk nam zijn eigen regels en normen in acht; manieren zijn door de eeuwen heen ontzettend veranderd, ja zelfs binnen een enkel volk hebben ze op de ene plaats aanzienlijk verschild van de andere plaats, binnen   n en dezelfde tijd. Wat de moslims betreft is het waar, dat veel elementen van islamitische manieren nog steeds de verschillende sferen van het dagelijks leven in de moslimwereld domineren. Niettemin is het eveneens waar, dat vreemde elementen een wijde en toenemende invloed hebben. Dit is hoofdzakelijk te wijten aan een zwakke interactie met het islamitische geloof. Maar het feit, dat er geen standaardwerk over dit onderwerp bestaat, is daar ook debet aan. Dit werk is een reactie op de behoefte aan een dergelijke tekst, dat de details van islamitische gewoontes toegankelijk maakt voor het grootst mogelijke publiek. Het belang van bepaalde elementen van westerse manieren binnen het dagelijkse moslimleven, is voortgekomen uit de recentelijke en voortdurende interactie met het Westen. Maar zelfs voor die interactie op gang kwam, was de islamitische manier van leven onderworpen aan niet-islamitische elementen, vooral ten gevolge van vernieuwingen. Deze uitdaging aanvaardend, moet een moslim zijn raamwerk van gewoontes islamitiseren, door ze af te leiden van de basisbronnen van de islam; de Qoer-aan en de Soennah. Hij moet een onderscheid aanbrengen tussen normatieve islam en historische islam, tussen islam en niet-islam, hij moet op veel gewoontes wijzen, die ongefundeerd zijn in de normatieve islam, maar toch onder moslims de boventoon voeren. Dit gedaan hebbende, zal de weg duidelijker zijn, die islamitische gemeenschappen voor zich hebben liggen: zichzelf te ontdoen van de culturele invloeden die in het moslimleven door de eeuwen heen doorgedrongen zijn. Het belang van onderwijs en training van moslimkinderen om zich in overeenstemming met islamitische manieren te gedragen, te alle tijden en op alle plaatsen, kan niet hoog genoeg geschat worden. Het is te hopen, dat dit boek insja Allah de leemte zal helpen opvullen, die hierboven genoemd werd en als een toegankelijk handboek zal fungeren, om te bepalen welke manieren bij een bepaalde gelegenheid of omstandigheid passen. Voor het gemak van de raadpleging, is elk hoofdstuk puntsgewijs opgebouwd, en tracht om volledig te zijn. Wanneer er onderwerpen behandeld worden, die in verschillende hoofdstukken voorkomen, viel het niet te vermijden dat sommige punten werden herhaald; het alternatief van langdradige kruisverwijzingen vonden we een te groot opstakel voor de doelstellingen van dit boek. Tenslotte is de auteur zijn lezers dankbaar voor enig advies over gemaakte fouten en weglatingen. Reacties dienen gestuurd te orden naar: Dr. Marwan Ibrahim.

In this book Peter Lindert evaluates environmental concerns about soil degradation in two very large countries China and Indonesia where anecdotal evidence has suggested serious problems. Lindert does what no scholar before him has done: using new archival data sets, he measures changes in soil productivity over long enough periods of time to reveal the influence of human activity. China and Indonesia are good test cases because of their geography and history. China has been at the center of global concerns about desertification and water erosion, which it may have accelerated with intense agriculture. Most of Indonesia's lands were created by volcanoes and erosion, and its rapid deforestation and shifting slash-burn agriculture have been singled out for international censure. Lindert's investigation suggests that human mismanagement is not on average worsening the soil quality in China and Indonesia. Human cultivation lowers soil nitrogen and organic matter, but has offsetting positive effects. Economic development and rising incomes may even lead to better soil. Beyond the importance of Lindert's immediate findings, this book opens a new area of study quantitative soil history and raises the standard for debating soil trends.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nOvuCwAAQBAJ&dq=Shifting+Ground:+The+Changing+Agricultural+Soils+of+China+and+Indonesia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"F'Lump's Adventures with Timmy and Tarbaby","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XyrYAQAACAAJ&dq=F%27Lump%27s+Adventures+with+Timmy+and+Tarbaby&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lottery","description":"If I asked you. ?

Through the iconic personalities of Ginsberg, Kerouac, Corso, and Burroughs, along with women writers, musicians, and artists, Christopher Gair charts the emergence and true significance of the group, revealing how their fresh approach to literature and a bohemian lifestyle created one of the most exciting and important movements in American literature. Half a century after the publication of the modern classics \\"Howl\\" and \\"On the Road\\", the movement continues to attract scores of new readers, influencing everything from bebop to the Beastie Boys.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yhq9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Torah Commentators","description":"As author Avraham Yaakov Finkel says in his introduction to The Great Torah Commentators, no words are adequate to describe the Torah. 'Only by actually tasting the words of our sages, by biting into them, can we gain an insight into the profound wisdom and beauty of the Torah. The selections in this book are intended to serve as tidbits to arouse the reader's appetite to study the masters from their sources.' The Great Torah Commentators groups the sages into seven areas of expertise: (1) Torah, (2) Mishnah, Talmud, and Midrash, (3) Halachah, (4) Mussar (Ethics), (5) Chasidism, (6) Philosophy, and (7) Kabbalah. Giants, among them Rashi, the Vilna Gaon, the Chafetz Chaim, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, the Baal Shem Tov, Nachman of Bratzlav, the Ari, and the Maharal of Prague, come to life through Finkel's masterful selection and translation of their writings. Included with the biographies and samples of these great sage's works are their portraits or photographs, and facsimiles of pages of their commentaries. When an authentic sage comments on the Torah, his words are also considered, in a real sense, to be 'Torah' by the student of tradition. And every subjectDfrom the most earthly to the most etherealDis worthy of inquiry. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in The Great Torah Commentators by Avraham Yaakov Finkel","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-LnXAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Great+Torah+Commentators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Killing Bono: I Was Bono's Doppelganger","description":"Longtime friend and reporter, Neil McCormick, reveals childhood and present day stories about Bono and his band, U2. Some are born great. Some achieve greatness. Some have greatness thrust upon them. And some have the misfortune to go to school with Bono. Everyone wants to be famous. But as a young punk in Dublin in the 1970s, Neil McCormick's ambitions went way beyond mere pop stardom. It was his destiny to be a veritable Rock God. He had it all worked out: the albums, the concerts, the quest for world peace. There was only one thing he hadn't counted on. The boy sitting on the other side of the classroom had plans of his own. Killing Bono is a story of divergent lives. As Bono and his band U2 ascended to global superstardom, his school friend Neil scorched a burning path in quite the opposite direction. Bad drugs, weird sex, bizarre haircuts: Neil experienced it all in his elusive quest for fame. But sometimes it is life's losers who have the most interesting tales to tell. Featuring guest appearances by the Pope, Bob Dylan, and a galaxy of stars, Killing Bono offers an extremely funny, startlingly candid, and strangely moving account of a life lived in the shadows of superstardom.  The problem with knowing you is that you've done everything I ever wanted to,  Neil once complained to his famous friend.  I'm your doppelganger,  Bono replied.  If you want your life back, you'll have to kill me.

This shortage, known as the nursing shortage, poses special problems for the Army Medical Department as it strives to maintain wartime readiness and provide comprehensive peacetime care to Department of Defense beneficiaries. History demonstrates that the present nursing shortage is different from past ones in that it has been caused by a host of emerging trends in health care and society at large. Unlike past shortages, experts believe there are no 'quick fixes' to the present, persistent shortages of nurses. Instead, it will require reforms that address a whole series of basic underlying problems. Still, classic studies have demonstrated attributes of magnet hospitals and characteristics of the nursing profession that provide clues to resolving, or at least ameliorating, the nursing shortage for the Army. This paper reviews the national nursing shortage and the history of shortages of nurses to meet Army needs. It examines strategies the Army Nurse Corps has used to correct imbalances in nurse compensation and improve its ability to successfully compete with the civilian labor market for nurses. It draws upon the classic studies and critiques the Army for failing to incorporate lessons learned in devising successful strategies for recruiting and retaining nurses. Finally, it introduces early findings of the Army Nurse Corps Proud to Care Survey and uses them to formulate the author's view of elements that should form the basis for a strategic restructuring of the role, function and organization of Army nursing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RQ6qtgAACAAJ&dq=The+national+nursing+shortage:+Recruitment+and+retention+challenges+for+the+Army+(USAWC+Military+Studies+Program+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Before the Last Dance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YJcgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Before+the+Last+Dance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Buddhist Wisdom","description":"Wisdom Energy is a simple and compelling introduction to Buddhism by two Tibetan lamas renowned for their insight and skill in teaching Westerners.

To have been a fellow-sufferer with him for many years, during which the closest friendship existed between us, a friendship which, owing to the circumstances of our captivity, was necessarily of a surreptitious nature, but which, interrupted as it was, mutually helped to alleviate our sad lot, is I think a sufficiently good reason for my friends to urge that I should comply with their wishes. Apart, however, from these purely personal motives, I need only refer to the fact that the small scraps of information which from time to time reached the outside world regarding Slatin Pasha, excited the deepest sympathy for his sad fate; what wonder, then, that there should have been a genuine outburst of rejoicing when he at length escaped from the clutches of the tyrannical Khalifa, and emerged safely from the dark Sudan? It is most natural that all those interested in the weal and woe of Africa should await with deep interest all that Slatin Pasha can tell them of affairs in the former Egyptian Sudan, which only a few short years ago was considered the starting point for the civilisation of the Dark Continent, and which now, fallen, alas! under the despotic rule of a barbarous tyrant, forms the chief impediment to the civilising influences so vigorously at work in all other parts of Africa. Slatin Pasha pleads with perfect justice that, deprived all these years of intellectual intercourse, he cannot do justice to the subject; nevertheless, I consider that it is his bounden duty to describe without delay his strange experiences, and I do not doubt that whatever literary defects there may be in his work the story of his life cannot fail to be both of interest and of value in helping those concerned in the future of this vast country to realise accurately its present situation. It should be remembered that Slatin Pasha held high posts in the Sudan, he has travelled throughout the length and breadth of the country and a perfect master of the language he has had opportunities which few others have had to accurately describe affairs such as they were in the last days of the Egyptian Administration; whilst his experiences during his cruel captivity place him in a perfectly unique position as the highest authority on the rise, progress, and wane of that great religious movement which wrenched the country from its conquerors, and dragged it back into an almost indescribable condition of religious and moral decadence. Thrown into contact with the principal leaders of the revolt, unwillingly forced to appear and live as one of them, he has been in the position of following in the closest manner every step taken by the Mahdi and his successor, the Khalifa, in the administration of their newly founded empire. Sad fate, it is true, threw me also into the swirl of this great movement; but I was merely a captive missionary, whose very existence was almost forgotten by the rulers of the country, whilst Slatin Pasha was in the vortex itself of this mighty whirlpool which swamped one by one the Egyptian garrisons, and spread far and wide over the entire Sudan.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XXdB9n5uv4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dancing Arabs","description":"A nimble, engaging, unflinching debut novel of a young Arab-Israeli who struggles to rise above larger forces beyond his control. In this debut novel that  rings out on every page with a compelling sense of human truth  (Kirkus Reviews), a nameless anti-hero contends with the legacy of a grandfather who died fighting the Zionists in 1948, and a father who was jailed for blowing up a school cafeteria in the name of freedom. When the narrator is granted a scholarship to an elite Jewish boarding school, his family rejoices, dreaming that he will grow up to be the first Arab to build an atom bomb. But to their dismay, he turns out to be a coward devoid of any national pride; his only ambition is to fit in with his Jewish peers who reject him. He changes his clothes, his accent, his eating habits, and becomes an expert at faking identities, sliding between different cultures, schools, and languages, and eventually a Jewish lover and an Arab wife. With refreshing candor and self-deprecating wit, Dancing Arabs is a  slyly subversive . . . chilling, convincing tale  (Publishers Weekly) that brilliantly maps one man s struggle to disentangle his personal and national identities, only to tragically and inevitably forfeit both.  Despite its dark prognosis, there is a lightness and dry humor that lifts it with the kind of wings its protagonist once hoped for.

In any business, nothing happens until somebody sells something. Nobody pays their mortgages, no kids get sent to college, and no retirements get funded until the salesperson is able to close business and get revenue coming in the door. In a company with a sales manager, the hiring, training and success of the sales people lay directly at the feet of the manager. The importance and significance of this role can well be illustrated by a recent study that shows that 95% of the CEOs in mid-size companies have at some point in their career filled the role of Sales Manager prior to being promoted to run the company. Clearly, this job matters. The hopes and dreams of the entire company depend on the job being done masterfully. The Sales Boss refers to a sales leader operating at peak performance and overseeing a team of people that outperforms the competition. Inside the cover of this book, the reader will begin a journey that will help them take a deep look into the psychology behind getting a team operating at the highest levels.

What might the future look like, and what are the likely ramifications for the United States and the rest of the world? In The Arab Awakening, experts from the Brookings Institution tackle such questions to make sense of this tumultuous region that remains at the heart of U.S. national interests. The first portion of The Arab Awakening offers broad lessons by analyzing key aspects of the Mideast turmoil, such as public opinion trends within the \\"Arab Street\\"; the role of social media and technology; socioeconomic and demographic conditions; the influence of Islamists; and the impact of the new political order on the Arab-Israeli peace process. The next section looks at the countries themselves, finding commonalties and grouping them according to the political evolutions that have (or have not) occurred in each country. The section offers insight into the current situation, and possible trajectory of each group of countries, followed by individual nation studies. The Arab Awakening brings the full resources of Brookings to bear on making sense of what may turn out to be the most significant geopolitical movement of this generation.

Gerald Arbuthnot is a young man on the make, with an American heiress and the post of secretary to the brilliant but dissolute Lord Illingworth within his reach. When he asks his mother to celebrate with them, it turns out that Illingworth is Gerald's father, who seduced and abandoned his mother twenty years earlier. Loyalty weighs heavier than ambition, and Gerald declines the association with Illingworth. This edition, which also analyses Wilde's various drafts and revisions of the play, argues that the playwright here continued to explore the rivalry between an older man and woman for the affection of a beautiful young man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R5vNAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Washington and Baltimore Stories","description":"The bold lines and decorative details of Art Deco have stood the test of time since one of its first appearances in the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925. Reflecting the confidence of modern mentality streamlined, chrome, and glossy black along with simple elegance, sharp lines, and cosmopolitan aspirations, Art Deco carried surprises, juxtaposing designs growing out of speed (racecars and airplanes) with ancient Egyptian and Mexican details, visual references to Russian ballet, and allusions to Asian art. While most often associated with such masterworks as New York s Chrysler Building, Art Deco is evident in the architecture of many U.S. cities, including Washington and Baltimore. By updating the findings of two regional studies from the 1980s with new research, Richard Striner and Melissa Blair explore the most significant Art Deco buildings still standing and mourn those that have been lost. This comparative study illuminates contrasts between the white-collar New Deal capital and the blue-collar industrial port city, while noting such striking commonalities as the regional patterns of Baltimore s John Jacob Zinc, who designed Art Deco cinemas in both cities. Uneven preservation efforts have allowed significant losses, but surviving examples of Art Deco architecture include the Bank of America building in Baltimore (now better known as 10 Light Street) and the Uptown Theater on Connecticut Avenue NW in Washington. Although possibly less glamorous or flamboyant than exemplars in New York or Miami, the authors find these structures along with apartment houses and government buildings typical of the Deco architecture found throughout the United States and well worth preserving. Demonstrating how an international design movement found its way into ordinary places, this study will appeal to architectural historians, as well as regional residents interested in developing a greater appreciation of Art Deco architecture in the mid-Atlantic region.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oFrCAwAAQBAJ&dq=Washington+and+Baltimore+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amazon Spirit: Daily Meditations for Lesbians in Recovery","description":"These 366 daily meditations offer healing words of strength and insight for many of life's most difficult challenges.

It was published in 1955 as The Urantia Book, a 2097-page volume divided into 196 papers. These papers describe God, the grand universe and its many inhabitants, the origin and history of our planet, the life and teachings of Jesus, and the glorious destiny God has planned for every creature throughout his vast domains-an endless life of boundless opportunity and unlimited progress. The Inhabited Universe consists of sixteen papers from the Urantia revelation. It focuses on the many worlds we will encounter as we journey through the universe, worlds teeming with life, both human and superhuman. \\" 'God is spirit, ' but Paradise is not. The material universe is always the arena wherein take place all spiritual activities; spirit beings and spirit ascenders live and work on physical spheres of material reality.\\" (Paper 12, \\"The Universe of Universes\\") \\"Spirit beings do not dwell in nebulous space; they do not inhabit ethereal worlds; they are domiciled on actual spheres of a material nature, worlds just as real as those on which mortals live. The Havona worlds are actual and literal, albeit their literal substance differs from the material organization of the planets of the seven superuniverses.\\" (Paper 14, \\"The Central and Divine Universe\\") \\"There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking.

Goodman travels from contemporary Kabyle Berber communities in Algeria and France to the colonial archives, identifying the products, performances, and media through which Berber identity has developed. In the 1990s, with a major Islamist insurgency underway in Algeria, Berber cultural associations created performance forms that challenged Islamist premises while critiquing their own village practices. Goodman describes the phenomenon of new Kabyle song, a form of world music that transformed village songs for global audiences. She follows new songs as they move from their producers to the copyright agency to the Parisian stage, highlighting the networks of circulation and exchange through which Berbers have achieved global visibility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=of6q6v5Lv7cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rex;: A novel","description":"Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the fiercest dinosaurs to ever roam the Earth.

Complex interaction of environmental factors with natural variations and increasing anthropogenic intervention is reflected in the sedimentary record at varying scales. The understanding of these processes gives way to the reconstruction of the past and is a key to the prediction of future trends. Especially in cases where observations are limited and/or expensive, computer simulations may substitute for the lack of data. State-of-the-art research work requires a thorough knowledge of processes at the interfaces between atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere, and is therefore an interdisciplinary approach.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MD6DBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Forbidden Face (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"Buddhist monasteries in medieval China employed a variety of practices to ensure their ascendancy and survival. Most successful was the exchange of material goods for salvation, as in the donation of land, which allowed monks to spread their teachings throughout China. By investigating a variety of socioeconomic spaces produced and perpetuated by Chinese monasteries, Michael J. Walsh reveals the \\"sacred economies\\" that shaped early Buddhism and its relationship with consumption and salvation. Centering his study on Tiantong, a Buddhist monastery that has thrived for close to seventeen centuries in southeast China, Walsh follows three main topics: the spaces monks produced, within and around which a community could pursue a meaningful existence; the social and economic avenues through which monasteries provided diverse sacred resources and secured the primacy of Buddhist teachings within an agrarian culture; and the nature of \\"transactive\\" participation within monastic spaces, which later became a fundamental component of a broader Chinese religiosity. Unpacking these sacred economies and repositioning them within the history of religion in China, Walsh encourages a different approach to the study of Chinese religion, emphasizing the critical link between religious exchange and the production of material culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C9OFujPWPSQC&dq=My+Forbidden+Face+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Queen & Di -","description":"The magisterial life of the woman whose family's personal intrigues, romances and political rivalries have shaped much of post-war British history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4myXzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Queen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Resolutions","description":"Non-trial resolutions, often referred to as settlements, have been the predominant means of enforcing foreign bribery and other related offences since the entry into force of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention 20 years ago.

Grote steden als Tenochtitl n hadden stromend water en bezaten prachtige botanische tuinen. In Mexico verbouwden precolum biaanse Indianen ma?s volgens zeer geavanceerde teelttechnieken. De Inca's hadden het grootste rijk in de toenmalige wereld opgebouwd, groter dan de Ming-dynastie of het Ottomaanse Rijk.

Mann ontkracht op overtuigende wijze talloze mythen en neemt de lezer mee naar de intrigerende, hoogontwikkelde wereld van onder meer de Inca's, Azteken en Maya's. 'Mann maakt korte metten met het inheemse Amerika van de schoolboekjes: passief, primitief en in de confrontatie met Europa gedoemd te verdwijnen.' NRC Handelsblad 'Mann heeft een mooi en aanstekelijk boek geschreven.' Trouw '[...] een zeer nauwgezette, weloverwogen zoektocht naar het antwoord op de vraag: Hoe zag de Nieuwe Wereld er ten tijde van Columbus uit.'

The Times Tijdens een bezoek aan Yucat n, overdonderd en betoverd door de Maya-ru?nes, werd het Charles Mann in alle omvang duidelijk dat Columbus in 1492 een hemisfeer met mensen en culturen betrad die in alles verschilde van de ons toen bekende werelddelen Europa en Azi?.Mann schrijft voor Science en The Atlantic Monthly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bmIeCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Board and table games from many civilizations","description":"This encyclopedic volume provides the rules and methods of play for more than 180 different games: Ma-jong, Hazard, Wei-ch'i (Go), Backgammon, Pachisi, and many others.

Of is het de levenslange rivaliteit tussen Rye en Julian Ladd? Rye Adler en Julian Ladd leren elkaar kennen op de prestigieuze Brodsky Workshop voor fotografie. Ze delen er een kamer. Ook delen ze de fascinatie voor hun mooie en getalenteerde medestudent Magda, die al spoedig opvalt door haar indringende fotowerk.

When Bertensson and Leyda s 1956 biography appeared, it lifted the veil of secrecy from several areas of Rachmaninoff s life, especially concerning the genesis of his compositions and how their critical reception affected him. The authors consulted a number of people who knew Rachmaninoff, who worked with him, and who corresponded with him. Even with the availability of such sources and full access to the Rachmaninoff Archive at the Library of Congress, Bertensson and Leyda were tireless in their pursuit of privately held documents, particularly correspondence. The wonderfully engaging product of their labors masterfully incorporates primary materials into the narrative. Almost half a century after it first appeared, this volume remains essential reading. Sergei Bertensson, who knew Rachmaninoff, published other works on music and film, often with a documentary emphasis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ExokDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Russian Heritage Cookbook","description":"The diversity of food cultures within the former Soviet Union, with more than 100 distinct nationalities, is overwhelming, but Food Culture in Russia and Central Asia brilliantly distills the main elements of contemporary cuisine and food-related customs for students and foodies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j7MTx_zcIR0C&dq=The+Russian+Heritage+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Vida Te Despeina: Historias de Mujeres en Busca de la Felicidad (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9ZayPwAACAAJ&dq=La+Vida+Te+Despeina:+Historias+de+Mujeres+en+Busca+de+la+Felicidad+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amateur Parent: A Book on Life, Death, War, and Peace, and Everything Else in the Universe!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m10OAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Amateur+Parent:+A+Book+on+Life,+Death,+War,+and+Peace,+and+Everything+Else+in+the+Universe!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing: Unit-Lessons in Composition, 1A, hc, 1964","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z4mLhHfNbScC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man Without a Country and Other Stories","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

This book explores whether that bold ambition was actually realized. Taking Charge is a sequel to the author s landmark work To Show Heart, which examined Indian policy through 1975. George Castile now explores federal Indian policy in the Carter, Reagan, and first Bush administrations, tracing developments triggered by executive and congressional action or inaction and focusing on the dynamics of self-determination as both policy objective and byword in the wake of the landmark 1975 legislation. Drawing on unpublished presidential papers and other archival sources, Castile chronicles the efforts of three presidents to uphold Richard Nixon s commitment to policy change, weighing such issues as the impact of Reaganomics and the advent of Indian gaming. He examines the marginalizing of Indian policy in both the executive and legislative branches in the face of larger issues, as well as the recurring tendency of policy to be driven by a single determined individual, such as South Dakota senator James Abourezk. Although self-determination is roundly advocated by all concerned with federal Indian policy, until now no book has provided a grasp of both its background and its implications. Taking Charge is an essential contribution to the critical study of that policy that allows a better understanding of contemporary Indian affairs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8ZIlEAAAQBAJ&dq=Taking+Charge:+Native+American+Self-Determination+and+Federal+Indian+Policy,+19751993&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cabin II: Return to Winding Ridge","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=khltzgEACAAJ&dq=Cabin+II:+Return+to+Winding+Ridge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cartwheel to the Moon: My Sicilian Childhood","description":"An illustrated collection of poems celebrating the landscape, people, plants and animals, customs, and traditions of the Italian island of Sicily.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q9QDAAAACAAJ&dq=Cartwheel+to+the+Moon:+My+Sicilian+Childhood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"People's Names: A Cross-Cultural Reference Guide to the Proper Use of Over 40000personal and Familial Names in Over 100 Cultures","description":"Your organization has just received a $1 million grant--just write Mr. Wong Chun Hoon, head of the foundation in Taiwan, and ask for it.

These Soviet citizens were mainly prisoners-of-war, forced labourers or part of the population of the occupied territories of the USSR. The Liberation Movement was encouraged by German officers who disagreed with Nazi policy towards the USSR, as their experience showed that treating the population as 'subhumans' (Untermensch) merely increased resistance to Nazi occupation. Throughout the development of the Liberation Movement there existed a divergence of aims between the Russian members who wished to form an army and a political movement which would effect change within the USSR, and its German supporters who merely wished to alter the type of propaganda directed towards the population of the USSR. Catherine Andreyev provides an account of the evolution of the Russian Liberation Movement and examines the motivation of the titular leader of the movement, Lieutenant-General Andrey Andreyevich Vlasov. The main focus of the book is the ideology of the Liberation Movement, the importance of which lies in the fact that it represented the first grass-roots opposition movement within the Soviet Union since the end of the Civil War in 1922. The programme of the Movement reflects issues which would have been raised by citizens in the 1930s had they been free to do so. Catherine Andreyev examines influences on the programme, and the ideas expressed are placed within the context of the pre-war Soviet and Russian  migr  society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ORYvFXeW8OAC&dq=Vlasov+and+the+Russian+Liberation+Movement:+Soviet+Reality+and+Emigr&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Lust Murder: Paraphilia, Sexual Killing, and Serial Homicide","description":"The Psychology of Lust Murder systematically examines the phenomenon of paraphilia (i.e., aberrant sexuality) in relationship to the crime of lust murder. By synthesizing the relevant theories on sexual homicide and serial killing, the authors develop an original, timely, sensible model that accounts for the emergence and progression of paraphilias expressed through increasingly violent erotic fantasies. Over time, these disturbing paraphilic images that, among other things, involve rape, body mutilation and dismemberment, torture, post-mortem sexual intercourse, and cannibalism, are all actualized. Thus, it is the sustained presence of deviant sexuality that contributes to and serves as underlying motive for the phenomenon of lust murder (a.k.a. erotophonophilia). Going well beyond theoretical speculation, the authors (Dr. Catherine Purcell, a forensic psychologist and Dr. Bruce Arrigo, a criminologist) apply their integrated model to the gruesome and chilling case of Jeffrey Dahmer. They convincingly demonstrate where and how their conceptual framework provides a more complete explanation of lust homicide than any other model available in the field today. The book concludes with a number of practical suggestions linked to clinical prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies; police training, profiling, and apprehension efforts; as well as legal and public policy responses to sexually violent and predatory assailants. Comprehensive in its coverage, accessible in its prose, and thoughtful in its analysis, The Psychology of Lust Murder is a must read for any person interested in the crime of erotophonophilia and those offenders responsible for its serial commission. Contributes, in a thoughtful and scholarly way, to the audiences' existing library of books on crimes and criminals Provides new and insightful information on the criminal behavior of Jeffrey Dahmer Enables readers to compare and contrast different models/theories on sexual homicide and serial murder Assists researchers, educators, public officials, and the lay public determine how best to respond to the phenomenon of lust murder","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=agmkfIgbQxUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Salsiology: Afro-Cuban Music and the Evolution of Salsa in N.Y.

This is religious discovery for a postmodern generation  (Philip Zaleski, Los Angeles Times). The tiny, arid Greek island of Patmos is one of the most sacred places in the Christian world a place of bewitching power, where people come for a brief summer visit and end up returning, year after year, for the rest of their lives. They respond to an unexplainable force that they can find nowhere else. Perhaps it is the invigorating  Greek light  that infuses the Holy Island s rocks and hills with a breathtaking sharpness and clarity, dating back to the time when Zeus raised the island from the bed of the sea. Or perhaps it is Patmos s incredible history. Almost two thousand years ago, Saint John was exiled here, and lived as a hermit in the Cave of Revelation, where he experienced a vision that led to the most famous piece of apocalyptic literature, the Book of Revelation. In A Place of Healing for the Soul, BBC commentator Peter France who arrived on the island a hardened skeptic tells how he came to change his life perspective. Learning from the island s gregarious inhabitants and its religious eccentrics hermits, ascetics, monks and nuns he discovered the pleasure and security of living simply and doing without, in a timeless realm where history, myth, and spirituality are endlessly alive.  France, an erudite and amiable companion, who spices his writing with self-deprecating wit and thoughtful commentary on the eternal mysteries of the universe, has created a delight for open, even if skeptical, minds.

William Golding s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L. Epstein, the publisher of the first American paperback edition of Lord of the Flies.

The Proper Study Of Mankind selects some of his best essays in which his insights both illuminate the past and offer a key to the burning issues of today. The full (and enormous) range of his work is represented here, from the exposition of his most distinctive doctrine - pluralism - to studies of Machiavelli, Tolstoy, Churchill and Roosevelt. In these pages he encapsulates the principal movements that characterise the modern age: romanticism, historicism, Fascism, relativism, irrationalism and nationalism. His ideas are always tied to the people who conceived them, so that abstractions are brought alive.

First, they cite the historical record, the art and literature of other civilizations and cultures, morphological studies, cognitive psychology, and the latest research in medical genetics, forensics, and the human genome to demonstrate that racial differences are not trivial, but very real. They conclude with the paradox that, while, scientific honesty requires forthright recognition of racial differences, public policy should not recognize racial-group membership. The evidence and issues raised in this book will be of critical interest to students of race in behavioral and political science, medicine, and law.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mVJPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Christian Ireland","description":"A fully documented history of Ireland and the Irish from the fifth to the ninth centuries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=g6yq2sKLlFkC&dq=Early+Christian+Ireland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Absolutely Amazing Ways to Save Money on Everything","description":"Written by \\"Christian Consumer Advocate\\" Jim Paris, this easy-to-use guide offers biblically sound financial principles and ideas that families can implement to cut expenses and get their money's worth every time.

Entirely modern in its data and conclusions, it reveals the surprising sophistication of certain areas of early science, particularly Babylonian mathematics. After a discussion of the number systems used in the ancient Near East (contrasting the Egyptian method of additive computations with unit fractions and Babylonian place values), Dr. Neugebauer covers Babylonian tables for numerical computation, approximations of the square root of 2 (with implications that the Pythagorean Theorem was known more than a thousand years before Pythagoras), Pythagorean numbers, quadratic equations with two unknowns, special cases of logarithms and various other algebraic and geometric cases. Babylonian strength in algebraic and numerical work reveals a level of mathematical development in many aspects comparable to the mathematics of the early Renaissance in Europe. This is in contrast to the relatively primitive Egyptian mathematics. In the realm of astronomy, too, Dr. Neugebauer describes an unexpected sophistication, which is interpreted less as the result of millennia of observations (as used to be the interpretation) than as a competent mathematical apparatus. The transmission of this early science and its further development in Hellenistic times is also described. An Appendix discusses certain aspects of Greek astronomy and the indebtedness of the Copernican system to Ptolemaic and Islamic methods. Dr. Neugebauer has long enjoyed an international reputation as one of the foremost workers in the area of premodern science. Many of his discoveries have revolutionized earlier understandings. In this volume he presents a non-technical survey, with much material unique on this level, which can be read with great profit by all interested in the history of science or history of culture. 14 plates. 52 figures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C&dq=Cosmology+in+Antiquity+(Sciences+of+Antiquity+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quest for a Maid","description":"Meg Wright is nine when she hides under a table and hears her sister Inge kill the King of Scotland by witchcraft, setting in motion a treacherous power struggle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jy2qNAEACAAJ&dq=Quest+for+a+Maid&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oh Babies!

The term sacred harp refers to the human voice. Brought to this continent by the settlers of Jamestown, this style of singing is also known as  fasola.  In Legacy of the Sacred Harp, author Chloe Webb follows the history of this musical form back four hundred years, and in the process uncovers the harrowing legacy of her Dumas family line. The journey begins in contemporary Texas with an overlooked but historically rich family heirloom, a tattered 1869 edition of The Sacred Harp songbook. Traveling across the South and sifting through undiscovered family history, Webb sets out on a personal quest to reconnect with her ancestors who composed, sang, and lived by the words of Sacred Harp music. Her research irreversibly transforms her rose-colored view of her heritage and brings endearing characters to life as the reality of the effects of slavery on Southern plantation life, the thriving tobacco industry, and the Civil War are revisited through the lens of the Dumas family. Most notably, Webb s original research unearths the person of Ralph Freeman, freed slave and pastor of a pre-Civil War white Southern church. Wringing history from boxes of keepsakes, lively interviews, dusty archival libraries, and church records, Webb keeps Sacred Harp lyrics ringing in readers  ears, allowing the poetry to illuminate the lessons and trials of the past. The choral shape-note music of the Sacred Harp whispers to us of the past, of the religious persecution that brought this music to our shores, and how the voices of contemporary Sacred Harp singers still ring out the unchanged lyrics across the South, the music pulling the past into our present.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FoRhWnsH6c4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Redeeming the Time","description":"It Is Never Too Late to Live the Life God Has for You DIVThe twenty-first century commodity is time.

Bush came into office only after a bitterly contested election result, but has since proceeded to establish himself as one of the most powerful, and one of the most arrogant, of all American presidents. He has involved the USA in the invasion of two Islamic countries, seems determined to impose global American hegemony, and has launched a 'war on terror' which risks perpetuating an unremitting state of crisis. And yet the sources of this enormous power are still shrouded in mystery. He relies on fanatical ideologues, fundamentalist Christians, shady businessmen and right-wing extremists to a degree that will surprise even the most hardened observer. This up-to-the-minute expose, by the celebrated French reporter Eric Laurent - a specialist in world affairs and the author of the best-selling Bush's War - provides a scrupulously researched and at times deeply alarming account of a President who risks definitively alienating America from the rest of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b2_LwAEACAAJ&dq=Bush%27s+Secret+World:+Religion,+Big+Business+and+Hidden+Networks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tontine Volumes One and Two","description":"Spanning 60+ years, beginning on the day Waterloo was won, it is a multigenerational story of 3 families during the Industrial Revolution.

Written in an accessible style, and including a wealth of exercises, this textbook is designed so that it can be used either on courses explicitly focused on morphology or as an adjunct to other courses, particularly in generative syntax and in phonology. The book opens with an account of the phenomena studied by morphologists, an outline of classical problems and an introduction to the earliest models of morphology proposed within the generative paradigm. Its second part deals with the interface between morphology and phonology and includes a detailed discussion of lexical Phonology, and related models, as well as a variety of types of nonconcatenative morphology. Part III begins with a comprehensive introduction to more recent theories of word structure, including inflectional morphology. Subsequent chapters examine the interface between morphology and syntax, exploring the processes which affect grammatical relations, such as passives and causatives. Further chapters examine compounding processes and the morphology, phonology and syntax of clitic systems. The final part of the book includes a full discussion of \\"bracketing paradoxes\\" and closes with a survey of models of morphology and competing views of the place of morphology in linguistic theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eigodiUKzVoC&dq=Morphological+Theory:+An+Introduction+to+Word+Structure+in+Generative+Grammar+(Blackwell+Textbooks+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empire of Debt: The Rise of an Epic Financial Crisis (Agora Series)","description":"In Empire of Debt, maverick financial writers Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggin provide you with the first in-depth look at how the American character has shifted to accommodate its new imperial role; how we have abandoned the private virtues of personal liberty, economic freedom, and fiscal restraint; and how the government has gained control of public life and the economy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=syNISzbqF0sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Control of Spacecraft and Aircraft","description":"Here a leading researcher provides a comprehensive treatment of the design of automatic control logic for spacecraft and aircraft.

The first half of the work is about attitude control of rigid and flexible spacecraft using momentum wheels, spin, fixed thrusters, and gimbaled engines. Guidance for nearly circular orbits is discussed. The second half is about aircraft attitude and flight path control. This section discusses autopilot designs for cruise, climb-descent, coordinated turns, and automatic landing. One chapter deals with controlling helicopters near hover, and another offers an introduction to the stabilization of aeroelastic instabilities. Throughout the book there is a strong emphasis on the mathematical modeling necessary for designing a good feedback control system. The appendixes summarize analysis of linear dynamic systems, synthesis of analog and digital feedback control, simulation, and modeling of flexible vehicles.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3EKXCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spiral of Cynicism: The Press and the Public Good","description":"Why do some citizens vote while others do not? Why does less than half of the American voting public routinely show up at the polls? Why is it that the vast majority of political issues affecting our day-to-day lives fail to generate either public interest or understanding? These questions have troubled political scientists for decades. Here, Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Joseph N. Cappella provide the first conclusive evidence to date that it is indeed the manner in which the print and broadcast media cover political events and issues that fuels voter non-participation. This book illustrates precisely how the media's heavy focus on the game of politics, rather than on its substance, starts a \\"spiral of cynicism\\" that directly causes an erosion of citizen interest and, ultimately, citizen participation. Having observed voters who watched and read different sets of reports--some saturated in strategy talk, others focused on the real issues--the authors show decisive links between the way in which the media covers campaigns' and voters' levels of cynicism and participation. By closely monitoring media coverage among sample audiences for both the recent mayoral race in Philadelphia and the national health care reform debate, the authors confront issues concerning the effects of issue-based and competitive-based political coverage. Finally, they address the question repeatedly asked by news editors, \\"Will the public read or watch an alternative media coverage that has more substance?\\" The answer their findings so clearly reveal is \\"yes.\\" Spiral of Cynicism is a pioneering work that will urge the media to take a close look at how it covers political events and issues, as well as its degree of culpability in current voter dissatisfaction, cynicism, and non-participation. For, in these pages, a possible cure to such ills is just what Jamieson and Cappella have to offer. Moreover, their work is likely to redefine the terms of the very debate on how politics should be covered in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XBd1nKS9wy0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irezumi: The pattern of Dermatography in Japan (Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden, 22)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yuMUAAAAIAAJ&dq=Irezumi:+The+pattern+of+Dermatography+in+Japan+(Mededelingen+van+het+Rijksmuseum+voor+Volkenkunde,+Leiden,+22)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Affixes in their origin and application,: Exhibiting the etymologic structure of English words","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DI220BlvJ40C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let your mind alone, and other more or less inspirational pieces (Armed Services edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CvLXzAEACAAJ&dq=Let+your+mind+alone,+and+other+more+or+less+inspirational+pieces+(Armed+Services+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McGillivray of the Creeks, (Civilization of the American Indian)","description":"This book, part biography and part primary source material, contains mostly McGillivray's correspondence that concerns his negotiations between the United States, Britain and Spain in regard to Creek political and economic affairs.

Hirth and F.R.N. Nabarro. While Volume 11 concentrated on the single topic of dislocations and work hardening, the present volume spreads over the whole range of the study of dislocations from the application by Kl man and his colleagues of homotopy theory to classifying the line and point defects of mesomorphic phases to Chaudhri's account of the experimental observations of dislocations formed around indentations. Chapter 64, by Cai, Bulatove, Chang, Li and Yip, discusses the influence of the structure of the core of a dislocation on its mobility. The power of modern computation allows this topic to be treated from the first principles of electron theory, and with empirical potentials for more complicated problems. Advances in electron microscopy allow these theoretical predictions to be tested. In Chapter 65, Xu analyzes the emission of dislocations from the tip of a crack and its influence on the brittle to ductile transition. Again, the treatment is predominantly theoretical, but it is consistently related to the very practical example of alpha iron. In a dazzling interplay of experiment and abstract mathematics, Kl man, Lavrentovich and Nastishin analyze the line and point structural defects of the many mesomorphic phases which have become known in recent years. Chapter 67, by Coupeau, Girard and Rabier, is essentially experimental. It shows how the various modern techniques of scanning probe microscopy can be used to study dislocations and their interaction with the free surface. Chapter 68, by Mitchell and Heuer, considers the complex dislocations that can form in ceramic crystals on the basis of observations by transmission electron microscopy and presents mechanistic models for the motion of the dislocations in various temperature regimes. While the underlying aim of the study of dislocations in energetic crystals by Armstrong and Elban in Chapter 69 is to understand the role of dislocations in the process of detonation, it has the wider interest of studying dislocations in molecular crystals which are \`\`elastically soft, plastically hard, and brittle''. Chaudhri in Chapter 70 discusses the role of dislocations in indentation processes, largely on the basis of the elastic analysis by E.H. Yoffe. The special case of nanoindentations is treated only briefly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-2VT7se6mo8C&dq=Larson+Geometry+Pe+95&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucy & Desi: The Real Life Scrapbook of America's Favorite TV Couple","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=U3WAEAAAQBAJ&dq=Lucy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Improving Test Performance of Students With Disabilities...On District and State Assessments","description":"\\"Students with disabilities must overcome unique obstacles in order to learn, and the pressure of testing often exacerbates existing challenges.

Crow Shade is a quick-witted college drop-out blinded to his own worth by his drug habit. After stealing three paintings and a manuscript from an artist friend in order to scare up some drug money, Crow finds himself in an eccentric circle of people who open the door to what seems a golden opportunity: access to more drugs, sex, and money than he ever imagined. With a facility that surprises even himself, Crow manages to convince a gallery owner that he's the artist, and the paintings are shown in an exhibit attended by such A-list art-world players and celebrities as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, and even Joseph \\"Rev. Run DMC\\" Simmons -- the author's real-life sibling. As the stakes grow ever higher, all in the pursuit of a good time, Crow begins to worry whether this time he's finally dug himself a hole of deception deeper than he can overcome. Written with an unerring ear for real-world conversational rhythms, Three Days as the Crow Flies keeps readers engaged, wondering if and when the impressive lies Crow Shade strings together -- not to mention the artist friend he robbed -- will ever catch up to him. Exuberant and ingeniously structured, the novel is funny, sexy, and pitch-perfect in its evocation of the textures and vernacular of the now-legendary New York art scene.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nu0c13WNo7MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading Puzzles & Games","description":"Crossword puzzles encourage students in grades three through six to recall facts provided in informational passages on each of the fifty United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-YcmJXI805AC&dq=Reading+Puzzles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kidnaped, and other stories (Penguin series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xHSKHAAACAAJ&dq=Kidnaped,+and+other+stories+(Penguin+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weight Of Numbers","description":"From millions of lives, spinning continents and different generations come three people: Anthony Burden, a wartime mathematical genius destroyed by the power and beauty of numbers; soap star Stacey Chavez, whose anorexic body is a reflection of her fading celebrity wattage and hunger for love; and Saul Cogan, a  60s prankster turned murderous people trafficker.

Rather, I have faith in a redemption witch infallibly secures the salvation of each and every one for whom it was purposed before the foundation of the world, namely the children of God that are scattered abroad, which are such a multitude of sinners declared righteous through faith in Christ that no man can number them. God forbid, therefore, \\"that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ\\" (Gal. 6:14) For Whom Did Christ Die? \\"God imposed His wrath due unto, and the Son underwent the pains of hell for, either: (1) all the sins of all men, or (2) all the sins of some men, or (3) some sins of all men. If the last, some sins of all men, then all men have some sins to answer for, and so no man shall be saved. If the second, that is it which we affirm, that Christ in their stead . . . suffered all the sins of all the elect in the world. If the first, why, then, are not all freed from the punishment of all their sins? You will say, 'Because of their unbelief; they will not believe.' But this unbelief, is it a sin, or not? If not, why should they be punished for it? If it be, then Christ underwent the punishment due unto it, or not. If so, then why must that hinder them more than their other sins for which He died? . . . If He did not, then He did not die for all their sins.\\" (John Owen, ca. 1650)","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ENLmrQEACAAJ&dq=Definite+Atonement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen-Brain Reflections","description":"A sequel to the popular Zen and the Brain further explores pivotal points of intersection in Zen Buddhism, neuroscience, and consciousness, arriving at a new synthesis of information from both neuroscience research and Zen studies. This sequel to the widely read Zen and the Brain continues James Austin's explorations into the key interrelationships between Zen Buddhism and brain research. In Zen-Brain Reflections, Austin, a clinical neurologist, researcher, and Zen practitioner, examines the evolving psychological processes and brain changes associated with the path of long-range meditative training. Austin draws not only on the latest neuroscience research and new neuroimaging studies but also on Zen literature and his personal experience with alternate states of consciousness. Zen-Brain Reflections takes up where the earlier book left off. It addresses such questions as: how do placebos and acupuncture change the brain? Can neuroimaging studies localize the sites where our notions of self arise? How can the latest brain imaging methods monitor meditators more effectively? How do long years of meditative training plus brief enlightened states produce pivotal transformations in the physiology of the brain? In many chapters testable hypotheses suggest ways to correlate normal brain functions and meditative training with the phenomena of extraordinary states of consciousness. After briefly introducing the topic of Zen and describing recent research into meditation, Austin reviews the latest studies on the amygdala, frontotemporal interactions, and paralimbic extensions of the limbic system. He then explores different states of consciousness, both the early superficial absorptions and the later, major \\"peak experiences.\\" This discussion begins with the states called kensho and satori and includes a fresh analysis of their several different expressions of \\"oneness.\\" He points beyond the still more advanced states toward that rare ongoing stage of enlightenment that is manifest as \\"sage wisdom.\\" Finally, with reference to a delayed \\"moonlight\\" phase of kensho, Austin envisions novel links between migraines and metaphors, moonlight and mysticism. The Zen perspective on the self and consciousness is an ancient one. Readers will discover how relevant Zen is to the neurosciences, and how each field can illuminate the other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uZ4fyfH_t9EC&dq=Zen-Brain+Reflections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patterns of Desire : Watercolors by Joyce Kozloff","description":"An artist's exploration of the erotic through an extraordinary suite of watercolor paintings that incorporate both sexual and ornamental motifs from the great art of the world, East and West, in surprising and amusing juxtapositions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MHhTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Patterns+of+Desire+:+Watercolors+by+Joyce+Kozloff&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry and Mudge in puddle trouble","description":"For Henry and his big dog Mudge, spring means admiring the first snow glory, playing in puddles in the rain, and watching the five new kittens next door.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vedBjMZi0m0C&dq=Henry+and+Mudge+in+puddle+trouble&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Badger Games","description":"A criminal couple joins a nefarious underground organization in this novel full of  sharp characterization, vivid scenes, and offbeat humor  (The Oregonian).

See, the devil and his demons like to plant fear in you and feed off it. If you don't give them no fear to eat, they will soon get weak and die. You can't play around with Satan and his evil army, because they are not playing. If they are not playing, well, neither am I. I fear nobody but God.

Veiled Reality provides a detailed view of the reasons why such a questioning arises, a survey of the corresponding conceptual and theoretical problems, and a comprehensive, up-to-date account, useful to scientists and epistemologists alike, of the various ways present-day physicists tackle these problems.The book deals with the E.P.R. reality criterion, local causality, and quantum measurement including relativistic quantum collapse, decoherence theories, consistent histories approaches, and ontologically interpretable theories. Questions bearing on the connection between counterfactuality and realism, intersubjective agreement, and limits of the bearing of the verbs  to have  and  to be,  follow naturally from the analysis and are thoroughly examined. Finally, distinguishing between empirical reality and a veiled independent reality whose only knowable features are structural yields a clue to a plausible interpretation of current physics.Accessible to readers with only very elementary background in modern physics, Veiled Reality offers nonspecialists, including students in physics and philosophy, easy access to basic problems in the foundation of physics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=v2UsAAAAYAAJ&dq=Veiled+Reality:+An+Analysis+of+Present-Day+Quantum+Mechanical+Concepts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Nova Scotia, New Brunswick & Prince Edward Island, 4E","description":"It's a Whole New World with Frommer's.

Bringing together previously unconnected strands of Michaels's thought--from \\"Against Theory\\" to Our America--it anatomizes what's fundamentally at stake when we think of literature in terms of the experience of the reader rather than the intention of the author, and when we substitute the question of who people are for the question of what they believe. With signature virtuosity, Michaels shows how the replacement of ideological difference (we believe different things) with identitarian difference (we speak different languages, we have different bodies and different histories) organizes the thinking of writers from Richard Rorty to Octavia Butler to Samuel Huntington to Kathy Acker. He then examines how this shift produces the narrative logic of texts ranging from Toni Morrison's Beloved to Michael Hardt and Toni Negri's Empire. As with everything Michaels writes, The Shape of the Signifier is sure to leave controversy and debate in its wake.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nW0iAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comedy: Meaning and Form","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r1G0AAAAIAAJ&dq=Comedy:+Meaning+and+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing Gourmet Eat to Beat Diabetes","description":"Use your diet to beat disease and promote wellness with Healing Gourmet Drawing from the latest scientific research, the Healing Gourmet? series focuses on foods and recipes for managing and preventing a wide range of diet-related illnesses.

While Frost's \\"voice\\" is a bit unformed in these poems, the rich ponderings of nature and love are strong, full of \\"sun-saturated meadows,\\" melancholy looks at life and death, and pearly streams. \\"I should not be withheld but that some day/Into their vastness I should steal away,\\" Frost announces in the first poem of \\"A Boy's Will.\\" He follows up this statement with everything from eerie story-poems (\\"Love and a Question\\") to exultant (\\"A Prayer in Spring\\") to melancholy meditations on nature's beauty, love, and broken hearts. \\"Something there is that doesn't love a wall,\\" is the first line of one of Frost's more typical poems in \\"North of Boston,\\" a nuanced work about neighbors rebuilding a wall between them. But then there are poems like \\"Death of the Hired Man,\\" a long conversation between a man and his wife, about a former worker who has returned home to die. Another is just about a mountain, as told by a farmhand. Poets take a while to reach their peak, and Frost was still starting out in these books. That said, it's astounding how good he was even in his first volume of poetry. Most striking is Frost's passion -- his enthusiasm, sorrow and thoughts seem to spill off the page. While Frost is more ethereal, even dreamy, in a \\"A Boy's Will,\\" both collections possess Frost's exquisite phrasing.  North of Boston  just focuses a little more on the mundane, like hotels, farms and strangers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GgnonQEACAAJ&dq=A+Boy%27s+Will&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mercy, Mercy Me","description":"The best-selling Motown artist of all time, Marvin Gaye defined the hopes and shattered dreams of an entire generation. Twenty years after his tragic death-he was shot by his father-his relevance persists because of the indelible mark his outsized talent left on American culture. A transcendent performer whose career spanned the history of rhythm and blues, from doo-wop to the sultriest of soul music, Gaye's artistic scope and emotional range set the soundtrack for America's tumultuous coming of age in the 1970s. Michael Eric Dyson's searching narrative illuminates Marvin Gaye's stellar ascendance-from a black church in Washington, D.C., to the artistic peak of What's Going On?-and charts his sobering personal decline. Dyson draws from interviews with those closest to Gaye to paint an intimate portrait of the tensions and themes that shaped contemporary urban America: racism, drug abuse, economic adversity, and the long legacy of hardship. Gaye's stormy relationships with women, including duet partner Tammi Terrell and wives Anna Gordy and Janis Hunter, are examined in light of the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Dyson also considers family violence in the larger context of the African-American life and how that heartbreaking legacy resulted in Gaye's murder. Mercy, Mercy, Me is an unforgettable portrait of a beloved black genius whose art is reflected in the dynamism of contemporary urban America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VOaCswEACAAJ&dq=Mercy,+Mercy+Me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snowmelt Timberdoodles: and Other Excursions","description":"Memory is the electric skeleton for the visual life.

The letters begin in the poet's schooldays and end just before his death in New York at the age of 39. In between, he loved, wrote, drank, begged and borrowed his way through a flamboyant life. He was an enthusiastic critic of other writers' work and the letters are full of his thoughts on the work of his contemporaries, from T.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden to Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis. More than one hundred new letters have been added since Paul Ferris edited the first edition of the COLLECTED LETTERS in 1985. They cast Thomas's adolescence in Swansea and his love affair with Caitlin into sharper focus. A lifetime of letters tell a remarkable story, each taking the reader a little further along the path of the poet's self-destruction, but written with such verve and lyricism that somehow the reader's sympathies never quite abandon him.

He drives home his brand-new Corvette one day to discover a strange doll on his doorstep. It's a rag doll made entirely of white cloth, with no face or hair or clothes. Where the eyes should be, there are two crossed stitches of black thread. Five sets of crossed black stitches mark the mouth, and another pair form an X over the heart. He brings it into the house. That night, he hears an odd little popping sound and looks up to see the crossed stitches over the doll's heart breaking apart. When he picks up the doll, he feels something pulsing in its chest. Another thread unravels to reveal a reptilian green eye --and not a doll's eye, because it blinks. Tommy Phan pursues the thing as it scrambles away into his house -- and then is pursued by it as it evolves from a terrifying and vicious minikin into a hulking and formidable opponent bent on killing him.

Sylvia Frumkin  was born in 1948 and began showing signs of schizophrenia in her teens. She spent the next seventeen years in and out of mental institutions. In 1978, reporter Susan Sheehan took an interest in her and, for more than two years, became immersed in her life: talking with her, listening to her monologues, sitting in on consultations with doctors even, for a period, sleeping in the bed next to her in a psychiatric center. With Sheehan, we become witness to Sylvia s plight: her psychotic episodes, the medical struggle to control her symptoms, and the overburdened hospitals that, more often than not, she was obliged to call home. The resulting book, first published in 1982, was hailed as an extraordinary achievement: harrowing, humanizing, moving, and bitingly funny. Now, some two decades later, Is There No Place on Earth for Me? continues to set the standard for accounts of mental illness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aRg5AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional Fly Tying, Spinning and Tackle Making Manual and Manufacturer's Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JAOvuQAACAAJ&dq=Professional+Fly+Tying,+Spinning+and+Tackle+Making+Manual+and+Manufacturer%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becoming a Mediator: Your Guide to Career Opportunities","description":"Shows you how to have a satisfying career as a mediator, offering a practical, nuts and bolts guide to breaking into the field and a no-nonsense approach to the reality of current professional opportunities.

I used to take my surroundings for granted, and I didnt always pay close attention to everything there was to notice. Welcome! Welcome once again to another book of poetry and to my wild, creative and imaginative mind. In this second poetry book I hope you find the stories much more interesting, the comedy much more refreshing and that the romance takes you to a few nostalgic moments of your own. You may notice that this second collection of my work is a little different to my first, TRUTH, COMEDY & POETRY for ALL, in that there are not as many love poems. This time around, I wanted to express a little more of my other sides instead of just the romance. So I decided, sure, there is still going to be plenty of heart felt tales in here, but there will be more emphasis on the serious and comic aspects this time around. I also made most of the poems much, much shorter. I wanted to make sure there wouldnt be constant thoughts of, \\"Gee, this poem is a little too long and therefore I am uncontrollably daydreaming due to the length of this study-hall of a poem.\\" Then again, according to my test group, it seems that the long stories here are pretty good. But you can be the judge of that. The reason I wrote my first book was to get others into reading poetry and writing some of their own. However, the reason I wanted to write this second book was because I wanted to know that if I were to die tomorrow, I would leave something behind that could still make people smile or think. I wanted to create something that would last and be appreciated for generations to come. I wanted to leave behind a mark of my existence. And so here is my book. If you havent read my first book, well, I want to start over with a \\"Hello.\\" I am a fairly new poet and writer who will either make you think, laugh or say, \\"My God this romantic material is going to come in handy for the next time I meet someone I like.\\" Whatever the scenario, I just want to remind everyone that we all have three sides to us. We may not show all of them every day, but within all of us exists a serious side, a humorous side and a romantic side. In both of my poetry books I show my different characters, and then some. Especially, in THE V-FILES.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e7iOBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raging Heart: The Intimate Story of the Tragic Marriage of O.J. and Nicole Brown Simpson","description":"Raging Heart is so revealing that the book itself became part of the actual O.J.

Just as packaged microprocessor ICs vary widely in their attributes, so do microprocessors packaged as IP cores. However, SOC designers still compare and select processor cores the way they previously compared and selected packaged microprocessor ICs. The big problem with this selection method is that it assumes that the laws of the microprocessor universe have remained unchanged for decades. This assumption is no longer valid. Processor cores for SOC designs can be far more plastic than microprocessor ICs for board-level system designs. Shaping these cores for specific applications produces much better processor efficiency and much lower system clock rates. Together, Tensilica s Xtensa and Diamond processor cores constitute a family of software-compatible microprocessors covering an extremely wide performance range from simple control processors, to DSPs, to 3-way superscalar processors. Yet all of these processors use the same software-development tools so that programmers familiar with one processor in the family can easily switch to another. This book emphasizes a processor-centric MPSOC (multiple-processor SOC) design style shaped by the realities of the 21st-century and nanometer silicon. It advocates the assignment of tasks to firmware-controlled processors whenever possible to maximize SOC flexibility, cut power dissipation, reduce the size and number of hand-built logic blocks, shrink the associated verification effort, and minimize the overall design risk.   An essential, no-nonsense guide to the design of 21st-century mega-gate SOCs using nanometer silicon.   Discusses today's key issues affecting SOC design, based on author's decades of personal experience in developing large digital systems as a design engineer while working at Hewlett-Packard's Desktop Computer Division and at EDA workstation pioneer Cadnetix, and covering such topics as an award-winning technology journalist and editor-in-chief for EDN magazine and the Microprocessor Report.   Explores conventionally accepted boundaries and perceived limits of processor-based system design and then explodes these artificial constraints through a fresh outlook on and discussion of the special abilities of processor cores designed specifically for SOC design.   Thorough exploration of the evolution of processors and processor cores used for ASIC and SOC design with a look at where the industry has come from, and where it's going.   Easy-to-understand explanations of the capabilities of configurable and extensible processor cores through a detailed examination of Tensilica's configurable, extensible Xtensa processor core and six pre-configured Diamond cores.   The most comprehensive assessment available of the practical aspects of configuring and using multiple processor cores to achieve very difficult and ambitious SOC price, performance, and power design goals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DwXOaCQ2gXYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La plaza del diamante/ The Diamond Plaza (Spanish Edition)","description":"When it began, modern Spanish cinema was under strict censorship, forced to conform to the ideological demands of the Nationalist regime. In 1950, the New Spanish Cinema was born as a protest over General Francisco Franco's policies: a new series of directors and films began to move away from the conformist line to offer a bold brand of Spanish realism. In the 1950s and early 1960s, filmmakers such as Juan Antonio Bardem, Luis Garc a Berlanga, and Luis Bu?uel expressed a liberal image of Spain to the world in such films as Muerte de un ciclista (Death of a Cyclist), Bienvenido Se?or Marshall (Welcome Mr. Marshall), and Viridiana. The emergence of new directors continued into the sixties and seventies with Carlos Saura, Jos  Luis Borau, V ctor Erice, and others. After Franco's death in 1975, censorship was abolished and films openly explored such formerly taboo subjects as sexuality, drugs, the church, the army, and the Civil War. The Spanish cinema was no longer escapist and entertaining but, at long last, mirrored the society it depicted. While established directors like Saura, Bardem, and Berlanga continued to produce distinguished work, the \\"new wave\\" of Spanish cinema included brilliant films by the likes of Montxo Armend riz (Tasio), Fernando Trueba (First Work), Imanol Uribe (The Death of Mikel), and Pedro Almod var (Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown). In the last couple of decades, exciting works by established filmmakers and newcomers alike continue to be produced, including Alejandro Amen bar's Thesis, Jos  Luis Garc 's The Grandfather, and Almod var's Talk to Her and Volver. In Great Spanish Films Since 1950, Ronald Schwartz presents a compendium of outstanding Spanish films from the pre-Francoist era through the Spanish New Wave of the 80's and 90's and into the present day.

Provoked by the need to protect American merchant shipping from the belligerent European nations and the piratical Barbary powers, Congress decided on a programme of frigate building, which included the 32-gun frigate Essex. Designed by William Hackett, Essex was a typical medium frigate of her time. Working from both US and British sources, the author has reconstructed many previously undetermined details of the ship and in passing has rehabilitated the reputation of the designer as one who was responsible for one of the best balanced of that generation's frigates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LLk9eBIXkIwC&dq=The+32-Gun+Frigate+Essex+(Anatomy+of+the+Ship)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cold Kindness: a novel","description":"In this searing exploration of deadly codependency, the author takes the reader on a spellbinding voyage of discovery that examines the questions: Are some people naturally too caring?

It covers such topics as radiative transfer theory, relativistic covariance and kinematics, bremsstrahlung radiation, synchrotron radiation, Compton scattering, some plasma effects, and radiative transitions in atoms. Discussion begins with first principles, physically motivating and deriving all results rather than merely presenting finished formulae. However, a reasonably good physics background (introductory quantum mechanics, intermediate electromagnetic theory, special relativity, and some statistical mechanics) is required. Much of this prerequisite material is provided by brief reviews, making the book a self-contained reference for workers in the field as well as the ideal text for senior or first-year graduate students of astronomy, astrophysics, and related physics courses. Radiative Processes in Astrophysics also contains about 75 problems, with solutions, illustrating applications of the material and methods for calculating results. This important and integral section emphasizes physical intuition by presenting important results that are used throughout the main text; it is here that most of the practical astrophysical applications become apparent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eswe2StAspsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 7: Best Of The Fifties Book 2","description":"The American Comic Book Chronicles continues its ambitious series of FULL-COLOR HARDCOVERS, where TwoMorrows' top authors document every decade of comic book history from the 1940s to today!

Across the arts, artists rebelled against traditional conventions, embracing a commitment to creative autonomy and personal vision never before witnessed in the United States. Paul Lopes calls this the Heroic Age of American Art, and identifies two artists Miles Davis and Martin Scorsese as two of its leading icons. In this compelling book, Lopes tells the story of how a pair of talented and outspoken art rebels defied prevailing conventions to elevate American jazz and film to unimagined critical heights. During the Heroic Age of American Art where creative independence and the unrelenting pressures of success were constantly at odds Davis and Scorsese became influential figures with such modern classics as Kind of Blue and Raging Bull. Their careers also reflected the conflicting ideals of, and contentious debates concerning, avant-garde and independent art during this period. In examining their art and public stories, Lopes also shows how their rebellions as artists were intimately linked to their racial and ethnic identities and how both artists adopted hypermasculine ideologies that exposed the problematic intersection of gender with their racial and ethnic identities as iconic art rebels. Art Rebels is the essential account of a new breed of artists who left an indelible mark on American culture in the second half of the twentieth century. It is an unforgettable portrait of two iconic artists who exemplified the complex interplay of the quest for artistic autonomy and the expression of social identity during the Heroic Age of American Art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KOeODwAAQBAJ&dq=Playboy+-+February+1964&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Happens When Brothers Go To Prison and Leave Sisters Alone","description":"Account trials and tribulations of an African-American woman who fell in love with a man who went to prison and all that she experienced as a result of it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bO1lAAAACAAJ&dq=What+Happens+When+Brothers+Go+To+Prison+and+Leave+Sisters+Alone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comedies (I)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=V-CFuAAACAAJ&dq=Comedies+(I)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Day Trading the Currency Market: Technical and Fundamental Strategies To Profit from Market Swings (Wiley Trading)","description":"Play the forex markets to win with this invaluable guide to strategy and analysis Day Trading and Swing Trading the Currency Market gives forex traders the strategies and skills they need to approach this highly competitive arena on an equal footing with major institutions.

It has been my project to rattle the chains.\\" (from \\"The Revenge of the Poet-Critic\\") In My Way, (in)famous language poet and critic Charles Bernstein deploys a wide variety of interlinked forms speeches and poems, interviews and essays to explore the place of poetry in American culture and in the university. Sometimes comic, sometimes dark, Bernstein's writing is irreverent but always relevant, \\"not structurally challenged, but structurally challenging.\\" Addressing many interrelated issues, Bernstein moves from the role of the public intellectual to the poetics of scholarly prose, from vernacular modernism to idiosyncratic postmodernism, from identity politics to the resurgence of the aesthetic, from cultural studies to poetry as a performance art, from the small press movement to the Web. Along the way he provides \\"close listening\\" to such poets as Charles Reznikoff, Laura Riding, Susan Howe, Ezra Pound, Allen Ginsberg, and Gertrude Stein, as well as a fresh perspective on L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, the magazine he coedited that became a fulcrum for a new wave of North American writing. In his passionate defense of an activist, innovative poetry, Bernstein never departs from the culturally engaged, linguistically complex, yet often very funny writing that has characterized his unique approach to poetry for over twenty years. Offering some of his most daring work yet essays in poetic lines, prose with poetic motifs, interviews miming speech, speeches veering into song Charles Bernstein's My Way illuminates the newest developments in contemporary poetry with its own contributions to them. \\"The result of [Bernstein's] provocative groping is more stimulating than many books of either poetry or criticism have been in recent years.\\" Molly McQuade, Washington Post Book World \\"This book, for all of its centrifugal activity, is a singular yet globally relevant perspective on the literary arts and their institutions, offered in good faith, yet cranky and poignant enough to not be easily ignored.\\" Publishers Weekly \\"Bernstein has emerged as postmodern poetry's sous-chef of insouciance.

While she knows, in general, what to expect, the details that will emerge over the next eight hours are as yet not revealed. What follows, taken from the notes in her journal concerning that day, reflect the vast array of tragedies, great and small, the triumphs, the hopes, and the disappointments of a representative sample of the 20% of American citizens who will, during their lives, experience similar events that will cause them to spend time in such a setting. Events like suicide attempts, incest, murder, profound unhappiness, entrapment by mind-wrenching drugs, failed loves, and bizarre behavior, not confined to the patients alone, that set people apart from their fellows, along with hope and the earnest wish for a better life. This book, all of it true - though the names of the actors have been disguised - describes a burgeoning problem: what is, sometimes loosely and inaccurately, termed \\"mental illness\\" and modern attempts to deal with it. Many of them challenge our best efforts to define what is, and what is not, \\"normal.\\" Their numbers are growing; the cost of their care takes a huge portion of health expenditures.

The good news is that Americans today are living longer, in part because of continual advances in healthcare. But the bad news is that with our aging population larger than ever before, nothing is being done to ensure that we can continue to afford the increasing costs of care. How Medicare with the Bush administration's reforms and a slumping economy will meet the needs of its recipients without adequate financing is among the most pressing issues facing this country today. Daniel N. Shaviro sees the future of our national healthcare system as hinging on the issue of funding. The author of books on the economic issues surrounding Social Security and budget deficits, Shaviro is a skilled guide for anyone seeking to understand the financial aspects of government programs. Who Should Pay for Medicare? offers an accessible overview of how Medicare operates as a fiscal system. Discussions of Medicare reform often focus on the expansion of program treatment choices but not on the question of who should pay for Medicare's services. Shaviro's book addresses this critical issue, examining the underanalyzed dynamics of the significant funding gap facing Medicare. He gives a balanced, nonpartisan evaluation of various reform alternatives considering everything from the creation of new benefits in this fiscal crunch to tax cuts to the demographic pressures we face and the issues this will raise when future generations have to pay for the care of today's seniors. Who Should Pay for Medicare? speaks to seniors who feel entitled to expanded coverage, younger people who wonder what to expect from the government when they retire, and Washington policy makers who need an indispensable guidebook to Medicare's future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4ZWBAHIjtIMC&dq=Who+Should+Pay+for+Medicare%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roots & Wings Workbook - Guided Imagery And Meditations To Transform Your Life","description":"In dit onderzoek wordt nagegaan welke betrokkenheden en identificaties met de herkomst - en vestigingsdiaspora leven bij drie generaties Afro-Surinaamse remigrantenvrouwen.

This revised second edition clarifies and includes additional sources to this study. Here is an open, honest, and refreshing history of the foundational years of the Latter-day restoration movement. You may have heard that Joseph Smith (1805-1844) was the prophet of Mormonism. But do you know the story behind the gold plates? This book examines the background, evolution, conflicts, and sacrifices made by church members. Primary sources are used that cover the unique teachings of Smith, including the scriptures he produced. The newly released Book of Commandments and Revelations manuscript is consulted. The theology of the founding prophet evolves away from the early teachings in the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith made changes to his revelations and also to his early story. This book includes four chapters on plural marriage. If you want to know the history and basis for every church whose teachings go back to the Book of Mormon this is the book.

Some of the animals were injured adults, others were orphaned babies, but all of them were in need of a little help to get them back into the wild. Growing up on a farm, as well as my training as an animal technician, prepared me for many of the medical situations that arose. Gijsbert took every opportunity to sketch, paint, and photograph our temporary guests during their stay on the farm. More importantly, Gijsbert was issued all the Federal and State permits needed to care for birds of prey. Without these permits, we would never have been able to care for hawks and owls. For good reason, caring for these birds is very tightly regulated and closely monitored. Taking an owl from its nest is dangerous and illegal. We have cared for many Great Horned Owls but none of them were like Jackson, the owl in this story. His personality was unique from the very beginning and we know that we were lucky to have shared such a close bond with this wild bird. This is the true story of his life with us.

In these essays, which have appeared over the course of the last three decades, he argues that Western scholars and policymakers have almost invariably underrated the influence of ethnonationalism and misinterpreted its passionate and nonrational qualities. Several of the essays have become classics: together they represent a rigorous and stimulating attempt to establish a secure methodological foundation for the study of a complicated phenomenon increasingly, if belatedly, recognized as the major cause of global political instability. The book opens by reviewing a wide range of scholarship on ethnonationalism. Connor examines nineteenth-and early twentieth-century debate among British scholars on the viability and desirability of the multinational state, the American \\"nation-building\\" school of thought that dominated the literature on political development in the post-World War II era, and the recent explosion of literature on ethnonationalism. In the second part of the book, he shows how progress in the study of ethnonationalism has been hampered by terminological confusion, an inclination to perceive homogeneity even where heterogeneity thrives, an unwarranted tendency to seek explanation for ethnic conflict in economic differentials, and lack of historical perspective. The book closes with a consideration of the inherent limitations of rational inquiry into the realm of group-identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zf9ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cetaganda (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)","description":"Attending a diplomatic ceremony on Cetaganda, Miles and Cousin Ivan get into a heap of political trouble when the late empress' lifelong attendant is murdered, and Ivan gets involved with several beautiful and well-connected aliens","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6lcgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Cetaganda+(Miles+Vorkosigan+Adventures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women Travellers in Colonial India","description":"Drawing on long-neglected travel writings by British women in India, this study looks at different aspects that women focus on as opposed to men, particularly in their encounters with Indian women in the zenana.

Howard Wesley Johnson has been associated with MIT for more than forty years and been a major influence on the modernization and expansion of many of its programs. He will be most remembered as a management educator and as MIT's president during the turbulent late 1960s and early 1970s. The title of his memoirs reflects his central, usually lonely position in those days, trying to hold together an institution often torn apart by the turmoil of the times. Johnson was more successful at navigating the minefields on campus than were many other college and university presidents, perhaps because he was always willing to listen to both sides and because his values were in the right place--against the war in Vietnam, in favor of increased participation in the university by women and minorities, and concerned about environmental issues. As a professor and administrator at MIT, a corporate director, and an advisor to American government agencies and to museums and foundations, Johnson consistently sought both to understand and to apply the principles of good management.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9qpmDJQPEZEC&dq=Holding+the+Center:+Memoirs+of+a+Life+in+Higher+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creatures : A Book of Rhymes About Emotions and Experience for Children and Parents to Read, Talk About and Enjoy Together","description":"Parents reading with their children can provide one of the most valuable and memorable experiences in a child's life.

Le Morte D'Arthur looks back to an idealized Medieval world and is full of wistful, elegiac regret for a vanished age of chivalry. Edited and published by William Caxton in 1485, Malory's prose romance drew on French and English verse sources to give an epic unity to the Arthur myth, and remains the most magnificent re-telling of the story in English.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0jyOAxBoY08C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family Reunion (Center Point Platinum Fiction (Large Print))","description":"The once-beloved matriarch to the grand Annesley clan, Odile Annesley, a self-imposed exile in France.

Zij schreef haar brieven alleen voor zichzelf, tot ze in de lente van 1944 op radio Oranje de minister van Onderwijs, Kunsten en Wetenschappen in ballingschap, Bolkestein, hoorde spreken. Hij zei dat na de oorlog alle getuigenissen van het lijden van het Nederlandse volk onder de Duitse bezetting verzameld en openbaar moesten worden gemaakt. Als voorbeeld noemde hij onder andere dagboeken. Onder de indruk van deze redevoering besloot Anne Frank na de oorlog een boek te publiceren. Haar dagboek zou daarvoor als basis dienen. In maart 1945 stierf Anne Frank op vijftienjarige leeftijd in het concentratiekamp Bergen-Belsen. De enige overlevende van de familie, Otto Frank, zorgde ervoor dat het dagboek van zijn dochter toch gepubliceerd werd. In 1947 verscheen Het Achterhuis. Het is sindsdien een van de meest gelezen boeken ter wereld. Het is in meer dan dertig landen verschenen en er zijn meer dan zestien miljoen exemplaren van verkocht. \\"E n enkele Anne Frank ontroert ons meer dan de ontelbaren die net zo leden als zij, maar wier beeld in de schaduw is gebleven.

Robert E. Lee as he desperately led the Confederate army through the final year of the Civil War (LibraryJournal). By May 1864, Gen. Robert E. Lee had been transformed from a reluctant man who chose to fight for his state over his country into a gray-haired patriarch of the Rebel cause. General Lee was revered by his men, who followed the  Old Man  as if he could hold off defeat by sheer force of will. But as fighting began in earnest once again, Lee could sense a change. The Union army s new commander, Ulysses S. Grant, was not like his predecessors. He was a fighter, he was in Virginia, and he s wasn t going to run. And behind Grant and his massive army were the bedrock pillars of Northern industry and infrastructure. Meanwhile, Lee s increasingly ragged and starving army had little keeping them going except raw courage, determination and belief in their leader. Lee had to take action or give up all hope of victory. Lee s Last Campaign is a triumph of historical research and elegant writing. In this essential analysis of General Lee s military strategy at a major turning point in history, Clifford Dowdey follows the triumphs and tragedies of the Army of Northern Virginia as it entered the final year of the Civil War.

Many go as far as to claim that science is all we need to explain the world. But for Mary Midgley, science, while undeniably a key element in this quest, can never be the whole story as it cannot truly explain what it means to be human. She asserts her corrective view that without poetry (or literature, or music, or history, even theology) we cannot hope to understand our humanity. Reading this remarkable book, which draws equally on both the great artists and poets for its inspiration, the reader is struck by both the simplicity and power of her argument and the sheer pleasure to be gained from reading one of our most accessible philosophers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=maE6PwAACAAJ&dq=Science+and+Poetry+(Routledge+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Finland's Literature (Histories of Scandinavian Literature)","description":"The literature of Finland is bilingual, with lively and extensive traditions in both Finnish and Swedish.

The feeling became a shivery chill when she moved into Rebel's Retreat, the historic cottage built by Confederate General Ashton Johnson. But the shock of seeing the general's portrait and recognizing him as the man of her most passionate fantasies left her with an eerie certainty -- that somehow his ghost was actually there. Soon Margaret was reading old letters and devouring every fact on the dashing Ashton, his engagement to a fickle beauty who may have been a spy, his death at the hands of a Union sharpshooter. But nothing prepared Margaret for the fever, the dizziness, and the shock of waking up in a vanished era -- in Ash's arms. Suddenly alive in a South of scorched earth and tears, she knew this was where she had always belonged...where she had been sent to alter the course of war itself, to embrace a destiny time could not stop and a love death could not deny....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KdlRqqQscqkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With the Stroke of a Pen: A Story of Ambition, Greed, Infidelity, and the Murder of French Publisher Robert Denoel","description":"An account of the murder of a celebrated French publisher takes readers deep into the heart of one of Europe's most famous crime stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y1o-vlAq5pUC&dq=With+the+Stroke+of+a+Pen:+A+Story+of+Ambition,+Greed,+Infidelity,+and+the+Murder+of+French+Publisher+Robert+Denoel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Do I Know?: New & Selected Poems","description":"Presents advice for new mother, covering such topics as breastfeeding, playtime, romance with partners, returning to work, and nursing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C7x2JjkKR80C&dq=What+Do+I+Know%3F:+New&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surmounting the Barricades: Women in the Paris Commune","description":"This book vividly evokes radical women's integral roles within France's revolutionary civil war known as the Paris Commune. It demonstrates the breadth, depth, and impact of communard feminist socialisms far beyond the 1871 insurrection. Examining the period from the early 1860s through that century's end, Carolyn J. Eichner investigates how radical women developed critiques of gender, class, and religious hierarchies in the immediate pre-Commune era, how these ideologies emerged as a plurality of feminist socialisms within the revolution, and how these varied politics subsequently affected fin-de-siecle gender and class relations. She focuses on three distinctly dissimilar revolutionary women leaders who exemplify multiple competing and complementary feminist socialisms: Andre Leo, Elisabeth Dmitrieff, and Paule Mink. Leo theorized and educated through journalism and fiction, Dmitrieff organized institutional power for working-class women, and Mink agitated crowds to create an egalitarian socialist world. Each woman forged her own path to gender equality and social justice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cHMRngEACAAJ&dq=Surmounting+the+Barricades:+Women+in+the+Paris+Commune&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hotel Me: Poems for Gil Evans and Others","description":"Poems deal with music, jazz musicians, inspiration, recordings, the past, love, loss, mortality, and genius","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FhxbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hotel+Me:+Poems+for+Gil+Evans+and+Others&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walker's Building Estimator's Reference Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JSrgnQEACAAJ&dq=Walker%27s+Building+Estimator%27s+Reference+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everyday Comforts: Decorating Ideas for Making Your Home a Haven (Better Homes & Gardens)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iMIZuAAACAAJ&dq=Everyday+Comforts:+Decorating+Ideas+for+Making+Your+Home+a+Haven+(Better+Homes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CANON EOS Rebel 2000","description":"This Canon Rebel was more responsible for introducing autofocus SLR photography to a wide public than any other Canon.

God is great...\\" As we mature, we discover that our prayers are not scripted for us. So how do we learn to pray in a more grown-up way? Creating a Life with God offers us the opportunity to learn and adopt 12 prayer practices. Some of these prayer practices include the general practice of peace and quiet, Lectio Divina, the Jesus prayer, creativity, journaling, and more. The first chapter uses the Desert Mothers and Fathers to focus on the general practices of solitude and silence. The second chapter describes the practice of Lectio Divina. The next five chapters describe prayer practices that focus on the use of the mind to come to know God. Chapters 8 and 9 seek to move us out of our minds and into our created bodies. The last three chapters take us beyond our individual selves to show us how the world and our lives can become part of our prayer life. Along with these prayer practices are historical figures to guide us. Some of these are Julian of Norwich, The Pilgrim (who described the Jesus Prayer), and Ignatius of Loyola. In addition to these helpful guides, Wolpert offers an appendix for step-by-step instructions for practicing each prayer practice either individually or with a group.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wd-kAQAAQBAJ&dq=Creating+a+Life+with+God:+The+Call+of+Ancient+Prayer+Practices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acting Games: Improvisations and Exercises : A Textbook of Theatre Games and Improvisations","description":"A collection of games and music to aid the drama teacher and give ideas for varied classes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Cp-xvnCEgIC&dq=Acting+Games:+Improvisations+and+Exercises+:+A+Textbook+of+Theatre+Games+and+Improvisations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digital Journalism: Emerging Media & the Changing Horizons of Journalism","description":"In this innovative book, experts on digital journalism share their perspectives on what digital journalism is, where it came from, and where it may be going.

She was not a strong, healthy little girl, and had never been able to run about and play; and, as she had no sisters or brothers, or companions of her own size, she was rather old-fashioned, as her aunts used to call it. She had always been very fond of books, and had learned to read when she was such a tiny child, that I should almost be afraid to say how tiny she was when she read her first volume through. Her papa wrote books himself, and was also the editor of a newspaper; and, as he had a large library, Editha perhaps read more than was quite good for her. She lived in London; and, as her mamma was very young and pretty, and went out a great deal, and her papa was so busy, and her governess only came in the morning, she was left to herself a good many hours in the day, and when she was left to herself, she spent the greater part of her time in the library reading her papa s big books, and even his newspapers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CmLrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The King Ranch (Two Volumes)","description":" The new image of the cattle country that emerges from Atherton s pages is no less romantic than the prior stereotype; he writes vividly.   Chicago Tribune Cowboys, gunslingers, and superpowered marshals dominate fictionalized accounts of the American West, but they were minor figures in the true history of the region. In The Cattle Kings, Lewis Atherton restores the leading role to the cattlemen the genuine adventurers who opened the plains, built empires, and brought prosperity, law, and order to the West. This classic history of the West tells the true stories of rugged cattlemen like Charles Goodnight, Shanghai Pierce, the Lang family, the Marquis de Mores, and Richard King, who were attracted by the challenge of the frontier and the astounding economic opportunities it offered. Self-reliant and progressive, these young individualists revolutionized ranching. The new industry transformed the West, bringing law and order to infamous sin towns like Abilene and Dodge City and leaving an indelible mark on America s national history and character. Atherton dramatically recreates the realities and economics of everyday life on the ranches, including the role of women, attitudes toward education and religion, and the philosophy of the cattle region. Now with an updated foreword by Western historian Timothy Lehman, this new edition of a beloved classic reveals the true heroes of the legendary cattle kingdoms that created the West.  Containing little glamour and much neglected history, this excellent book will appeal to students of the West, Old and New, and to addicts of history who prefer fact to fireworks; it belongs in all comprehensive collections of Western Americana.
