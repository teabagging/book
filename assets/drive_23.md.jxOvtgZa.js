And how can it coexist with disbelief in an afterlife? Most modern thinkers hold that afterlife belief serves such important psychological and social purposes as consoling survivors, enforcing morality, dispensing justice, or giving life meaning. Yet the earliest, and some more recent, afterlives strikingly fail to satisfy those needs. In Inventing Afterlives, Regina M. Janes proposes a new theory of the origins of the hereafter rooted in the question that a dead body raises: where has the life gone? Humans then and now, in communities and as individuals, ponder what they would want or experience were they in that body. From this endlessly recurring situation, afterlife narratives develop in all their complexity, variety, and ingenuity. Exploring afterlives from Egypt to Sumer, among Jews, Greeks, and Romans, to Christianity s advent and Islam s rise, Janes reveals how little concern ancient afterlives had with morality. In south and east Asia, karmic rebirth makes morality self-enforcing and raises a new problem: how to stop re-dying. The British enlightenment, Janes argues, invented the now widespread wish-fulfilling afterlife and illustrates how afterlives change. She also considers the surprising afterlife of afterlives among modern artists and writers who no longer believe in worlds beyond this one. Drawing on a variety of religious traditions; contemporary literature and film; primatology; cognitive science; and evolutionary psychology, Janes shows that in asking what happens after we die, we define the worlds we inhabit and the values by which we live.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0UpBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Original Intent & the Framers of the Constitution","description":"In their own words, the Supreme Court has become \\"a national theology board,\\" \\"a super board of education,\\" and amateur psychologists on a \\"psycho-journey.\\" The result has been a virtual rewriting of the liberties enumerated in the Constitution. A direct victim of this judicial micromanagement has been the religious aspect of the First Amendment. For example, the Court now interprets that Amendment under: a \\"Lemon Test\\" absurdly requiring religious expression to be secular, an \\"Endorsement Test\\" pursuing an impossible neutrality between religion and secularism, and a \\"Psychological Coercion Test\\" allowing a single dissenter to silence an entire community's religious expression. Additional casualties of judicial activism have included protections for State's rights, local controls, separation of powers, legislative supremacy, and numerous other constitutional provisions. Why did earlier Courts protect these powers for generations, and what has caused their erosion by contemporary Courts? Original Intent answers these questions. By relying on thousands of primary sources, Original Intent documents (in the Founding Fathers' own words) not only the plan for limited government originally set forth in the Constitution and Bill of Rights but how that vision can once again become reality.

But there is another truth: the longing for oblivion. With pain, wit, and humor, the art of Samuel Beckett variously embodies this truth, this ancient enduring belief that it is better to be dead than alive, best of all never to have been born. Beckett is the supreme writer of an age which has created new possibilities and impossibilities even in the matter of death and its definition--an age of transplants and life-support. But how does a writer give life to dismay at life itself, to the not unwelcome encroachments of death, when it is for the life, the vitality of their language that we value writers? Beckett became himself as a writer when he realized in his very words a principle of death: in clich s, which are dead but won't lie down; in a dead language and its memento mori; in words which mean their own opposites, like cleaving; and in what Beckett called a syntax of weakness. This artful study explores the relation between deep convictions about life or death and the incarnations which these take in the exact turns of a great writer, the realizations of an Irishman who wrote in English and in French, two languages with different apprehensions of life and of death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q1FaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Beckett%27s+Dying+Words:+The+Clarendon+Lectures+1990+(Clarendon+Lectures+in+English)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conflicting Visions: Spiritual Possibilities of Modern Israel","description":"Looks at the issues facing Judaism today, the religious significance of Israel, divisions between Orthodox and secular Jews, and the quest for peace","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vb3XAAAAMAAJ&dq=Conflicting+Visions:+Spiritual+Possibilities+of+Modern+Israel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Syllabus of medical history (Historia medicinae)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qd3UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Syllabus+of+medical+history+(Historia+medicinae)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intended for Pleasure","description":"Combines scriptural teachings on love and marriage with the latest medical information on human sexuality to lead Christian couples to a full awareness of the pleasures that can be found in sexual union","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_O2WUphPbLwC&dq=Intended+for+Pleasure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acadian-Cajun Genealogy: Step by Step","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=keE7AAAACAAJ&dq=Acadian-Cajun+Genealogy:+Step+by+Step&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do Butterflies Carry Spare Parts?","description":"This book recounts Malcolm's determined journey to become the person he expected himself to be . . . and the miraculous developmental therapy he used to grow into a trim, buoyant teenager.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DwkIAAAACAAJ&dq=Do+Butterflies+Carry+Spare+Parts%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century","description":"Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner has been acclaimed as the most influential educational theorist since John Dewey. His ideas about intelligence and creativity - explicated in such bestselling books as Frames of Mind and Multiple Intelligences (over 200,000 copies in print combined) - have revolutionized our thinking.In his groundbreaking 1983 book Frames of Mind, Howard Gardner first introduced the theory of multiple intelligences, which posits that intelligence is more than a single property of the human mind. That theory has become widely accepted as one of the seminal ideas of the twentieth century and continues to attract attention all over the world.Now in Intelligence Reframed, Gardner provides a much-needed report on the theory, its evolution and revisions. He offers practical guidance on the educational uses of the theory and responds to the critiques leveled against him. He also introduces two new intelligences (existential intelligence and naturalist intelligence) and argues that the concept of intelligence should be broadened, but not so absurdly that it includes every human virtue and value. Ultimately, argues Gardner, possessing a basic set of seven or eight intelligences is not only a unique trademark of the human species, but also perhaps even a working definition of the species. Gardner also offers provocative ideas about creativity, leadership, and moral excellence, and speculates about the relationship between multiple intelligences and the world of work in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pU4gAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not Working: Latina Immigrants, Low-Wage Jobs, and the Failure of Welfare Reform","description":"Not Working chronicles the devastating effects of the 1996 welfare reform legislation that ended welfare as we know it. For those who now receive public assistance,  work  means pleading with supervisors for full-time hours, juggling ever-changing work schedules, and shuffling between dead-end jobs that leave one physically and psychically exhausted. Through vivid story-telling and pointed analysis, Not Working profiles the day-to-day struggles of Mexican immigrant women in the Los Angeles area, showing the increased vulnerability they face in the welfare office and labor market. The new  work first  policies now enacted impose time limits and mandate work requirements for those receiving public assistance, yet fail to offer real job training or needed childcare options, ultimately causing many families to fall deeper below the poverty line. Not Working shows that the new  welfare-to-work  regime has produced tremendous instability and insecurity for these women and their children. Moreover, the authors argue that the new politics of welfare enable greater infringements of rights and liberty for many of America's most vulnerable and constitute a crucial component of the broader assault on American citizenship. In short, the new welfare is not working.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3t9ClgW_s6IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abstracts of the Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C1BlWTeM3rwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daniel Boone: The pioneer of Kentucky","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ufMzAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Primary Colors: Three Essays","description":"A fascinating cultural history, these splendid essays on the three primary colors--blue, yellow, and red--extend to the artistic, literary, linguistic, botanical, cinematic, aesthetic, religious, scientific, culinary, climatological, and emotional dimensions of each color.

This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VEdmCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michelin Hungary Map #732 National (Michelin Maps) (English and Hungarian Edition)","description":"Renowned for over 100 years for their clear, accurate and easy-to-read mapping, Michelin country maps give travelers an overall picture of their route, with practical road and travel information; and city maps containing extensive street indexes orient them quickly so they can find their way to their destination.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oBDDsgEACAAJ&dq=Michelin+Hungary+Map&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wildcats of Exeter: Volume VIII of the Domesday Books (Domesday Books (St. Martins))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mvy2GwAACAAJ&dq=The+Wildcats+of+Exeter:+Volume+VIII+of+the+Domesday+Books+(Domesday+Books+(St.+Martins))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The butternut guerillas: A story of Grierson's raid","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=saOxPwAACAAJ&dq=The+butternut+guerillas:+A+story+of+Grierson%27s+raid&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Way Home","description":"Christopher Flynn is trying to get it right.

Parent bases his argument on three historical developments: the expropriation of Powhatan lands, the switch from indentured to slave labor, and the burgeoning tobacco trade. He argues that these were the result of calculated moves on the part of an emerging great planter class seeking to consolidate power through large landholdings and the labor to make them productive. To preserve their economic and social gains, this planter class inscribed racial slavery into law. The ensuing racial and class tensions led elite planters to mythologize their position as gentlemen of pastoral virtue immune to competition and corruption. To further this benevolent image, they implemented a plan to Christianize slaves and thereby render them submissive. According to Parent, by the 1720s the Virginia gentry projected a distinctive cultural ethos that buffered them from their uncertain hold on authority, threatened both by rising imperial control and by black resistance, which exploded in the Chesapeake Rebellion of 1730.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y6QVAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Atlantic Liners 1925-70","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UzEAYgEACAAJ&dq=The+Atlantic+Liners+1925-70&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Windows 2000 Professional","description":"Begin with a thorough explanation of the Windows 2000 operating system and then dive into some of the most popular Windows features and related programs.

This federal agency was chartered to research insects and birds but'because of various pressures'morphed into a political powerhouse operating wildlife-extermination programs. Drawing on deep research and wide reading, Robinson's narrative follows the wolves from the eras of explorers and mountain men through the wolves' 120-year entanglement with the federal government. He shares the parallel story of the Survey's rise, detailing the forces that allowed extermination programs to continue'despite opposition from hunters, animal lovers, scientists, environmentalists, and presidents'though the agency's mission and even its name changed.

From the explorer to the pioneer, the swagman to the drover's wife, with a few bushrangers for good measure, Europeans play all the leading roles. A rare exception is the redoubtable tracker. With skills passed down over millennia, trackers could trace the movements of people across vast swathes of country. Celebrated as saviours of lost children and disoriented adults, and finders of missing livestock, they were also cursed by robbers on the run. Trackers live in the collective memory as one of the few examples of Aboriginal people's skills being sought after in colonial society. In New South Wales alone, more than a thousand Aboriginal men and a smaller number of women toiled for authorities across the state after 1862. This book tells the often unlikely stories of trackers including Billy Bogan, Jimmy Governor, Tommy Gordon, Frank Williams and Alec Riley. Through his work on native title claims, historian Michael Bennett realised that the role of trackers - and how they moved between two worlds - has been largely unacknowledged. His important book reveals that their work grew out of traditional society and was sustained by the vast family networks that endure to this day. Pathfinders brings the skilled and diverse work of trackers not only to the forefront of law enforcement history but to the general shared histories of black and white Australia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iDxBxwEACAAJ&dq=Bennett+and+the+Pathfinders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PsychoCybernetics","description":"Cybernetics (loosely translated from the Greek):  a helmsman who steers his ship to port.  Psycho-Cybernetics is a term coined by Dr. Maxwell Maltz, which means,  steering your mind to a productive, useful goal so you can reach the greatest port in the world, peace of mind.  Since its first publication in 1960, Maltz s landmark bestseller has inspired and enhanced the lives of more than 30 million readers. In this updated edition, with a new introduction and editorial commentary by Matt Furey, president of the Psycho-Cybernetics Foundation, the original text has been annotated and amplified to make Maltz s message even more relevant for the contemporary reader.  Before the mind can work efficiently, we must develop our perception of the outcomes we expect to reach. Maxwell Maltz calls this Psycho-Cybernetics; when the mind has a defined target it can focus and direct and refocus and redirect until it reaches its intended goal.   Tony Robbins (from Unlimited Power) Maltz was the first researcher and author to explain how the self-image (a term he popularized) has complete control over an individual s ability to achieve (or fail to achieve) any goal. And he developed techniques for improving and managing self-image visualization, mental rehearsal, relaxation which have informed and inspired countless motivational gurus, sports psychologists, and self-help practitioners for more than fifty years. The teachings of Psycho-Cybernetics are timeless because they are based on solid science and provide a prescription for thinking and acting that lead to quantifiable results.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hJpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=PsychoCybernetics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The White Stag.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers","description":"On December 11, 1941, All-American football player Dave Schreiner wrote to his parents, \\"I'm not going to sit here snug as a bug, playing football, when others are giving their lives for their country. ...

Meet Ben Dane: brilliant, devastating, devoted, honest to a fault (truly, a fault). His Broadway theater baron father is dead--but by purpose or accident? The question rips him apart. Unable to face alone his mother's ghastly remarriage to his uncle, Ben turns to his dearest friend, Horatio Patel, whom he hasn't seen since their relationship changed forever from platonic to something...other. Loyal to a fault (truly, a fault), Horatio is on the first flight to NYC when he finds himself next to a sly tailor who portends inevitable disaster. And who seems ominously like an architect of mayhem himself. Meanwhile, Ben's ex-fianc  Lia, sundered her from her loved ones thanks to her addiction recovery and torn from her art, has been drawn into the fold of three florists from New Orleans--seemingly ageless sisters who teach her the language of flowers, and whose magical bouquets hold both curses and cures.

But in the masterful hands of Lyndsay Faye, the story we all know has abundant surprises in store. Impish, captivating, and achingly romantic, this is Hamlet as you've never seen it before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IPc3EAAAQBAJ&dq=KING+OF+INFINITE+SPACE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"VIETNAM 68: JACK'S JOURNAL","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SN0UAQAAIAAJ&dq=VIETNAM+68:+JACK%27S+JOURNAL&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency","description":"Argues that the \\"lean and mean\\" corporate model of workaholism and downsizing is proving counterproductive, explaining how companies can implement downtime, promote flexibility, and foster creativity as part of realizing increased revenues.

When poisoning and black magic became widespread, arrests followed. Suspects included those among the highest ranks of society. Many were tortured and numerous executions resulted. The 1676 torture and execution of the Marquise de Brinvilliers marked the start of the scandal which rocked the foundations of French society and sent shock waves through all of Europe. Convicted of conspiring with her adulterous lover to poison her father and brothers in order to secure the family fortune, the marquise was the first member of the noble class to fall. In the French court of the period, where sexual affairs were numerous, ladies were not shy of seeking help from the murkier elements of the Parisian underworld, and fortune-tellers supplemented their dubious trade by selling poison. It was not long before the authorities were led to believe that Louis XIV himself was at risk. With the police chief of Paris police alerted, every hint of danger was investigated. Rumors abounded and it was not long before the King ordered the setting up of a special commission to investigate the poisonings and bring offenders to justice. No one, the King decreed, no matter how grand, would be spared having to account for their conduct. The royal court was soon thrown into disarray. The Mistress of the Robes and a distinguished general were among the early suspects. But they paled into insignificance when the King's mistress was incriminated. If, as was said, she had engaged in vile Satanic rituals and had sought to poison a rival for the King's affections, what was Louis XIV to do? Anne Somerset has gone back to original sources, letters and earlier accounts of the affair. By the end of her account, she reaches firm conclusions on various crucial matters. The Affair of the Poisons is an enthralling account of a sometimes bizarre period in French history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UdtCAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Idioms and Their Origins","description":"p.The English language contains a great store of idioms that can be used in creative and forceful ways.

By the early 1970s, however, the legacy of their generations rested on the shoulders of a single elderly woman, upon whose death the Pequots' reservation would fall into government hands. Her grandson, Richard \\"Skip\\" Hayward, and other relatives responded to her pleas and kept alive the tribe and its land by coming to live on the reservation. Journalist Kim Isaac Eisler tells in riveting detail how Hayward and others skillfully manipulated laws, court decisions, and political connections to permit the Mashantucket Pequots to found the Foxwoods Resort and Casino in 1992. Located in Ledyard, Connecticut, Foxwoods today is arguably the world's most profitable casino complex, grossing over one billion dollars annually. The Mashantucket Pequots have become staggeringly rich, their tribal membership has swelled, and they are now an influential force in national politics. Their triumph has not been without controversy: Eisler also examines the volatile issue of racial identity among the Pequots and looks at the negative impact of Foxwoods on those who also make their home in the Connecticut woods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fWxG3SGY7AIC&dq=Revenge+of+the+Pequots:+How+a+Small+Native+American+Tribe+Created+the+World%27s+Most+Profitable+Casino&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 9: Skin Deep","description":"Collects Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #515-518.

Attending to the forms of words rather than to their denotations, Craig Dworkin traces hidden networks across the surface of texts, examining how typography, and even individual letters and marks of punctuation, can reveal patterns that are significant without being symbolic fully meaningful without communicating any preordained message. Radium of the Word takes its title from Mina Loy s poem for Gertrude Stein, which hails her as the Madame  Curie / of the laboratory / of vocabulary.  In this spirit, Dworkin considers prose as a dynamic literary form, characterized by experimentation. Dworkin draws on examples from writers as diverse as Lyn Hejinian, William Faulkner, and Joseph Roth. He takes up the status of the proper name in Modernism, with examples from Stein, Loy, and Guillaume Apollinaire, and he offers in-depth analyses of individual authors from the counter-canon of the avant-garde, including P. Inman, Russell Atkins, N. H. Pritchard, and Andy Warhol. The result is an inspiring intervention in contemporary poetics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r6L9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Coming Chastisement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YLMqGgAACAAJ&dq=The+Coming+Chastisement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trace Their Shadows","description":"Rumors of a ghost lure beginning reporter Brandy O'Bannon to a mansion on an isolated Florida lake and into an investigation that leads to a forty-five year old skeleton, a concealed murder, and an unexpected romance.

As W. H. Auden told friends, it is \\"really about the Christian conception of art\\" and it is \\"my Ars Poetica, in the same way I believe The Tempest to be Shakespeare's.\\" This is the first critical edition. Arthur Kirsch's introduction and notes make the poem newly accessible to readers of Auden, readers of Shakespeare, and all those interested in the relation of life and literature--those two classic themes alluded to in its title. The poem begins in a theater after a performance of The Tempest has ended. It includes a moving speech in verse by Prospero bidding farewell to Ariel, a section in which the supporting characters speak in a dazzling variety of verse forms about their experiences on the island, and an extravagantly inventive section in prose that sees the uncivilized Caliban address the audience on art--an unalloyed example of what Auden's friend Oliver Sachs has called his \\"wild, extraordinary and demonic imagination.\\" Besides annotating Auden's allusions and sources (in notes after the text), Kirsch provides extensive quotations from his manuscript drafts, permitting the reader to follow the poem's genesis in Auden's imagination. This book, which incorporates for the first time previously ignored corrections that Auden made on the galleys of the first edition, also provides an unusual opportunity to see the effect of one literary genius upon another.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Mc8EAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Mirror+of+the+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dance to the Piper","description":"Born into a family of successful playwrights and producers, Agnes de Mille was determined to be an actress. Then one day she witnessed the Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova, and her life was altered forever. Hypnotized by Pavlova s beauty, in that moment de Mille dedicated herself to dance. Her memoir records with lighthearted humor and wisdom not only the difficulties she faced the resistance of her parents, the sacrifices of her training but also the frontier atmosphere of early Hollywood and New York and London during the Depression.  This is the story of an American dancer,  writes de Mille,  a spoiled egocentric wealthy girl, who learned with difficulty to become a worker, to set and meet standards, to brace a Victorian sensibility to contemporary roughhousing, and who, with happy good fortune, participated by the side of great colleagues in a renaissance of the most ancient and magical of all the arts.

Peter Guillam, staunch colleague and disciple of George Smiley of the British Secret Service, otherwise known as the Circus, is living out his old age on the family farmstead on the south coast of Brittany when a letter from his old Service summons him to London. The reason? His Cold War past has come back to claim him. Intelligence operations that were once the toast of secret London, and involved such characters as Alec Leamas, Jim Prideaux, George Smiley and Peter Guillam himself, are to be scrutinized by a generation with no memory of the Cold War and no patience with its justifications. Interweaving past with present so that each may tell its own intense story, John le Carr  has spun a single plot as ingenious and thrilling as the two predecessors on which it looks back: The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. In a story resonating with tension, humor and moral ambivalence, le Carr  and his narrator Peter Guillam present the reader with a legacy of unforgettable characters old and new.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RzI3DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cerberus: Wolf in Fold","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AyNlOQAACAAJ&dq=Cerberus:+Wolf+in+Fold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vegan Feasts","description":"Vegetables never tasted better than in these richly flavored, satisfying vegetarian meals from Sarah Copeland, whose Newlywed Cookbook has become a trusted resource in the kitchens of thousands of new cooks.

After three decades of extensive research on those non-ordinary states of consciousness induced by psychedelic drugs and by other means, Grof concludes that our present scientific world view is as inadequate as many of its historical predecessors. In this pioneering work, he proposes a new model of the human psyche that takes account of his findings. Grof includes in his model the recollective level, or the reliving of emotionally relevant memories, a level at which the Freudian framework can be useful. Beyond that is perinatal level in which the human unconscious may be activated to a reliving of biological birth and confrontation with death. How birth experience influences an individual's later development is a central focus of the book. The most serious challenge to contemporary psycho-analytic theory comes from a delineation of the transpersonal level, or the expansion of consciousness beyond the boundaries of time and space. Grof makes a bold argument that understanding of the perinatal and transpersonal levels changes much of how we view both mental illness and mental health. His reinterpretation of some of the most agonizing aspects of human behavior proves thought provoking for both laypersons and professional therapists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WqX4wAEACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Brain:+Birth,+Death,+and+Transendence+in+Psychotherapy+(Suny+Series+in+Transpersonal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shannon's Way","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Music study in Germany","description":"Excerpt from Music Study in Germany In preparing for the public letters which were written only for home, I have hoped that some readers would find in them the charm of style which the writer's friends fancy them to possess; that others would think the description of her masters, and especially Liszt, amid their pupils worth preserving; and that piano students would be grateful for the information that such an analysis of the piano technique of the greatest artists has been made, that any earnest pupil can with comparative ease and certainty conquer the difficulty of the piano-forte which includes all others - the Scale.

Years ago, Owen Daybright was an orphan on a railroad crew when old Arch Stobie took him under his wing at the Acorn ranch. He needed the quiet, hardworking Owen for a special job: to act as a friend and be a calming influence on his fiery-tempered son, Lee. But, instead, the boys showed an immediate hatred for each other that never waned. Only out of loyalty to Arch did Owen cover for Lee s stupidity and carelessness. But now Lee s crossed the line. There are some angry men after him for disgracing their sister. And he s put a target on Owen s back. Unless Owen is very fast and very careful, he s going to end up taking a bullet for the brother he d like to kill himself.

However, much current Pauline scholarship discusses Paul s God-, Christ-, and Spirit-language without reference to trinitarian theology. In contrast to that trend, Wesley Hill argues in this book that later, post-Pauline trinitarian theologies represent a better approach, opening a fresh angle on Paul s earlier talk about God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Spirit. Hill looks critically at certain well-known discussions in the field of New Testament studies -- those by N. T. Wright, Richard Bauckham, Larry Hurtado, and others -- in light of patristic and contemporary trinitarian theologies, resulting in an innovative approach to an old set of questions. Adeptly integrating biblical exegesis and historical-systematic theology, Hill s Paul and the Trinity shows how trinitarian theologies illumine interpretive difficulties in a way that more recent theological concepts have failed to do.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xastBgAAQBAJ&dq=THE+TRINITY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life on Tour with David Bowie: We Can Be Heroes","description":"This intimate account of life on tour with David Bowie, includes in-depth personal insights about touring, hotel life, groupies, fans and Bowies personal life, unpublished photographs of Bowie on stage and behind the scenes and insider account of recording with Bowie, Eno and Visconti.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nvCWOAAACAAJ&dq=Life+on+Tour+with+David+Bowie:+We+Can+Be+Heroes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"European Politics Today (3rd Edition)","description":"European Politics expertly and accessibly surveys the history, institutions, and issues that are essential for understanding contemporary European politics.

There are many societies that survive in a remarkably orderly fashion without the help of judges, law courts and policemen. They are small in scale and have relatively simple technologies, lacking those centralized agencies which we associate with legal systems; yet early anthropologists did not hesitate to name  law,  along with kinship, politics and religion, as one of the facets of their subject. Simon Roberts contends, however, that legal theory has become too closely identified with our own arrangements in western societies to be of much help in cross-cultural studies of order. But conversely, by looking at the ways in which other societies keep order and solve disputes, he sheds valuable light on the contemporary debates about order in our own society, in a straightforward text which will be accessible to the general reader and anthropologist alike. Now in its Second Edition with a new Foreword and Afterword by the author, this renowned introduction to the anthropology of law is part of the Classics of Law & Society Series from Quid Pro Books.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LS7PYblRe7UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Day With Barney","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FFM2AAAACAAJ&dq=A+Day+With+Barney&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stupid Crook 2004 Day-To-Day Calendar","description":"We all know the basics of punctuation.

From the invention of the question mark in the time of Charlemagne to George Orwell shunning the semicolon, this lively history makes a powerful case for the preservation of a system of printing conventions that is much too subtle to be mucked about with.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e2ROR0qqFwwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of Shared Services (Essentials Series)","description":"What works, why it works, and how to evaluate a shared services program Shared services, a form of \\"internal outsourcing,\\" enables corporations to achieve economies of scale by creating a separate entity within the company to perform specific internal services, such as payroll, accounts payable, travel and expense processing, etc. Essentials of Shared Services provides a quick, concise overview of shared services fundamentals, bringing senior-level executives up to speed so that they make the right decision.

Beginning with the start of time itself, Knickerbocker reveals historical anecdotes, both real and imagined featuring social commentary, fresh perspectives on the past, and conversations with powerful historical figures. With humor and intrigue, A Knickerbocker s History of New York tells the tale of the discovery of New York, and explores the first Dutch settlements. While examining those origins, Knickerbocker muses about the ethics of colonization and the immoral treatment of Native Americans, with biting and brutal honesty. Still under the Dutch  rule , 1600 New York acted as one of the breeding grounds for many American Christmas traditions, some of which are still alive today. Under a comical microscope, A Knickerbocker s History of New York explores the effect the early Dutch settlements have on American culture, particularly in New York. Originally published in 1809, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York earned acclaim for its innovative genre as one of the first American comedic works. With the mix of specific, inside jokes and universal humor, Irving s satire invites laughter from both his original audience and contemporary readers. With prose and wit that has remained fresh and hilarious even two-hundred and eleven years later, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York contains a narrative that has earned centuries of influence. While playfully mocking both classic literature and historians, Irving was bold enough to even include a list of people, professions and properties that he intended to make fun of. Though Irving mixes fact with fiction, A Knickerbocker s History of New York provides useful insight on the history of Dutch Americans, as well as contributing thoughtful social commentary that finds itself still applicable to modern society. Now featuring a stunning new cover design and a modern font, this edition of Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York is both accessible and entertaining.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ZosEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stolen Vows: The Illusion of No-Fault Divorce and the Rise of the American Divorce Industry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zI9wAAAACAAJ&dq=Stolen+Vows:+The+Illusion+of+No-Fault+Divorce+and+the+Rise+of+the+American+Divorce+Industry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Child and Adolescent Development","description":"\\"Child and Adolescent Development is an exceptional, process-oriented textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate students taking child development and developmental psychology courses in Psychology, Human Development & Family Studies, Education, and related fields.\\"--Book jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gzEE_eC79BAC&dq=Child+and+Adolescent+Development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Film Producers, Studios, Agents and Casting Directors Guide: Credits Through 1996","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2PsHAQAAMAAJ&dq=Film+Producers,+Studios,+Agents+and+Casting+Directors+Guide:+Credits+Through+1996&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemicals in war;: A treatise on chemical warfare,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w-orMwEACAAJ&dq=Chemicals+in+war%3B:+A+treatise+on+chemical+warfare,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Trek and Sacred Ground: Explorations of Star Trek, Religion and American Culture","description":"Offers a multidisciplinary examination of Star Trek, religion, and American culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZwXjYLx3fvMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With All My Heart: Reflections on Love (Cutout Shape Books)","description":"Whether by candlelight or with fireworks, the powerful nature of love ignites all who fall under its spell.

Acclaimed filmmaker Ang Lee's concept for his film adaptation of the classic Marvel Comics series The Hulk combines all the elements of a blockbuster visual effects-intensive superhero movie with the brooding romance and tragedy of Universal's classic horror films.

Eric Bana (Black Hawk Down) stars as scientist Bruce Banner, whose inner demons transform him in the aftermath of a catastrophic experiment.

Using that as a launching pad, he explores the reaches of modern physics, including theories on the origin of the universe (e.g., the big bang), the nature of black holes, and space-time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=59x0PgAACAAJ&dq=The+Theory+of+Everything&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grammar of Fantasy: An Introduction to the Art of Inventing Stories","description":"A collection of essays from the visionary storyteller Gianni Rodari about fairy tales and folk tales and their great advantages in teaching creative storytelling. \\"Rodari grasped children's need to play with life's rules by using the grammar of their own imaginations. They must be encouraged to question, challenge, destroy, mock, eliminate, generate, and reproduce their own language and meanings through stories that will enable them to narrate their own lives.\\" --Jack Zipes \\"I hope this small book,\\" writes renowned children's author Gianni Rodari, \\"can be useful for all those people who believe it is necessary for the imagination to have a place in education; for all those who trust in the creativity of children; and for all those who know the liberating value of the word.\\" Full of ideas, glosses on fairytales, stories, and wide-ranging activities, including the fantastic binomial, this book changed how creative arts were taught in Italian schools. Translated into English by acclaimed children's historian Jack Zipes and illustrated for the first time ever by Matthew Forsythe, this edition of The Grammar of Fantasy is one to live with and return to for its humor, intelligence, and truly deep understanding of children. A groundbreaking pedagogical work that is also a handbook for writers of all ages and kinds, The Grammar of Fantasy gives each of us a playful, practical path to finding our own voice through the power of storytelling. Gianni Rodari (1920-1980) grew up in Northern Italy and wrote hundreds of stories, poems, and songs for children. In 1960, he collaborated with the Education Cooperation Movement to develop exercises to encourage children's creative and critical thinking abilities. Jack Zipes is a renowned children's historian and folklorist who has written, translated, and edited dozens of books on fairytales. He is a professor at the University of Minnesota. Matthew Forsythe lives in Montreal where he draws and paints for picture books, comics, and animations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ep21xwEACAAJ&dq=The+Grammar+of+Fantasy:+An+Introduction+to+the+Art+of+Inventing+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Figure drawing","description":"Many of us want to learn  how to draw.  But as artist Anthony Ryder explains, it s much more important to learn what to draw. In other words, to observe and draw what we actually see, rather than what we think we see. When it comes to drawing the human figure, this means letting go of learned ideas and expectation of what the figure should look like. It means carefully observing the interplay of form and light, shape and line, that combine to create the actual appearance of human form. In The Artist s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing, amateur and experienced artists alike are guided toward this new way of seeing and drawing the figure with a three-step drawing method. The book s progressive course starts with the block-in, an exercise in seeing and establishing the figure s shape. It then build to the contour, a refined line drawing that represents the figure s silhouette. The last step is tonal work on the inside of the contour, when light and shadow are shaped to create the illusion of form. Separate chapters explore topics critical to the method: gesture, which expresses a sense of living energy to the figure; light, which largely determines how we see the model; and form, which conveys the figure s volume and mass. Examples, step-by-steps, and special  tips  offer helpful hints and practical guidance throughout. Lavishly illustrated with the author s stunning artwork, The Artist s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing combines solid instruction with thoughtful meditations on the art of drawing, to both instruct and inspire artists of all levels.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=La66AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Japanese Dictionary Phrasebook 2 (Rough Guide Phrasebooks) (Japanese and English Edition)","description":"Essential Japanese Phrase Book & Dictionary teaches you the practical phrases and expressions needed for common, everyday interactions in Japan in a clear, concise, accessible and enjoyable way.

Since the beginning of human history, Mars has been an alluring dream the stuff of legends, gods, and mystery. The planet most like ours, it had long been thought impossible to reach, let alone explore and inhabit. But that is changing fast. In February 2021, the American rover Perseverance will touch down on Mars. Equipped with a powerful suite of scientific instruments including some that will attempt to make oxygen from the Martian atmosphere the rover also carries a helicopter that will take spectacular panoramic movies from the air. Most exciting of all, a spectrometer onboard may find evidence of fossils left behind by microbes millions of years ago, when the planet was warm and wet, proving at last that life on Earth is not unique, but a general phenomenon in the universe. Meanwhile, in Boca Chica, Texas, Elon Musk s SpaceX has created a shipyard that is building and testing the vessels that will take humans to Mars before this decade is out. Leading space exploration expert Robert Zubrin crafted the daring blueprint for humanity s reach to the Red Planet twenty-five years ago, when he first published The Case for Mars. Now, in this updated edition, he looks to the future once more to describe how in an era when the American space program and private companies like SpaceX are racing to send astronauts to Mars our first colonies there are imminent. In the grand tradition of successful explorers, Zubrin calls for a travel-light and live-off-the-land approach to Martian settlement. He explains how scientists can use present-day technology to send humans to Mars, produce fuel and oxygen on the planet s surface with its own natural resources, build bases and communities, and one day, terraform or alter the atmosphere of the planet in order to pave the way for sustainable life. As a landmark new mission opens the decisive campaign to take humans to the Red Planet, Zubrin lays out a comprehensive plan to build life on a new world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wS8SEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Case+for+Mars:+The+Plan+to+Settle+the+Red+Planet+and+Why+We+Must&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Long George Alley","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vb4dRQAACAAJ&dq=Long+George+Alley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XbEuAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Death+of+Outrage:+Bill+Clinton+and+the+Assault+on+American+Ideals+(Thorndike+Nonfiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Rookie's Guide to Buying or Selling a Pool Table","description":"Buying or Selling a Pool Table is the most comprehensive book outlining what anyone should know before buying or selling a new or used pool table.

Moreover, this approach can be applied beyond videogames: Bogost suggests that any medium from videogames to poetry, literature, cinema, or art can be read as a configurative system of discrete, interlocking units of meaning, and he illustrates this method of analysis with examples from all these fields. The marriage of literary theory and information technology, he argues, will help humanists take technology more seriously and hep technologists better understand software and videogames as cultural artifacts. This approach is especially useful for the comparative analysis of digital and nondigital artifacts and allows scholars from other fields who are interested in studying videogames to avoid the esoteric isolation of \\"game studies.\\" The richness of Bogost's comparative approach can be seen in his discussions of works by such philosophers and theorists as Plato, Badiou, Zizek, and McLuhan, and in his analysis of numerous videogames including Pong, Half-Life, and Star Wars Galaxies. Bogost draws on object technology and complex adaptive systems theory for his method of unit analysis, underscoring the configurative aspects of a wide variety of human processes. His extended analysis of freedom in large virtual spaces examines Grand Theft Auto 3, The Legend of Zelda, Flaubert's Madame Bovary, and Joyce's Ulysses. In Unit Operations, Bogost not only offers a new methodology for videogame criticism but argues for the possibility of real collaboration between the humanities and information technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kp0jEAAAQBAJ&dq=Unit+Operations:+An+Approach+to+Videogame+Criticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights","description":"The first book to reveal the abuses of animal rights activists reveals terrorist tactics and deception on the part of those involved in the fight for \\"animal rights.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GF7tXZ6tz8EC&dq=Animalscam:+The+Beastly+Abuse+of+Human+Rights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Night Crew","description":"#1 New York Times bestselling author John Sandford takes all the action and suspense of his acclaimed Prey novels and heads west to the dark gleam of L.A.

Traditionalists wonder where the divine order is in all of this. There was a time when Latter-day Saints seemed impervious to such theological conundrums. The assumption was that LDS teachings were scientific and that research would prove the truth of Mormonism. Books were written about \\"rational theology\\" and \\"Joseph Smith as scientist.\\" Students at church schools celebrated Darwin's birthday without hint of controversy, believing that evolution confirmed eternal progression. In The Search for Harmony fifteen scholars document the striking reversal over the past half-century beginning with Joseph Fielding Smith's and James E. Talmage's clash over the age of the earth. Although the church sided with Talmage at the time, the membership eventually accepted Smith's views, and the rhetoric of other church leaders' sermons became increasingly hostile toward empiricism. Contributors suggest that this antagonism could be averted to the benefit of the church. They explain why in light of the details of both science and LDS theology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y1vfAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Search+for+Harmony:+Essays+on+Science+and+Mormonism+(Essays+on+Mormonism+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kitsch Deluxe","description":"It s fun, it s fanciful, it s kitsch!

Her challenging new book definitively establishes the centrality of lesbianism as sexual obsession and aesthetic model in Proust's vast novel A la recherche du temps perdu. Traditional readings of the Recherche have dismissed Proust's \\"Gomorrah\\"--his term for women who love other women--as a veiled portrayal of the novelist's own homosexuality. More recently, \\"queer-positive\\" rereadings have viewed the novel's treatment of female sexuality as ancillary to its accounts of Sodom and its meditations on time and memory. Ladenson instead demonstrates the primacy of lesbianism to the novel, showing that Proust's lesbians are the only characters to achieve a plenitude of reciprocated desire. The example of Sodom, by contrast, is characterized by frustrated longing and self-loathing. She locates the work's paradigm of hermetic relations between women in the self-sufficient bond between the narrator's mother and grandmother. Ladenson traces Proust's depictions of male and female homosexuality from his early work onward, and contextualizes his account of lesbianism in late-nineteenth-century sexology and early twentieth-century thought. A vital contribution to the fields of queer theory and of French literature and culture, Ladenson's book marks a new stage in Proust studies and provides a fascinating chapter in the history of a literary masterpiece's reception.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0EDQBT-v_lUC&dq=Proust%27s+Lesbianism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Poor Law to Welfare State, 6th Edition: A History of Social Welfare in America","description":"Trattner provides in-depth examination of developments in child welfare, public health, and the evolution of social work as a profession, showing how all these changes affected the treatment of the poor and needy in America.

This global study of Anglicanism from the sixteenth century looks at how was Anglican identity constructed and contested at various periods since the sixteenth century; and what was its historical influence during the past six centuries. It explores not just the ecclesiastical and theological aspects of global Anglicanism, but also the political, social, economic, and cultural influences of this form of Christianity that has been historically significant in western culture, and a burgeoning force in non-western societies today. The chapters are written by international experts in their various historical fields which includes the most recent research in their areas, as well as original research. The series forms an invaluable reference for both scholars and interested non-specialists. Volume three of The Oxford History of Anglicanism explores the nineteenth century when Anglicanism developed into a world-wide Christian communion, largely, but not solely, due to the expansion of the British Empire. By the end of this period an Anglican Communion had come into existence as a diverse conglomerate of often competing Anglican identities with their often unresolved tensions and contradictions, but also with some measure of genuine unity. The volume examines the ways the various Anglican identities of the nineteenth century are both metropolitan and colonial constructs, and how they influenced the wider societies in which they formed Anglican Churches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d97XDQAAQBAJ&dq=Anglicanism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The gospel and the church (Fifty-cent religious series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7x1WAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theory and Problems of Genetics","description":"This illustrated book on genetics contains new objective-type questions and over 450 solved problems and includes chapters on the physical basis of heredity, single gene inheritance, the genetics of sex and linkage and chromosome mapping.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nWIKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Theory+and+Problems+of+Genetics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness","description":"Three of the most original thinkers of our time explore issues that call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life. ?

In this book of \\"trialogues,\\" the late psychedelic visionary and shamanologist Terence McKenna, acclaimed biologist and originator of the morphogenetic fields theory Rupert Sheldrake, and mathematician and chaos theory scientist Ralph Abraham explore the relationships between chaos and creativity and their connection to cosmic consciousness. Their observations call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life in the universe. The authors challenge the reader to the deepest levels of thought with wide-ranging investigations of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos in the dynamics of human creation, and the resacralization of the world. Among the provocative questions the authors raise are: Is Armageddon a self-fulfilling prophecy? Are we humans the imaginers or the imagined? Are the eternal laws of nature still evolving? What is the connection between physical light and the light of consciousness?

Along the way he upturned the genealogy industry, unearthed his family s deepest secrets, and broke open the second longest cold-case in US history, all in a desperate bid to find out who he really is. In 1964, a woman pretending to be a nurse kidnapped an infant boy named Paul Fronczak from a Chicago hospital. Two years later, police found a boy abandoned outside a variety store in New Jersey. The FBI tracked down Dora Fronczak, the kidnapped infant s mother, and she identified the abandoned boy as her son. The family spent the next fifty years believing they were whole again but Paul was always unsure about his true identity. Then, four years ago spurred on by the birth of his first child, Emma Faith Paul took a DNA test. The test revealed definitively that he was not Paul Fronczak. From that moment on, Paul has been on a tireless mission to find the man whose life he s been living and to discover who abandoned him, and why. This is the story of Paul s heart-wrenching and tortuous journey to solve both mysteries and finally learn the truth about his identity. The Foundling is a touching and inspiring story about a child lost and faith found, about the permanence of families and the bloodlines that define you, and about the emotional toll of both losing your identity and rediscovering who you truly are.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4A-_DAEACAAJ&dq=The+Foundling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse","description":"Where can you show up for world-class barbecue, stick around for the blues, and shut the place down philosophizing with some truly gritty characters?

This volume is highly recommended as an important acquisition for any research library on colonial Mexican history.\\"  Colonial Latin American Historical Review As one of the finest surviving examples of the art of Aztec manuscript painting, the Codex Telleriano-Remensis provides invaluable information about the core of Aztec culture. In this landmark publication, Eloise Quiones Keber presents the first photographic color facsimile of the entire codex, accompanied by the most extensive commentary ever undertaken on its abundant images and Spanish annotations and the first English translation of its texts. Produced in sixteenth-century colonial Mexico, the codex consists of a ceremonial calendar of the \\"months\\" of the year, a divinatory almanac featuring the deities that determined the fates of the days, and a history of the Aztecs from their legendary migration in the twelfth century through the first decades of Spanish occupation. Dr. Quiones Keber's commentary offers new data and hypotheses regarding the physical features of the manuscript, its origins, dating, authorship, prototypes, Spanish influence, and relationship to its partial cognate, the Codex Vaticanus A. Now owned by the Bibliothque Nationale of Paris, the Codex Telleriano-Remensis offers a rare visual example of the cultural encounter between the \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" worlds as European practices mingled with indigenous traditions to produce an expression unique to its time and place.

In this new interpretation of the frieze, Eve D'Ambra examines how art depicting mythological themes served as an instrument of social policy in the Roman Empire. She proposes that the portrayal of Arachne flanked by obedient women who spin and weave is presented as a moralizing exemplum: rather than unfolding in a continuous narrative, the myth is reduced to a series of emblems that provide both a cautionary tale and inspirational models of domestic virtue. D'Ambra shows how the representation of weaving as a sign of the matron's traditional values reinforced Domitian's measures for moral reform, which included laws concerning marriage and adultery. She considers the equation of weaving and chastity in the cults revived by Domitian and, in the context of the founding myths depicted in Augustan art and literature, she explores the narratives of heroines and transgressors that blur the boundaries between private and public life: weaving not only served to initiate girls into the household economy but it also provided metaphors for statesmanship, civilization, and powers of life and death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SjRiQgAACAAJ&dq=Private+Lives,+Imperial+Virtues&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Maltese Angel","description":"Marrying a professional dancer, prosperous farmer Ward Gibson is stunned by the murderous jealousy of Daisy Mason, a young neighbor who believes Ward was promised to her","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_kGO98Ci8F0C&dq=The+Maltese+Angel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The golf secret","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=88A1zgEACAAJ&dq=The+golf+secret&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dostoevsky,","description":"Joseph Frank's award-winning, five-volume Dostoevsky is widely recognized as the best biography of the writer in any language--and one of the greatest literary biographies of the past half-century.

More than a biography in the usual sense, this is a cultural history of nineteenth-century Russia, providing both a rich picture of the world in which Dostoevsky lived and a major reinterpretation of his life and work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TWiYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Dostoevsky,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Studies: 10 Day Competency Review","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4GrJNC7CVrkC&dq=Global+Studies:+10+Day+Competency+Review&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waiting for Sarah","description":"Mike's parents and sister are dead and his legs are gone.

The sixteen connected stories in this exciting debut are set in the fictional Midwestern town of Gateway City, where second generation off-spring of the Great Migrators have pieced together a thriving, if fragile existence. With police brutality on the rise, the civil rights movement gaining momentum, and wars raging at home and abroad, Asim has conjured a community that stands on edge. But it is the individual struggles with love, childrearing, adolescence, etc, lyrically chronicled here, that create a piercing portrait of humanity. In I'd Rather Go Blind and Zombies, young Crispus Jones, who while sensitive to the tremors of upheaval around him is still much more concerned with his crush on neighbor Polly and if he's ever going to be as cool as his brother. When Ray Mortimer, a white cop, kills the owner of his favorite candy store, Crispus becomes aware of malice even more scary than zombies and the ghost that he thinks may be haunting his house. In The Wheat from the Tares and A Virtuous Woman, Rose Whittier deals with her abusive husband with a desperate resignation until his past catches up with him and she's given a second chance at love. And Gabriel, her suitor, realizes that his whole-hearted commitment to The Struggle may have to give way for his own shot at romance. And in Ashes to Ashes we see how a single act of despicable violence in their childhoods cements a lasting connection between two unlikely friends. From Crispus' tender innocence to Ray Mortimer's near pure evil, to Rose's quiet determination, the characters in this book and their journeys showcase a world that is brimming with grace and meaning and showcases the talents of a writer at the top of his game.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9qwH6OIyIpAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1001 Great Jokes (Signet)","description":"Carefully divided into 250 categories and arranged in reference book format, the 1,000-plus jokes in this book will have everyone laughing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gkh31KRm8lIC&dq=1001+Great+Jokes+(Signet)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calling Rain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=khsbOwAACAAJ&dq=Calling+Rain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Firebird - Large Print Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The cost of discipleship","description":"Perhaps Dietrich Bonhoeffer s most radical book, this reading of the Sermon on the Mount has influenced many Christians throughout the world over the last 50 years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xGWmDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+cost+of+discipleship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Churches of Christ: Student Edition (Denominations in America, No. 10)","description":"Offers a brief historical overview, biographical sketches of important figures, and a fresh interpretation of Churches of Christ in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AelJ0jRvc5AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Magic","description":"BESTSELLING BOOK In this inspirational guide, Wayne Dyer, the author of the phenomenal bestsellers Wisdom of the Ages, Pulling Your Own Strings, and Your Erroneous Zones, reveals seven beliefs central to working miracles in our everyday lives.

THE BACHELARD TRANSLATIONS are the inspiration of Joanne H. Stroud, Director of Publications for The Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, who in 1981 contracted with Jose Corti to publish in English the untranslated works of Bachelard on the imagination. Gaston Bachelard is acclaimed as one of the most significant modern French thinkers. From 1929 to 1962 he authored twenty-three books addressing his dual concerns, the philosophy of science and the analysis of the imagination of matter. The influence of his thought can be felt in all disciplines of the humanities - art, architecture, literature, language, poetics, philosophy, and depth psychology. His teaching career included posts at the College de Bar-sur-Aube, the University of Dijon, and from 1940 to 1962 the chair of history and philosophy of science at the Sorbonne. One of the amphitheaters of the Sorbonne is called \\"L'Amphi Gaston Bachelard,\\" an honor Bachelard shared with Descartes and Richelieu.

The author happens to be Rose s son-in-law, which creates a painful dilemma for her. Her daughter Nadia, a talented interior designer, has been struggling to hold her marriage together, and conceal the truth from their young daughters, her family, and the world. But Nicolas, her straying husband, is blinded by passion for a younger woman and not only that, she is pregnant with his child.

In Beholden: Religion, Global Health, and Human Rights, Susan R. Holman--a scholar in both religion and the history of medicine--challenges this traditional polarization by telling stories designed to help shape a new perspective on global health, one that involves a multidisciplinary integration of religion and culture with human rights and social justice. The book's six chapters range broadly, describing pilgrimage texts in the Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic traditions; the effect of ministry and public policy on nineteenth-century health care for the poor; the story of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as it shaped economic, social, and cultural rights; a \\"religious health assets\\" approach based in Southern Africa; and the complex dynamics of gift exchange in the modern faith-based focus on charity, community, and the common good. Holman's study serves as an insightful guide for students and practitioners interested in improving and broadening the scope of global health initiatives, with an eye towards having the greatest impact possible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VjvvBQAAQBAJ&dq=Beholden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture and Human Nature: Theoretical Papers of Melford E. Spiro","description":"One of the most prominent figures in psychoanalytic and psychological anthropology, Melford E. Spiro has produced an oeuvre of broad theoretical and ethnographic scope. One of the few anthropologists who are also trained in psychoanalysis, he has made the study of culture and personality a distinctive theoretical approach to anthropological work and has been a consistent and forceful critic of such popular intellectual movements as structuralism, hermeneutics, cultural determinism, and symbolic anthropology. This volume of Spiro's major theoretical writings concentrates on theories of culture and human nature, functional analysis, and religion. Spiro argues that important dimensions of the human family are the same everywhere and that a theory of human nature is both possible and necessary. He discusses religious beliefs, analyzing not only their structures but also the ways such beliefs are held and the meanings attributed to them. This analysis, Spiro shows, can be done most successfully by means of a theory of the human family, of infant and child development and socialization, of panhuman unconscious processes, and of universal psychodynamic constellations such as the Oedipus complex.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Coa8QgAACAAJ&dq=Culture+and+Human+Nature:+Theoretical+Papers+of+Melford+E.+Spiro&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doing Your Masters Dissertation","description":"A practical and comprehensive guide to researching, preparing and writing a dissertation at Masters level.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=drmwc95ezaYC&dq=Doing+Your+Masters+Dissertation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Psychomancy and Crystal Gazing","description":"Lesson I-The Nature of Psychomancy 5 Interesting, scientific principles underlying Psychomancy.

When Nicholas Shakespeare stumbled across a trunk full of his late aunt s personal belongings, he was unaware of where this discovery would take him and what he would learn about her hidden past. The glamorous, mysterious figure he remembered from his childhood was very different from the morally ambiguous young woman who emerged from the trove of love letters, journals and photographs, surrounded by suitors and living the precarious existence of a British citizen in a country controlled by the enemy during World War II. As a young boy, Shakespeare had always believed that his aunt was a member of the Resistance and had been tortured by the Germans. The truth turned out to be far more complicated. Piecing together fragments of his aunt s remarkable and tragic story, Priscilla is at once a stunning story of detection, a loving portrait of a flawed woman trying to survive in terrible times, and a spellbinding slice of history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mXmxAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saints of the Pueblos","description":"Explores the patron saints and the pottery traditions of each of the Pueblos of New Mexico.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1orYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Saints+of+the+Pueblos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soil Geomorphology","description":"Soil geomorphology is the accurate assessment of the genetic relationship of soils and landforms, which is possible only if their interdependence is recognized.

The first 3 volumes of this series on Human Cell Culture are devoted to these cancer cell lines. The chapters in these first 3 volumes have a common aim. Their purpose is to address 3 questions of fundamental importance to the relevance of human cancer cell lines as model systems of each type of cancer: 1. Do the cell lines available accurately represent the clinical presentation? 2. Do the cell lines accurately represent the histopathology of the original tumors? 3. Do the cell lines accurately represent the molecular genetics of this type of cancer? The cancer cell lines available are derived, in most cases, from the more aggressive and advanced cancers. There are few cell lines derived from low grade organ-confined cancers. This gap can be filled with conditionally immortalized human cancer cell lines. We do not know why the success rate for establishing cell lines is so low for some types of cancer and so high for others. The histopathology of the tumor of origin and the extent to which the derived cell line retains the differentiated features of that tumor are critical. The concept that a single cell line derived from a tumor at a particular site is representative of tumors at that site is na?ve and misleading.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1j4OBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whisper of Death","description":"When only five kids are left in a town, they realize the suicide of Betty Sue may be connected to this strange situation.

The first book in Bruce Catton s Pulitzer Prizewinning Army of the Potomac Trilogy, Mr. Lincoln s Army is a riveting history of the early years of the Civil War, when a fledgling Union Army took its stumbling first steps under the command of the controversial general George McClellan. Following the secession of the Southern states, a beleaguered President Abraham Lincoln entrusted the dashing, charismatic McClellan with the creation of the Union s Army of the Potomac and the responsibility of leading it to a swift and decisive victory against Robert E. Lee s Army of Northern Virginia. Although a brilliant tactician who was beloved by his troops and embraced by the hero-hungry North, McClellan s ego and ambition ultimately put him at loggerheads with his commander in chief a man McClellan considered unworthy of the presidency. McClellan s weaknesses were exposed during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American military history, which ended in a stalemate even though the Confederate troops were greatly outnumbered. After Antietam, Lincoln ordered McClellan s removal from command, and the Union entered the war s next chapter having suffered thousands of casualties and with great uncertainty ahead. America s premier chronicler of the nation s brutal internecine conflict, Bruce Catton is renowned for his unparalleled ability to bring a detailed and vivid immediacy to Civil War battlefields and military strategy sessions.

King shows how rank-and-file movement participants defined and discussed such concepts as rights, equality, justice, and, in particular, freedom, and how such key movement leaders as Martin Luther King Jr., Ella Baker, Stokely Carmichael, and James Forman were attuned to this \\"freedom talk.\\" The book includes chapters on the concept of freedom in its many varieties, both individual and collective; on self-interest and self-respect; on Martin Luther King's use of the idea of freedom; and on the intellectual evolution of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, especially in light of Frantz Fanon's thought among movement radicals. In demonstrating that self-respect, self-determination, and solidarity were as central to the goals of the movement as the dismantling of the Jim Crow system, King argues that the movement's success should not be measured in terms of tangible, quantifiable advances alone, such as voter registration increases or improved standards of living. Not only has the civil rights movement helped strengthen the meaning and political importance of active citizenship in the contemporary world, says King, but \\"what was at first a political goal became, in the 1970s and 1980s, the impetus for the academic and intellectual rediscovery and reinterpretation of the Afro-American cultural and historical experience.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m9l7DTMkiCcC&dq=Civil+Rights+and+the+Idea+of+Freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stalking Justice The Dramatic True Story of the Detective Who First Used DNA Testing to Catch a Serial Killer","description":"Describes the landmark homicide case headed up by detective Joe Horgas, who led the first investigation that used DNA evidence and successfully identified and captured a serial killer known as the Southside Strangler.

The public demanded proof, and a host of artists and writers obliged. These early explorers possessed a vigorous devotion to the young nation s wilderness the naturalist John Muir famously toured the land from Wisconsin to Florida on foot and through their work established aesthetic categories that exist to this day. In Lines on the Land, Scott Herring contends that these writers and artists were canon makers, recognizing the national parks as naturally occurring works of art and conferring upon them a cultural prestige: the parks were the splendid focal points of the American landscape. These early, canonizing works are homages to a vast, untouched wilderness. This praise would gradually give way, however, to a distinctly American anger what Herring calls \\"outraged idealism.\\" Later generations were faced with a changing culture that had imperfectly absorbed, and even misrepresented, the national-park aesthetic. The postwar park was overrun by cars and tourists who could not possibly match the pioneering naturalists  profound commitment to and appreciation for their surroundings. The collective tone of the parks  chroniclers, as a result, evolved from celebration of awesome beauty to indignation over the perceived corruption of the parks, both as an ideal and as actual physical settings. Herring traces this shift through the work of a wide spectrum of creative minds, from early figures such as Muir and Thomas Moran to later observers of the parks such as Ansel Adams, Sylvia Plath, Edward Abbey, and Rick Bass. The text is punctuated by autobiographical \\"interchapters,\\" in which Herring relates the book s chief themes to his own experiences in Yellowstone National Park.

Brown argues that efforts to outlaw hate speech and pornography powerfully legitimize the state: such apparently well-intentioned attempts harm victims further by portraying them as so helpless as to be in continuing need of governmental protection. \\"Whether one is dealing with the state, the Mafia, parents, pimps, police, or husbands,\\" writes Brown, \\"the heavy price of institutionalized protection is always a measure of dependence and agreement to abide by the protector's rules.\\" True democracy, she insists, requires sharing power, not regulation by it; freedom, not protection. Refusing any facile identification with one political position or another, Brown applies her argument to a panoply of topics, from the basis of litigiousness in political life to the appearance on the academic Left of themes of revenge and a thwarted will to power. These and other provocations in contemporary political thought and political life provide an occasion for rethinking the value of several of the last two centuries' most compelling theoretical critiques of modern political life, including the positions of Nietzsche, Marx, Weber, and Foucault.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IxCnDwAAQBAJ&dq=States+of+Injury&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Affect Regulation, Mentalization, and the Development of Self","description":"In a brilliant examination of the frontiers of human emotion and cognition, four prominent psychoanalysts combine the perspectives of developmental psychology, attachment theory and psychoanalytic technique.

While Andersen s tales continue to seize the imagination with their singular blend of simplicity, eccentricity, and charm, English-language readers have until now had to content themselves with inaccurate retellings and inadequate translations. Diana Crone Frank, a Danish novelist and linguist, and Jeffrey Frank, a novelist and editor at the New Yorker, offer a much-needed modern translation. In this collection are twenty-two tales that best represent Andersen s literary legacy, including such classics as  The Little Mermaid,   The Ugly Duckling,   Thumbelisa,  and  The Emperor s New Clothes,  as well as largely unfamiliar stories like  By the Outermost Sea.  Illuminating notes clarify references in the tales. And in an introductory essay, the Franks explore the writer and his times, placing the enigmatic and often bizarre figure of Andersen among his literary contemporaries, such as Charles Dickens and S?ren Kierkegaard, with whom he crossed paths; and they bring to life Andersen s fascinating relationship with the United States. Illustrated with the delicate and beautiful drawings that accompanied the original Danish publication, The Stories of Hans Christian Andersen will delight readers of all ages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6uVDOW5cmRgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pilates Workbook for Pregnancy: Illustrated Step-by-Step Matwork Techniques","description":"Presents original Pilates matwork exercises on three different experience levels, designed specifically for use during and after pregnancy, emphasizing breathing, gentle stretching, and precise techniques for keeping a pregnant body healthy, easing labor, and recovering swiftly.

In Art and Crisis, first published in 1948, Hans Sedlmayr argues that the aesthetic disjunctures of modern art signify more than matters of style and point to much deeper processes of cultural and religious disintegration. As Roger Kimball observes in his informative new introduction, Art in Crisis is as much an exercise in cultural or spiritual analysis as it is a work of art history. Sedlmayr's reads the art of the last two centuries as a fever chart of the modern age in its greatness and its decay. He discusses the advent of Romanticism with its freeing of the imagination as a conscious sundering of art from humanist and religious traditions with the aesthetic treated as a category independent of human need. Looking at the social purposes of architecture, Sedlmayr shows how the landscape garden, the architectural monument, and the industrial exhibition testified to a new relationship not only between man and his handiwork but also between man and the forces that transcend him. In these institutions man deifies his inventive powers with which he hopes to master and supersede nature. Likewise, the art museum denies transcendence through a cultural leveling in which \\"Heracles and Christ become brothers\\" as objects of aesthetic contemplation. At the center of Art in Crisis is the insight that, in art as in life, the pursuit of unqualified autonomy is in the end a prescription for disaster, aesthetic as well as existential. Sedlmayr writes as an Augustinian Catholic. For him, the underlying motive for the pursuit of autonomy is pride. The \\"lost center\\" of his subtitle is God. The dream of autonomy, Sedlmayr argues, is for finite, mortal creatures, a dangerous illusion. The book invites serious analysis from art critics and theological thinkers alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0_vhtAEACAAJ&dq=Art+in+crisis,+the+lost+center&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soil Nutrient Bioavailability: a Mechanistic Approach","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Killers & Boosters for Child Custody Cases (Attitude Adjustment for Child Custody Litigants)","description":"Maya Augustine needed to disappear-her life depended on it.

Gisevius knew or met the major figures including Beck, Canaris, Oster, Goerdeler, and von Stauffenberg and barely escaped after the coup s failure.

While intent on ridding the United States of what the Society's members saw as a dangerous black population, the association also attracted some liberals who viewed its goals as an incentive toward emancipation. Attitudes among African Americans toward colonization were varied, some viewing it as an opportunity to start new lives in a free country and others seeing in it a deceptive scheme of the white man. But when the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850 put the freedom of every person of African descent in jeopardy, many began to consider emigration their only option. This collection of historic documents illuminates the debate on emigration through the narratives of four black men who in 1853 traveled to the new black nation of Liberia. Their accounts offer surprisingly different views and insights on the young country and provide both endorsements and condemnations of the colonization effort. Liberian Dreams contains four selections that have never before been published in a single volume: William Nesbit's attack on Liberia and its sponsors, Samuel Williams's spirited defense of the black republic in response to Nesbit, Daniel Peterson's pro-emigration tract commissioned by the ACS, and Augustus Washington's balanced critique of both sides of the issue. Each account offers a perspective not found in the others, and together they cover nearly the full range of debate among black Americans of that time. These narratives shed light not only on the experience of creating a new country but also on the conflict among African Americans over the colonization effort, and they offer a unique opportunity to witness African Americans encountering Africans and their cultures. The selection by Augustus Washington in particular reveals the insights of an educated community activist with a sure understanding of the issues at stake. Historian Wilson Moses, who has published widely on African American history and black nationalism, provides an introduction that expertly places the selections in context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NdVusAOtU_YC&dq=Liberian+dreams:+Back-to-Africa+narratives+from+the+1850s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dungeon Master Guide, No. 2100, 2nd Edition (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons)","description":"Outlines how to determine a character's abilities, rules for character improvement, and mapping and combat procedures","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XpFFkgEACAAJ&dq=The+Dungeon+Master+Guide,+No.+2100,+2nd+Edition+(Advanced+Dungeons+and+Dragons)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barron's how to prepare for the AP French: Advanced placement examination","description":"Provides an overview of the AP French exam, along with exercises and a series of practice tests to improve skills in reading comprehension, grammar, writing, and listening.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yi5yMgEACAAJ&dq=Barron%27s+how+to+prepare+for+the+AP+French:+Advanced+placement+examination&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me: An Eye-Opening Guide to Brand-Name Cosmetics (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)","description":"A consumer advocate rates and evaluates cosmetics, explains the types of ingredients they contain, and offers advice on skin care","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ahRwyHsN4b0C&dq=Don%27t+Go+to+the+Cosmetics+Counter+Without+Me:+An+Eye-Opening+Guide+to+Brand-Name+Cosmetics+(Don%27t+Go+to+the+Cosmetic+Counter+Without+Me)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to the study of the law of the constitution","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jNOjAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lethal Mercy","description":"Was it medicine?

Mariners' only aids were skill, luck, and single coal-fire light on the east coast, which was usually extinguished by rain. In 1786 the Northern Lighthouse Trust was established, with Robert Stevenson appointed as chief engineer a few years later. In this engrossing book, Bella Bathhurst reveals that the Stevensons not only supervised the construction of the lighthouses under often desperate conditions but also perfected a design of precisely chiseled interlocking granite blocks that would withstand the enormous waves that batter these stone pillars. The same Stevensons also developed the lamps and lenses of the lights themselves, which \\"sent a gleam across the wave\\" and prevented countless ships from being lost at sea. While it is the writing of Robert Louis Stevenson that brought fame to the family name, this mesmerizing account shows how his extraordinary ancestors changed the shape of the Scotland coast against incredible odds and with remarkable technical ingenuity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yZeiDA8vBWcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Translation Of Children's Literature (Topics in Translation)","description":"Translating Children s Literature is an exploration of the many developmental and linguistic issues related to writing and translating for children, an audience that spans a period of enormous intellectual progress and affective change from birth to adolescence.

This collection is the firt to analyze the concepts and issues involved in exploring African men and the constructions of masculinity in sub-Saharan Africa. An introduction establishes the major themes of the anthology : -men as gendered actors -the social construction of masculinity -masculinity as a relational category hegemonic and subordinate masculinities This book challenges stereotypes of African men as savages, patriarchs, or emasculated colonial victims. Essays establish the centrality of gender to the social and political transformation of the 20th-centrury Africa.

Jonathan Swinchatt and David G. Howell weave a tale that begins millions of years ago with the clash of continental plates that created the Napa Valley and go on to show how this small region, with its myriad microclimates, complex geologic history, and dedicated winemakers, came to produce world-class wines. A fascinating look at the art and science of winemaking and the only comprehensive book that covers Napa's geology, history, and environment, The Winemaker's Dance will help wine enthusiasts better understand wine talk and wine writing and, most importantly, wine itself. The Winemaker's Dance is animated by the voices of Napa's winemakers talking about their craft. The book also contains two driving tours through the valley that highlight the landscapes and wineries discussed. An array of unique illustrations including shaded relief maps overlaid with color aerial photographs provide a new and illuminating look at the region: its bedrock, sediments, soils, sun, wind, and rain. The expansive narrative considers how these elements influence wines from particular vineyards and how specific winemaking practices can bring out or mask aspects of terroir.

As the author herself affirms, this work is not intended to be a complete treatise or  didactic exposition  of the theory of unified fields, but rather a tool for further study, both by students and professional physicists. Dealing with all the major areas of research which together comprise the development of a working model, the author ranges over conservation equations, variational principles, solutions of spherical symmetry, and treats a wide selection of Einstein s own equations. The final chapter indicates problems associated with the unified field theory, in particular the energy-momentum tensor and geodesics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-nIKBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Byzantine Art and Architecture: An Introduction","description":"The Byzantine empire began with the transformation of the Roman empire initiated by the official acceptance of Christianity and the establishment of Constantinople as the capital city. It ended with the fall of that city to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The art and architecture of the empire reflects its changing fortunes, the development of Christianity, and the cultural influences that affected it. This book offers a systematic introduction to the material culture of the Byzantine empire, from the fourth to the fourteenth centuries. It provides for the student or any other interested reader a compendium of material which is generally difficult to access: much of the writing on Byzantine art and architecture is not in English, and is published as articles in scholarly journals. The book sets out the subject in an accessible manner, describing and discussing by period the surviving material - and that which can be reconstructed from documentary sources - and exploring its social/historical context. The text is copiously illustrated by well over 400 halftones, plans and maps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LwpZjgEACAAJ&dq=Byzantine+Art+and+Architecture:+An+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luftwaffe test pilot: Flying captured Allied aircraft of World War 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YUTEMgEACAAJ&dq=Luftwaffe+test+pilot:+Flying+captured+Allied+aircraft+of+World+War+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Firearms curiosa (The firearms classics library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NJrRnQEACAAJ&dq=Firearms+curiosa+(The+firearms+classics+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chromatic Harmonica: A Complete Manual for Beginners and Professionals","description":"This is a step-by-step approach to the chromatic harmonica by the renowned harmonica player Tommy Morgan.

Modern beer, however, has little in common with the drink that carried that name through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Looking at a time when beer was often a nutritional necessity, was sometimes used as medicine, could be flavored with everything from the bark of fir trees to thyme and fresh eggs, and was consumed by men, women, and children alike, Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance presents an extraordinarily detailed history of the business, art, and governance of brewing. During the medieval and early modern periods beer was as much a daily necessity as a source of inebriation and amusement. It was the beverage of choice of urban populations that lacked access to secure sources of potable water; a commodity of economic as well as social importance; a safe drink for daily consumption that was less expensive than wine; and a major source of tax revenue for the state. In Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Richard W. Unger has written an encompassing study of beer as both a product and an economic force in Europe. Drawing from archives in the Low Countries and England to assemble an impressively complete history, Unger describes the transformation of the industry from small-scale production that was a basic part of housewifery to a highly regulated commercial enterprise dominated by the wealthy and overseen by government authorities. Looking at the intersecting technological, economic, cultural, and political changes that influenced the transformation of brewing over centuries, he traces how improvements in technology and in the distribution of information combined to standardize quality, showing how the process of urbanization created the concentrated markets essential for commercial production. Weaving together the stories of prosperous businessmen, skilled brewmasters, and small producers, this impressively researched overview of the social and cultural practices that surrounded the beer industry is rich in implication for the history of the period as a whole.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7zivoNYc0uEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Willy Pogany's The Art of Drawing","description":"One of the most popular drawing guides ever published, The Art of Drawing has been an informative and thorough guide to several generations of aspiring artists.

Susan Cain, New York Times bestselling author of Quiet Does working from home or anywhere else but the office make sense? In Remote, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the founders of Basecamp, bring new insight to the hotly debated argument. While providing a complete overview of remote work s challenges, Jason and David persuasively argue that, often, the advantages of working  off-site  far outweigh the drawbacks. In the past decade, the  under one roof  model of conducting work has been steadily declining, owing to technology that is rapidly creating virtual workspaces. Today the new paradigm is  move work to the workers, rather than workers to the workplace.  Companies see advantages in the way remote work increases their talent pool, reduces turnover, lessens their real estate footprint, and improves their ability to conduct business across multiple time zones. But what about the workers? Jason and David point out that remote work means working at the best job (not just one that is nearby) and achieving a harmonious work-life balance while increasing productivity. And those are just some of the perks to be gained from leaving the office behind. Remote reveals a multitude of other benefits, along with in-the-trenches tips for easing your way out of the office door where you control how your workday will unfold. Whether you re a manager fretting over how to manage workers who  want out  or a worker who wants to achieve a lifestyle upgrade while still being a top performer professionally, this book is your indispensable guide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KeJE7Tyl6o8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World's Greatest Knock-Knock Jokes for Kids","description":"Everyone loves knock-knock jokes especially kids!

Morgan to Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey","description":"From the early years of fur trading to today's Silicon Valley empires, America has proved to be an extraordinarily fertile land for the creation of enormous fortunes. Each generation has produced one or two phenomenally successful leaders, often in new industries that caught contemporaries by surprise, and each of these new fortunes reconfirmed the power of fanatically single-minded visionaries. John Jacob Astor and Cornelius Vanderbilt were the first American moguls; John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were kingpins of the Gilded Age; David Sarnoff, Walt Disney, Ray Kroc, and Sam Walton were masters of mass culture. Today Oprah Winfrey, Andy Grove, and Bill Gates are giants of the Information Age. America has again and again been the land of dizzying mountains of wealth. Here, in a wittily told and deeply insightful history, is a complete set of portraits of America's greatest generators of wealth. Only such a collective study allows us to appreciate what makes the great entrepreneurs really tick. As H. W. Brands shows, these men and women are driven, they are focused, they deeply identify with the businesses they create, and they possess the charisma necessary to persuade other talented people to join them. They do it partly for the money, but mostly for the thrill of creation. The stories told here -- including how Nike got its start as a business-school project for Phil Knight; how Robert Woodruff almost refused to take control of Coca-Cola to spite his father; how Thomas Watson saved himself from prison by rescuing Dayton, Ohio, from a flood; how Jay Gould nearly cornered the gold market; how H. L. Hunt went from gambling at cards to gambling with oil leases -- make for a narrative that is always lively and revealing and often astonishing. An observer in 1850, studying John Jacob Astor, would not have predicted the rise of Henry Ford and the auto industry. Nor would a student of Ford in 1950 have anticipated the takeoff of direct marketing that made Mary Kay Ash a trusted guide for millions of American women. Full of surprising insights, written with H. W. Brands's trademark flair, the stories in Masters of Enterprise are must reading for all students of American business history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SYE2eius694C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sanditon","description":"'no person could be really well . . . without spending at least six weeks by the sea every year' In Sanditon, Jane Austen writes what may well be the first seaside novel: a novel, that is, that explores the mysterious and startling transformations that a stay by the sea can work on individuals and relationships. Sanditon is a fictitious place on England's south coast and the obsession of local landowner Mr Thomas Parker. He means to transform this humble fishing village into a fashionable health resort to rival its famous neighbours of Brighton and Eastbourne. In this, her final, unfinished work, the writer sets aside her familiar subject matter, the country village with its settled community, for the transient and eccentric assortment of people who drift to the new resort, the town built upon sand. If the ground beneath her characters' feet appears less secure, Austen's own vision is opening out. Light and funny, Sanditon is her most experimental and poignant work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q0KjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Psychological Assessment","description":"The most highly acclaimed and complete reference work on psychological assessment-fully updated and expanded Covering principles of assessment, evaluation, referral, treatment planning, and report writing, the latest edition of Gary Groth-Marnat's landmark Handbook of Psychological Assessment has been thoroughly revised and expanded.

The second volume of Siegfried Sassoon's semiautobiographical George Sherston trilogy picks up shortly after Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man: in 1916, with the young Sherston deep in the trenches of WWI. For his decorated bravery, and also his harmful recklessness, he is soon sent to the Fourth Army School for officer training, then dispatched to Morlancourt, a raid, and on through the Somme. After being wounded by a bullet through the lung, he returns home to convalesce, where his questioning of the war and the British Military establishment leads him to write a public anti-war letter (verbatim the letter Sassoon wrote in 1917, entitled \\"Finished with the War: A Soldier s Declaration\\", which was eventually read in the British House of Commons). Through the help of close friend David Cromlech (based on Sassoon's friend Robert Graves) a medical board decides not to prosecute, but instead deem him to be mentally ill, suffering from shell-shock, and sends him to a hospital for treatment. Sassoon's stunning portrayal of a mind coming to terms with the brutal truths he has encountered in war as well as his unsentimental, though often poetic, portrayal of class-defined life in England at wartime is amongst the greatest books ever written about World War I, or war itself.

That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. . . . The manner in which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology and spirituality is illuminating.   Los Angeles Times Book Review The bestselling classic that holds the key to unlocking meaning, creativity, peak performance, and true happiness. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's famous investigations of \\"optimal experience\\" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi (\\"the leading researcher into  flow states \\"  Newsweek) demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QVjPsd1UukEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rain on the River: New and Selected Poems and Short Prose","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History of England","description":"A complete social and political history of England.

Deeply engaging and witty  (Los Angeles Times). Long before Columbus arrived in the New Word, tobacco was cultivated and enjoyed by the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas, who used it for medicinal, religious, and social purposes. But when Europeans began to colonize the American continents, it became something else entirely a cultural touchstone of pleasure and success, and a coveted commodity that would transform the world economy forever. Iain Gately s Tobacco tells the epic story of an unusual plant and its unique relationship with the history of humanity, from its obscure ancient beginnings, through its rise to global prominence, to its current embattled state today. In a lively narrative, Gately makes the case for the tobacco trade being the driving force behind the growth of the American colonies, the foundation of Dutch trading empire, the underpinning cause of the African slave trade, and the financial basis for victory in the American Revolution. Well-researched and wide-ranging, Tobacco is a vivid and provocative look at the surprising roles this plant has played in the culture of the world.  Ambitious . . . informative and perceptive . . . Gately is an amusing writer, which is a blessing.

As of March 2005, Microsoft no longer supports this version of Visual Basic. And you can't blame them.

But roughly five million of you decided to stick with VB6, mostly to maintain legacy Windows and COM projects. Now, with the upcoming release of VB 2005, Microsoft has several attractive reasons to upgrade that you'll find hard to resist, including the return of some VB6 features. And we have the perfect book to help you make the conversion: Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart. Now, you can test-drive the beta version of VB 2005 with three hands-on projects that enable you to learn the syntax of this new language quickly. VB 2005 not only lets you convert the bulk of your existing VB6 code, but offers several familiar features, such as compile-and-run debugging, new MyClasses that simplify use of .NET libraries and frameworks, lots of IDE support for Windows, web and mobile GUI development, and data access controls that closely resemble what you use now. The real plus is that you'll be using these features with the .NET platform, which is more secure, less complex than COM, and offers OneClick deployment. Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart lets you get the feel of this platform for building smart/rich Windows Forms clients, ASP.NET web applications, and web services.

For such we can have nothing but respect while the fight is going on and friendship when it is over. Captain Franz von Rintelen belongs to this latter class. A young naval officer with every likelihood of reaching to high rank, he went abroad in 1915 and only saw his own country again after the lapse of six strenuous and, in part, unhappy years. The history of those years is told in this book. The conversations which he records depend, of course, upon his memory; the main facts we are able to check, and we know them to be exact. The book is written, as one would expect from his record, without the least rancour, and I think I am not trenching upon the province of criticism when I add with admirable simplicity. It is a record which is more detailed and concerned with endeavours on a vastly wider scale than is usual in such accounts. One cannot, I think, read it without recognising, apart from the magnitude of the things attempted and done, the terrific strain under which he lived; and this gives a moving and human quality to the narrative which sets it a little apart from any other which I have read. Those who are most saturated in spy stories will find much to surprise them in this volume, and they will not be likely to forget the poignant minutes which he spent on the top of an omnibus in London and the way in which those minutes ended. Finally, here is as good an argument against War as a man could find in twenty volumes devoted to that subject alone.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CpbEDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luna, Luna: Creative Writing Ideas from Spanish, Latin American, and Latino Literature","description":"Contains twenty-one essays that describe ways Spanish and Latino literature has been used in the classroom, discussing the works of Federico Garc a Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Sandra Cisneros, and others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=emMQAAAAYAAJ&dq=Luna,+Luna:+Creative+Writing+Ideas+from+Spanish,+Latin+American,+and+Latino+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PRAXIS/CST Home Economics Education (Family Consumer Science) (National Teacher Examination Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QVJYAAAAMAAJ&dq=PRAXIS/CST+Home+Economics+Education+(Family+Consumer+Science)+(National+Teacher+Examination+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Thought My Father Was God","description":"A collection of 180 personal, true-life accounts from NPR's National Story Project reflects the work of men and women of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life and is accompanied by Auster's illuminating look at the role of storytelling in our lives.

In addition to the now seemingly ubiquitous dude ranch-style furniture, western furnishings today range from meticulous leather-wrapped armoires to petrified-stone tabletops on fantastically curved and striated juniper bases, from headboards inset with strips of Indian beadwork to rustic desks made from woods not traditionally western. While there are still plenty of mounted heads on wall in the West, lighting fixtures range from the traditional cut-metal silhouettes to three-dimensional cast-bronze pieces by fine artists. The river-rock fireplace still predominates, but there's also a place for hand-carved mantelpieces depicting a trout stream or local wildlife that represents hundreds of hours of painstaking work. This extraordinary commitment of time plus a pure passion and singular creative vision are the hallmarks of the fine furnishings of the contemporary West. Today's artisans are creating works that are fresh, beautiful, meticulously crafted, sometimes nostalgic, often humorous, and always celebratory of both the region and its traditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m3-EkcXrhF0C&dq=Cowboy+Chic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signaling System No. 7 (SS7/C7): Protocol, Architecture, and Services (Networking Technology)","description":"A complete, practical guide to the world's most popular signaling system, including SIGTRAN, GSM-MAP, and Intelligent Networks.

SS7 has numerous applications and is at the very heart of telecommunications. Setting up phone calls, providing cellular roaming and messaging, and supplying converged voice and data services are only a few of the ways that SS7 is used in the communications network. SS7 also provides the point of interconnection between converging voice and data networks. This transition, which affects everyone who works with the data network, has bolstered the need for practical and applied information on SS7. In short, anyone who is interested in telecommunications should have a solid understanding of SS7. Signaling System No. 7 (SS7/C7): Protocol, Architecture, and Services will help you understand SS7 from several perspectives. It examines the framework and architecture of SS7, as well as how it is used to provide today's telecommunications services.

A surprisingly clear-headed view of potheads worldwide  (The New Yorker). In Pot Planet, journalist Brian Preston sets out on a global ganja safari to explore strange new cannabis cultures, to seek out new growers, activists, and other reefer revolutionaries . . . and to boldly get baked with each of them. Preston s journeys take him across every strata of pot cultivation and enjoyment. In the Canadian Kootenays, he meets hemp farmers struggling to harvest their crop on the fringes of legitimacy. In Cambodia and Morocco, he explores the final frontiers of Third World weed enthusiasts. In northern California, he takes a clear-eyed look at the medicinal marijuana movement, seeing both its promises and its problems. In England, Switzerland, and Spain, he observes grudging governments catching up to public tolerance. And at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, he joins in the raucous multiday tasting competition and celebration at the international summit of the best breeders, growers, and connoisseurs in the world.

The central idea is that Jacob, representing the farmer and civilized man, suffers a deep wound when he swindles the birthright of Esau, representing the hunter and primitive man. Herriot queries whether we, as Jacob did with Esau, can eventually reconcile with the wilderness that we have conquered and have been estranged from for so long.Jacob's Wound takes readers on an untrodden path through history, nature, science, and theology, sharing stories and personal experiences that beautifully illuminate what we once were and what we have become.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a333DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreams Come True (Disney Princess) (Super Coloring Time)","description":"Four favorite Disney princesses--Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, andAriel--are featured in this coloring book.

With access to new evidence and secret materials from both here and abroad, including an archive of captured North Korean documents, Bruce Cumings reveals the war as it was actually fought. He describes its origin as a civil war, preordained long before the first shots were fired in June 1950 by lingering fury over Japan s occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. Cumings then shares the neglected history of America s postWorld War II occupation of Korea, reveals untold stories of bloody insurgencies and rebellions, and tells of the United States officially entering the action on the side of the South, exposing as never before the appalling massacres and atrocities committed on all sides.

In Meatpackers and Beef Barons: Company Town in a Global Economy, sociologist Carol Andreas traces the development of the meatpacking industry in Greeley, Colorado. As a case study, Greeley is significant because modern beef-processing technology began here as a small family business and evolved into a division of one of the most lucrative and powerful corporations in the world: ConAgra, Inc. Andreas argues that a concentration of ownership in the multibillion-dollar beef industry has been accompanied by increased exploitation and injury to workers. Meatpackers and Beef Barons presents gripping testimony of meatpacking workers from Monfort, Inc. The experiences of these workers are placed in context of historical developments locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. Some of the highly charged issues that are discussed include intimidation of workers, the replacement of union workers by nonunion immigrants, speed up of disassembly lines, strikes, plant closures, and company influence on legislation and law enforcement. Meatpackers and Beef Barons focuses on the restructuring of the production process in the red meat industry and the effect of the restructuring on women and men who work in meatpacking plants and on the communities in which they live. It explodes local myths about the beneficence of corporate \\"leadership\\" and examines the possibilities for change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y8KwAAAAIAAJ&dq=Meatpackers+and+Beef+Barons:+Company+Town+in+a+Global+Economy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to the Law of Real Property: An Historical Background of the Common Law of Real Property And Its Modern Application","description":"This classic monograph presents a simple, concise and readable text of the history of the English common law scheme of estates in land, including future interests, and the scheme's importation to the United States.

Not only is the welfare state draining billions from the economy, it has given rise to an underclass, lacking the social capital necessary to participate in mainstream society. In this collection of essays the authors consider attempts to reform welfare in both the USA and the UK. David Smith is unimpressed by the Blair government's two flagship policies, the much vaunted New Deal and the introduction of the working families tax credit. Norman Dennis dissects the hollow rhetoric of the official line on the family, and exposes the anti-family tendencies of proponents of the 'Third Way'. Richard Pryke dismisses exaggerated poverty statistics and finds the real problem to be an underclass concentrated in social housing. It is left to US contributors John Clark and Jay Hein to provide an example of welfare reform that works. Since the 1996 welfare reform legislation, the USA has seen caseloads fall by nearly 40 per cent nationwide, with some states showing falls of over 80 per cent. failed to reform a system that saps incentive and rewards bad behaviour. It need not be like this, and it is not too late to change. it. Of the 191,000 people placed into jobs through the New Deal since its inception, more than 50,000 were back on benefits within three months... it is likely that the numbers ultimately returning to the dole are even greater... Of the rest, the vast majority would have found jobs anyway, thanks to the strength of the economy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nowzMUOxv_wC&dq=Welfare,+Work+and+Poverty:+Lessons+from+Recent+Reforms+in+the+US+and+the+UK+(Civil+Society)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THEN HANG ALL THE LIARS","description":"Crime reporter Samantha Adams investigates the murder of a ladies  man in this  terrific  mystery with a  witty, sexy and smart  Southern sleuth (Nancy Pickard, award-winning author of the Jenny Cain series).

The message they carried is proof that Jesus was who He said, the Son of God! And these miracles hold great relevance in our lives today. As Dr. Rogers said, \\"Their purpose is to deepen our trust in Him, not in the miracles themselves.\\" They serve as signposts pointing to Jesus, showing that He was and is God's answer to your deepest need - to your disappointments, doubts, disabilities, desires, despair, darkness, and death. This book will change the way you view God and His work in our lives. **** ABOUT THE AUTHOR: For over fifty years, Adrian Rogers preached and championed the Word of God. In that time he became one of America's most respected Bible teachers presenting the Good News of Jesus Christ with strong conviction, compassion, and integrity. His ministry continues thanks to a rich legacy of sermons, studies, books, booklets, and other resource materials. Through Love Worth Finding, his multimedia ministry, tens of thousands of believers have had their faith strengthened and thousands more have entered into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. His teaching will inspire you to grow in your love of the Lord and service in His kingdom. \\"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His name.\\" John 20:30-31","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oQYvngEACAAJ&dq=Believe+in+Miracles+but+Trust+in+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colonial Printer","description":"Beautifully illustrated study explores every aspect of the American printer and his craft from 1639 to 1800.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GxzyEpnT-VAC&dq=Colonial+Printer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reaper's Gale: Malazan Book of the Fallen #7: (UK Hardcover Steven Erikson)","description":"The Letherii Empire is in turmoil.

It is a practical \\"how-to\\" book, but it is extremely well researched and covers every imaginable custodial issue. No one involved in a custodial battle should enter the courtroom without first reading it. With this book everybody wins--mothers, fathers, and especially the children. The use of the military metaphor throughout (including a photo of a child in a Marine Corps dress uniform on the cover) is in recognition of two salient facts about custody disputes: they can be psychologically as brutal as war; and the stakes can be extremely high. Yet, the book demonstrates with details and documents, that negotiations are possible, and if the welfare of the child has the highest priority, both sides can win.I would advise you, however, NOT to go into court without having first read this remarkable book. Over the course of 640 triple-columned pages, Hardwick shares her personal experience and her painfully accumulated knowledge on just about every conceivable aspect of the child custody wars while guiding the reader toward a powerful strategy. If you don't have this book you are likely to be overmatched; indeed if your attorney doesn't have this book, he or she is likely to be overmatched. In fact, I would say that the first thing you should do after reading the book yourself, is buy a copy for your attorney and somehow persuade him or her to open the pages and to start reading--anywhere in the book. I promise you your attorney will learn facts, ideas, strategies new to him or her. The expanse and depth of the material presented here quite frankly amazed me. This extensive tome constitutes an entire course not only in child custody disputes but in human psychology, parenting, and the law itself. Some items: There are 91 pages citing, summarizing, quoting from, and referencing relevant cases and decisions.There is a detailed guide on how to negotiate and what conflict resolution is all about;a chapter on how to handle discovery and depositions; another on judges, what to expect from them and how you might get a good one or avoid a bad one; there's guidance on what to expect in court and how to present yourself and your case; how to select an attorney; what your case is likely to cost and how to discover the assets of your adversaries, including (this floored me) hidden assets such as \\"Overpayments to the IRS\\". You will learn about how much you can expect to pay or receive in child support, and again how to gauge assets, including hidden income such as \\"excessive deductions on paychecks\\" --a nice dodge which amounts to loaning Uncle Sam the money until tax time! You will also: --Discover how to handle psychologists and other \\"evaluators\\" and influence them to your advantage. For example beware of the \\"halo effect.\\" (Have your side evaluated by the psychologist first to secure that effect.) --Understand what psychological tests can be given and what they can mean in the dispute. Sometimes the judge makes the court-ordered decision of a professional binding, so that \\"you have in fact a new judge.\\" --Appreciate the role of other experts, what they can and cannot do to further your case, and how to evaluate and get a reliable expert who will make an effective witness.--Learn the value of keeping a detailed log of everything pertaining to your case and its possible use as documentation. Hardwick presents this with some tips on how e-mail and computer files can come back to haunt you if you share the wrong information, even anonymously or through the assumption of an Internet moniker.--Become knowledgeable about lie detectors and their use and misuse and the reach of DNA testing.--Know which problems or accusations are issues and which are non-issues in the eyes of the law. For example, child endangerment is an issue; a \\"blended\\" family is not. Physical abuse is an issue; false accusations may or may not be. --Be introduced to the infamous Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS) in which one parent tries to alienate the child from the other parent through lies and distortions. PAS includes \\"The Grand Lie\\" in which one side falsely accuses the other of child sexual abuse, a charge that is hard to become completely free of, regardless of the truth of the accusation.Hardwick even includes some humor with eleven ways on how to know \\"You've Been in Court Too Long\\" (from Dean Hughson).

This is a fantastic, timely book that I highly recommend.\\"  Steve Kerr, Head Coach, Golden State Warriors Knowing how to transform conflict is critical in both our personal and professional lives. Yet, by and large, we are terrible at it. The reason, says longtime mediator Chad Ford, is fear. When conflict comes, our instincts are to run or fight. To transform conflict, Ford says we need to turn toward the people we are in conflict with, put down our physical and emotional weapons, and really love them with the kind of love that leads us to treat others as fellow human beings, not as objects in our way. We have to open ourselves up with no guarantee that anyone on the other side will do the same. While this can feel even more dangerous than conflict itself, it allows us to see the humanity of others so clearly that their needs and desires matter to us as much as our own. Ford shows dangerous love in action through examples ranging from his work in the Middle East to a deeply moving story about reconciling with his father. He explains why we disconnect from people at the very time we need to be most connected and the predictable patterns of justification and escalation that ensue. Most importantly, he gives us a path to practice dangerous love in the conflicts that matter most to us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AyzJDwAAQBAJ&dq=Dangerous+to+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AP World History (Advanced Placement Test series)","description":"AP Biology Premium Prep, 2021, previously titled Cracking the AP Biology Exam, Premium Edition, will now include a total of 6 full-length practice tests.

Val Ross presents a history of reading that is, in fact, the story of the monumental, on-going struggle to read. From Enheduanna, daughter of Sargon the Great, the world s oldest signed author to Empress Shotoku of Japan who in 764 ordered the printing of one million Buddhist prayers; from the story of Hulagu, Ghengis Khan s nasty brother who destroyed the library of Baghdad to Bowdler and the censorship of Shakespeare, there have been barriers to reading ranging from the physical to the economical, social, and political. Written for children ages ten and up, You Can t Read This explores the development of alphabets, the decoding of ancient languages, and censorship in Ancient Rome and modern America. It's about secret writing, trashed libraries, writers on the run, writers in hiding, books that are thought to have magical powers and mistranslations that started wars. It's about people: from the American slave Frederick Douglass to girls in Afghanistan in the year 2001 who defied laws that prevented them from learning to read. What do all these stories have in common? They re all about how texts contain power  and how people everywhere throughout history have devoted their wills and their brains to reading and unleashing the power of the word.

Instead, the Inkas' records consisted of devices made of knotted and dyed strings called khipu on which they recorded information pertaining to the organization and history of their empire. Despite more than a century of research on these remarkable devices, the khipu remain largely undeciphered. In this benchmark book, twelve international scholars tackle the most vexed question in khipu studies: how did the Inkas record and transmit narrative records by means of knotted strings? The authors approach the problem from a variety of angles. Several essays mine Spanish colonial sources for details about the kinds of narrative encoded in the khipu. Others look at the uses to which khipu were put before and after the Conquest, as well as their current use in some contemporary Andean communities. Still others analyze the formal characteristics of khipu and seek to explain how they encode various kinds of numerical and narrative data.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HTYGAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Translation of Children's Literature: A Reader (Topics in Translation)","description":"In the last few decades a number of European scholars have paid an increasing amount of attention to children's literature in translation.

Research Laboratory of Electronics. Special technical report)","description":"The fiftieth anniversary edition of a landmark work in generative grammar that continues to be influential, with a new preface by the author. Noam Chomsky's Aspects of the Theory of Syntax, published in 1965, was a landmark work in generative grammar that introduced certain technical innovations still drawn upon in contemporary work. The fiftieth anniversary edition of this influential book includes a new preface by the author that identifies proposals that seem to be of lasting significance, reviews changes and improvements in the formulation and implementation of basic ideas, and addresses some of the controversies that arose over the general framework. Beginning in the mid-fifties and emanating largely from MIT, linguists developed an approach to linguistic theory and to the study of the structure of particular languages that diverged in many respects from conventional modern linguistics. Although the new approach was connected to the traditional study of languages, it differed enough in its specific conclusions about the structure of language to warrant a name,  generative grammar.  Various deficiencies were discovered in the first attempts to formulate a theory of transformational generative grammar and in the descriptive analysis of particular languages that motivated these formulations. At the same time, it became apparent that these formulations can be extended and deepened. In this book, Chomsky reviews these developments and proposes a reformulation of the theory of transformational generative grammar that takes them into account. The emphasis in this study is syntax; semantic and phonological aspects of the language structure are discussed only insofar as they bear on syntactic theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ljFkBgAAQBAJ&dq=Aspects+of+the+theory+of+syntax+(Massachusetts+Institute+of+Technology.+Research+Laboratory+of+Electronics.+Special+technical+report)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems For Surviving: Breakup, Abuse & Divorce","description":"Breakups suck.

Essential for all students of medieval literature, Early Fiction in England includes extracts by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Wace, Marie de France, Chaucer and many others, in new translations and with illuminating introductions. Before the twelfth century, fiction had completely disappeared in Europe. In this important and provocative book, Laura Ashe shows how English writers brought it back, composing new tales about King Arthur, his knights and other heroes and heroines in Latin, French and English. Why did fiction disappear, and why did it come to life again to establish itself the dominant form of literature ever since? And what do we even mean by the term 'fiction'? Gathering extracts from the most important texts of the period by Wace, Marie de France, Chaucer and others, this volume offers an absorbing and surprising introduction to the earliest fiction in England. The anthology includes a general introduction by Laura Ashe, introductions to each extract, explanatory notes and other useful editorial materials. All French and Latin texts have been newly translated, while Middle English texts include helpful glosses. Laura Ashe is a University Lecturer in English and Fellow of Worcester College, Oxford. Her first book Fiction and History in England, 1066-1200 (Cambridge University Press, 2007) has been followed by numerous articles and edited collections; she is now writing the newOxford English Literary History vol. 1: 1000-1350 (Oxford University Press).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t0SbBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why Are We Created?

It follows the ambitions of Julien Sorel, a young man raised in the French countryside who wishes to rise above his provincial station by climbing the social ranks of Parisian society. Through a series of events, Juliens talent and hard work give way to deception and hypocrisy when he realizes the limitations for advancement of a sincere and honest man of humble origins. Although Julien achieves much which he aspires to, ultimately his pride gets the better of him when he commits a violent crime of passion, leading to his tragic downfall. Through the deep psychological introspection of Julien we see Stendhals unique literary genius, the remarkable way in which he allows readers to live in the minds of his characters. Set against the backdrop of the July Revolution of 1830, The Red and the Black is a narrative which embodies the rich social conflict of that time.

Each of us, says author Anne Robertson, builds our own way of understanding God our  God-box -- and fills it up with bits of scripture, wisdom, and our experiences of God at work in our lives. It s a perfectly good way to puzzle out what God means to us. Encountering God through our human limitations, we learn something about the meaning of Incarnation. But to say that our experience of God is the only valid one is to put a lid on the box and create an idol. This book is about examining our God-boxes and bursting them wide open. Blowing the Lid Off the God-Box starts with the ministry of Jesus  who blew the lid off everyone s God-box by constantly challenging his followers with the unexpected. Subsequent chapters examine the God-boxes we create with scripture, worship, and political and social agendas. In a world marked by extremism on both the right and left, the author calls readers to spiritual balance as they learn to integrate others  experiences of God, rather than insisting on their own. Anne Robertson is a United Methodist minister who leads a parish in Dover, New Hampshire. Active in the New England Conference of the United Methodist Church, she is a regular columnist for Zion s Herald, a national publication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UMN12O-nhj4C&dq=Blowing+The+Lid+Off+The+God-Box:+Opening+Up+To+A+Limitless+Faith+(Explorefaith.Org+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystery at Land's End","description":"A serial killer is stalking women across Long Island.

As the two friends struggle to reconcile their desires against the expectations and institutions that seek to define them, they find themselves speeding toward a future more violent and senseless than they can imagine. Neither will escape unscathed. In the tradition of Junot Diaz s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie s Americanah, Speak No Evil explores what it means to be different in a fundamentally conformist society and how that difference plays out in our inner and outer struggles. It is a novel about the power of words and self-identification, about who gets to speak and who has the power to speak for other people. As heart-wrenching and timely as his breakout debut, Beasts of No Nation, Uzodinma Iweala s second novel cuts to the core of our humanity and leaves us reeling in its wake.

Betty Pack was charming, beautiful, and intelligent and she knew it. As an agent for Britain s MI-6 and then America s OSS during World War II, these qualities proved crucial to her success. This is the remarkable story of this  Mata Hari from Minnesota  (Time) and the passions that ruled her tempestuous life a life filled with dangerous liaisons and death-defying missions vital to the Allied victory. For decades, much of Betty s career working for MI-6 and the OSS remained classified. Through access to recently unclassified files, Howard Blum discovers the truth about the attractive blond, codenamed  Cynthia,  who seduced diplomats and military attach s across the globe in exchange for ciphers and secrets; cracked embassy safes to steal codes; and obtained the Polish notebooks that proved key to Alan Turing s success with Operation Ultra. Beneath Betty s cool, professional determination, Blum reveals a troubled woman conflicted by the very traits that made her successful: her lack of deep emotional connections and her readiness to risk everything. The Last Goodnight is a mesmerizing, provocative, and moving portrait of an exceptional heroine whose undaunted courage helped to save the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dy6pCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Visit to the Sesame Street Hospital (Pictureback(R))","description":"Grover visits the hospital to find out what to expect when he goes to have his tonsils out.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2mFYNgAACAAJ&dq=A+Visit+to+the+Sesame+Street+Hospital+(Pictureback(R))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tenderly (That Special Woman) (Silhouette Special Edition, No 1147)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lDYvAQAAIAAJ&dq=Tenderly+(That+Special+Woman)+(Silhouette+Special+Edition,+No+1147)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","description":"This thoroughly revised edition of Bruce M.

In this master work, completed just before his death, William McLoughlin not only explains how the Cherokees rebuilt their lives and society, but also recounts their fight to govern themselves as a separate nation within the borders of the United States. Long regarded by whites as one of the 'civilized' tribes, the Cherokees had their own constitution (modeled after that of the United States), elected officials, and legal system. Once re-settled, they attempted to reestablish these institutions and continued their long struggle for self-government under their own laws--an idea that met with bitter opposition from frontier politicians, settlers, ranchers, and business leaders. After an extremely divisive fight within their own nation during the Civil War, Cherokees faced internal political conflicts as well as the destructive impact of an influx of new settlers and the expansion of the railroad. McLoughlin brings the story up to 1880, when the nation's fight for the right to govern itself ended in defeat at the hands of Congress.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bTxeBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quality Control (6th Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oh7zDwAAQBAJ&dq=Quality+Control+(6th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament II: Mark (Vol 2)","description":"The early church valued the Gospel of Mark for its preservation of the apostolic voice and gospel narrative of Peter.

Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language in this case narrative stories can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need, Shattered Voices explores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy to Hamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful. Shattered Voices contends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish. In the developing culture of ubiquitous truth reports, Phelps argues that we must become attentive to the form these reports take the narrative structure, the use of victims' stories, and the way a political message is conveyed to the citizens of the emerging democracy. By looking concretely at the work and responsibilities of truth commissions, Shattered Voices offers an important and thoughtful analysis of the efficacy of the ways human rights abuses are addressed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=abtF9cOf6NEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginning Direct3D Game Programming, Second Edition (Premier Press Game Development)","description":"With a detailed explanation of vertex and pixel shader programming, coverage of the new Microsoft HLSL (High Level Shader Language), and greater concentration of the fixed function pipeline, the second edition of this popular reference guide will take you farther than you ever imagined!

Imagine that within these universes there exist biological forms that reproduce, grow, and think. Imagine plantlike forms, ant colonies, immune systems, and brains, all adapting, evolving, and getting better at solving problems. Imagine if our computers became greenhouses for a new kind of nature. Just think what digital biology could do for us. Perhaps it could evolve new designs for us, think up ways to detect fraud using digital neurons, or solve scheduling problems with ants. Perhaps it could detect hackers with immune systems or create music from the patterns of growth of digital seashells. Perhaps it would allow our computers to become creative and inventive. Now stop imagining. digital biology is an intriguing glimpse into the future of technology by one of the most creative thinkers working in computer science today. As Peter J. Bentley explains, the next giant step in computing technology is already under way as computer scientists attempt to create digital universes that replicate the natural world. Within these digital universes, we will evolve solutions to problems, construct digital brains that can learn and think, and use immune systems to trap and destroy computer viruses. The biological world is the model for the next generation of computer software. By adapting the principles of biology, computer scientists will make it possible for computers to function as the natural world does. In practical terms, this will mean that we will soon have \\"smart\\" devices, such as houses that will keep the temperature as we like it and automobiles that will start only for drivers they recognize (through voice recognition or other systems) and that will navigate highways safely and with maximum fuel efficiency. Computers will soon be powerful enough and small enough that they can become part of clothing. \\"Digital agents\\" will be able to help us find a bank or restaurant in a city that we have never visited before, even as we walk through the airport. Miniature robots may even be incorporated into our bodies to monitor our health. Digital Biology is also an exploration of biology itself from a new perspective. We must understand how nature works in its most intimate detail before we can use these same biological processes inside our computers. Already scientists engaged in this work have gained new insights into the elegant simplicity of the natural universe. This is a visionary book, written in accessible, nontechnical language, that explains how cutting-edge computer science will shape our world in the coming decades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fmY9jwedEAcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Another Angel","description":"An Award Winning Canadian Bestseller An amazing story line that s deeply inspirational and laced with Pearls of wisdom An absolute must read! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- God causes all things to work together for good To those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.

Although recognizing that U.S. policymakers must consider a wider range of interests in the current political climate, Sutter argues that following the prevailing consensus among organized interests may lead to bad policy. Instead, he contends that U.S. foreign policy must strike a balance between satisfying domestic concerns while buttressing interests abroad.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GtgyCxnyLWgC&dq=U.S.+Policy+Toward+China:+An+Introduction+to+the+Role+of+Interest+Groups&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trouble on Janus","description":"Jack and his robot buddy, Danny One, set off for the planet Janus to rescue the young King Paul from his conniving uncle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IqSRS949dJMC&dq=The+Trouble+on+Janus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pharmacotherapy","description":"Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.

Legendary politician and military strategist Winston S. Churchill was a master not only of the battlefield, but of the page and the podium. Over the course of forty books and countless speeches, broadcasts, news items and more, he addressed a country at war and at peace, thrilling with victory but uneasy with its shifting role on the global stage. In 1953, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for  his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values.  During his lifetime, he enthralled readers and brought crowds roaring to their feet; in the years since his death, his skilled writing has inspired generations of eager history buffs. Best known for his political genius and keen eye for military tactics, Churchill was a man of many talents not the least of which was painting. Throughout his life, Churchill painted to relieve his mind from the demands of leadership and to keep the  black dog  of depression at bay. Included in this volume are Churchill s meditations on painting as a salve for the spirit and an essential creative pursuit. His love for the craft comes to life in this concise yet impassioned work. This volume includes eighteen reprints of Churchill s original work in oil, giving the reader a window into the little-known creative and artistic skill of this prominent figure in twentieth century history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c8qWAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hi Bob!: A Self-Help Guide to the Bob Newhart Show","description":"The Bob Newhart Show is one of the best-loved sitcoms to come out of the '70s.

Thagard provides a new and comprehensive perspective on the transformation of scientific conceptual systems. Thagard examines the Copernican and the Darwinian revolutions and the emergence of Newton's mechanics, Lavoisier's oxygen theory, Einstein's theory of relativity, quantum theory, and the geological theory of plate tectonics. He discusses the psychological mechanisms by which new concepts and links between them are formed, and advances a computational theory of explanatory coherence to show how new theories can be judged to be superior to previous ones.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n_FaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"360 Degrees of Wisdom","description":"A practical astrological guide discusses the use of the Sabian Symbols to chart one's inner psyche through astrology, in a handbook that is accompanied by forty-two specially designed cards, along with practical advice on how to interpret their meaning.

His clothes were so rumpled and dirty that street urchins would mock him. He had trouble holding on to servants, and what few friends he had, when they came to his flat, had to put up with stench from an unemptied chamber pot that he kept beside his piano. He became deaf. Mysterious ailments further isolated him from human society. Loneliness and desperation leap from the pages of his intimate letters and scribbled entries in his notebooks. He contemplated suicide. His relations with women were troubled and short-lived: at age forty he impulsively proposed marriage to a fifteen year old girl-who rejected him. Other liaisons came to naught. He wrote an opera about conjugal love in which the heroine, Leonora, rescues her husband from a dark cell under a fortress: one suspects this choice of subject reflects the composer's own need to be rescued, the need for such a woman in his own life. But a woman did come into his life-a woman different from all the others. She became his angel Leonora, whose identity he kept a secret from the world. After his death a few friends discovered a small compartment in his writing desk secured by a bent nail. In it was a three part love letter that he wrote to a woman who claimed that she loved him; he called her his \\"immortal beloved.\\" We have long wondered who this woman is. We now believe she is Antonie Brentano. What took place between these lovers? Mr. Gregory's novel explores the fears and doubts that must have afflicted the great composer as the star-crossed lovers come together in a locked embrace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tg7qwAEACAAJ&dq=My+Angel+Leonora:+Beethoven%27s+Love+for+Antonie+Brentano&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Postcard Books: Angels","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ma-AAAAACAAJ&dq=Postcard+Books:+Angels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sunshine State Almanac and Book of Florida-Related Stuff","description":"- Take an armchair whirl around Florida and digest tidbits of useful facts and fun trivia along the way - Chock-full of statistics, recipes, and photos--a veritable cornucopia of helpful (and just plain fascinating) stuff - How do you build a backyard pond and stock it with tropical flowers? - How can you attract songbirds to your bird feeder? - How many movies have been made in the Sunshine State, and were they gems or flops? - How do you get a license to captain a boat or run your business in Florida? - Includes a long list of what's going on around Florida every month of the year--from clambakes to chill cook-offs, pirate parades to pumpkin-carving contests, Oktoberfests to Christmas celebrations - A handy reference to keep around the house","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KAHQNdpUHWcC&dq=Sunshine+State+Almanac+and+Book+of+Florida-Related+Stuff&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visions of Jesus: Direct Encounters from the New Testament to Today","description":"Ernie Hollands, a career criminal, said Christ appeared to him in his cell in Millhaven Penitentiary. Maria Martinez saw Jesus at a busy intersection in Miami, Florida. Rose Fairs was lying in bed one morning when the Venetian blinds opened and the head of Jesus materialized before her. Were these people only imagining a figure that seemed life-like, or is there a chance that what they saw was, in some way, real? This first critical study of contemporary visions of Jesus offers the intriguing accounts of thirty people, most of them ordinary men and women without prior or subsequent experiences of this kind, who remain mystified about their encounters. Wiebe recounts each vision in vivid detail, exploring why these individuals believe their visions were of Jesus, and why they typically believe them to be objective happenings, rather than hallucinations or dreams. He regards the occurrences from perspectives as diverse as biblical scholarship and parapsychology, concluding that they may well represent genuine religious experiences of a mystical character. The fascinating nature of these visions and Wiebe's thoughtful, evenhanded approach to each report add up to a book that will be provocative reading for skeptics and the faithful alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xKo9zwDYj1EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100+ Activities for Houston Kids","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=--YpF-nrn8kC&dq=100++Activities+for+Houston+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thanksgiving Parade (Thanksgiving Board Books)","description":"Get excited about the Thanksgiving Day parade!

Richard E. Bennett presents new facts and ideas that challenge old assumptions particularly that life on the frontier encouraged American individualism. With an excellent command of primary sources, Bennett assesses the role of women in a pioneer society and the Mormon strategies for survival in a harsh environment as they planned their emigration, coped with internal dissension and Indian agents, and dealt with tribes of the region. This was, says Bennett,  Mormonism in the raw on the way to what it would be later.

The Pruitt-Igoe project is only one of the many environments in which urban Negro Americans lived in the 1960s, but the character of the family life there shares much with the family life of lower-class Negroes as it has been described by other investigators in other cities and at other times, in Harlem, Chicago, New Orleans, or Washington D.C. This book is primarily concerned with private life as it is lived from day to day in a federally built and supported slum. The questions, which are treated here, have to do with the kinds of interpersonal relationships that develop in nuclear families, the socialization processes that operate in families as children grow up in a slum environment, the informal relationships of children and adolescents and adults with each other, and, finally, the world views (the existential framework) arising from the life experiences of the Pruitt-Igoeans and the ways they make use of this framework to order their experiences and make sense out of them. The lives of these persons are examined in terms of life cycles. Each child there is born into a constricted world, the world of lower class, Negro existence, and as he grows he is shaped and directed by that existence through the day-to-day experiences and relationships available to him. The crucial transition from child of a family; to progenitor of a new family begins in adolescence, and for this reason the book pays particular attention to how each new generation of parents expresses the cultural and social structural forces that formed it and continue to constrain its behavior. This book, in short, is about intimate personal life in a particular ghetto setting. It does not analyze the larger institutional, social structural, and ideological forces that provide the social, economic, and political context in which lower-class Negro life is lived. These larger macro sociological forces are treated in another volume based on research in the Pruitt-Igoe community. However, this book does draw on the large body of literature on the structural position of Negroes in American society as background for its analysis of Pruitt-Igoe private life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mKs0DwAAQBAJ&dq=Behind+Ghetto+Walls:+Black+Families+in+a+Federal+Slum&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Invitation to Sailing","description":"A complete illustrated guide to small boat sailing that takes you from the first day out to racing in regattas, under the direction of an expert sailor and teacher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xHipws9Id2YC&dq=Invitation+to+Sailing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Halo Parade (Harpur & Iles Mysteries)","description":"The third title in the popular Harpur and Iles series.

Shy, afflicted with a stutter, and struggling with his sexuality, Will Parker comes to New York to escape the provincial western towns where he grew up. In New York, he finds himself surrounded for the first time by people who understand and celebrate his quirks and flaws. He also begins an unforgettable love affair with a volatile, six-foot-five African-American drag queen and performance artist named Rose. But even as he is falling in love with Rose and growing into himself, Will must watch as AIDS escalates from a rumor into a devastating tragedy.

Just Being Difficult? provides learned and thoughtful analyses of the claim, of those it targets, and of the entire question of how critical writing relates to its intended publics and to audiences beyond them. In this book, a range of distinguished scholars, including some who have been charged with willful obscurity, argue for the interest and importance of some of the procedures that critics have preferred to charge with obscurity rather than confront in another way.

Discover the life-changing memoir that has inspired millions of readers through the Academy Award?winning actor s unflinching honesty, unconventional wisdom, and lessons learned the hard way about living with greater satisfaction. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE GUARDIAN  McConaughey s book invites us to grapple with the lessons of his life as he did and to see that the point was never to win, but to understand.  Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck I ve been in this life for fifty years, been trying to work out its riddle for forty-two, and been keeping diaries of clues to that riddle for the last thirty-five. Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life s challenges how to get relative with the inevitable you can enjoy a state of success I call  catching greenlights.  So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, it s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. It s a love letter. To life. It s also a guide to catching more greenlights and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Good luck.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sULYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pilgrim : A Novel","description":"Ageless. Sexless. Deathless. Timeless.

Uniting the voices of 22 experts from around the world, Derek Congram s collection of original papers centres its attention on those who are engaged in the location, identification, and repatriation of missing persons. The contributors to this timely volume represent multiple disciplines and various fields, including academia, government, and civil service, but are connected by a shared conviction that accounting for the missing is vital for a just society. The chapters concentrate on victims of physical or structural violence, including armed conflict, repressive regimes, criminal behaviour, and racist and colonial policies towards Indigenous persons and minority populations. Some contexts are familiar morgues, mass graves, and battlefields while others are surprising, such as schoolyards and a museum in Canada. Although the circumstances of the disappearances vary greatly, Missing Persons illustrates the connections between these disparate contexts. Multidisciplinary in scope, this edited collection is a valuable comparative resource for students, academics, and practitioners in forensic anthropology, anthropological/archaeological ethics, forensic psychology, criminal justice, and human rights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RGqzDAAAQBAJ&dq=Missing+Person:+Unabridged&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preparing to Read","description":"Teachers make a difference. The success of any plan for improving educational outcomes depends on the teachers who carry it out and thus on the abilities of those attracted to the field and their preparation. Yet there are many questions about how teachers are being prepared and how they ought to be prepared. Yet, teacher preparation is often treated as an afterthought in discussions of improving the public education system. Preparing Teachers addresses the issue of teacher preparation with specific attention to reading, mathematics, and science. The book evaluates the characteristics of the candidates who enter teacher preparation programs, the sorts of instruction and experiences teacher candidates receive in preparation programs, and the extent that the required instruction and experiences are consistent with converging scientific evidence. Preparing Teachers also identifies a need for a data collection model to provide valid and reliable information about the content knowledge, pedagogical competence, and effectiveness of graduates from the various kinds of teacher preparation programs. Federal and state policy makers need reliable, outcomes-based information to make sound decisions, and teacher educators need to know how best to contribute to the development of effective teachers. Clearer understanding of the content and character of effective teacher preparation is critical to improving it and to ensuring that the same critiques and questions are not being repeated 10 years from now.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tS5kAgAAQBAJ&dq=Preparing+to+Read&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Personal Investing (5150248)","description":"The ABA Journal serves the legal profession.

He connects Zen to the philosophy of the samurai, and subtly portrays the relationship between Zen and swordsmanship, haiku, tea ceremonies, and the Japanese love of nature. Suzuki's contemplative work is enhanced by anecdotes, poetry, and illustrations showing silk screens, calligraphy, and examples of architecture. Since its original publication in 1938, this important work has played a major role in shaping conceptions of Zen's influence on Japanese traditional arts. Richard Jaffe's introduction acquaints a new generation of readers with Suzuki's life and career in both Japan and America. Jaffe discusses how Zen and Japanese Culture was received upon its first publication and analyzes the book in light of contemporary criticism, especially by scholars of Japanese Buddhism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i1RrPgAACAAJ&dq=Zen+and+Japanese+culture+(Bollingen+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Let Me Play: The Story of Charlie Sifford, the First Black Pga Golfer","description":"The first black golfer on the PGA tells of the consistent battles he has waged against bigotry in the exclusive world of golf and tells how his courage has opened the sport to a new generation of blacks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QG95QgAACAAJ&dq=Just+Let+Me+Play:+The+Story+of+Charlie+Sifford,+the+First+Black+Pga+Golfer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RYAN'S ENCHANTRESS","description":"Beautiful Susan Bradford can play boys' games with the best of them, but it will take the tender caresses of her handsome new neighbor to transform spunky tomboy Susan into a woman.

The novel consists of two novellas, \\"Adventure on Poloda\\" and \\"Tangor Returns\\", written quickly in late 1940. The first was published in The Blue Book Magazine in 1942, but the second did not see publication until 1964 when it was featured in Tales of Three Planets along with \\"The Resurrection of Jimber-Jaw\\" and The Wizard of Venus. Burroughs likely intended Beyond the Farthest Star to be the opening of a new series comparable to the Barsoom or Pellucidar sequences, but declining health and Burroughs's World War II service as a war correspondent prevented this from happening. However, the story saw new life in 1972, when it was adapted by comics writer Marv Wolfman and artist Dan Green as one of the back-ups in DC Comics' version of the Tarzan comic book; the story itself lasted until January 1973 (issues #212218, then Tarzan Family #61).

Essentials of the American Constitution examines five closely integrated components which make up the fundamental law: the Compact, Separation of Powers, Federalism, Representation, and the Bill of Rights. It is the interaction among these components that give the constitution its dynamism, and landmark decisions handed down by the Supreme Court involve two or more of them.This book's unique approach shows how the components often work together, assisting, explaining, or reinforcing one another. Providing an overview of the fundamental principles of the American Constitution, the author gives a firm foundation for students interested in American Government and Politics, Constitutional Law or Civil Liberties.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wWRCswEACAAJ&dq=Essentials+of+Constitutional+Law:+The+Supreme+Court+and+the+Fundamental+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Writer's FAQ's: A Pocket Handbook, Second Edition","description":"Fast answers to frequently asked questions about publishing--from preparing, submitting, and selling your manuscript, to industry etiquette, sales, and profitability.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JjeGe9OU_LUC&dq=The+Writer%27s+FAQ%27s:+A+Pocket+Handbook,+Second+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith and Saving Faith","description":"When lobbyist Faith Lockhart stumbles upon a corruption scheme at the highest levels of government, she becomes a dangerous witness who the most powerful men in the world will go to any lengths to silence in this #1 New York Times bestselling thriller.

The experience of maturation was often clumsy and out of step, an evolutionary process that saw the nation's developing at their own pace as they struggled to replace the protection of Rome with their own home-grown strength. What the nations, once they were ready to be described in that manner, did have was the Roman Catholic Church, which defined itself as the spiritual protector of Christian believers. But the dutiful Christians of the Middle Ages who sought orthodoxy and for the most part obeyed the papal rules underwent a change when the Middle Ages ended. The Renaissance, or rebirth, was a period of time when Europeans began to question what they had been told was sacrosanct. Through art, inventions, science, literature, and theology, the separate nations of the European continent sought answers that the Roman Catholic Church was unwilling, or perhaps unable, to offer. Inside you will read about... ? The Rebirth of Europe ? The Italian Renaissance ? The French Renaissance ? The Spanish Renaissance ? The German Renaissance ? The Low Countries Renaissance ? The English Renaissance ? Here Be Dragons: Exploring the Unknown The Church that had become a powerful political entity was viewed with distrust and skepticism by many Christians; the spread of learning that accompanied the invention of Gutenberg s printing press meant that bold new ideas were traveling across the boundaries of Europe faster than the Church could silence them. Lascivious, power-brokering popes could not bring a halt to the challenges they encountered when a German priest rebelled against corrupt practices that masqueraded as ecclesiastical authority. As the walls came tumbling down, humanism burst forth, inspiring the art of Michelangelo, the science of Vesalius, the literature of Shakespeare and Cervantes. But with the loss of religious uniformity came terrible conflicts: France suffered the St. Bartholomew s Day Massacre; Spain welcomed the Inquisition to purge heresy; the Low Countries were split between Catholic and Protestant. The Renaissance was a triumph of the human spirit and a confirmation of human ability, even as it affirmed the willingness of men and women to die for the right to think freely.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RmKfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Testament, No. 3: Luke (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture)","description":"For the church fathers the Gospels did not serve as resources for individual analysis and academic study.

A sometime collaborator with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, yet never fully accepted into mainstream suffragist circles, Woodhull was a flamboyant social reformer who promoted freedom, especially freedom from societal constraints over intimate relationships. This much we know from the several popular biographies of the nineteenth-century activist. But what we do not know, as Amanda Frisken reveals, is how Woodhull manipulated the emerging popular media and fluid political culture of the Reconstruction period in order to accomplish her political goals. As an editor and public speaker, Woodhull demanded that women and men be held to the same standards in public life. Her political theatrics brought the topic of women's sexuality into the public arena, shocking critics, galvanizing supporters, and finally locking opposing camps into bitter conflict over sexuality and women's rights in marriage. A woman who surrendered her own privacy, whose life was grist for the mills of a sensation-mongering press, she made the exposure of others' secrets a powerful tool of social change. Woodhull's political ambitions became inseparable from her sexual nonconformity, yet her skill in using contemporary media kept her revolutionary ideas continually before her peers. In this way Woodhull contributed to long-term shifts in attitudes about sexuality and the slow liberation of marriage and other social institutions. Using contemporary sources such as images from the \\"sporting news,\\" Frisken takes a fresh look at the heyday of this controversial women's rights activist, discovering Woodhull's previously unrecognized importance in the turbulent climate of Radical Reconstruction and making her a useful lens through which to view the shifting sexual mores of the nineteenth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bq3rxISOD6AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Defense of Informal Logic (ARGUMENTATION LIBRARY Volume 2)","description":"\\"Against the Logicians\\" is what the author calls his eclectic collection of 15 essays spanning the last 15 years.

Always an outcast himself, Genet was drawn to this displaced people, an attraction that was to prove as complicated for him as it was enduring. Prisoner of Love, written some ten years later, when many of the men Genet had known had been killed, and he himself was dying, is a beautifully observed description of that time and those men as well as a reaffirmation of the author's commitment not only to the Palestinian revolution but to rebellion itself. For Genet's most overtly political book is also his most personal the last step in the unrepentantly sacrilegious pilgrimage first recorded in The Thief's Journal, and a searching meditation, packed with visions, ruses, and contradictions, on such life-and-death issues as the politics of the image and the seductive and treacherous character of identity. Genet's final masterpiece is a lyrical and philosophical voyage to the bloody intersection of oppression, terror, and desire at the heart of the contemporary world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zXM0px02-WEC&dq=Prisoner+Of+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alice of Old Vincennes,","description":"\\"Alice of Old Vincennes\\" by Maurice Thompson.

The social significance of computers as mediators and brokers has tremendous political and economic consequences. For managers, these consequences manifest themselves most clearly in the virtual organization, which is founded on the separation of requirements, for example, inputs such as components, from the ways in which requirements are met, or satisfiers, for example, suppliers and distribution networks. Separating these elements allows managers to switch easily from one way of meeting a requirement to another. Used systematically, switching brings huge increases in productivity but it also weakens traditional loyalties. Absent a sense of loyalty to persons or places, virual organizations distance themselves from the regions and countries in which they operate. This process is undermining the nation-state, which cannot continue indefinitely to control virtual organizations. A new feudal system is in the making, in which power and authority are vested in private hands but which is based on globally distributed resources rather than on the possession of land. The evolution of this new political economy will determine how we do business in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGuotZZLXEwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Final Blackout","description":"The world is in the throes of economic decay and at the mercy of terrorists.

In an age when even meals are rarely made from scratch, homespun easily acquires the glow of nostalgia. The objects Ulrich investigates unravel those simplified illusions, revealing important clues to the culture and people who made them. Ulrich uses an Indian basket to explore the uneasy coexistence of native and colonial Americans. A piece of silk embroidery reveals racial and class distinctions, and two old spinning wheels illuminate the connections between colonial cloth-making and war. Pulling these divergent threads together, Ulrich demonstrates how early Americans made, used, sold, and saved textiles in order to assert their identities, shape relationships, and create history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UVg0vSqfmT4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunger and Ecstasy of Vampires","description":"A professor recounts his time travels, one of which was to a world where vampires raised humans for blood.

Xenophon's portrait is the only one other than Plato's to survive, and while it offers a very personal interpretation of Socratic thought, it also reveals much about the man and his philosophical views. In 'Socrates' Defence' Xenophon defends his mentor against charges of arrogance made at his trial, while the 'Memoirs of Socrates' also starts with an impassioned plea for the rehabilitation of a wronged reputation. Along with 'The Estate-Manager', a practical economic treatise, and 'The Dinner-Party', a sparkling exploration of love, Xenophon's dialogues offer fascinating insights into the Socratic world and into the intellectual atmosphere and daily life of ancient Greece.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qwp-kOetNUQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Manners' guide to excruciatingly correct behavior","description":"An indispensable manual to navigating life from birth to death without making a false move.

It's a case of malaria versus murder when private dick extraordinaire Kinky Friedman comes down with a tropical disease, in the jungle known as New York City, and is confined to his loft on Vandam Street in lower Manhattan, a prisoner in his own home with only his cat and black puppet head as company (neither of whom are great conversationalists). With little to do but stare out the window in between bedridden bouts of fever and hallucinations, Kinky calls on assistance from the stalwart Village Irregulars, who proceed to dish out their own uniquely skewed brand of tea and sympathy, turning the loft into a virtual Mardi Gras of confusion and drunken debauchery. Suffering almost as much from company overload as from his fever, Kinky welcomes a rare moment of calm as he finds himself once again alone in his loft. Resuming his position at the kitchen window, he spots a pretty young woman in an apartment across the street. What he hopes might be titillating turns terrifying, however, as a man joins the woman and proceeds to attack her. Sure that he's witnessed a crime, Kinky calls in the cops, but, upon investigating his claim, they can find neither a victim nor an apartment across the street. In addition, no one else saw or heard anything that would ndicate a crime had taken place. Was it foul play or merely a fevered dream? Convinced that their friend is about to slip off into the land of eternal slumber, the Village Irregulars increase their vigilance and in the process raise the Kinkster's irritability level to an all-time high. Not to be deterred, however, Kinky sticks to his story and is rewarded when a few days later he sees the man in the apartment again, but this time with a gun. Outrageous, audacious, and ingeniously crafted, The Prisoner of Vandam Street is vintage Kinky: irreverent, clever, and full of the hardened philosophy and mordant wit that has earned him a vast and devoted readership. But what more would you expect from the writer The New York Times has called \\"The world's funniest, bawdiest, and most politically incorrect country music singer turned mystery writer\\"?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V5TKNUxcJYUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bouncing Back : I've Survived Everything...and I Mean Everything...and You Can Too!","description":"\\"There are many self-help books by Ph.D's, but I hold a different degree: an I.B.T.I.A. -- I've Been Through It All.

There was no pattern to the murders, no common thread other than the fact that the victims were all vacationers, robbed of their possessions and slain in seemingly random crimes. Authorities across three continents and a dozen nations had no idea they were all looking for same man: Charles Sobhraj, aka  The Serpent.  A handsome Frenchman of Vietnamese and Indian origin, Sobhraj targeted backpackers on the  hippie trail  between Europe and South Asia. A master of deception, he used his powerful intellect and considerable sex appeal to lure na?ve travelers into a life of crime. When they threatened to turn on him, Sobhraj murdered his acolytes in cold blood. Between late 1975 and early 1976, a dozen corpses were found everywhere from the boulevards of Paris to the slopes of the Himalayas to the back alleys of Bangkok and Hong Kong. Some police experts believe the true number of Sobhraj s victims may be more than twice that amount.

If I'm on HRT, should I stop immediately in light of the new findings? And what is the best way to stop? What else can I do to enhance my overall health, with or without HRT? To date, nearly 6 million women use some form of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) to combat menopausal symptoms and retain overall good health. However on July 9, 2002 the National Institute of Health (NIH) announced it would be halting its study of HRT due to an increased risk of cancer in study participants.

Its focus on motivational principles rather than motivational theorists or theories leads naturally into discussions of specific classroom strategies. Throughout the book the author focuses on and expertly synthesizes that portion of the motivational literature that is most relevant to teachers. Key features of this expanded new edition include: *Focus on School and Classroom Realities--The selection and treatment of motivational principles and strategies is constantly tied to the realities of schools (e.g., curriculum goals) and classrooms (e.g., student differences, classroom dynamics). *Integrates Intrinsic and Extrinsic Principles--The author employs an eclectic approach to motivation that shows how to effectively integrate the use of intrinsic and extrinsic strategies. *Covers Expectancy and Value-Related Topics--Full coverage is given to both the expectancy aspects of motivation (attributions, efficacy perceptions, expectations, confidence, etc) and to value-related topics (relevance, meaningfulness, application potential) and to their associated teacher-student dynamics. *New Chapters--Two theories that have spurred much education-related motivational research in recent years (self-determination theory and achievement-goal theory) have been given their own chapters. *Focus on Individual Differences and Problem Learners--Guidelines are provided for adapting motivational principles to group and individual student differences and for doing \\"repair work\\" with students who have become discouraged or disaffected learners. *Expanded Topical Coverage--Expanded coverage has been given to several emerging topics, including self-identity concepts, cross-cultural comparisons, situational interest, stereotype threat, and the rediscovery of John Dewey's motivational ideas. *Improved Pedagogy--Chapter and section introductions and summaries provide an unusual degree of continuity across the book, and its second person writing style is more reader friendly than most textbooks. New to this edition are reflection questions at the end of each chapter. This book is appropriate for any course in the undergraduate or graduate teacher education curriculum that is devoted wholly or partly to the study of student motivation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fB49iTKmH4gC&dq=Motivating+Students+to+Learn+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visual Basic 5 Developer's Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w7jstgAACAAJ&dq=Visual+Basic+5+Developer%27s+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Publication Design Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Designing Magazines, Newspapers, and Newsletters","description":"DIVPublication Design Workbook is packed with information regarding the ins and outs of publication design.

I could just kill you right now!  It s something we ve all thought at one time or another. But Ruby has actually acted on it. Three times, to be exact. Though she may be a murderer, Ruby is not a sociopath. She is an animal-loving therapist with a thriving practice. She s felt empathy and sympathy. She s had long-lasting friendships and relationships, and has a husband, Jason, whom she adores. But the homicide detectives at Miami Beach PD are not convinced of her happy marriage. When we meet Ruby, she is in a police interrogation room, being accused of Jason s murder. Which, ironically, is one murder that she did not commit, though a scandal-obsessed public believes differently. As she undergoes questioning, Ruby s mind races back to all the details of her life that led her to this exact moment, and to the three dead bodies in her wake. Because though she may not have killed her husband, Ruby certainly isn t innocent. Alternating between Ruby s memories of her past crimes and her present-day fight to clear her name, Blood Sugar is a twisty, clever debut with an unforgettable protagonist who you can t help but root for an addicting mixture of sour and sweet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zKZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Blood+Sugar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starshine: One woman's valiant escape from mind control : a novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mv73GwAACAAJ&dq=Starshine:+One+woman%27s+valiant+escape+from+mind+control+:+a+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Red Knight of Germany; the Story of Baron Von Richthofen, Germany's Great War Bird","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ubmEtwEACAAJ&dq=The+Red+Knight+of+Germany%3B+the+Story+of+Baron+Von+Richthofen,+Germany%27s+Great+War+Bird&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Project Management: Tools and Techniques for Today's Lis Professional","description":"Are you involved in project work such as implementing IT systems, setting up a website or conducting a customer survey?

Between 1980 - 1985, Judy Chicago designed dozens of images on the subject of birth and creation to be embellished by needleworkers around the United States, Canada and as far away as New Zealand. Formatted into provocative exhibition units which included both needleworks and documentary materials, these works toured the country and Canada, eventually placed by 'Through the Flower' in numerous institutions where they are on public view or used as part of university curricula. Prior to the Birth Project, few images of birth existed in Western art, a puzzling omission as birth is a central focus of many women's lives and a universal experience of all humanity - as everyone is born. Seeking to fill this void, Judy Chicago created multiple images of birth to be realized through needlework, a visually rich medium which has been ignored or trivialized by the mainstream art community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DY5PAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Birth+Project&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Microbiological Quality Control Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (Pharmaceutical Science Series)","description":"Microbiologists working in both the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, face considerable challenges in keeping abreast of the myriad microbiological references available to them, and the continuously evolving regulatory requirements.

By the age of sixteen, Masetti had left Havana to follow in his father's footsteps, fighting as an urban revolutionary in Buenos Aires. Two years later, he was back in Cuba for a course in \\"conspiratorial methods.\\" Then he joined the notorious Americas Department, entering what he calls \\"the pirate's den\\" as a secret agent for Fidel Castro. In this riveting book, Masetti takes the reader inside the war room of the Cuban revolution. His life involved international revolutionary intrigue: smuggling diamonds and ivory; counterfeiting U.S. dollars; trafficking in narcotics. He served in Angola and other war zones in the 1980s. He was an adviser with groups such as the M-19 guerrillas in Columbia and the Sandinistas. Masetti's first hand account at times seems to have come from a Le Carre novel. But his story is true. In addition to shedding light on the machinations of the Castro government, it is also a compelling story of a crisis in a revolutionary faith. \\"In The Pirate's Den\\" is the result of that painful introspection, a page turning chronicle of a remarkable journey into and out of the Cuban revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YRpAPgAACAAJ&dq=In+the+Pirates+Den:+My+Life+as+a+Secret+Agent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pride of Tyson (Sagebrush Large Print Western Series)","description":"The untamed frontier was a graveyard for cowardly greenhorns who couldn't outshoot, outwit or outlast the human vultures who fed off their fear.

This great adventure, which will involve a metaphorical journey back in time to within a billionth of a second of the Big Bang, is the latest stage in the quest to understand the nature of the matter that makes our Universe and the forces that govern it. The Particle Odyssey takes the reader on a spectacularly illustrated journey to the heart of matter. In clear, non-technical language the authors describe the key experiments and fundamental discoveries which have led to our current understanding of the origins and nature of the material universe. In this fascinating book, you will find individual 'portraits' of all the major subatomic particles, from the electron to the top quark. The authors describe the history of experimental particle physics: its origins in the discovery of X-rays in 1895; the dissection of the atom by Rutherford and others; the unexpected revelations of the cosmic rays; the explosion of new particles in the 1950s and 60s; the discovery of quarks and the rise of the 'standard model' in the last part of the 20th century. And they also look at the great challenges that face physicists today where did antimatter go? what is dark matter? can there be a theory of everything? and the experiments they are devising to explore them. The Particle Odyssey brings together and presents with style over 100 of the best images of particle 'events': mysterious, abstract, beautiful pictures of the tracks of subatomic particles as they speed, curve, dance, or explode through cloud and bubble chambers, stacks of photographic emulsion, and the giant multi-element detectors of modern experiments. Here are spiralling electrons, the tell-tale 'vees' of strange particles, matter and antimatter born from raw energy, energetic jets of particles spraying out from the decay points of quarks and gluons. A further 250 pictures, many taken specially for this book, illustrate the laboratories, experiments, and personalities of over a century of particle physics. This superb book is a testament to the work of 'big' science and one of the great detective stories of our age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KPHyoOEmOqQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Karen Finley: Pooh Unplugged - An Unauthorized Memoir","description":"An adult parody of A.A.

Many people suffer from ailments that have no apparent cause, no obvious cure. Quite by accident, while using hypnotherapy, Dr. Modi discovered that pastlife regression can be a beneficial treatment. Many of these patients, under hypnosis, claimed to have spirits attached to their bodies and energy fields, creating psychological and physical problems. Based on years of experience, Dr. Modi describes techniques that release these spirits, revealing how patients can sometimes recover within a few sessions. While most doctors would agree that emotional states affect our health, few would give credence to spiritual \\"influences.\\" In this truly groundbreaking book, Dr. Modi presents evidence that something beyond the physical affects the health of many people, and urges medical scientists to objectively assess this revolutionary approach to mental and, often, physical illness. Pioneers have the courage to put aside the status quo and evaluate what the evidence shows, even if it defies the prevailing logic of the time. Both physicians and the general public should explore the pioneering work of Dr. Modiwork which no doubt has produced many remarkable healings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i6G9fHts1UEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milton: Paradise Lost (Landmarks of World Literature (New))","description":"This volume offers a stimulating introduction to one of the most influential texts of western literature, Milton's Paradise Lost.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mq88AAAAIAAJ&dq=Milton:+Paradise+Lost+(Landmarks+of+World+Literature+(New))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gmat Cat: Everything You Need to Score High on the Computer-Adaptive Test (Serial)","description":"A union list of serials commencing publication after Dec. 31, 1949.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-19GAQAAMAAJ&dq=Gmat+Cat:+Everything+You+Need+to+Score+High+on+the+Computer-Adaptive+Test+(Serial)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadow Knitting","description":"The mysteries of shadow knitting--a simple technique of alternating rows of dark and light yarn to produce a subtle patterning that appears and disappears depending on the angle from which it is viewed--are explored and refined here by a professional knitwear designer.

Hackers and cybercrime syndicates are hitting a who's who of banks, retailers, law firms, and healthcare organizations: companies with sophisticated security systems designed to stop crime before it starts. They're also hitting companies that thought they were too small to matter. So how do cybercriminals continue to breach the defenses of the big companies--and why do they go after the small ones? And, most importantly, how can companies of all sizes protect themselves? Cybersecurity expert Mark Sangster deftly weaves together real-life cases in a thrilling narrative that illustrates the human complexities behind the scenes that can lead to companies throwing their digital front doors open to criminals. Within a security context, deep social engineering is the newest and biggest means of breaching our systems. Sangster shows readers that cybersecurity is not an IT problem to solve--it is a business risk to manage. Organizations need to shift the security discussion away from technology gates alone toward a focus on leadership, team behaviors, and mutual support. Sangster punctuates his eye-opening narratives with sets of questions businesspeople at all levels need to ask themselves, facts they need to know, and principles they need to follow to keep their companies secure.\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dlE8EAAAQBAJ&dq=No+Safe+Harbor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hallelujah Diet : Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have","description":"Hallelujah!

In the era of the Cold War, the military planners on both sides of the Iron Curtain were very aware of the threat to their security both from bombers that could carry nuclear weapons and from spyplanes. Thus it was deemed essential to have fast fighter aircraft which could intercept and destroy such incoming threats. The MiG-23 was developed to succeed the MiG-21 as the standard Soviet interceptor. It was a major advance on the earlier aircraft. Its swing-wing configuration was a generation on from its predecessor. Deliveries began in 1972 and in excess of 3,000 aircraft were built before production ended in 1986. As was the case with many Soviet types, the MiG-23 was widely exported to satellite or friendly countries. The MiG-23 saw service with air forces in the Middle East, the Far East, Cuba, and Eastern Europe, and a licensed version was built in India. This book also covers the history and operation of the MiG-27, a development of the MiG-23. This was a tactical strike aircraft with a completely redesigned forward fuselage which was produced in significant quantities from the late 1970s onwards. Both of these important types are thoroughly covered in this book, with a detailed narrative and many photographs. This volume completes the Aerofax series coverage of MiG design bureau's major modern types.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UdUdAAAACAAJ&dq=MiG-23/27+Flogger:+Soviet+Swing-Wing+Fighter+/+Strike+Aircraft+(Aerofax)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Into the Great Wide Open","description":"Building on the success of A Stranger in This World, the widely praised collection of stories that was one of the most exciting literary debuts of recent years, Kevin Canty has written a blistering, unforgettable first novel. Set in the sprawl of suburbia, with its shattered families and hollow lives, Into the Great Wide Open is the story of two young people fleeing their families' emotional abandonment to find refuge in each other. Smart but scarred, Kenny Kolodny yearns to awake from the nightmare of his smashed-up family: his mother is in an institution and forever away; his father is an abusive alcoholic; his brother lives abroad. Seventeen and alone, he hangs on the periphery of his world, until he makes a passionate connection with the troubled, beautiful, fiercely independent Junie Williamson. Kenny discovers in their highly charged, intensely erotic relationship a reality--and a capacity for caring--he has not known before. In prose startling for its diamond-hard edges and bravura lyricism, Kevin Canty revives the heady carnival of adolescence, evoking its confusing emotional landscape and its heightened sensuality, too soon lost.

In 1916, in the middle of the First World War, two men secretly agreed to divide the Middle East between them. Sir Mark Sykes was a visionary politician; Fran?ois Georges-Picot a diplomat with a grudge. They drew a line in the sand from the Mediterranean to the Persian frontier, and together remade the map of the Middle East, with Britain s 'mandates' of Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq, and France's in Lebanon and Syria. Over the next thirty years a sordid tale of violence and clandestine political manoeuvring unfolded, told here through a stellar cast of politicians, diplomats, spies and soldiers, including T. E. Lawrence, Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle. Using declassified papers from the British and French archives, James Barr vividly depicts the covert, deadly war of intrigue and espionage between Britain and France to rule the Middle East, and reveals the shocking way in which the French finally got their revenge.  The very grubby coalface of foreign policy   I found the entire book most horribly addictive  Independent  One of the unexpected responses to reading this masterful study is amazement at the efforts the British and French each put into undermining the other  The Spectator","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V7r7I9OQ_gIC&dq=A+Line+In+The+Sand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Monsieur De Moliere","description":"Blending biography with fiction, this portrait of the famed French playwright is written by a kindred spirit: the author of The Master and Margarita. Mikhail Bulgakov and Jean-Baptiste Poquelin more commonly known as Moli re had much in common. The twentieth-century Russian satirist and dramatist and the seventeenth-century French playwright known for Tartuffe and The Misanthrope shared a love for finding material in the shortcomings and follies of the human condition. They both created their art under unpredictable and often repressive regimes Bulgakov under the Bolsheviks and Moli re under King Louis XIV and often saw their work censored or banned. Both were also favored by influential men: King Louis was Moli re s patron, and Stalin, despite his oppressive rule, was a fan of Bulgakov s work. Perhaps it is not surprising that Bulgakov penned such a vibrant, affectionate biography of one of the greatest masters of comedy in the Western canon. Written between 1932 and 1933 and eventually published posthumously in 1963, Bulgakov s portrait of the famed French playwright and actor goes beyond the usual boundaries of biography the two men at times seem to be communicating with each other across the centuries through Bulgakov s lively prose and inspired interpretations of the life of a literary kindred spirit. Sliding delightfully between fiction and meticulous fact, The Life of Monsieur de Moli re is not to be missed.  In its playfulness and hybridity, this book looks forward to contemporary 'faction' that fuses fiction and biography.

The book expertly explores the commonwealth s Civil War sites for those hoping to gain greater insight and understanding of the conflict. But in the years since the book s original publication, accessibility to many sites and the interpretive material available have improved dramatically. In addition, new historical markers have been erected, and new historically significant sites have been developed, while other sites have been lost to modern development or other encroachments. The historian Brian Steel Wills offers here a revised and updated edition that retains the core of the original guide, with its rich and insightful prose, but that takes these major changes into account, introducing especially the benefits of expanded interpretation and of improved accessibility. The guide incorporates new information on the lives of a broad spectrum of soldiers and citizens while revisiting scenes associated with the era s most famous personalities. New maps and a list of specialized tour suggestions assist in planning visits to sites, while three dozen illustrations, from nineteenth-century drawings to modern photographs, bring the war and its impact on the Old Dominion vividly to life. With the sesquicentennial remembrances of the American Civil War heightening interest and spurring improvements, there may be no better time to learn about and visit these important and moving sites than now.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZIfUEiJMSf8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghosts of Flight 401 (Unsolved Mysteries (Raintree Paperback))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HzVYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ghosts+of+Flight+401+(Unsolved+Mysteries+(Raintree+Paperback))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flamingo Rising","description":"Owner of the Flamingo Drive-In Movie Theater in Jacksonville, Hubert Lee's battle against his neighbor, a funeral home operator who wants Lee's land, is complicated when their children fall in love.

There are profiles of the many gift-bringers, from Santa Claus to Babouschka, and miraculous tales of the numerous saints associated with the season. And there are histories of seasonal celebrations and folk customs around the world, from the United States to Japan, from Egypt to Iceland.

In Armies of Deliverance, Elizabeth Varon offers both a sweeping narrative of the Civil War and a bold new interpretation of Union and Confederate war aims. Lincoln's Union coalition sought to deliver the South from slaveholder tyranny and deliver to it the blessings of modern civilization. Over the course of the war, supporters of black freedom built the case that slavery was the obstacle to national reunion and that emancipation would secure military victory and benefit Northern and Southern whites alike. To sustain their morale, Northerners played up evidence of white Southern Unionism, of antislavery progress in the slaveholding border states, and of disaffection among Confederates. But the Union's emphasis on Southern deliverance served, ironically, not only to galvanize loyal Amer icans but also to galvanize disloyal ones. Confederates, fighting to establish an independent slaveholding republic, scorned the Northern promise of liberation and argued that the emancipation of blacks was synonymous with the subjugation of the white South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uiaeDwAAQBAJ&dq=Elizabeth%27s+army+(Oxford+historical+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Superstring Universe: Strings, Branes, Extra Dimensions and Superstring-M Theory","description":"This book is intended as an introduction to what soon may prove to be the most important theory of science...ever.

This book sets the situation in perspective by tracing the development of relations between them during the last two centuries. No longer needing allies as it did during the Cold War, the United States is now using its economic power to force them to open their markets to its exports and to move towards Western democracy. American pressure is making Asians appreciate what they have in common, and helping to overcome the divisions that have kept them dependent on outside powers. But collision is not inevitable. America has played a critical part in the transformation of East Asia. It still has much to teach, and it now has much to learn as well. By studying Asian experience, Americans can re-learn the importance of self-discipline, and face Asian competition without relying on their power and resorting to protectionism. APEC shows the way for the United States and other Western countries to benefit from the fast growth of Asian economies, and make the whole of the Pacific area more prosperous.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mX6WBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Postgraduate Surgery, 2Ed: The Candidate's Guide","description":"This book is highly regarded as an authoritative and comprehensive text for higher surgical examinations, and an excellent practical guide for surgical trainees.

What is the nature of Indian logic? And what is the nature of Indian linguistics? By addressing these questions, Staal demonstrates that, contrary to the general assumption among Western philosophers, the classical philosophers of India were rationalists, attentive to arguments. They were in this respect unlike contemporary Western thinkers inspired by existentialism or hermeneutics, and like the ancient Chinese, Greeks, and many medieval European schoolmen, only as Staal says more so.

Congressman Hutchings was investigating a secret project called Tsunami, the biggest currency scam in history. Jackie is instructed to unearth all she can and to leave no paper trail. Wynn Bryant, a successful, wealthy businessman, is the brother-in-law of the governor of Florida. Wynn has never liked politics and is surprised when his brother-in-law contrives to have him take Hutchings s place in Congress. The reason soon becomes clear: Legislation to relieve Third World countries of their debtdubbed the Jubilee Amendmentis in the offing, and the governor is determined to have it quashed at any cost.
