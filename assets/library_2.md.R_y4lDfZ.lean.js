I don't regret reading it, but I know it will be a long time before I read it again.While the story was good, the writing was uneven. In the beginning there is a lot of detail (almost too much at times) but yet by the end the story feels rushed. The amount of detail early on made it drag at times, but the lack of detail towards the end made the ending feel abrupt. It felt as if Stevenson had spent so much time on the beginning, that by the time he got to the end he just wanted to be finished with it.That said, I still think it is a book people should read once. Like with most classics there are lessons to be learned from this book.Prioritize it on your reading list accordingly."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"It was the fabulous mid-fifties and I was eight years old. Every night, my mom would read to me a chapter from \\"Treasure Island.\\" I delighted at every turn of the page. Written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1883, \\"Treasure Island\\" is the epic tale of a young man's quest to capture a hidden treasure on the open seas. Since its first publication, it has remained one of the best-loved adventure stories of all time.What is little known about this wonderful novel is that it was born out of a fictitious map that was drawn by Stevenson in 1881 for his twelve-year-old grandson. From this hastily created map sprang a tale about pirates and a search for buried treasure.\\"Treasure Island\\" is a treasure unto itself. It should be found on every novel-lovers book shelf, especially if the novel-lover is a parent. I am now sixty years 'young' after reading once again (fifty-two years later) the book that fired my childhood imagination. Buy it! Read it! Sailing the bounty blue mane under the black flag and the vivid imagination of Robert Louis Stevenson is the best medicine that I know of for lifting your spirit and igniting the adventurous soul within you. Argh, Matey, it may even be the best remedy for pathological depression."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Jim is just a boy, that works at the Admiral Benbox Inn, but he can see that Billy Bones is a nervous man, always alert and watching for stangers arriving at the inn. And he has the right to be nervous, because he possesses a map drawn by Capitan Flint, the most feared pirate to ever roam the high seas.Well, Flint died, but there's plenty of men who served with Capitan Flint still alive who feel they deserve a fair share of the treasure. The map, though, ends up with Jim Hawkins - (it's a near thing, read the book to find out how that happens). Jim confides in the local doctor and squire, who work together to acquire a ship, a crew, and provisions to sail for Treasure Island. There is a weak link though, because although Squire Trelawney is well-intentioned, he has a big mouth. By the time the Hispaniola is ready for sea, she is boarded by the old murderous mob who sailed with Flint!There's a scene in the book where Jim, hiding in a barrel on deck, discovers that mutiny is planned. The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to take over the ship and make this journey their own, taking all the treasure for themselves. There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim, aboard the ship.And now....You will have to read the book for yourself to see what happens next. This is a fantastic story of double-crossing and deceit, bravery and cowardice. I don't know how things would have turned out if Jim hadn't been involved. For it is he who finds Ben Gunn, marooned on the island, half-mad with isolation. And it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place.And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all? No? Well, don't expect me to tell you, you will have to read this amazing pirate tale for yourself."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure IslandBy Robert Louis Stevenson.I am a twelve year old reviewer that is in the 6th grade. I enjoy fantasy adventure books the most. I have quite a good memory for the details in books that I enjoy. If books are not of interest to me I have trouble getting through them and then I forget about what's happening. I can never forget about a good book. I always go back to check out a good book over and over again until someone will buy it for me. I like building my own library because then I will always have the book I want there to read. I stay up late at night reading and if I'm lucky I might stay up the whole night reading. I am someone that does not enjoy looking up words in the dictionary so I just read on and try to figure it out. Treasure Island was not a book I stayed up all night reading, but I still enjoyed reading it. It hand the adventure I wanted, it hand mystery, and it hand a lot of sword fighting.A strange pirate named Captain Flint walks into the Admiral Ben Bow Inn where Jim Hawkins and his mother own, live and work. Little does Jim know that this man will change his life forever. Captain Flint has a treasure map that another pirate named Long John Silver wants more then anything in the world. This map will lead the Long John to the treasure. When Flint died Jim found the treasure map. Soon after he finds the map pirates attack his house and Jim must flee. When Jim goes looking for the treasure he has to work for a mysterious cook named Long John Silver. When they set upon there journey to the island in search of the treasure Jim gets put to the most challenging tasks. When they see the island Jim gets betrayed by Long John Silver and his cronies who want the treasure more than anything. When Jim gets on shore he must fight pirates for the treasure. As Jim is running through the jungle he finds a man named Ben who was marooned on the island. Ben knows his way around and he may help lead him to the treasure. Jim might lose his life looking for the treasure.I thought that the author had a very interesting way of writing. He would go all out on the exciting parts. I think he made the most important parts of the story sound dreadfully dull. This was a book that I would not stay up all night reading. At some parts I felt like just closing the book and throwing it away. Then he would pick it up again and make it exciting and it made me want to continue. One thing I liked was how I could relate with the character, Jim, at certain points in the book. Something I thought was good was how the author made you use your imagination for the island and how you could picture Ben, the man, and how he lived on the island all alone. The author expressed Jim emotions very well. I could tell when he was scared, sad and mad. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"There is more to this book than meets the eye, you may lay to that. Apart from the fairy tale plot there is superb dialogue and dialect hidden in the pages. The relationship between Long John and Jim unfolds grippingly. There are also superbly detailed scenes of action and adventure allways achieved with an economy of language. The seafaring language is used very deliberately without any ostentation. Always a pleasure to read. Great pace."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"J M Barrie said \\"Over Treasure Island I let my fire die in winter without knowing I was freezing.\\" This is a captivating book that will make you forget little things like freezing to death. Barrie recalls his mother feigning disinterest in the book: \\"'Oh, I may take a look at it again by and by' she says indifferently, but nevertheless the probability is that as the door shuts the book opens, as if by some mechanical contrivance. I remember how she read Treasure Island, holding it close to the ribs of the fire (because she could not spare a moment to rise and light the gas), and how, when bedtime came, and we coaxed, remonstrated, scolded, she said quite fiercely, clinging to the book, ' I dinna lay my head on a pillow this night till I see how that laddie got out of the barrel.'\\" A well written story of pirates, buried treasure, sailing ships, and adventure, Treasure Island is also a literary treasure. Stevenson deftly creates a whole Piratical lingo for this tale. Parts of the book stick with you like Jim Hawkins meeting marooned Ben Gunn. Ben tells him \\"Marooned three years agone,\\" he continued, \\"and lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke up again, and here I were.\\" How can we ever forget Long John Silver's parrot Cap'n Flint crying pieces of eight! pieces of eight! until Silver throws his handkerchief over the cage. You may even hear the surf booming about the coasts of Treasure Island in your dreams. Long John beckons to Jim during the voyage \\"Come away, Hawkins,\\" he would say; \\"come and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son.\\" and so Silver welcomes us all into this splendid yarn."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The author is indeed a great master, who can plot this story in such a way that a reader feels that he has to finish this story as soon as possible.Without such a story, the life in that time would be totally forgot. This is the real-life treasure for civilization."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is a classic that truly stands the test of time. Young Jim Hawkins works at his mother's inn until a strange pirate, Billy Bones, takes up residence and hires him to keep watch for the dangerous man with one leg. Violence rocks the community when a blind pirate named Pew delivers the dreaded black spot to Billy, causing him to fall over dead of a heart attack, and the pirates attack the inn hoping to find his treasure. But Jim has already claimed the most important part of Billy's treasure, a mysterious map with directions to Skull Island. Jim boards a shop with a doctor, the squire, and the charismatic Long John Silver who quickly charms all three of them until Jim stumbles upon John's part in a plot to mutiny with several of the other sailors, kill those not with them (including Jim), and claim the treasure for themselves. I'd only seen the movie adaptations of this story, so I was surprised to see at the portrayal of John, who was far more slippery, honorable, and smart that I expected. The story is a sure winner with children who love adventure stories, even in the violence can be a little graphic, but my seven-year-old daughter was unphased by it and couldn't wait each night to hear another couple of chapters. The story is every boy's dream: secret treasure, heroic actions, villains who are overcome, and a safe return home with an amazing story to tell."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Wonderful. This book is a must read. This was the first classic I downloaded (for free nonetheless) for my Kindle and could not be more impressed with the quality of the novel. I expected a sort of lame adventure-Disney pirate hybrid but instead found myself looking forward to each and every turn of the page. The book is not terribly long (so you won't feel like the author fancies the killing of trees for sport) and keeps a rather good pace of narrating the action. Treasure Island is a must read. (A) It's free, (B) You'll knock out reading a classic, and (C) You'll feel all that much more enlightened when you throw up in front of it's namesake hotel in Vegas. Yarr."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is one of those books that is thought of as a boy's book, a classic that nonetheless is designed for the youth that craves adventure. As such, it delivers, but that is not the only reason one should read this classic. The appeal is present for the fully grown man, if not woman. In fact, there is hardly a woman character in the novel, and though Robert Louis Stevenson had contributions from others in the writing of it, women were conspicuously absent in the influence, contributions primarily coming from his stepson and his father.It is evident from the novel that Stevenson's description of the landscape does not mesh well with something from the Caribbean, but possibly something from California (which he visited -- in pursuit of a certain married woman, which he later married himself), with the inclusion of trees that can only be described as Redwoods. He does not really say where the island lies, in any case. The story goes that Stevenson drew the island first, then the story was developed later, influenced by other stories by such as Washington Irving.This is an adventure that is a beautiful version of escapist literature from an imaginative writer, and though Stevenson was obviously influenced by others, his tale has influenced more modern tales, such as \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" theme song and all. I think women may enjoy the tale, as well, but on the whole, this is a story for boys and men, especially ones in search of a worthy adventure of the mind.As a little quibble, on page 179, I noticed a place in the Penguin paperback version where it says \\"tail trees\\" rather than \\"tall trees,\\" and it was not simply a printing imperfection, but an outright error. Still, the Penguin version has many extras...an introduction by a scholar, an essay at the end by Stevenson on the writing of the book, and a section from Washington Irving's \\"Tales of a Traveller,\\" which influenced the beginning of \\"Treasure Island.\\""},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This Kindle edition of \\"Treasure Island\\" featuring N.C.

Of course, you need to view it on Kindle for PC (free download) to view them that way, but it's nice to know this book is \\"future proofed\\" for the day when, hopefully, they will come up with color e-ink readers.My only criticism is that the beautiful cover painting, shown above, is nowhere to be found in the e-book itself."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"SummaryTreasure Island was Robert Louis Stevenson's first full-length, published novel, which began as a story for his stepson. The main character and the narrator is a boy named Jim Hawkins who lives and works in his parents' Admiral Benbow Inn. A drunken buccaneer has been living at the inn and causing quite a scene among the locals. After he receives a black spot (an item representing pirate judgment) from an old, blind pirate named Pew, the buccaneer dies, leaving behind an unpaid room and a seaman's chest. Jim and his mother open the chest and find a bag full of coins of all different nationalities and a document containing a map. They escape the inn just before a band of pirates begin to break in and search for the map, which leads to an island containing Captain Flint's buried treasure.Jim takes the map to Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney, who then immediately embark on a voyage on the ship Hispaniola, hiring Captain Smollet and a crew recommended by Long John Silver. Silver and most of the crew he brings with him were part of Flint's voyage to Skeleton Island, unbeknownst to Livesey and Trelawney. At sea, Jim finds himself in a barrel of apples and accidentally overhears plans for mutiny from the pirates, which he soon relays to Livesey, Trelawney, and the Captain. Soon to land at the island, Jim Hawkins and the rest of the trustworthy crew plan a way to make it off the island with the treasure and their lives.My ReactionUntil I read this book, I did not realize how much I already knew about it simply from references in popular culture. International Talk Like a Pirate Day could very well have been originated from a group of readers fond of this classic tale of pirates, treasure, and island adventure. In fact, I found just about everything I think about when I imagine pirates in this book. (The only thing Stevenson left out was a few hundred uses of the now ubiquitous pirate word \\"Arr!\\" but that may be anachronistic.) This alone I think demonstrates the far-reaching influence of this book as it applies to the popular view of pirate caricatures.Normally when one thinks of reading \\"classic literature\\" one expects a laborious trek through hundreds of pages of archaic phrases and unfamiliar circumstances. Treasure Island is a refreshing reminder of why there are \\"classics\\" and has encouraged me to seek out others to read. Despite being over one hundred years old, it is easy to immerse oneself in Jim Hawkins' place throughout the action.It took me a few pages to get used to some of the nautical terminology and Stevenson's use of apostrophes and phonetic spelling to illustrate the way the pirates were talking. However once I figured out what he was doing, the characters' voices in my head were clear. The action and suspenseful moments kept me turning the pages. I even jumped a bit in the part when Jim accidentally ended up with the pirates in the middle of the night. Descriptions easily laid out the setting of Skeleton Island. In fact, some of the more bloody scenes were surprisingly descript considering this was a tale aimed at young boys, but nowadays the target audience has seen more than that in a single video game.I was also impressed with the character development within the novel. This was truly a coming-of-age type of tale for Jim Hawkins, learning nobility and honor practically as he fought to keep his and his party's lives and dignity. Long John Silver was mostly the star throughout because of his interesting mannerisms (\\"and you can lay to that\\") and his manipulative character. Just when I thought I figured out Silver's motivation, he pulled out another trick. The rest of the characters were distinct and multi-dimensional, with only one or two archetypes (Pew being one of evil villain, though he doesn't last long in the book).Overall, as many other reviewers have said, Stevenson did not waste any words in writing Treasure Island. Everything written had purpose and added to the story. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a fun exciting page-turner, as well as to anyone wanting to get started reading the classics."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Moving beyond Muppet Treasure Island, I had a hard time even wanting to pick up this novel. Alas, I had to grow up and read the real story. I'm glad I did. While the novel is absent of catchy songs and puppets, Treasure Island makes up for it with graphic fight scenes and an outstanding narrative framework. I love that the story is mostly narrated by Jim Hawkins, our main character. Jim's voice places me so deep in the story that I felt every setting in the novel, from ship to island. Great classic and a must read for any English major."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is the best illustrated classic book I found so far. Reading the original can be a great challenge for young readers.

Can Jim save the \\"good\\" crew, and the treasure?In the book, Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, I was surprised when Long John Silver described his dangerous plan to his fellow pirates and that the \\"time\\" is near. There are a lot of parts where the book is told from a point of view, Jim and Dr. Livesey. This book is not a prequel, sequel, or part of a series. This book is a full out fight between good and evil and full of adventure. I would surly recommend this book to any boy interested in adventure and in Robert Louis Stevenson."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins, owners of the Admiral Benbow inn, and their son James \\"Jim,\\" are alternately intrigued and repulsed by the latest lodger, a \\"plain\\" hard-drinking, terrifying-tale-telling man who promises payment to the boy every month for watching out for a \\"...seafaring man with one leg.\\" \\"Black Dog appears and disappears\\" and soon after, the pirate lodger (Billy Bones) dies, still in financial debt to the family.

En route to the island, Hawkins learns about a mutinous plan and shares it with his allies, who plan for their imminent peril, outmanned and outgunned from the start. Young Hawkins, showing cunning and bravery beyond his years, triumphs as a young, inexperienced underdog turned hero. Treasure Island, with its colorful characters, perfect pirate jargon and mannerisms, and ultra-exciting plot is an amazing story, surprisingly first published in 1883.

After staying in the inn for weeks, the sea captain dies inthe inn's tavern, and Jim discovers a treasure map hidden away in the captain's treasure chest. Lookingfor an adventure, Jim decides to head out in search of the captain's fortune, assisted by Long John Silverhimself.As I read Treasure Island, I was captivated by the author's vivid descriptions of settings and characters.Stevenson used the element of flashback to tell the story. For example, the books opens with Jimrecalling, \\"Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full ofdangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange as ouractual adventures,\\" which definitely gave the narration a more prevalent voice.

The first 20 pages or so had to be trudged through. But once through this beginning bit, the reader will find themselves delving into a seafaring world of adventure, piracy, and suspense. Progressively this book improves on itself the longer you read. For those interested in well written, enchanting books, this is one for you. All those who enjoy a minor literary challenge, requiring you to take a step back from time to time to reread a passage due to swashbuckling dialect and jargon, will find great fun in this novel.

Later, I read the Classics Illustrated (comic book) version. It was not until I was 23 years old and in the Navy that I finally got around to actually reading the book itself in the edition with the Wyeth illustrations. I found it to be a perfect masterpiece. Of course, I was already familiar with the characters and the plot, so nothing came as a surprise One oddity of my childhood was that I somehow managed to get through it without reading any of the classic books except in comic book form, so it was only in my twenties that I went back and read the actual books. I visited Scotland and toured a museum in Edinburgh devoted to Burns, Scott and Stevenson. Among other items, I remember that there was a rocking-horse that belonged to Stevenson as a child. Adults reading this book need to find an essay by Stevenson on the internet titled A Humble Remonstrance, which sort of goes with this book, but would be boring to a child. In the 1960s I remember being on a bus that was going along a causeway in Miami, and one of the artificially-created islands of the causeway was Treasure Island. There was a boy on the bus who said to his mother that he was sure that this was the real Treasure Island. Fortunately she didn't spoil his opinion with the rude truth. Recently I was talking with a trio of teenagers and told them that this was my favorite book. They responded in a rude fashion and declared that it was boring. I suppose that they had been forced to read it in school, a process which seems to invariably backfire in its well-meaning attempt to cast pearls before swine. Stevenson was looked down upon by intellectuals for a long time because he was popular and wrote for the young, but eventually even the snobs had to admit that he was a fine writer. The real treasure of Treasure Island is the book itself."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"In my retirement I have decided to revisit titles from my youth.

I enjoy reading the classics and just made my way to this one, which I am very glad I did. The book is a fast-paced, lean adventure story with all the expected elements of a great pirate yarn. The only thing it is missing is a dramatic walking-off-the-plank scene. Some of the jargon is outdated and can be hard to understand, but it is not impossible to get through. Minor Spoiler Alert for people who haven't read the book - don't read the rest of this review! Long John Silver is a terrific character, a more sinister version of the modern-day Capt Jack Sparrow. He is an interesting repository of moral ambiguity in a book otherwise populated by characters that fall clearly on the side of good or evil. I also really enjoyed how the regimented moral uprightness of Captain Smollett serves as a foil for Long John Silver. He is not such a fabled character, but he is an almost equal force in the novel and has the respect of all parties, even Silver himself. It was hard to believe he would ever consent to go on the cruise, since he seemed to smell a rat from the very beginning. Jim Hawkins, the main POV character, tells the story of his adventure with charming impulsive boyishness.

In my youth I read Tolkein, Burroughs, Howard, and many others, but, somehow I never got around to reading Treasure Island. Not only is this one of the great pirate tales, it is also THE buried treasure book, and, one of the truly great adventure stories of all time. While there are many that will find fault with some aspects of the story, all in all, I would suggest that all would-be writers desiring to tell a tale of adventure should take the time to reread this tale before they begin their labors. I should say that having done so, the bulk of them would recognize how far short their own efforts fall. Technically; the book is extremely well written, the plot moves along at a brisk pace, the characters are well drawn, and the dialog sparkles. There is plenty of action, adventure, and suspense, all of it told in a crystal clear prose that wastes not a word. In a nutshell this may indeed be one of the greatest tales of adventure ever told.Although it has traditionally been perceived as a story for younger readers, having just read it at middle age, I believe that you shouldn't consider this a children's tale. Long John Silver is as darkly evil a character as ever appeared in print; he seduces men with a ready confidentiality, warm, friendly, knowing banter, and then cold-bloodedly murders them when their back is turned. He suffers no scruples, knows nothing of mercy, and sells anyone at anytime to the other side if he thinks it will profit him. I think Long John Silver would have done well as a Wall Street corporate raider."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Gotta love that Jack Hawkins kid.

Treasure Island was my first e-book on my Kindle that I received at Christmas. First, let me comment on the fact that there are numerous FREE e-books for your Kindle; this includes such classics such as Treasure Island. Second, I had long forgotten how enjoyable are the classics of literature of which Treasure Island is one. I greatly enjoyed what I believe is the greatest pirate story every written. If you compare all of the modern pirate stories and especially the movies you can readily see that they are based on Treasure Island.Sometimes old is better than new and this is the case with the Kindle version of Treasure Island or in fact the hard copy as well. 15 men on a dead man's chest, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"A classic for a reason.

The book follows Jim Hawkins, a young man, who has found a treasure map and with the help of friends hires a crew to find the treasure. But the crew has their own plans.In the mid 18th Century at a seaside village in south-west England Jim Hawkins, the young son of the keepers of the Admiral Benbow Inn, meets and old seaman named Billy Bones. Quickly Jim discovers that Bones is a pirate and that his old crewmates want Bones' sea-chest.Bones dies and Jim opens his sea-chest to collect the money owed to the inn - only to discover a mysterious oilskin packet. The packet is a detailed map of an island Jim, together with Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney, hire a crew to sail to the island.But the crew are not the honest sailors they think they are and the sea-cook, Long John Silver, turns out to be the most dangerous one of them all.I read \\"Treasure Island\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson as a young boy and always remembered it as one of my favorites. Recently, as part of a classics book club, I read it again.The two main characters of the book, Jim Hawkins and Long John Sliver have certainly cemented themselves as two of the most intriguing and dimensional characters in literature. I was happy to reconnect with them almost as if they were old friends.The first half of the book was a breeze to read, but the second half was a bit more difficult due to the pirate's slang, cumbersome metaphors and tongue tied conversations. However, I quickly re-discovered that those quirks were part of the charm of the book. Even Jim Hawkins admits he has trouble understanding the narrative - so I wasn't alone.I read the Barnes and Noble classics version, which came with a fascinating biography of Stevenson especially regarding \\"Treasure Island\\". The book was actually written for Stevenson's stepson, after painting the island he started the novel and completed 15 chapters. Stevenson finished the book in Switzerland writing a chapter a day.Unknowingly, Stevenson created much of the pirate lore which we have been accustomed to. The pirate speaking almost unintelligibly, a parrot on his shoulder, missing a foot and ready to double cross his best friends for a buck or two.My biggest surprise upon reading \\"Treasure Island\\" as an adult was that I realized that the story is not about Jim Hawkins, but about Long John Silver. Granted that usually the villain in any book is usually more colorful and fun than the upstanding protagonist - but this discovery has taken by surprise. Silver's moral ambiguity is well known but just how amoral the character is I never fully realized as a nave child (even though I have become a nave adult).I was happy to discover that \\"Treasure Island\\" truly deserves its status as a beloved classic. The story is suspenseful and the adventure can be enjoyed by children of any age."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This is a great introduction to a really fantastic story.

Since I never read Treasure Island as an adolescent, I decided to give it a try. It is absolutely delightful! It is a tale worth reading. Robert Louis Stevenson's prose is appropriate for youths or adults and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep the reader on their toes. The story is rich in detail and intrigue. Stevenson is able to develop character with a few details, as does Charles Dickens. Quickly we empathize and identify with the feisty, clever, honest boy Jim Hawkins. The pirates are great. They are such a lousy bag of scum and Stevenson has the ability to make them evil and also individuals, a real skill. We also learn the tale through the eyes of an adolescent boy. This is a wonderful technique used by Salinger in Catcher in the Rye and used by Mark Twain in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This technique is powerful in that it allows the character as well as the reader to encounter characters and situations with naive eyes and thus must use native intelligence to separate lie from truth, safety from danger. While the boy main character is trying to figure out who to trust, the reader is also. Jim Hawkins is a likable boy and Stevenson has a sense of the physicality and movement and energy of boys. He has Jim engaging in physical activities in which an adolescent would undertake in an emergency that an adult might not. This feature helps explain the popularity over many years of this book for adolescent males. Jim, the son of a terminally ill tavern owner and his wife, is exposed to the pirates when Billy Bones comes to hide out in their remote tavern and inn. Immediately Stevenson lets us know that some adults are not to be trusted and are of low, dangerous character. That is another great aspect of the book since it doesn't sugar coat adulthood but allows Jim to see adults as a mixture of virtue, foolishness, greed, and homicidal intention. The Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey are examples of realistically developed adults, sometimes foolish and sometimes heroic. Another fine aspect of the book is that it is about recognizing, understanding, and counter-acting treachery. The character of Long John Silver is wonderful. He would be classified as a psychopath by today's psychological standards but when written, he was very evil and very smart, a deadly combination. Without giving away any of the plot, Jim must outsmart Long John Silver just to survive and thus the tension developed by character and an economical storyline makes the book a real treat. The book deserves to be considered a classic and deserves more than 5 stars since it is an enjoyable classic, the best combination."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The book Treasure Island is an exciting book. It contains mutineers, pirates, and a big treasure it is a challenging book to read though. There are loops and turns around every corner. Jim, the mail character came across a ship called the Hispaniola, and rode it for the rest of the book. He takes on many troubles throughout the book. At first, he meets a man called Long John Silver. He seems very nice at first but at the end he turns very evil.There tends to be mutinies when a ship sets off for treasure. And that's exactly what happens. One day, the ship is sailing on and BOOM! There sounds a gunshot! The wicked mutineers attack the ship killing one person, shooting them in the head. But it's not over yet! Three muskets go off at a time and one of the mutineers falls. The fight goes on and it is soon found out that the mutineers had lost more souls then the ships company and that was good for Jim.At one point in the book, Jim comes across a man that was on an island that had been marooned and he had been there for over three years and had to live off eating goat.The sentence structure of the book was a very hard. The sentences were very hard to read and there were a lot of things going on at the same time and it never seemed to end. One reason that the book was so hard was it was almost a different kind of English. The book was written in the late 1800 so it was very hard to understand. The sentences were long and choppy and they went on. But on the other hand some sentences were only two words.The word choice of the book was two ways mostly. That means that some words were long and some words were very short. But the words were switched around so it was even harder to read.The description of the book was not so great. Robert didn't describe the setting too well. Sometimes you couldn't tell where Jim was at some points because of the poor description.My opinion of the book was not so great and it was hard to understand because of the word choice and the settings were very bad at some points. At one part of the book Jim comes off the ship and it doesn't explain what was happening and it seemed there was something missing. And at some points it seemed that they were too long and you were waiting for something else to happen and it got boring. After some sentences it was so confusing that you had to read it again until you got what was going on. That was hard to do and that's one reason I didn't like the book all that much.I think that the appropriate age for reading this book is about teen. I think that it was not so good fir my age because I didn't understand it all that much, and if someone were older, then they have a better learning experience and they can understand the hard words. I am only eleven years old and this book is not such a good book for my age. But everyone has there own opinion and some people have different reading abilities.Ben Schwartz 6th Grade"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Over all I thought the book Treasure Island was somewhat good. I thought at some parts some of it was quite confusing. I do not think it was the writers fault for my confusion. I was confused simply because the book was a bit too challenging for me. I think I could of enjoyed it more if I was older reading it. My favorite part of the book was when they finally found the treasure in the caves. Another part that I liked was towards the beginning of the book when the boy was with captain at the inn. I enjoyed the pirate fights too. Also I enjoyed very much the way the pirates talked in the book because how they used phrases such as \\"shiver me timbers\\", \\"arrg\\" as well as other similar phrases. The book was not too predictable. I think the author was very clever. I would have never guessed that the treasure would be hidden then re-hidden! That is why I like the book.There are many reasons why I do not like the book. One thing is that it often went on about things that didn't have to do with the book that much. The pirates would have very long conversations with each other and they took away from my understanding of the plot even though that was probably the authors goal so that I wouldn't guess the ending of the story. It did not have any humor or jokes at all in the conversations or throughout the book, if there were jokes then I was not old enough to understand them. Also, I could not memorize the names of all the pirates. Therefore when they mentioned a name that was not a main character, I did not know whom the Author was talking about. I also did not like how I did not get to know the characters and their personality that well before another character was introduced. Some of these names were: Mary, Tom, and Frank!? I think if I got to know the characters more, it would of made book even better. I also thought there were too many characters. The story was not touching. Unless bad guys randomly killing people, greedy mutinous pirates, and boys taking maps from dead people is touching to you. For so much plot, I didn't feel like I was in the story. It was not compelling. It did not give me any life morals either. I had trouble telling if the characters were good or bad as well. His book was definitely not my favorite but for sure no my least favorite. It could have been more enjoyable. All in all I thought the book was ok. His is why I rated my book 2 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This novel was very descriptive and original, but dragged on too long. I found myself skimming chapters at a time because I became so bored with the content. This book was definately not for me. Don't necessarily let this review discourage you from reading it, though.

By then you'll know the general impression of the novel, and can decide whether to continue or not."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I thought this book was nice, but it was not my favorite. It first starts out when a big dark man with an scare on his cheek shows up at his family's inn the \\"Admiral Benbow\\". What Jim (the lead character of the storey) did'nt know was that this larg scarey man was the begining of his horific adventure. Later in the book Jim finds his self sailing off on a boat called the \\"Hispaniola\\" to treasure island along with real seamen and an rude captain.The sentence structure of this book was a bit complicated for me. The sentences were long and very detailed. Some sentences were short and choppy and did not explain enough, were others were long and over detailed and never seemed to end. It seemed like you were always waiting fore some thing exciting to happen, but it never came. The description in this book seemed a little over board. There would be these long and descriptive sentences explaining things that should have not been that long. There would be some thing that was very simple and they would write it in complex detail.I reconmend this book to teen readers. I think that that14 year olds would most enjoy this book because the vocabulary is at proubly their level and they can take in the description more. This book was very long and a little frustrating for me. It seemed like because of the big words and long sentences I could not engage into this book.Also it was hard for me to determend were Jim was in the book. The author would transition from one setting to another way to quikly for me to follow were he is going. It was also hard for me to understand what going on because he would be talking about one thing going on then emediatly switch to some thing else.Alex Meallet."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"This isn't a terrible book but I think the plot doesn't make sense.If you are going to read it prepare to be confuced"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I made it to chapter 8 in this book when lo and behold it skipped all the way to chapter 13!

His mom and dad take care of teh inn. Jim's life was just as normal as any other kid's in teh 1700's until one day an old seaman came and registered at the inn. All was alright with the seaman until one day he fell dead. A map was foujnd in the seaman's jacket. Jim gaters up a crew to seek the treasure,only later finding themselves sailing with some of Flin'ts bloodthirsty crew. Will Jim get out of this mess alive? Will Flint's crew leave them on the island?Positive Points: It puts barriers in the way of Jim. He doesn't just go to the island, find the treasure, and go home. That would be a short and boring story plot. Jim has to get around Flint's crew and other barriers. Robert Louis Stevenson shows grea action and suspense in his writing.Negative Points: The ending is a little of a let-down. It doesn't have very much action. It may be hard to do, but if a book has action throughout, it would be a five-star easily.I think my rating would be 4 1/2, becaust it wasn't a very exiting ending.

I highly recomend this book to people who have trouble finding a good book and like not stop thillers with many twists and turns."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"At School 10 in Troy , New York many years ago Miss McGovern led her little mateys through a reading of this children's classic. I do not remember exactly what she had to say about Captain Silver and Jim Hawkins , whether she felt the cunning and dishonest old curmudgeon Silver was somehow a sympathetic soul, and young Mr. Hawkins was a very worthy and wily apprentice. I do know that around about the same time the Big Screen showed a version of this tale which brought it more vividly to life. As a child I could not exactly understand why Captain Silver had to be ' bad ' at all, and what exactly Mr.Stevenson wanted for us. The treasure , the map , the finding of booty did not appeal very much to my young soul, and to tell the truth the whole tale seemed more like yet another ' adult trick' to make ' children' feel interested in 'school'. The rousing yarn that has held the attention of so many largely confused me. In this one however my guess is my own childhood impressions are pretty well of the mark, and do little justice to a book which has given so much suspenseful pleasure to young readers."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"No doubt Treasure Island is one of the greatest adventure stories of all time, though in my opinion, many readers (especially kids) will have difficulty with the archaic language. My son (12 yrs) had a very tough time understanding the text at times, forcing him to reread many passages. If you are looking for a fun pirate adventure story, but prefer a more readable book, I would recommend an interesting new adaption of Treasure Island, called Wave Hunters, by Chris Lacy. It is basically the same story as Treasure Island, only it takes place in the present day amongst a group of surfers in Indonesia. My son couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island starts out in a inn. in England in the mid 1700's with a boy named Jim Hawkins. His life seems perfectly normal until men start showing up and threaten his life and one ends up dieing in the inn.

While snooping he finds money from everywhere and a map.He sets out with a crew destined to find the treasure. Along the way he makes friends with the friendly cook Long John Silver. He soon finds out the truth about silver and his crew, theu're pirates determined to find the treasure and kill the crew that gets in their way. As they arrive at the island they are soon diveded by power and fright. a battle takes place and soon they realize who has the true power.Jim diobalicly outsmarts the pirates and prove to them that hes not just a boy.This story is full of alcohal and voilance, something not expected in a story meant for children. It can be boring at times and and is full of terms and slang that some may bnot even be able to realize if they didnt put the peices together. All in all it is a wonderful story full of detail and mystery. Its wonderful to find out what happens with the treasure and what ever happens to Jim....? So i recommend it to you if you enjoy stories such as this or maybe Mmuppets Treausre Islands...or Pirates of the Carribean! Anyways i hope you enjoy the story and you will love what happens to the treasure!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I really liked this book. My favorite part is when the kid is on the ship alone with the pirate and gets in a fight on the mast. This is a great story, but some parts were kind of hard to understand. Its best if your dad reads it to you."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"The classic pirate tale by Stevenson, \\"Treasure Island\\" has been retold in various forms for the last 100 years. And there is a good reason why this story has been kept alive, as it is a classic adventure tale and a coming-of-age tale. It is geared toward a younger audience, but a reader of any age should find this tale entertaining and an easy read.Throughout the book, the unlikely hero of Jim Hawkins emerges. He is first introduced aa a fearful young boy, who runs to his mother in the face of intruders to their seaside inn. However, Jim quickly matures as cabin-boy of the treasure-seeking ship, and he soon realizes his full potential as a young hero. Although he may be impulsive, his actions help to defeat the pirates. Indeed, Jim shows his bravery and intelligence as he attempts to capture the ship away from the mutineers single-handedly.Certainly an overriding theme is that of greed and desire. The nobleman Trelawney becomes giddy and gleeful when he hears of a possible treasure and quickly procures a ship and crew. The pirates, or \\"gentlemen of fortune\\", lead their whole lives whose sole purpose is the pursuit of wealth by whatever means necessary. Indeed, it is this greed and burning desire for gold that eventually leads to their downfall.Overall, this is a great adventure tale that appeals to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. The author described the characters and the settings very well. The author used very interesting word choices and he used very interesting ideas in the book. I had trouble understanding the old English words in the dialect which was sometimes incomplete. For example when the pirates are talking to each other they would talk with incomplete sentences which made it hard to follow.My favorite character in the book was Jim. He was clever and brave. Jim was the narrator in the story and the main character. This book took place in the time when pirates sailed the oceans. The story starts when a strange pirate arrives at Jim's family inn. Then, the pirate was visited by unfriendly pirates looking for his treasure map. Tha inspired Jim to go treasure hunting himself.I think that the book was too hard for me to understand the dialect. It was also hard for me to remember the characters in the book. It was also hard for me to determine if the characters were the good guys or the bad guys. Another thing I did not like about the book was that it took a long time to get into action and it made me want to not read on. The book would be very hard for people under grade 6. Since I am a six grade student and it was challenging for me. I would recommend the book for people over the age of 12. Overall, I gave the book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island Is a good book with many twists. It has its moments at the end of the book.

Jim got a couple of respectable people together and they bought a ship named the Hispaniola and set of sail for Treasure Island, not knowing the problems that lay before them.

In this book, Steven tells the story of a young Scottish boy named Jim Hawkins, who stumbles upon a dreaded pirate's (Captain Flint) treasure map, and goes in search of it along with the village doctor and the squire. However they are not the only ones who knew about the hidden treasure. They are pursued by the former ruthless crewmembers of Captain Flint, these men will stop at nothing to lay their hands on the map!\`Treasure Island' is absolutely great. From the beginning to the end its filled with non-stop action. Jim Hawkins is telling the story, so as young people are, he is straight to the point. No unnecessary details are given which will certainly appeal to youngsters and best of all it is written in simple and plain English. For children this is a must-read.If you think \`pirates', \`treasures' are too childish for you then I suggest you read it in your leisure moments. I'm sure you won't be able to put it aside till you've read the last page!"},{"Title":"Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure island","review":"Treasure Island is an exciting book full of action and suspense.

The book starts off with &quot;My favorite person is coming to visit me today...&quot; and goes on to take you through a story of two people sharing time together and enjoying the simple things in life, like hot chocolate &quot;with as many marshmallows as you want&quot;. It teaches that part of love is sharing small things in common together, and you're never too old to enjoy the company of a little person if you don't lose touch with the kid inside yourself."},{"Title":"Lucky Pennies and Hot Chocolate","review":"I read this heartwarming book and instantly thought of my dad's relationship with his out-of-town grandchildren.

The students enjoy the cooperative nature of most activities contained in the book. Teachers will find it easy to use and assess students' work thanks to the clear, concise directions and the included worksheets students use to plan the activities.The index in the back also is extremely helpful in locating just the right type of exercise; entries are listed in categories such as &quot;no preparation,&quot; &quot;noisy rehearsal,&quot; &quot;beginner level,&quot; and many other cross-references.When I started teaching drama five years ago, this book was my lifesaver in planning classroom activities!"},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"Viola Spolin's works tend to be the benchmark for theater students, and after reading this one, I am a convert to Novelly. Her ideas are useful, concrete, creative, and apply DIRECTLY to working onstage, not to hocus-pocus theater jargon. As a professional actress and drama instructor, I recommend this highly."},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"After nearly fifteen years of being away from the classroom, I was a bit nervous about teaching drama again. In searching for a resource that would get me back in the swing of things, I debated between this book and the classic Viola Spolin books. I finally decided on this one, and I couldn't be happier! The lessons in this book are easy to follow, easy to prepare (there's not much to preparation at all!), and, best of all, fun for the kids in class! The lessons are also easily adaptable to different circumstances, such as short class periods, environmental concerns (like needing a quieter activity), or needing a quick activity to warm the kids up. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in integrating drama into a classroom, or as a stand-alone resource in a full-fledged drama curriculum."},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"I found this book very easy to follow and the ideas are great for both regular classroom teaching and one off drama workshops. The excersises are even split into catagories depending on their topic and energy/noise level."},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"I love this book. I use something from it at least once a week in my classroom. It's wonderful for teaching the basics. Pantomime, expression, scene building, creative thinking... As other reviews state, it doesn't get into playing objectives, but you can cover that in other lessons and activities. That's simply not the scope of this book and that's fine by me. The activities are especially good for sixth graders. Seventh and Eighth, you'll have to play it by ear depending on your group. Most of mine are \\"too cool\\" for some of the activities, but a lot of the games are pretty adaptable for that age group if you get creative."},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"Maria Novelly's book was one of the first I purchased as a new drama teacher, and I'm very grateful to have had such an excellent resource so early on. Most of the the theater game compendiums I've read before or since have been hit-or-miss; I'd get use out of some suggested activities, but the others lacked depth or educational merit. Not so with Novelly's book--I've used every activity outlined in her book, and I continue to use them with great results. Children love these exercises--especially \\"Walking Through,\\" \\"Imaginative Journeys,\\" and pretty much everything in the Improv chapter--and importantly, they learn a lot about what it means to be a performer through their engagement with them. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who teaches drama, new or experienced teacher. It includes meaningful activities for development of pantomime, improvisation,and vocal performance. Each activity is clearly explained and includes a suggested worksheet guide for students with a sample provided for the teacher to share. This book works well as either a teacher resource or as a student text. I used this for many years and found it to be one of the best resources I had. It is almost a complete curriculum for beginning drama and is suitable for middle school through secondary students."},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"This book has a nice variety of games and lessons suitable for young actors. It offers variations to games and lessons to dovetail with your own program. It has some fantastic insights for the teacher too and is an effective book to pull out when your program needs a little twinkle or to a beginning teacher who needs a basis on which to build his or her program."},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"This book contains many of the activities Viola Spolin uses in her Improvisation book with more simple terms. I really enjoyed the activities as did my kids. (I'm a MS choir teacher who is now teaching drama, too.) Each one is set-up to be a lesson. The times on the activities are not always accurate. One short script-writing interview presentation should have taken 30 min. but took me three days to do. Maybe I didn't teach it well and I am at a school where more than half of the students' first language is Spanish but still, a difference of 2 hours, hmmm. Others were quite accurate but I needed a timer to stay on target. Highly recommended for any drama teacher as it was given to me by my HS drama teacher."},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"This resource book is a \\"must\\" for directors or teachers of youth theatre. Have it and keep giving it to former students."},{"Title":"Theatre Games for Young Performers","review":"Forget the reference to young people in the title; I've used the games in this book with 6th graders up through middle aged participants. Bypass, too, the somewhat dated photos throughout--the exercises are timeless.In my current work with homeless adults, this book has saved me on a number of occasions. I know the page numbers of favorite exercises like one might know songs in a hymnal, or recipes in a well-used cookbook. I may not conduct every exercise exactly the way Novelly intends--each of us must adapt according to the needs and dynamics of our particular group, of course--but without fail she provides me with enough creative ideas to keep the juices flowing.As for someone else's comment that the book focuses too much on emotions, I'll point out that many of the games are nice lead-ins to deeper work if your group is ready for it. If you are indeed working with young performers, there's no harm in getting them warmed up and enthused before tackling your Stanislavski/Meisner/whomever. And if you do indeed have success doing otherwise, please, please, let me know your secret.This evening, I finally sat down to google Novelly, as I felt she deserved to know that I use and appreciate her book on a weekly basis.

A friend let me read her copy of Bird of One Wing: A VN Woman's Story to give me an idea of what my daughter's birth family life might have been like. I couldn't put the book down. For obvious reasons, I've read many books about, or by authors from, Viet Nam, but none has touched me the way this book has. During my reading of Bird of One Wing, my daughter was able to establish contact with her birth family. I was stunned to see how accurate Kieu Lien Le's discriptions were in terms of Vietnamese people, life and customs. Her personal story helped me fill in many of the blanks in my daughter's story.I read this remarkable book back in 4/02. Since then I have tried desperately, but unsuccessfully, to purchase my own copy. Sadly, I can't find it for sale anywhere - not even through Amazon.Com (my old standby). Bird... has haunted me so much that I'm now trying to reach the author directly. If you are fortunate enough to find a copy, DEFINATELY READ IT!

Often with the horrors of the struggles that engulfed her country and ours as backdrop, we learn in bare none detail how her family survived. In any setting this is a spellbinding story of a courageous woman whose honesty and humor about her own flaws and the dysfunctions of her family make you laugh, cry, and cheer her on in the end. After reading this first novel, I will look forward to reading more by this gifted voice."},{"Title":"Bird of One Wing: A Vietnamese Woman's Story","review":"I enjoyed this book so much. It is a very interesting, detailed and vivid account from a little girl to that of a young woman of life in Vietnam before, during, and after the war. At times it brought sadness, laughter, fear, joy and love. The author makes you feel as though you were there. As I read the book, I found myself turning back and forth to the cover to look at the author's picture to gather a glimpse of her courage and understanding. This is truly a compelling and inspirational story. I would most certainly recommend this excellent book to readers of all ages who have an interest in Vietnamese culture."},{"Title":"Bird of One Wing: A Vietnamese Woman's Story","review":"Not too long ago, I had the wonderful experience of editing a great book, Bird of One Wing: A Vietnamese Woman's Story. Lien's book spans a 20-year period of her early life, and is lively and intensely moving. Although many of these years were excruciatingly difficult, the author overcame them with heart, intelligence, and an inexhaustible sense of humor. The characters are so vividly depicted that by the end of the book you feel they have become some of your best friends. The fact that Lien has written such a fantastic book when English is not her first language is also a testimony to her immense talent.As an aside, shortly after I promised to edit the book I was delighted to discover that my husband and I were expecting our youngest child, Marc. Despite the raving nausea, tremendous sleepiness, and die-for-a-bagel hunger characteristic of this pregnancy, Lien's book was spellbinding, even in editing mode! It was truly the best thing I've ever had the pleasure of editing."},{"Title":"Bird of One Wing: A Vietnamese Woman's Story","review":"The vivid descriptions allow you to follow the author through both her good and bad experiences.

I didn't want it to end and I hope there is a sequel. A must read for people of every age and gender!"},{"Title":"Bird of One Wing: A Vietnamese Woman's Story","review":"I loved this book the most for the details of the author's life. It's rare to read a book that tells in lots of detail the ordinary parts of a life lived in extrordinary times and places---what is eaten, what jobs are held, what school is like, what family life is like. Although Vietnam during the period the author was growing up and in her 20s, the scope of this book, was a war zone, this is not really a war book, but more a book about what everyday life in a war zone is like. It's written with unusual frankness---no effort is made to make the author look better or worse than she really is. I like it that it is not ghost written---the author's own voice is used, and she tells things in her own way and order, not always immediately explaining things like the value of money or why people are addressed in the way they are. This serves to immerse you in her life.The subplot of this book is how having an abusive childhood affects you. At times, I was not sure the author really saw herself as abused, although she certainly was. But the cultural differences keep her from reacting or speaking of this abuse in the way a Westerner might. Instead, we are allowed to see for ourselves how she expects the abuse to continue in her marriage, and how surprised she is when it does not. It's only in the epiloge that we see she is aware of this abuse, and wants to help others living with parental abuse.Definately highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Bird of One Wing: A Vietnamese Woman's Story","review":"This book was truly captivating.

She is a spectacular sculpture, long regarded as the pinnacle of Minoan art from the sixteenth century BCE. She is of delicately carved ivory decorated with gold, a sensuous figure in a wide skirt of multiple tiers, a narrow, belt-encircled waist, and a bodice cut so low that her ample breasts are visible. She holds snakes in her outstretched arms. She pouts. She is one of the most famous pieces of ancient art in the world, a superb example of Cretan Bronze Age sculpture.Except she isn't. Kenneth Lapatin, President of the Boston Society of the Archeological Institute of America, has been studying her for a decade, and casting doubts on her authenticity. Now he has published a book-length explanation, _Mysteries of the Snake Goddess: Art, Desire, and the Forging of History_ (Houghton Mifflin Company) of how the experts of art and archeology have been fooled, and with the book's exhaustive notes and appendices, this account is devastating. It also tells plenty about how archeology is done, what sort of characters do it, how we view the ancient past, and how wishful thinking, perhaps even more than greed, has perpetrated the forgery. The details of the origin of the statue are still unclear, and probably always will be. But Lapatin has dug into as much as can be known of its shadowy past, and has provided an expert's details. He can write, for instance, \\"Eyes with drilled pupils _and_ canthi have no parallel in Aegean sculpture and do not appear in ancient statuary before the second century A.D.\\" He gives an excellent section on why science can provide only limited evidence in this case (although none of it points to the statue's authenticity).Lapatin does more than just debunk, for in his fascinating and original book, he shows how the Goddess is still important. She isn't the find Sir John Evans, the excavator of Knossos, and others thought she was. However, \\"She has provided a canvas on which archeologists and curators, looters and smugglers, dealers and forgers, art patrons and museum-goers, feminists and spiritualists, have painted their preconceptions, desires, and preoccupations for an idealized past.\\" We may have to admit we know less about Minoan culture, but we can always learn more about human nature."},{"Title":"Mysteries Of The Snake Goddess: Art, Desire, And The Forging Of History","review":"Lapatin does a good job in sleuthing through the surviving letters and other documentary evidence. He reaches the conclusion, mirrored by the lab report contained in an appendix to the book, that the &quot;Boston Snake Goddess&quot; is almost certainly a twentieth century forgery.He reveals that it is impossible to carbon-date the ivory of the figurine itself, because of the techniques used to restore it. Ivory fragments associated with the find but not used in the reconstruction date back about four hundred years. The chemical composition of the gold in the find does not match ancient gold. The facial expression is unlike genuine examples of Minoan art, lacking either the archaic smile or the manga-style eyes of genuine artifacts.His verdict is stated with caution, but the evidence seems to weigh against the authenticity of the Goddess. He also catalogues a number of similar statues, some of which are definite forgeries, and others have similarly dubious histories.These images nevertheless reappear over and over again, not only in historical, but also in popular literature. They were adopted into popular culture, in fantasy novels, and as feminist symbols. They even became the keystone of enthusiasts' attempts to revive the worship of this apparently invented deity.Where his argument breaks down is when he attempts to present the broader context. He asserts that Evans, the chief excavator at Knossos, was influenced by prevailing intellectual trends in positing ancient Crete as an idyllic society practicing a goddess-worshipping earth religion. In fact, though, he presents very little of Evans's own conclusions in making this argument. Where his theory comes from, and why it was wrong, is treated much less thoroughly in this slim book. Influential successors obviously influenced by Evans's theories, like Robert Graves, are not discussed at all.For a readable summation of the influence of Frazer's -Golden Bough-, and the other literary sources of the sort of beliefs that apparently influenced Evans, Ronald Hutton's -The Triumph of the Moon- does a much better job."},{"Title":"Mysteries Of The Snake Goddess: Art, Desire, And The Forging Of History","review":"Readable, concise, and absorbing account of the way archaeological interpretation and the manufacture of forgeries is influenced by current trends and fashions.Sheds light on the extent to which Minoan discoveries were 'tailored' to fit their discoverers' expectations. Very important reading for anyone who is interested in 'interpreting' the art and artifacts of Knossos and Minoan culture. Otherwise, one would never know that many of the now-accepted images of Minoan culture were highly 'edited' and even created by Arthur Evans and his employees at Knossos.If anything the book is too concise and focused on the Snake Goddess. I'd like to have seen a bit more on Evans' background and life. I'd stop short of calling it an 'expose',' but it certainly shows how archaeologists -- especially the gentleman adventurers of the nineteenth and early twentieth century -- were able to play fast and loose with the 'facts' to their own advantage. In fairness to Evans, he comes off as a well-meaning, if egotistical type more guilty of self deception than guile. But his complicity in the illicit trade in relics is documented."},{"Title":"Mysteries Of The Snake Goddess: Art, Desire, And The Forging Of History","review":"This is a fascinating, if disillusioning, detective story. But it confirms what I have long uneasily suspected when I lectured my students about Minoan art -- that many, indeed MOST of my assumptions rested on modern recreations of that art, rather than the hard evidence of the original objects. Lapatin convincingly demonstrates here what I suspected but didn't want to believe about the exquisite Boston ivory. More important, however, he helped me understand what I can trust and what I can't about the heavily restored sculpture and painting from Knossos.Of course we all tend to interpret history in light of our own experiences; that's a fact of life. However, some historians and archaeologists go farther overboard than necessary. Evans, to give him the great credit he deserves, had a wonderful and empathetic imagination, and his discovery of an ancient civilization was an extraordinary achievement. But even in his own time, his determination to make such extensive restorations to the art and architecture was controversial.One more observation: the less we know about an ancient civilization, the easier it is for us to idealize it. Even as recently as the 1960's, Crete was usually described as a peaceable kingdom, despite the rather suspicious fact that its royal symbol was the battle axe. As for matriarchy, I hate to disappoint a previous reviewer, but the evidence for matriarchy in ancient Crete consists of two statuettes that come from secure archaeological proveniences, and a great many forgeries. The fact that the people of ancient Crete worshiped goddesses doesn't make them unusual; so did the citizens of classical Athens, whose city housed one of the most magnificent images of that goddess ever created. But their women had about the same legal rights as their goats.Final note: Read this and then read Arthur Phillips's entertainingly black-comic novel \\"The Egyptologist,\\" for a take on the same phenomenon that Lapatin describes here."},{"Title":"Mysteries Of The Snake Goddess: Art, Desire, And The Forging Of History","review":"To describe Lapatin's book, in one word: disingenuous.Claiming his book to be the exposure of the ivory \\"Boston Snake Goddess\\" as a fake (which is not in dispute), Lapatin actually goes well beyond this to embark on his personal exercise of disingenuous cynicism. As an example of the disingenuity of the kind of argument presented by Lapatin throughout this book I will proffer one example:In the body of his text on page 46 he acknowledges that Ventris deciphered Linear B and discovered it to be Greek; and even writes that the writing turned out to be inventory lists (understood because they are Greek). However, an illustration of a tablet of Linear B is accompanied by the caption \\"the first Greek script?\\", thus insinuating that it may not be Greek at all.His book does not get any better. He relies on the ignorance by the majority of his readership of ancient societies to disparage the motivations of scholars who have come before him. In his chapter entitled \\"The Divine Mother\\" he claims that the conclusion of the existence of a matriarchic society in Krete was part of a nineteenth century desire to find \\"evidence of the central importance of woman's biological powers in prehistoric society.\\" p.69. He finds \\"proof\\" for this by writing \\"[Evans] writes repeatedly of 'the older matriarchal stage of social development'...\\" p.70. Bizarrely, even though he damns Evans for his matriarchic conclusions, Lapatin himself concludes that \\"There is indeed ample archaeological evidence for a predominant female deity (or deities) on Krete...\\" p. 73!By pages 88-89, Lapatin forgets what he wrote (on p. 73) and writes:\\"...ideas about the proper role of women in society have evolved in the past onehundred years. For the past is constantly reshaped to suit the needs of the present ... Feminists and others seeking alternatives to an oppressive patriarchal, Judeo-Christian tradition have embraced the idea of a kinder gentler, matriarchal world...\\" Thus, Lapatin is suggesting that there were no matriarchic societies in antiquity. He is wrong. Tacitus wrote, (nearly) 2000 years before the birth of Lapatin. In his \\"Germania\\" he describes the tribe of Sitones in which \\"woman is the ruling sex.\\" (Germania, section 45).And, in Lapatin's book we do not even encounter Elam. The religion of Elam, from c. 2200 - c. 700 BC was administered by priestesses; the Elamite godhead was matriarchic; and they worshipped the snake. In Elam the texts have been deciphered. The head goddess was Pinikir, \\"mistress of the heavens\\". \\"[Snakes] appear on jar-stoppers and on the lids of vessels as symbols of protection against evil. Snakes rear up as guardians... twine around altar plates...\\" (p. 41 \\"The Lost World of Elam\\", Walther Hinz).Lapatin by way of gross omissions claims that the scholars of the past were mindless products of their age. Only by excluding matriarchic societies which did coexist with those in Krete (as those at Elam) and which continued to exist (in parts of Europe) long enough to be recorded by Tacitus, is Lapatin able to \\"prove\\" his point. Lapatin's argument is void. It cannot therefore be said that Evans and others were fabricating a history to give women their share in human history. Thus, the overriding question here is: what motivates Lapatin? For it certainly isn't the truth. Indeed, the only conclusion anyone can draw is that Lapatin is projecting what motivates himself onto to others instead."},{"Title":"Celtic wonder tales,","review":"I've read many times the celtic tales written by historians or history teachers.

I finally picked it up a few years ago and found that, unlike many of the books I read as a kid, this one actually held up to being read as an adult. A story, like many others, of children in another world. Not a terribly complicated story, but a convincing one, with stong elements of strangeness and sadness."},{"Title":"The marrow of the world","review":"While Phillip and his adopted cousin, Linda, are rowing their boat across the lake where they are vacationing for the summer, they see something impossible. A castle is sunk in the water that no one else can see, and which vanishes when they dive to investigate. When they return during the night to investigate further, their boat is seized by unknown forces and propelled up a river into another world.There the two children meet Herne, a woodsman who tells them the story of the battle between the good king Kyril Tessarion, and the evil witch, Morgan. An unseen power separates them from Herne, and the children find themselves in the clutches of the witch Ygerna, daughter of Morgan, who claims Linda is really from this world, the last daughter of the witch Morgan.Ygerna sends the children on a dangerous quest for The Marrow of the World, which is deep within the dwarfs' mountain stronghold. Great danger and personal growth are in store for the two cousins as they go after the marrow and try to return home. Much better than Nichols other adventure novel, A Walk out of the World, but still a little lacking in resonance."},{"Title":"HOT ROD ROAD","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much for an older book. The book was listed as in good shape. It was in terrible shape. Binder coming off and pages falling out."},{"Title":"Electromagnetic theory","review":"This is not a single book it is a set of 3 hardbacks:Vol 1 is 504 pages and consists of Heaviside's papers published in the Electrician of 1891 to 1893. Vol II is 547 pages and consists Heaviside's papers published in the Electrician of 1894 to 1898. Vol III is 666 pages and consists of Heaviside's papers in the published Electrician of 1900 to 1912. It also contains papers published in Nature during this same interval. Additionally there are 140 pages of unpublished notes discovered after Heaviside's death.Heaviside evidently published a lot of material and was a very influential engineer both in his time and subsequently. His views on Electromagnetic Theory, and in particular on transmission line theory, shaped the whole development of the subject. His arguments with the influential \\"experts\\" of his day are made public in these republished papers. Not all of his criticisms were polite and this certainly comes across in these papers!Heaviside was a man of very limited financial resources and yet still managed to achieve scientific greatness and esteem from the great men of his time. The other men of great influence, but little ability, with whom he crossed swords, all seem to have fallen by the wayside, leaving Heaviside's viewpoint as dominant. Somehow Heaviside never translated his intellectual and scientific ability and contributions into enough finances to support him. He was desperately poor throughout his life, even having the gas supply to his home cut off during winter months due to non-payment of bills. It is therefore fitting that these volumes be read and appreciated by future generations as his reward. You may of course have heard of the Heaviside operator in calculus, the Heaviside step function, the Kennelly-Heaviside layer in the ionosphere, the Heaviside-Feynman formula for the radiated field of a moving charged particle. There is a lot of other stuff which did not get Heaviside's name on it, such as the telegrapher's equation.Throughout, Heaviside tries to explain things in easy to understand terms using simple notation. He hated the wretched gothic fonts used by Maxwell in the famous treatise (and on this point anyone who has ever read Maxwell will easily agree!) and he introduced the bold faced fonts for the D, E, B and H vector fields that are still used today.This collection of papers is an honest and non-pompous piece of work. It is actually pleasurable to read and to compare against more modern writers on the same subject. The reader will perhaps forgive Heaviside for his lack of (false) modesty. After all, this fame is evidently the greater part of what he personally received from his publications by way of a reward."},{"Title":"Rise Stevens: A Life in Music (Great Voices 10)","review":"John Pennino has written a new and definitive biography of Rise Stevens (a woman who enjoyed a fabulous mezzo soprano opera soloist at the Met for over 25 years), for the Baskerville Publishers Great Voices Series. The tenth volume of this consistently impressive series, \\"Rise Stevens: A Life in Music,\\" includes a CD of 26 rare recordings, plus works by Bizet, Gluck, Verdi, Kern, Strauss, Schubert, Wolf, Brahms, and others as only she could perform them. Also included is a hefty 48 pages of black and white photos from the archives of the Met, a complete discography in 18 pages, and a complete chronology of her life and works in an additional 41 pages. The definitive Carmen of her time (and perhaps of all time), Rise Stevens has truly gifted the world with her vocal talents. Described as \\"a force of nature on the stage\\", she rose from humble beginnings in New York through many obstacles to a legendary status as a variably experienced opera singer. Prolific and proficient in her vocal career, her choices both in her early vocal training with Schoen-Renee, and later in widening her classical career to include more popular entertainment venue under the management of husband Walter Surovy, all combined to affect her total star impact. A true Mezzo, some of her most memorable roles were Carmen, Octavian (Der Rosencavalier), Hansel, Cherubino, Orfeo, Prince Orlovsky, and Dalila. \\"Rise Stevens: A Life In Music\\" is a magnificent summation of an unforgettable vocal talent and a core addition to any personal, professional, academic, or community library Music History reference collection or American Biography shelf."},{"Title":"Rise Stevens: A Life in Music (Great Voices 10)","review":"Mr. Pennino obviously admires Miss Stevens and he has gathered a great deal of material in preparing this biography. Although he indicates that he had the cooperation of Stevens, her husband and her son, there are no indications of this -- there is very little personal information in the book. You do not get a feeling of the person that is Rise Stevens, which is a pity. Even sadder is the fact that, as far as her biographer is concerned, she has not existed for the last 12 years.Obviously, most of the singers who worked with Stevens are dead, but there is a great body of material published about this singer during her career that could have been used to create a feeling of the person behind the public image.As a book, it has been poorly edited; there are numerous typos (poor Jussi Bjorling suffers especially); in the photo section, Rise is spelled with the French acute accent, instead of the umlaut; there is no index.It is unforunate that the discography does not provide full information on availability of materials and recording companies. The footnotes do not conform to any style manual. For newspapers and magazine, the author cites the source but does not indicate section or page number; books do have pages cited.In short, Rise Stevens' career was unique. For many years, she was THE American opera singer. She deserves a biography that not only defines her position in American music (she did bring a lot of new people to this rarified art form) and captures her warm, gracious personality. She really is a distinguished American who has been largely forgotten.operadidact"},{"Title":"Rise Stevens: A Life in Music (Great Voices 10)","review":"Here are the items on the cd.

In addition to a very good mystery story, you are presented with a remote part of Australia in a very different time than we live in today. The detective, Napoleon Bonaparte, is an excellent character, and well supported by other well developed characters. The plotting is also strong and keeps you interested in the developing story. Through it all, you have that sense of a different time and place, a different pace of living, but familiar emotions and motivations.

It was delightful to read, and, now I am working my way through other books in the series (also delightful) as I am able to find them."},{"Title":"The sands of Windee,","review":"In 1929 Arthur Upfield was working as a boundary rider in western Australia, while also mulling over a plot for The Sands of Windee. He needed a method for disposing of a body without a trace, and a mate made a good suggestion. Unfortunately another mate was listening and used the method to commit his own murders! Upfield testified at the trial a year after finishing his book.The Sands of Windee was Upfield's second novel featuring Detective Inspector Napoleon (Bony) Bonaparte of the Queensland Police.In a police report Bony reads about the disappearance of a man named Marks at Windee station in New South Wales. He's convinced Marks was murdered, not lost in the bush, and senses the presence of a crime worthy of his great gifts. Bony, a half-caste, combines in his person the best hunting skills of the white race and the Aborigine.The plot is quite complex and includes a scandalous subplot. All the characters are terrific. The great generalship of the station owner, the intelligence and beauty of his daughter and the eccentricities of his station hands totally engaged my interest. And there's an ancient Aborigine chief who can read thoughts and evoke hypnotic visions. I was fascinated by Upfield's observations on the mental powers of the Aborigines.But Australia itself is the most riveting character of all, with its scorching winters, exotic landscape, horrendous bush fires and teaming wildlife. The reader is also treated to two riotous social events - a tin-kettling among the whites (honoring newlyweds) and a corroboree among the Aborigines.Upfield's Bony mysteries are fast going out of print, so I suggest buying them all, and quickly. The Lure of the Bush is the first, but you can jump into the series at any point. Bony is always Bony."},{"Title":"The sands of Windee,","review":"I love the books and I love the CD's.

I was attracted to the pictures on the box, and bought them on a whim. When I opened them up, they really didn't speak to me. Try as I might, I couldn't do a reading with them at all. So I bought another deck and used it exclusively until a few months ago. I was beginning to have &quot;issues&quot; with this other deck, so I pulled out the Old Path and began using them in a professional readers course I was taking. After about 4 weeks, I suddenly found myself doing much better with the deck, but the additional images in the background of many cards had all of us in the class doing symbolism research in our spare time. For example, the toad in the tower card. For frogs there of course is the amphibian aspect, and the &quot;touch a frog get warts&quot; tale, as well as the &quot;kiss a frog find a prince&quot;... but what about a TOAD? Another difficult card for many of us was the 6 of swords, the single card in the deck with no human in it. We all knew what the 6 of swords meant, but what about this picture? Then serendipity struck again and I saw the book and found I had just enough cash to buy it. Another reviewer has mentioned that the book analyzes the cards to nth degree, and I agree. But for myself, and the other experienced readers in the class, it was a moment of &quot;Eureka!&quot; to find that the mushrooms in the page of pentacles hands added depth to the card, etc. And now, everyone in the class has gone out and bought the deck, including the facilitator.SO, if you like the deck but aren't a walking encyclopedia of symbolic knowledge, the book is an excellent reference that will add depth to readings done with this beautiful deck."},{"Title":"Tarot of the Old Path (Book & Card Deck)","review":"The Tarot of the Old Path deck is a wonderful deck that speaks to the reader. The symbolism is rich, the colors vibrant. An excellent deck for intuitive Tarot readings. The book tends to describe things down to the nth detail, and tends to get pedantic and set in the meaning of each card. A Tarot deck should be studied carefully on one's own before utilizing a book, if you choose to utilize a book at all. If you buy this deck simply for fortune telling, then by all means read the book. For intuitive readings, set the book aside and let the deck speak to you."},{"Title":"Tarot of the Old Path (Book & Card Deck)","review":"the Tarot of the Old Path is certainly pagan in tone. the illustrations are subtle, incorporating traditional tarot symbols (like the two pillars in the high priestess card)without being any less origional. i found that the cards had enough similarity to standard rider-waite decks to be familiar, but were much more attuned to Wiccan philosophy than to ceremonial magick. I would recomend this deck to Wiccans and Pagans primarily, but also to anyone who collects or likes a variety of artwork."},{"Title":"Tarot of the Old Path (Book & Card Deck)","review":"The Tarot of the Old Path deck is beautiful and quite original, but all you need to interpret it is the instruction booklet included with the deck.

McClatchy, a superb poet and the editor of The Yale Review, has put together a number of landmark anthologies over the years, including the Vintage Book of Contemporary American Poetry and Vintage Book of Contemporary World Poetry. For the Everyman's Library Pocket Poets series, he has co-edited an anthology of Christmas Poems with John Hollander. And, most recently, he has edited the Library of America's outstanding edition of the poems of Longfellow. But perhaps nowhere has he brought his refined taste and peerless editorial acumen to bear more beautifully than on this Everyman edition of some of the finest poems about birds in the English language-ON WINGS OF SONG.McClatchy sets the tone for this collection in his elegant foreword: &quot;At the very dawn of civilization, birds were symbols of the spirit. Falcon or dove, stork or raven or owl, they were our messengers, fierce or gentle intermediaries between our earthbound lives and the upper air.&quot; Keenly aware of emblematic types and the categories that they fall into, McClatchy carefully arranges the anthology accordingly. The list of poets that grace this anthology include many timeless masters, ranging from Virgil to Chaucer, from Wordsworth to Yeats, and from Poe to Frost.The great Romantic era poems about birds, such as Shelley's &quot;To a Skylark&quot; and Keats's &quot;To a Nightingale&quot; are duly included, but the surprises in the collection are numerous. Among my favorites is a little-known four-line poem by the Anglo-Indian poet Vikram Seth, entitled &quot;Pigeons&quot;: &quot;The pigeons swing across the square/Suddenly voiceless in midair,/Flaunting, against their civic coats,/The glossy oils that scarf their throats.&quot; A number of the poems are also downright funny. Chief among these is X.J. Kennedy's sardonic &quot;Vulture&quot;: &quot;The vulture's very like a sack/Set down and left there drooping./His crooked neck and creaky back/Look badly bent from stooping/Down to the ground to eat dead cows/So they won't go to waste/Thus making up in usefulness/For what he lacks in taste.&quot;McClatchy does a masterful job of arranging the poems in a manner that refreshes and surprises the reader at every turn. ON THE WINGS OF SONG is a must have on every birdwatcher's and verse lover's shelf."},{"Title":"On Wings of Song: Poems About Birds (Everyman's Library Pocket Poets)","review":"This Pocket Poets series has done us a great favor by publishing these short collections of a central theme. Past volumes focused on common poetic themes (i.e. love, war, friendship), and while there has already been a volume on animal poems, one devoted to bird poems is certainly time- and paper-worthy.This little book gives lovers of poetry (and of birds) a chance to indulge in the seemingly forbidden enjoyment, in today's poetic world, of poetry as an ebullient celebration of the simple and mundane. With so many poets of our time are so caught up with catharsis, neuroses, unresolved parental issues, and the like, it's difficult to imagine those poets taking the focus off themselves long enough to consider something like birds, let alone write poems about them. Fortunately, as this book enchantingly demonstrates, our poetic heritage is too rich to let us forget that poet craft has a vast voice to speak of many things, and with a topic such as birds, the poem has the power to shake us out of our indifference to the ordinary, letting us see its beauty by honoring with beauty.I presently own all the volumes of the Pocket Poets series to date, and this volume easily ranks among my favorites. It includes a fascinatingly broad range of poetic literature from the Bible to contemporaries like Seamus Heaney, and its last section pays homage to &quot;famous&quot; birds in poetry, such as Coleridge's albatross and Poe's raven. It's worth every cent, and has a very attractive dust jacket to boot, so you'll be tempted to leave it out on your coffee table just to impress your friends."},{"Title":"On Wings of Song: Poems About Birds (Everyman's Library Pocket Poets)","review":"This pocket-sized hardcover of poems about birds provides a beautiful gathering of literary verse revolving around birds, separated by general bird categories from 'backyard' and 'barnyard' to 'birds of prey' and beyond.

After all, why read about a place when you can turn on the travel channel and see it in living color? Well, for one reason, it's reading! But, I'll try not to climb up on my soapbox. Unsworth does a wonderful job of presenting a textual picture of the people, culture and history of this cradle of civilization. His insights on travels to the scenic countryside, tourist Mecas and ruins of past civilizations on this Mediterranean island provide the reader with more than just pictures; he provides us with the flavors and smells, awakening the senses of our imagination more than any passive media presentation.The bottom line is that this is not an exhaustive treatment of the history, geography or culture of Crete, nor is it a picture book; it is a throwback to a time when travel was not the commodity of the everyday man, a time when we lived vicariously through the likes of Hemmingway and Stevenson. If all you want is to see beautiful scenery, there are any number of picture books or web sites to entertain you, but if you want to experience Crete without the trip, you will want to read this book.P-)"},{"Title":"Crete (Directions)","review":"I was surprised and pleased to find a new Unsworth book- particularly since I am planning a trip to Greece this summer. I have perused several travel guides, but this book stands out, despite its brevity (or perhaps on account of it).Unsworth's glimpse at Crete is by no means comprehensive, but fills in the gaps that he proposes- What kind of place Crete is, some interesting things to see there, and an outline of his tour with his wife Aira. His style is unashamedly first-person reflective, and he gives a fair and balanced account of the island which becomes saturated by tourists each summer. Barry has whet my appetite for visiting this island without overwhelming me with his own ideas and opinions. Do not look for a detailed history; instead look for an impressionistic accounting of the caves, gorges, churches and urban labyrinths of Crete. Fans of Unsworth and thoughtful travellers will enjoy this novella immensely."},{"Title":"Crete (Directions)","review":"One of the best and easiest travel guides I have owned.I'm still returning to it and will use it on my next trip!"},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"Scripture Matters is a masterful guide to reading -- and understanding -- the Bible from the heart of the Church. It is a work that combines intelligence and depth with a wonderful warmth and readability. Dr. Hahn's chapters on historical criticism, the Real Presence, and the place of Scripture in Catholic teaching are worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"In this new volume Professor Scott Hahn has gathered together twelve of his essays on the reading and study of Holy Scripture. The essays are put together in a logical order, even though they were written at different times and for different publications. Professor Hahn stresses the fact that there are many levels of meaning in Scripture. The literal meaning is basic to all the senses of the Bible, but that must not be emphasized to the exclusion of the spiritual and typological meaning that permeates the Scripture. The reason for this is that God is the author of the book.During the past century many scripture scholars, including many Catholics, have so emphasized the literal sense that they have neglected the spiritual sense. This is especially true of those who rely exclusively on the historical critical methods of interpreting Scripture. Dr. Hahn grants that there is much value in the proper use of the historical critical methods, but at the same time he clearly points out the weaknesses and deficiencies. Professor Hahn reminds us in this fine book that the study of Scripture is the soul of theology. The Bible remains normative for Catholic theology. In short, Dr. Hahn spells out the basic principles for a Catholic interpretation of Scripture, and he also gives us some good examples of how to go about interpreting a few passages the sacred pages. &quot;Scripture Matters,&quot; therefore, is a helpful book for those who want to learn how to interpret the Bible in a way that is in agreement with Catholic teaching and tradition. If you read Scott Hahn carefully, you will begin to have a deeper appreciation of the various levels of meaning in the divinely inspired Scriptures."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"Once again, Scott Hahn sets out to motivate Catholics to soak long and often in the Word of God. And once again, the popular Steubenville professor excites in his readers a heightened appreciation for the Bible's inextricable link to the Church. Hahn gives an insightful overview of the traditional ways Scripture can be understood, and argues that the Bible must be read with each sense in mind. In addition to the literal sense, the Bible should be read in the allegorical, moral and anagogical senses as well. Hahn insists the Bible is best understood only when one integrates all four of these senses.In what is perhaps the book's most challenging chapter, Hahn explains what he believes to be a \\"key that unlocks the mysteries of faith... the family of God.\\" He points out that \\"the whole of Scripture can be viewed as the story of how God, as Father, repeatedly strives... to draw his wayward children home.\\" Hahn also includes two chapters about the central importance of Scripture in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. In another chapter, he provides a moving tribute to the recently canonized St. Josemaria Escriva and the preeminent place he gave to Scripture in the spiritual life. Elsewhere, Hahn explains the importance of Jesus' \\"hour\\" in John's Gospel, as the culmination of his saving work, as it is re-presented in the Mass. In another chapter that's particularly helpful in current debates about marriage, celibacy and the male priesthood, Hahn offers an insightful look at the priestly vocation of fatherhood and the fatherly vocation of the priesthood. He ends with a thoughtful critique of currents trends in biblical scholarship.In each chapter, Hahn's style is accessible to a wide range of readers, yet even seasoned theologians can benefit from his clear and enthusiastic elucidation of the basics of Bible reading for Catholics. \\"Scripture Matters\\" is an invitation to penetrate the mysteries of God's Word more deeply, always within the Living Tradition of the Church. If it finds the wide readership it deserves, it will succeed in its aim to help Catholics become Bible Christians and Bible Christians to become Catholics. After all, God's Work is at the heart of the Church; just so, the Church should be at the heart of every Christian."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"Scott Hahn has done it again! Through a collection of challenging and fascinating essays on biblical matters, he has prepared our minds and hearts to be open to the Holy Spirit at work in the life-giving Word of God. At Vatican II, the Council Fathers called for a greater access to Sacred Scripture for all the Christian faithful They exhorted all of us to learn &quot;the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ&quot; (Phil. 3:8), through the study of Sacred Scripture. I can think of no better introduction to this study than Scott Hahn's Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"Dr. Scott Hahn has provided in Scripture Matters an invaluable series of essays that will not only help to keep students of Sacred Scripture on track, but also give them a sense of certitude concerning the Church's long-standing tradition of interpretation. After reading Scripture Matters, you will want to jump into Scripture study with renewed zeal. Dr. Hahn's excitement for Scripture will rub off on you. Get ready!"},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"One does not have to agree with Dr. Hahn in all particulars of Scripture Matters to see that he succeeds admirably in stirring things up in the world of contemporary Catholic biblical scholarship. This book should prove to be a useful stimulus for getting all of us who love Scripture to come to terms with it in our lives."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"Dr. Scott Hahn's new book, Scripture Matters, reflects not only a profound theology of God's Word, but also analyzes and critiques some of the more prevalent errors which have crept into discussions of the interpretations and proper use of Sacred Scripture in the life of the Church and the lives of individuals. I heartily recommend this work for students and all those who wish to enhance the effective role of Holy Scripture in their lives."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"\\"Scripture Matters,\\" by Scott Hahn is a collection of essays written on approaches and perspectives that can be used to study the Bible. I was a bit skeptical about the book, when I noted that one of the essays referred to the late founder of Opus Dei, because I have reservations about some of that organization's teaching. However, the essay, was not an exhortation of what one should find in terms of ideas in the Bible, but rather techniques that any one could apply in their Bible study to better reatin the wisdom that God speaks to any particular soul who studies the scripture.The essay topics are not histories on when the books of the Bible may have been written. Nor do the essays, for the most part (the essay about fathers and the one about the forgiven prostitute do pull meaning from a story and are exceptions), concern themselves with telling people what instruction they should take from any part of the Bible.Instead, the essays introduce vocabulary related to basic Biblical exegesis and predominantly have topics about techniques that any reader can employ in their personal study; such as typology, dividing the Bible into three time periods (age of patrirachs, age of law, age of spiritual law or Jesus Christ) for reference; and using four senses for discernment of scripture (one literal and three spiritual). None of the analytical frameworks proposed contradict teaching of the Cathechism, and the last device mentioned is straiht from the Cathechism. However, the essays in the book will enlghten any Bible scholar's approach to scripture, particulalry if they are beginning Biblical scholar, regardless if they consider themselves members of the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"I always gain insight when I read Scott Hahn. This book helps explain scripture in a concise and well defined way."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"This is a great, short book composed of several short essays which can be read in about 20 minutes. Each essay discusses some aspect of scripture, whether it be the historical-critical method, a particular verse, or simply the way that scripture is to be read in the mind of the Church.Chapter two discusses the current (sad) state of biblical scholarship in so far as its reliance on the historical critical method. Though Hahn does not flat out reject this method, he talks about how you can not have only one way to interpret scripture (namely, through an historical-critical lens) and contrasts this with another extreme, that of the completely literal Fundamentalist interpretation. The Fathers as well as the heart of the Church have always interpreted scripture in a 4-fold sense; the literal, the moral, analogical, and anagogical sense, with the main sense being the literal. In particular, the last three comprise what is often called the \\"spiritual sense\\" of scripture, and this is something that has been lost by many people over the past century.Several essays stick out in my mind. One essay that I learned a lot from was the essay on Josemaria Escriva, the founder of Opus Dei. I did not know much about him, and was fascinated to learn about the man's deep love and devotion to the scriptures. Another one was on the proper understanding of Jesus when he says \\"Judge not lest ye be judged.\\" As the author points out, so many times people use this to say you simply can't judge others, but Hahn looks at this in the context of the story of the woman caught in adultery and shows how Jesus brilliantly turned the question the Pharisees asked him around onto them. This showed the perfect balance between mercy and justice, the old law and the new law.This is a great little book which should make your heart burn within you, to use one of Dr. Hahn's favorite bible verses (Luke 24:32)."},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"If someone wants to know about the interpretation of scripture and where we stand with historical criticism from the Catholic Church's point of view, this is an excellent statement"},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","review":"Dr. Hahn is a master communicator of difficult topics in a way that makes them accessible to the layman. This collection of essays could be the definitive guide to biblical theology and hermeneutics from the traditional Catholic perspective. With them, you will learn of the alternative approaches to scripture and where they lack while gaining a deeper respect for the guidance of the Church in understanding scripture within the appropriate context. The only drawback to this work is that the essays seem to beg for more attention to specific topics in a more systematic approach but the essay approach does seem to work well as an introduction to these topics.

Everyone should buy and start with this one. All the transactions were professional and fast service."},{"Title":"Astrology For Dummies","review":"I've been dabbling in astrology here and there for the past few years, but have not dedicated much time to studying the subject until recently. My first real intro came with \\"The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need\\".... yeah, right. I liked the book, but didn't learn as much as I would have liked or expected from a book so titled. \\"Astrology for Dummies\\" is shorter and more readable, and it lays the groundwork for a basic understanding in a subject that is deep, complex, and rewarding.Orion begins with constructing the birth chart. I appreciate that she gives information on how to go about calculating and drawing up your own birth chart WITHOUT the use of a computer. Now, you'd be near crazy to do so (as she states), as a simple internet search can take you to plenty of sites that can render a thorough and accurate birth chart in mere seconds, but it is interesting to learn about how these things had to be done in the not-too-distant past. I do appreciate that she took the time to go through some of the motions on how this is done as opposed to simply starting off with: \\"Go to this site, type in your info, print your chart. Now match what it says with what's in my book.\\" The goal is to gain some perspective on this whole thing, and progress out of Dummydom. But if you do favor the quick, skimmy approach, she suggests simply skipping ahead at any time.We get solid information about the basics: traits and behavior of each sun sign, overviews of the elements and modes and how they stack up in your chart, and succinct yet reasonably thorough outlines of what the major aspects of your natal chart mean for you. Ex: Your (planet) in (sign), your (planet) in (house), your (planet) aspecting (planet). The mandatory sun sign compatibility section was even a bit refreshing from most I've read, with examples of famous couples listed.My favorite part of the book was near the end where Orion outlines simple ways to use astrology in your daily life. By noting the phases and signs of the moon, you get a feel for what times are good for certain activities. Another chapter touches on the common and often irritating period of Mercury Retrograde and how to deal with it. You also learn what to look for in the calendar in order to properly time big events in your life, such as marriage, opening a business, or throwing a party. These are aspects of astrology I always saw as intimidating and far too advanced for my understanding; if I have barely scratched the surface of my birth chart, how am I going to decipher the planets' current movements in relation to my life now? The author introduces you to the simplest ways to begin utilizing astrology for practical life purposes, right now.A small but notable problem with \\"Astrology for Dummies\\" is the planetary tables only go through 2012, so hopefully an updated edition remedies this soon. Still, as you'll surely be using the internet for a natal chart, you could just as easily look up the planetary tables online, too.Overall, I was impressed with this book. It wasn't so much the information, but how Orion presents it. The little hints and details she includes, which many authors might simply take for granted, make this book truly useful to the beginner, as opposed to mildly helpful. After finishing the book, I feel ready and excited to dig deeper into astrology!"},{"Title":"Astrology For Dummies","review":"This is my second basic Astrology book and I love it.

It is more understandable just READING it, than actually attempting to create a natal chart with just this 'book for dummies' as an aid. I am a complete novice and to entertain you more, a 'DUMMY in Astrology' so I needed to purchase something I thought would be easy to comprehend and implement alone. Wrong, wrong and a thousand times wrong. The minute I was left on my own creating my natal chart (Gemini sun, Virgo moon and Scorpio Ascendent) I was completely LOST. I couldn't and didn't understand where the dog-gone FIRST house was and I believe many other don't either. The people who write these books should actually have a dummy like me sitting there with them and then they'd know exactly what I mean. This book couldn't get me out of the problems I discovered as I was challenging my limited ability in this subject. I used the Birth Chart on the Internet and I could SEE it. I made my chart according to Internet. I clearly for 3 hours didn't know what to counterclockwise count back from - The Sun - the book isn't clear here. Remember, I'm the idiot.

I found this book to be condesending to the reader, though perhaps the author meant this to be comical. I did not find the humour and felt as though he was attempting to talk down to the reader rather than simplify astrology.

You'll find general and easy to understand explinations for a variety of topics in astrology along with an astrological \\"cookbook\\" for a quick chart analysis. The book comes short on the topic of sign compatibility rendering it too simplistically for any real use, though.I also feel that the book is too trivial at times, harming astrology's already battered image; but this is more a personal opinion than a fact.If your interest runs a bit deeper and/or are looking for a professional introduction, there are more serious and in-depth books out there."},{"Title":"Astrology For Dummies","review":"This is a first class general introduction to all of real astrology. If you have heard or suspected that there is a great deal more to it than the newspaper columns, this book is a good place to begin finding out more. Rae Orion explains the basics and complexities of the birth chart (a proper horoscope is based on the exact time, date and place of birth) in a clear, straightforward manner.In &quot;The Cosmic Cookbook&quot; section, Orion takes the reader through the basics of birth chart interpretation. Sun signs, Moon signs, the positions of all the planets in the various signs and houses e.g. Mars in Aquarius, Uranus in the sixth house and so on. Real life examples are scattered throughout the book. Other sections cover basic compatibility, both Sun sign combinations and more complex relationship astrology. Towards the end there is &quot;Ten Types Of Astrology&quot; (including Vedic and Chinese) and some more esoteric features of the horoscope are briefly covered in &quot;Ten Ways To Complicate A Chart&quot; (such as midpoints and Arabic parts).An excellent starter. &quot;Parkers Astrology&quot; could be a colourful complement to this volume, and I recommend Stephen Arroyo's &quot;Chart Interpretation Handbook&quot; as a possible next step."},{"Title":"Astrology For Dummies","review":"Ignore the unfortunate cover art (consistent among this series). Rae Orion has written a thoroughly entertaining and extremely user-friendly guide to the fascinating world of astrology. Unlike tradition astrology tomes, which always seem filled with hopelessly complicated charts and mysteriously undecipherable symbols, this book is easy to use -- and SO fun to read! I love picking it up and opening it at random--virtually every page has some delightful nugget of insight or some wonderfully gossipy real life example. (Find out why Princess Diana and Charles's marriage was doomed from the start!) Even a little time spent browsing through this book will make a skeptic into a believer. The writing is smart and informed, lively, and somehow comforting. I highly recommend it (though I could do without the goofy cartoons, for which Rae Orion is evidently not responsible)."},{"Title":"Astrology For Dummies","review":"This book was much more complete than I ever expected.

The author certainly doesn't fit this stereotype. This book is written seriously and intelligently. If you don't know anything about astrology and would like to learn as much as you can, this is the book for you. This book is very easy to understand and proves that astrology is uncannily accurate. Orion helps dispel skepticism (from close-minded people) regarding astrology by discussing the mathematical basis (referring to planetary alignment) for this ancient science. There is an entire section in the later pages of the book devoted to this mathematical aspect, and it gets quite complicated, though Orion breaks it down well. Even gifted mathematicians will have to spend some time here, but if you're devoted to it, you'll be pleased with the results. Keep in mind that you will need to know not only the date of your birth and your birthplace but your exact birth time, which is essential for an accurate reading. Give this book a chance, and you'll be awestruck with your newfound information and perspective."},{"Title":"Astrology For Dummies","review":"Astrology For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))I will happily admit to being a big fan of the Dummies books. If one is new to a subject, wants to find a starting point that will not mislead or overwhelm them or only wants an overview they are the perfect place to start. \\"Astrology for Dummies\\" by Rae Orion is just such a book.As an experienced Tarot reader, I know the basics of astrology, but I wanted to learn more so that I could effectively add astrology to my services. I needed a starting point from which to learn enough so that I could intelligently evaluate more advanced books as well as software and other technical astrological products. This book has given me those tools.Other reviewers have complained that this book \\"...is an extremely generalized book...\\" or that it is \\"...not very helpful for anyone who really wants to seriously study astrology\\". Yes, it is generalized and no, it will not make you a serious nor professional astrologer. It is a Dummies book! It does precisely what all Dummies books are intended to do, it takes the reader from know little or nothing about a subject to either satisfying their curiosity or giving them an effective platform from which to launch more detailed study.The various parts of astrology are covered step by step with the clear tables, checklists, comments, signpost icons and sidebars for which the Dummies books are famous.I highly recommend this book for anyone who knows little or even nothing about astrology, but wants to learn more and then either be satisfied or know how to go on with their studies."},{"Title":"Astrology For Dummies","review":"This book is easy to read and understand.

That's what has kept this series so popular for all these years. Actually ,this episode has matured quite well.It was published exactly 7 years ago, in August 2000. Just because it isn't new,don't let that bother you as these yarns are timeless;and the older ones read as good as the newer ones.In this episode we see our hero,Longarm taking on quite a different role;that being a bodyguard for a rich Englishman,Sir Harry Blackstreet and his Niece Alice Channing on their visit to America for some real high powered wheeling and dealing. The job of bodyguard quickly turns into one including private eye and mystery solving.The story has a bit too much of the \\"Whodunnit\\" flavor for my liking ;but I still enjoyed it;as would anyone who likes some Mystery thrown into their Westerns.The srory reads much like a mystery and doesn't have the expressions and conversation that one gets in a lot of Westerns.There are several interesting characters developed; but these are quite different than the types Curtis usually meets up in his travels throughout the Old West. If you have read Larry McMurtry's \\"Berrybender Narratives\\" ,you'll recognize that the some of the characters are somewhat similar.It's not too often that I have to turn to the dictionary,reading these novels,but there were a couple of words that sent me searching.\\"Indubitably\\" meaning with certainty.and,\\"Catamite\\" this is an old west term going back to the 1890's.It wasused to describe a young hobo,usually in the company of anolder tramp;or a young boy who has sexual relations with anolder man.Longarm usually meets up with some interesting ladies of the Old West;but will he ever find the Golden Goddess?"},{"Title":"In the Kennedy Style: Magical Evenings in the Kennedy White House","review":"I've always enjoyed history and especially reading about the Kennedys.

HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"In the Kennedy Style: Magical Evenings in the Kennedy White House","review":"This is a marvellous, beautifully presented look at the entertaining done by President and Mrs. Kennedy during their too-brief thousand days in the White House. Letitia Baldrige was Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary, and she has collaborated with Kennedy White House Chef Rene Verdon on reminiscences and recipes that really do evoke that very special time and place. Baldrige's anecdotes give glimpses behind the scenes that help us all understand how distinguished the hosts, guests, and entertaining really were- and her comments are often very funny indeed. Verdon's recipes are drawn from menus actually served at the White House on historic occasions, such as the famed evening when cellist Pablo Casals played for the Kennedys and their guests. The book is incredibly generous with its illustrations, which range from White House photos, to pictures of actual invitations for the events described, to fashion designer Oleg Cassini's original sketches for Mrs. Kennedy's clothes. For Jackie devotees, the book is a bonanza, with many photos showing her in her full splendour as First Lady; one 1954 photo of her lighting the candles on her dinner table may be the single most beautiful ever taken of her. I have one small, gentle caveat: Verdon's recipes have been given before, in different form, in his 1967 &quot;The White House Chef Cookbook&quot;. The versions of the recipes in this new book have been changed a bit from the 1967 incarnations, mainly with an eye to increasing the strength of flavour; today's palates are evidently more demanding than those of the Sixties. Still, you're getting a look at the Kennedy White House from the people who made it HAPPEN- no gossip, no hearsay, no errors of research. Baldrige and Verdon were indisputably THERE, and you could do much worse than to buy their book. Come to think of it, if you've been reading some of the other Kennedy books issued recently, you have."},{"Title":"In the Kennedy Style: Magical Evenings in the Kennedy White House","review":"True to her impeccable style, manners maven Letitia Baldridge gives us a glimpse inside what was surely the most magical White House of the 20th Century.And while it is a delight to peruse, this tome only hints at the style and panache of a woman who was -- and is -- without peer in style and manners: First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who appreciates how dignified a lady was Jacqueline Kennedy, to everyone who remembers the cache' that surrounded the Kennedy White House, and to all who would like to be transported -- however briefly -- to a time which was at once more simple and more elegant than today."},{"Title":"In the Kennedy Style: Magical Evenings in the Kennedy White House","review":"Anyone interested in Jacqueline's clothing, hairstyles, etc will love this book.

Rene Verdon and Letitia Baldridge show that they have not lost their touch and guide us through a host of beautiful occasions. My personal highlight is the famous state dinner at Mount Vernon. We find out many intriguing details about entertaining at the highest level and are able to take a little of the glamour to our own table.

Tish Baldrige's book lays out the effort to update The White House for two young, modern parents who inhabited it. She also makes a case for the art of entertaining--a dying or even lost art--and makes me want to throw a dinner party. The Kennedy's lived like royality, it's true. I don't know if The White House would ever get away with the extravagance and glamour today (now that we spend all our money on defense and security), but the more innocent time of the Kennedy administration was ripe for the kind of magic a handsome rancouteur and his well-bred wife could generate.

Now a reporter, Irene returns 17 years later at the request of her former best friend in a cryptic email. She arrives in Dunster to the surprise of many long time residents, as well as Luke Danner, the new proprietor of the rental cabins. He follows her to her meeting with Pamela where they make the grisly discovery of her body, dead of an apparent overdose.Irene never believes that Pamela took her own life, despite being advised by Pamela's father that she was clinically depressed and on medication. Senator Webb is making a run for the White House, and the last thing he needs is an investigation into his daughter's apparent suicide. She and Luke join forces to investigate the circumstances surrounding Pamela's email and come across a mysterious key hidden in her room just before the house goes up in flames. But what does the key open? Could Pamela's death be related to her parents' deaths?More bodies pile up, lots of red herrings get tossed around, the intrepid couple falls into bed, and Luke's brother Jason utters the annoying \\"Boy howdy\\" far too many times to be endearing. But Krentz manages to make the best of the material, and come up with an unlikely bad guy. The funniest scene in the book is the intervention by his well meaning family, and Irene's assurance that he does not suffer from erectile dysfunction."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"This was the first book I've read from Jayne Ann Krentz after being given a copy by a friend who urged (read threatened) me to read it. While this type of thriller usually isn't quite my cup of tea I founf myself getting into the characters much more that I would have ever imagined. Characterization is certainly one of Krentz's great strengths as a writer. The story concerns Irene Stenson's whose parents were killed 17 years earlier in what was ruled to be a murder-suicide. Irene left the town of Dunsley but a message from her best friend who still lives there, sends Irene back home for the first time in years.But when Irene goes to meet Pamela she finds her dead in what is again ruled a suicide. Irene, now a journalist puts her investigative skills to use, determined to prove that both Pamela and her parents deaths were linked and to find out who did it. She gets little help in the small town except from Luke, the man who owns the lodge where Irene is staying. Furthermore, Pamela's father was an important Senator who may run for President and who Pamela discovers has some secrets of his own.It's romance is predictable but the books is fairly well paced and plotted and as mentioned before the chracters and dialog are what really puts this book over the top with me."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"This book was a joy to read, the dialogue was absolutely fabulous. Can't wait until her next book comes out.SC"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I really, really, enjoyed this book. I can't think of two characters I've read in a romance novel in a long time that were so likeable and well-suited. The book had a great love story, good suspence and was very funny in places. I simply didn't want it to end!Irene Stenson and Luke Danner are a perfect match. They just really 'get' each other in a way that is very rare and romantic. Irene's parents were murdered when she was 15 and she has struggled to be seen as normal ever since. Luke's mother committed suicide when he was 6 and he left the Marines six months ago. Searching for peace and quiet, Luke opened a lodge in Irene's hometown, which she has not visited for 17 years. The pair meet when Irene briefly returns home to meet up with an old friend. Needless to say, the suspence and romance kick off almost immediately as Luke and Irene work together to solve a murder case and find themselves falling in love. Both Irene and Luke are very believable characters, and their actions are solidly based on their pasts and personalities.I really appreciated the humour in this book. Most of it is created by the fact that Luke treats the paying guests at his lodge like they are army recruits. There is also a lot of fun banter exchanged between Luke and Irene, which makes the book a joy to read. I really liked the fact that Luke treats Irene with respect right from their first meeting, and there are no 'big misunderstandings' or unnecessary rudeness between the two lead characters.The only off-key note in the book is the inclusion of a sub-plot about Luke's family, who have mistakenly assumed that he has post-traumatic stress disorder. I found this sub-plot quite baffling because I couldn't understand why his family had assumed that Luke had certain problems (which I won't give away here) based on the fact that he ended a short engagement with a woman he didn't love shortly after leaving the Marines.Overall, this is a great novel and I've already re-read it several times. There is no silliness or eye-rolling stupidity in this book, which makes a refreshing change from some of the romance I've read recently. Instead, the novel is down to each and very realistic. The ending made me cry - the words that Luke says to Irene are simply beautiful :-)I hope you enjoy this one as much as I did!"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I seem to be the Odd Man Out in my review, but I thought the reading was fine, and I tend to be pretty critical about the audiobooks I will listen too.

The police said it was a murder/suicide, but Irene knows how much love there was in her home and she must deal with their deaths and the fact she found them. Now an old friend from 17 yrs ago has e-mailed Irene, wanting to see her and tell her something about what happened 17 years ago. Irene has fought Post Tramatic Stress for along time now. She has been told she needs closure to this tragedy. Now she hopes Pamela can cast some light on the darkness in her life.Luke owns a lodge, but he is far from a regular lodge owner. Since he left the Marines he has a lot of military input into how the lodge is run. Mostly he just wants to be left alone. Facing the horror of his yrs in the Marines and the things he did for his country have left him with his own post tramatic stress syndrome. The need to escape his loveing family is also paramount.The difference being he has a supportive family, and Irene has no one. However, once they find the dead body of Irene's friend they also find alot of similarities in each other. While Irene is determined to find the connection between Pamela's death and her parents, Luke is determined to keep the fiesty lady out of trouble. As the police try to pass Pamela's death off as a suicide, Luke begins to believe his Irene is not far off in her ideas. It seems a local Senator running for President is the father of Irene's friend. If it smells like a cover-up and walks like a cover-up, it probably is a cover-up.The tension between Luke and Irene is priceless, the wit and snipeing is delicious, and the romance is a battle of immovable objects. I loved it. Only Krentz can give us such full characters that we fall in love with them ourselves. Don't miss this one. You don't want it to end."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"All Night Long is everything you hope for when you pick up a book by JAK. The primary characters were warm and well-rounded, the mystery was covered thoroughly with a surprise ending, the romance developed gradually and realistically, and the ambience was great, as always.It was worth the hardcover price."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"With apologies to the author and her fans, of which I happen to be one. If Amazon provided a way to review audio books separately from the paper kind, I'd rate this CD a grudging \\"1.\\" The 2 is based on the safe assumption than the book itself would have rated at least a 4.I devour audio books in the car, and this is the first one I've ever ejected (and rejected) without making it to the third chapter.Kathy Garver's little-girl voice makes it hard to envision the heroine as an adult. She'd be fine narrating audio books for very young children, but for a suspense novel, she's simply laughable.I would probably have grown accustomed to Garver's delivery and kept listening, if the male lead had sounded remotely professional, and if the director/producer hadn't disrupted the flow of the narrative with a ham-handed attempt at having one actor interrupt the other to insert his lines.This was so unlistenable, I can only assume that somebody's friends or relatives were in need of acting jobs. Fine for them, but I'm out 30+ bucks.If you enjoy audio books, do yourself and Jayne Ann Krentz a favor: stick to the paper version of \\"All Night Long.\\" If you happen to know Jayne Ann Krentz, please beg her to insist on appropriate actors - and a producer with experience in romantic suspense narration - the next time one of her books is recorded on CD."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson would rather not have come back to her childhood town of Dunsley; the place where her nightmares began. As a young teenager she had been out with her best friend Pamela Webb, beyond her curfew and once home discovered both her parents dead in what appeared to be a murder suicide. It's seventeen years later, Irene has become a journalist, and a cryptic note from Pamela Webb who she hadn't heard from since that fateful night convinces Irene to return. Before Irene has a chance to meet with her, Pamela ends up dead; another apparent suicide. Irene intuitively feels that the sheriff is making quick assumptions and the facts just aren't adding up. With the help of a very sexy inn-keeper, Luke Danner an ex-marine, they begin uncovering more and more details of suicides and accidents that look like a huge cover-up. When Irene starts her investigation and her accidents start being a bit too coincidental Luke and Irene discover some secrets are too deadly to keep.*** Ms. Krentz is a brilliant strategist when it comes to weaving heart stopping danger and highly charged sexual tension into her immensely popular and highly sought after novels. In this extremely well done audio production, not only was the writing superb, but the fabulous audio performances by Kathy Garver and David Colacci only added to the intense enjoyment and overall entertainment of bringing this book alive.Krentz gave Irene just the right amount of emotional baggage from surviving the trauma of having discovered the bodies of her parents as a young terrified teenager. She went on to describe how Irene after surviving the shock began to wonder how her loving father would have ever been able to kill her mother when she knew how devoted they were to one another. It didn't make sense, but when grownups tell a traumatized child something, they tend to believe that to be the truth. But there always was a doubt and consequently, Irene wanted the truth and was willing to brave her nightmares to return to the so-called scene of the crime, especially when she thought Pamela was going to shed some light on what had really happened all those years ago.The romance that Krentz developed between Irene and Luke, was again, classic with both leads having their own demons to fight and letting a sensual romance flourish to help lighten each other's loads. While the suspense was on-going during Irene and Luke's investigation, the sexual chemistry along with some very light-hearted and witty repartee moments gave pause to chuckle now and then which at times was a heady relief.Bottom line is ALL NIGHT LONG has all the elements of a winning novel, suspense, intrigue, hot sex, along with a terrific plot and great twists at the end. I loved it!Marilyn Rondeau, for [...]"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson was only fifteen when fate changed her life forever.

I would give this 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Haven't read Krentz for a while but remembered I always like her books.This was a 17 year old mystery to be solved by the heroine Pamela with the help of Luke, an ex Marine with a story to tell. These two were so entertaining I just loved the repartee. Luke's responses to Pam's jibes were excellent and entertaining. I sort of got the answer rather quickly to this mystery but it came as a shock anyway.Each chapter had a ending to make you continue to solve this mystery. Luke's brother was a howl and the book kept up a fast pace. All the loose ends were tied up at the end. Good read."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I feel like a heel after reading all the great reviews for the book. JAK is one of my FAV authors - I owe every one of her titles except the Eclipse Bay collection. Unfortunately, a few chapters into \\"All Night long,\\" I was certain I had read this before - even though it's a new release. And, in effect, I have.This book is a combination of JAK's \\"Absolutely, Positively\\" (hero's perceived problems with intimacy and family intervention); Dee Davis' \\"Dark of the Night\\" (for the political family with secrets angle); and Chapman's \\"Seductive Imposter\\" (for the tragic murder-suicide that divided a small-town family and the details on the inner workings of a small town).Maybe I just read too much, but to me, this effort wasn't nearly up to par with JAK's past work. Last year's \\"Falling Awake\\" was phenomenol. It was unique, thrilling and kept me turning pages until the wee hours - and until I was finished. With \\"All Night Long,\\" I had to force myself to turn the pages.The killer's ID was a surprise, and yet it wasn't. Irene and Luke are fallible characters that you can't help but want to know more about. As a former long-time journalist, Irene's character seems to know a lot more about investigative reporting than a typical small-town newspaper reporter, BUT you have to remember that she's had years to think over the scenarios, the connections and she has a burning in her soul to know the truth. That would make any person more adept at asking the tough questions. JAK never really told us about Luke's Marine background; the intimacy issues were the only things that had detail - that and the fact that he wasn't into the family wine biz. And one annoying detail - his seemingly intelligent family is led around my the nose by a psychologist who is determined to prove Luke has PTSD. I think it would have given more credence to the family's concern for Luke had JAK added a graph or two about what he saw - maybe through a nightmare that he awakens from and talks about with Irene.\\"All Night Long\\" is well-crafted novel that is a pinch of this book and a dash of that book, but it doesn't have its own identity. For that reason alone, it's not a \\"full-price\\" buy.But if you like JAK like I do, it's a given that you'll want this book for your shelf. But you might want to purchase a used or on-sale copy. Or wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I have enjoyed Jayne's older novels like \\"Wildest Hearts\\" and \\"Trust Me,\\" but her more recent books have been plot driven without likeable characters. I especially don't recommend spending $25.00 for a hardback. Wait for the paperback or better yet, check it out of your local library. I already donated my copy."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer... Is that logical at all?? The senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father? If he had the senator when he was twenty he'd have to be 77. Is it really reasonable that he's running around killing people, and setting houses on fire. It was a very unlikely twist to the end. It still was a good book."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"This book reminds me of the old JAK. It was funny in places and heart tugging in others. I loved it and hope she will continue writing in this way."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Very enjoyable book! All Jayne Ann Krentz books seem to follow a similar formula so there weren't really any surprises but it's a good read. I happen to really like her formula. :)The hero is Luke, a former marine who bought an inn and is now trying to run it like a barracks. His lack of hospitality and annoyance at those pesky guests made for a lot of terrific lines but I was asking myself just *why* he bought the place (you know, aside from the obvious - it's a great source of humor). I was pleased to see JAK gives us a perfectly reasonable answer about halfway through the book.Irene is the leading lady. She has returned to the town where she grew up for the first time since she found her parents dead as a teen. She got an email from an old friend frantically asking her to come see her. She arrives to find the friend dead. And so begins the mystery..."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I've been a fan of JAK for a long time and am really thrilled that her latest fully showcased her writing talent. I won't go into synopsis because it has been mentioned many times over. Instead, I will tell you that this book is fast paced, the mystery plot believable and made sense, and it has all the classic JAK formula: strong chemistry between hero/heroine, witty dialogues, strong family love, many hillarious scenes, and strong character development. I enjoyed this book tremendously."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I rarely buy hardbacks for several reasons. Too expensive, too hard to read while lying in bed, don't fit in my purse to take with me in the car, etc. However, there are 2 or 3, maybe 4, authors whose books I will buy in HB for the simple reason that I enjoy their work and don't want to wait for the paperback version. Krentz is one of those. Along with Nora Roberts, Mary Balogh and, sometimes, Teresa Medeiros.A big plus for me is I got this one with a Christmas gift certificate and it came right away. Love Amazon.com!Parts of the story reminded me of the older Seattle books that I love so much. Us against the family sort of thing. But the dialogue sparkles. The plot is good even tho the villain is pretty much identified ahead of time. No problem. The other villain is an ick and deserves whatever happens to him. The subject of his \\"little problem\\" was handled very tastefully. It could have been really gross and a turn off.Irene and Luke are a perfect pair. Luke's approach to being an inn keeper is cute (ncluding requiring guests to furnish their own toilet paper!) I like that he and Irene just accept each other without all the angst that I sometimes find annoying romance novels. They understand each other. The ED thing his family thinks is one of his problems is sort of funny but not belabored. One thing Krentz never does is write down to her readers. She just assumes we get it. Bless her heart. I hate having the h/h's reasons for whatever they are doing/feeling pointed out to me on every other page.BTW, In the review from Publisher's Weekly by an anonymous reviewer, he/she got the name of the town wrong and wondered if it was a nod to an Amanda Quick character. Uh. No. The town is named Dunsley. Not Dunster as the reviewer thought. I'm not even sure the town is in Napa Vallley. Luke's family's vineyard is, but... Makes me wonder if that person actually read the book. Oh well.I also bless JAK that she doesn't write a sex manual for us just to fill in a few pages. I think we all know what part goes where and how. We don't need whole chapters describing every loving/lusting detail. I like to use my imagination, frankly. I do have one.So, hooray for JAK. She's come through again for us, her devoted readers."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"A wonderful, easy read - typical of Krentz. Even after writing so many books, she's come up with a unique plot & ingenious twists. How DOES she do it?! I would have rated it 5 stars, but this one didn't grab me right from the start. Although the mystery begins on page 1, it was a little slow to build my interest. Nevertheless, once it got going, the pacing was well done, the main characters were delineated pretty well, (although I found the subordinate characters more interesting & recognizable), and the physical environs depicted just well enough to create the proper atmosphere for suspense. Jayne Ann Krentz doesn't disappoint, and I look forward to her next book."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Lust at first sight.

Quirky female in a couple of conversations with male's family tells them their crazy. In the end all family realizes they were wrong and stop worrying about the prodigal son.

I know there are folks who devour this stuff, but I can't imagine why if this book is representing the field. I read several positive reviews and they all appeared to be written by fans of the genre as well as the author, but as a work of actual literature I am stunned that this is what America reads, though I have never considered myself a literary snob. It doesn't seem to require much in the way of thinking to get through this stuff and if I want to suspend brain activity I'll read US Weekly or watch a Lifetime movie.The characters are formulaic, the twists were so predictable they may as well have been straight lines, and I had the bulk of it figured out early on as the author drops \\"hints\\" as if they were anvils.It was unfortunate that I chose to listen to the audiobook as the female reader was just awful. The male reader was fine, I totally bought him as a Marine, and even as the other characters, but every female voice was overworked, especially Irene's editor Adeline.So I give it 2.5 stars because I guess I enjoyed it well enough as a diversion during my commute, but I think I'll stick to the classics...listening to someone read sex scenes is positively painful!

Devastated, Irene left the small California town of Dunsley and did not return. Now a reporter, Irene receives an urgent e-mail from Pamela asking her to return because there are secrets that need to be revealed. When Irene does, she finds Pamela dead, an apparent suicide.Ex-marine Luke Danner is trying his hand at inn-keeping in Dunsley. Sensing trouble and highly intrigued by Irene, Luke follows her the night she discovers Pamela's body. Irene is certain it's murder, and as Luke starts to connect the dots, he's inclined to agree. But with Pamela's senator father trying to close down the investigation, revealing the truth could be dangerous business.I really enjoyed Luke's character because he doesn't take any bs from anybody. He is what you see is what you get. Both he and Irene suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder which made their characters more complex and interesting. Both were very honest and straight-forward in their relationship with each other. That was different. I was I like you, you like me, let's go to bed together.

It's irresistible - after one sip you down it. Or, in the case of All Night Long read it from cover to cover.Set in Dunsley, a small northern California town bordering a lake, Krentz's latest romantic suspense novel loses no time in painting a chilling scene. The Prologue is related in flashback as Irene Stenson remembers a summer some 17 years ago. She had been out with her best friend, wealthy and privileged Pamela Webb. Things didn't seem right when she arrived home. The porch light was off - her parents never left the house dark when she was out. Hoping to avoid recrimination for her tardiness she went around to the back door, thinking she could sneak into her bedroom. However, she couldn't open the door, something heavy seemed to be blocking it from inside. She pushed. Her screams were \\"high, desperate, frantic cries of grief, horror and denial\\" when she saw the bloody scene on the kitchen floor.The deaths of her parents was determined to be a murder-suicide, and teenaged Irene left Dunsley forever. In the intervening years she has been haunted by the dark, unable to sleep unless the room is well lit, terrified of night places.Now, some 17 years later she has received an email from her friend, Pamela, pleading with her to come back. What could possibly be so important that Pamela has to see her after all this time? It seems that question will remain unanswered as Pamela is found dead, pills and booze by her side. Her body is found in the home of her father, Ryland Webb, a U.S. Senator who has a new young wife and a sure shot for the presidency. Pamela's death is declared a suicide.Irene doesn't believe that any more than she believes that her parents' deaths were a murder/suicide. Where can she turn? The townspeople are determined to consider her \\"not right\\" after the shock of finding her parents - she could surely use a friend and she finds him in an unlikely place.Luke Danner, a former Marine, now owns Sunrise on the Lake Lodge, the string of cabins where Irene is staying. He's gruff, used to barking orders, yet very attractive. He's everything a Krentz hero is - honorable, brave, strong. Yet, he has some problems of his own. Of course, there's chemistry between the two that develops intriguingly.While Irene had intended to put Dunsley in her rear view mirror as quickly as possible, she knows that she must find the truth that has been hidden for so many years and why keeping it secret is so vital to the present.One more exciting read from the indefatigable Jayne Ann Krentz.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"At the tender age of fifteen, Irene Stenson's world changed over night. Irene's summer night had been spent with her friend, Pamela Webb, who is U.S. Senator Ryland Webb's wild daughter. Pamela dropped Irene off on that fateful night. Irene entered her dark house to find her parents' bodies in the kitchen. It was labeled a murder-suicide and the case was quickly closed. Irene left the town of Dunsley with a relative, hoping never to return. She could never bring herself to believe that her father, Dunsley's Chief of Police, would murder his wife and then turn the gun upon himself.It is a little over fifteen years later that Irene is contacted by Pamela via email. Irene is now a reporter for the Glaston Cove Beacon, a small town newspaper. The email message is coded and sounds desperate. Pamela insists that they meet in Dunsley and that the night Irene's parents died is involved. Like it or not, Irene must face the house of blood and darkness that has haunted her dreams for years.Luke Danner may be out of the Corps, but his mind set is still that of a Marine. Luke saw too much during the last two years of duty and his family fears for Luke's sanity. To get away from everyone and think in solitude, Luke purchased the lodge cabins near the lake in Dunsley and rents them out. There is not much business during this time of year, but he has one tenant, Irene Stenson. To Luke, information and clues are like dots; and he enjoys connecting dots. One thing is for sure, the lady in cabin number five has a lot of dots around her. Being the Marine that he is, Luke barrels his way into her problems and begins connecting some seriously dangerous dots. Luke is with her when Irene finds Pamela's body. It looks like she overdosed on booze and pills, but those dots just do not connect. They connect even less so when Pamela's house is torched shortly afterward. No one in town in talking either. Irene may be from an old town family, but everyone in town is too scared of Senator Webb. Irene and Luke are on their own!**** There is not enough focus on the two main characters. Even though the author supposedly still writes Contemporary Suspense, she seems to be leaving it for regular fictional stories, much to her fans' disappointments. This story is very good. The plot is sound. However, I did not REALLY come to care for Luke or Irene until a humorous family intervention breakfast, well past the half way point of the novel. From there on, the two main characters clicked beautifully! There are two other ex-Marines in the story. One is in town, the other is a corporate investigator. I have high hopes that Ken Tanaka, the investigator, will get his own story told in a future novel. All-in-all, this is not as good as her older tales, but it is a very good story that will please Krentz's fans. Recommended. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson was only fifteen when fate changed her life forever.

The story's a bit contrived - how many people do you really know whose parents died in what was an appearant murder suicide. And then comes the e-mail from Pamela telling her to come home. And of course there's the altogether predictable romance developing with the host at the hotel where's she's staying. In summary, a great book. The only real problem is that you're likely to stay up 'All Night Long' getting through it.Ms. Krentz has written some 42 books under various pen names (Amanda Quick, Jayne Castle). The surprising is that even with that many books her novels do not turn out to be formulaic. To be sure there are the standard themes that he likes: romantic relationship, family, the classic heroic virtues like honor, determination and love.Is this a classic book that like Shakespeare will be around in three hundred years, NO. Is it a good addition to this year's reading, YES."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I read this book in one sitting and it's wonderful. The two main characters are classic Krentz. Luke is an ex-Marine (oops, FORMER Marine), who's convinced that everything will be fine if everyone just does things his way. Irene, the heroine, isn't at all interested in following Luke's rules. They drive each other nuts, of course, all the while dealing with a murder, a 20 year-old mystery, and their sexual tension.Lots of laughs, lots of romance and some very, very intense suspense. LOVED it."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"In the small Northern California town of Dunsley, Irene Stenson missed curfew because her best friend Pamela Webb deliberately kept her out late. When she finally arrives home she sees the murdered bodies of her parents on the kitchen floor. Their deaths were deemed murder-suicide and Irene left town and never returned or spoke to Pamela.Seventeen years later, Pamela e-mails Irene asking her to come back to Dunsley because she has something important to tell her. She checks in at the Sunrise on the Lake Lodge and is immediately attracted to the owner Luke Danner who finds himself very interested in his boarder. When Irene arrives at Pamela's house, she finds her former friend dead, a bottle of empty pills and liquor near the body. The sheriff rules it a suicide but from the urgency of Pamela's message Irene thinks she was murdered. As a reporter she starts her own investigation because she believes there is a link between her parents' deaths and Pamela's demise. Luke helps her and saves her life quite a few times because it is obvious someone is willing to kill to keep Pamela's secret hidden.A Jayne Ann Krentz novel is always a joy too read and ALL NIGHT LONG is no exception. The protagonists are drawn true to life and are not as quirky as Ms. Krentz's characters usually are but that is because they are dealing with dark, troubling and dangerous situations and emotions. The mystery is very complex and filled with red herrings and unusual twists and turns. There is a secondary character, one of Luke's brothers, who deserves his own story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I bought this book last night and finished it this morning. It was different from some of the JAK books because there is no paranormal element, but rather the two main characters more or less were dealing with post traumatic stress syndrome, one from being a marine in wartime and the other from finding her parents murdered. The book was JAK at her best, funny and touching. Her banter and repartee are at their finest.One thing that hits me as I'm writing the review is how I wasn't bothered by some of the subject matter that the book dealt with as I am with other romance writers. Perhaps that's due to the fact that it wasn't revealed until the end or just that JAK handles it more sublimely than other authors. She's not all gore and prurience for the sake of gore and prurience. Thanks for that, JAK!"},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Irene Stenson's parents died 17 years ago. It was always believed to be a murder-suicide. Irene gets called back to Dunsley by her one-time best friend Pamela Webb. Irene is anxious to hear what Pamela has to say and get out of town. Instead she discovers Pamela's body. Local residents say she had problems but Irene suspects more. Pamela's father Ryland Webb wants to put the tragedy behind him and continue his run for the White House. Irene pursues the case all the way back to her parents' old house, with the help of former marine Luke Danner. Luke and Irene both have their buried troubles however their attraction to one another is great. The dialogue weakens a tiny bit every time his brother says \\"Boy, Howdy\\" as his constant refrain. However, it is a good mystery with a convincing romance and an intriguing twist in the end."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"The best thing about this book is Luke Danner. He's ex-Marine, politely refused employment in the family's winery and instead runs a \`lodge' in Dunsley, California. He doesn't really like the paying guests (some of the scenarios are hilarious), and has a list of rules as long as your arm. Basil Fawlty, move over! His family's annoyingly persistent shrink thinks he's got PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), EDD (erectile dysfunction disorder), plus a few other disorders tossed in for good measure! His concerned father and stepmother's attempts to get him into therapy are unsettling yet humorous, to say the least. Luke is actually working on a secret project that'll eventually settle all questions about his future.Anyway, reporter Irene Stenston returns to Dunsley - and Luke's lodge - when childhood friend Pamela, a Senator's daughter, sends her an urgent, cryptic email about the past. Irene's parents supposedly died in a murder-suicide, but Pamela hints at knowing more about what Irene considers her parents' unsolved murders. Unfortunately Irene and Luke (who curiously and coolly invites himself along for the ride - typical JAK hero!) find Pamela dead of an apparent OD. Not believing Pamela would kill herself, any more than her police chief father would shoot her mother and then himself, Irene sets out on a dangerous trail of clues leading to a seething, nasty underbelly of crime! Luke refuses to leave Irene alone, and so lends her some very nice muscle and brains as the scenario spirals dangerously out of control. He also proves beyond any doubt he does not have EDD, to Irene's bone-melting satisfaction. JAK is the mistress of dead bodies, dark mystery and deep romance. You'll cheer for Irene as she champions Luke to his family - and do watch for the scene where she disclaims the EDD in public, to Luke's horror! Very funny. You'll hold your breath as they tackle what must surely be one of the most twisted villains ever. And, what's even better, Luke has two very interesting brothers... Sequels, we dare hope?\`You were asking about room service, for Pete's sake.' He opened the door and surveyed the brightly lit main room of the little cabin. \`We don't go in for that sort of thing. But we do have the morning coffee and doughnuts. Assuming we've got guests, that is. Which, thanks to you, we happen to have at the moment.'\`Sorry to be such an imposition.'\`Yeah, well, guests happen in this business,' he observed somewhat dourly."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"Finally, a good old fashion romantic suspense.

I found myself picking it up even when I only had a few minutes to read, which is a very good sign that it kept me interested. I also found myself changing my mind about it while reading... There is a cat that JAK lets out of the bag a little early in the book, and I originally thought that was a mistake. However, that cat turns out to be a dog (you get my metaphor here, right?), so instead of a disappointing plot slip you find you've fallen victim to a very good red herring. Never would I have guessed the real reason for Pamela's death. And there's just the right amount of romance mixed in with the suspense as Luke and Irene find some stress relief in each other. The epilogue is a little too sappy for my tastes, but I guess she wanted to make sure everyone gets their happily ever after."},{"Title":"All Night Long","review":"I liked the book but loved the audio version of this Krentz novel.

It is the development of a romantic relationship set within a murder mystery with some added suspense and a generous use of humor. I loved Luke's character. Many of his lines were gems. He was a gruff retired marine who bought a third-rate motel, which I will call the \\"Lodge.\\" He intimidates and yells at paying customers as if they were marine recruits, as he informs them of motel rules and enforces the rules. He also puts out the \\"no vacancy\\" sign when he does not want to be disturbed. Irene, his love interest heroine, also has some good lines. This book was full of wonderfully creative dialogue. The characters and conversations caused me to laugh out loud many times. It is dry wit. I will quote a couple of examples here, but I fear they may not be as funny to the reader of this review, since the reader does not have the full flavor of the characters and the context for the lines. But, I'm hoping to provide a glimpse of the type of humor. On page 46, Luke's assistant Maxine complained that Luke did not put out donuts in the morning since the Lodge had a guest. Maxine said \\"All of the better-class hotels and inns do it.\\" Luke said \\"I like to think that the Lodge is in a class by itself.\\" On page 87, he has one guest Irene staying at the Lodge. As Irene is driving away, he runs to the drive and stops in front of her car, forcing her to stop. He says \\"Where are you headed?\\" She says \\"You know, I've stayed in a wide variety of lodging establishments in my life, but this is the first time I've had to account for my comings and goings to the proprietor.\\" He said \\"We do things a little differently here at the Lodge.\\" His motive for this, of couse, is that he's interested in her, attracted to her and concerned for her safety. I love this kind of writing.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: two. Setting: current day small town of Dunsley, in northern California.

This book may be out of print, but there are many other resources available on the art of monogramming, and I highly recommend obtaining one or more. This particular book is the one that I turn to repeatedly when searching for inspiration and instruction. Any lover of embroidery would benefit from a working knowledge of this useful decorative art. Monogrammed table linens, handkerchiefs, towels, bedlinens and clothing all make wonderful and treasured gifts.The only real fault that I find with this book is that it does not name the alphabets or provide one with descriptions of their origin, which would have been useful."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century.Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance which burned brightly when the protagonists were younger and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen (if these people were real) afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice, how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and in Persuasion, how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own disfunctional family?) No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique is her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this &quot;critique of the family&quot; more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines. She is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.We know by reading any of Jane Austen's books of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows: &quot;(Anne and Captain Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.&quot;Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be - intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read - it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I like Jane Austen, but this is a very special book, even for her.When I was widowed a few years ago, I read Persuasion. Lots or people here love this book, but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on. We live in a youth-oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young, the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness; this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness. Persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life. You can start again, and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around, when you were young and didn't know what life was about. I know some people prefer the dashing heroes in Austen's other books, but Anne and Captain Wentworth are much closer to who most of us are. We are not flashy or rich; we don't always have supportive families; our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they've looked in our hearts. Love will not bring us land or access to the powerful, and it won't make our families act more kindly to us. But what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life- death, sickness, insensitive people.While women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early 19th century, they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages, the value of maturity, how having 'baggage' can be a sign that one has been places and seen things, and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense. Most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man. Because most women and men don't value these concepts, Persuasion is not ranked as highly as Austen's more exciting earlier novels. Still, if I could only take one book with me to a desert island, this would probably be the one."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"When I saw that this was the preferred edition for kindle I presumed that the text would be organised in a way to fit the kindle comfortably. Instead I found that the text does not uniformly fill the page. It is written as a full line follwed by a half line. I had to increase the font size in order to make it slightly less annoying. One thing it taught me is to ALWAYS download the sample chapter first before purchasing and don't presume that 'kindle preferred' means you'll be getting the best one for the kindle. Of course the book itself is brilliant."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion was Austen's last completed novel before her death and was written whilst the novelist was dying, which may explain its shorter length when compared to her other novels. Although briefer in the telling, it lacks none of the hallmarks of Austen's style including the omniscient ironic (and sometimes in this work cynical) narrative voice and her witty yet extraordinarily subtle comments on her societies approach to women and the social hierarchy. The action of this novel centers on the character of Anne Elliot who under the influence of a close family friend, Lady Russell is persuaded to reject the advances of Wentworth. The main body of the plot takes place eight years after this rejection; Wentworth is now known as Captain Wentworth and has made his fortune through the collection of enemy booty in the Napoleonic Wars. Now with England in peace he has returned ashore seemingly having forgotten Anne and his rejection and ready to take a wife.As the romance unfolds the novel covers a number of themes, for instance the idea of being \`persuadable' per se. Initially the notion that Anne allowed herself to be won over by Lady Russell's influence is seen as a fault, however as the story progresses the sub plot involving the character of Louisa Musgrove shows that rather than being a fault, Anne listening to Lady Russell's advice shows that she is susceptible to reason and practicality. Seemingly the error occurred rather in Lady Russell's judgment of Wentworth than in Anne's decision to follow her advice.Lady Russell's preference for Mr Elliot Jnr as a more suitable marriage partner for Anne over Wentworth seems to be based solely on the class distinction that divides these two men. This class based prejudice by Lady Russell may be regarded as a critical reflection upon Austen's society which closely associated (and often without valid cause) moral virtue and class status, the assumption being that the higher your class, the better your moral decency. The reader discovers the error of Lady Russell in relying on such a system of character judgement as it produces such corrupt results.Possibly the greatest achievement of this work is the very quiet proto-feminist message that Austen manages to slip into one of the closing chapters. Every the ironist, Austen has the meek Anne Elliot, who seemingly conforms to all of societies rules about what a women \`ought to be' speak out against the confining nature of a woman's expected place in society. When discussing the fate of love affairs between men and women, Anne argues that it is easier for men to forget as women \\"live at home, quiet, confined...You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change.\\" Anne then goes on to turn on its head Captain Harville's ideas that the supposedly stronger and more robust figure and mind of man is better capable for love than that of the mind of women.Austen's novels are never innocent of the issues which affected their period and this is yet another example as Austen deftly and subtly critiques gender roles, social class and the notion of \`appearances.' In its whole, this is a great book, perhaps the fact that it was written by an older and dying Austen may explain the nostalgic tone of decline or sadness that seems to pervade it. It is well worth the money you would spend to buy it and the time you would take to read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I've hated the fact that Persuasion isn't one of Jane Austen's most famous works ever since I read it. It is truly a beautiful love story, and it is written perfectly (as only Jane Austen could do).The story is about Anne Eliot, one of Austen's most likeable characters. Seven years before the novel begins, Anne had been persuaded out of a marriage to Frederick Wentworth. Neither Anne nor Captain Wentworth, had been persuaded out of love, though. Both have basically wasted the last seven years. Fortunately for the couple, circumstances arise which through them back together, and the two have to attempt to build a new relationship and deal with there own actions from years before.Persuasion is possibly Austen's greatest love story. It is much less satirical than here other novels. Anne is also a much more sympathetic character than say Emma. The novel is, of course, in Austen's incomparable style. Any romantic or lover of great literature would adore this beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This story is heart-wrenchingly agonising. This is a good thing! Never have I been so moved by a love story. When Anne and Captain Wentworth finally overcome their own guardedness and the pressures of society and re-declare their love for each other...... It is the most wonderful scene ever written. I have never read a more wonderful love story. I think this to be the most romantic of Jane Austen's novels. The mercenary marriage market Jane Austen ridicules in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is portrayed in a darker and more destructive light in &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Two lovers torn apart by a society fixated on class, wealth and position, only able to find happiness together once this obstacle has been overcome, but in the mean time..... OH THE HEART ACHE!!!!! I recommend this one for a rainy day when one can lie in bed, or sit in the favourite arm-chair, and wallow in the brilliance of this timeless and heart stirring romance. Don't forget your tissues!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel because of Jane Austen's lyrical prose, her timeless subjects of family relationships, love (and/or the search for it), her heartwarmingly drawn characters that I think any reader anywhere and at any time can relate to easily, and her usual witty and critical social commentary. I find it amazing to think that she wrote this novel nearly 200 years ago! I can think of several people in my own family and among friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who match her descriptions of Anne Elliot, her father and sisters Walter and Elizabeth Elliot and Mary Musgrove, Lady Russell, Captain Wentworth, etc. Times and mores may have changed in 200 years, but human nature has not changed! Reading her descriptions of these characters and well imagining Anne's reaction to them, whether it is with resignation, amusement, or exasperation mirror my own thoughts on them.Austen has created a wonderful character in Anne Elliot. I found that I liked her more and more as I read the novel, and, had she been real, would liked to have had her as a sister, friend, or relative. She is such a wonderful character because readers have a chance to see how she has grown up, has changed, and is willing to go for what she wants now that she is older and wiser (much like anyone else).The story is not like Austen's other novels (Pride and Prejudice, Emma) because it deals with the issue of a true rarity in life--a second chance at love. Anne Elliot met and fell in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth, a naval officer, when she was 19 years old. Against her better judgment, she is \\"persuaded\\" by family in the form of family disapproval of her choice. Her mother is dead, her father and her elder sister Elizabeth (who have a very strange, almost-marriage-like relationship themselves) are social snobs and do not consider a mere captain in the British navy good enough to marry into their family because they are ranked above him socially. Anne's feelings, Frederick's feelings, and the possibility that he could earn a great deal of money by capturing privateers and enemy ships, or be rewarded with a title for distinguishing himself in battle does not occur to them. Anne is also strongly influenced by Lady Russell, a close family friend and a particularly close friend to Anne. Lady Russell, since the death of Anne's mother, has become a mother-figure/friend to Anne (since Anne is ignored by her father and sister Elizabeth). Lady Russell also disapproved of Anne marrying Captain Wentworth, and Anne, because she was young and easily influenced by those around her at age 19, breaks off her engagement to Captain Wentworth. She has regretted it ever since, and has not met anyone (her father and sister went out in Society, but did not take Anne with them; her younger sister Mary is married, but spends her time complaining about non-existent ailments and about all the wrongs and hurts she has suffered at the hands of family and friends to take any interest in introducing Anne to eligible young men) she would consider as a husband. Eight years pass, and, by chance, Captain Wentworth (now considerably wealthier though not titled) re-enters her life due to the temporary lull in the Napoleonic Wars. He too was very hurt by Anne's breaking off of their engagement, but, like Anne, he has not met any other women who compare to her. Both are wary of eachother--and Austen handles both their introspection and their gradual establishment of a stronger, more mature love for eachother with sensitivity and passion. I loved this story because it clearly shows an older (though still young) heroine who is offered the rarest of all things--a second chance at love with the love of her life. She is wise enough to reject the opinions of her family and Lady Russell this time, accepts the love offered, and offers her own love in return! Captain Wentworth's letter to Anne at the end of the novel is the kind of love letter every woman would cherish. Wow! What a beautiful letter! It warms your heart, touches your soul, and nourishes your spirit. The story is all the more poignant because Anne and Captain Wentworth appreciate eachother and their relationship because they know what they have and what they could have missed had they followed social conventions.For the die-hard Austen fans, there is plenty of social commentary, and I thought that Austen illustrated the snobbishness of the upper classes very well in her characterizations of Anne's father and sisters. The criteria they use to accept or reject a person are based on such things as whether the man owns property and how much, how many servants he has, title, family background, connections, and, in her father's case, physical appearance is very important. None of these things have any intrinsic value compared to whether Anne is loved and respected by Captain Wentworth, how he treats people, his ethics, morality, etc. Austen's subtle humor and way of poking fun at these values contribute to the tone of this novel.Give this novel a try. I do not think that you will be disappointed. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This is one of Jane Austen's five novels as a mature author. As with four of the other five, it follows the same formula of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \\"Emma\\" where the protagonist has her owns means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\" From a strictly literary point of view, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.So, where does that leave \\"Persuasion\\" among her novels? The present novel is good and it is generally thought of as one of her five best. It is one of her mature novels - as opposed to Northanger Abbey, an early work. It has a good story and good characters. I liked her treatment of Captain Wentworth. The description and the story about the primary character, Anne Elliot, is vintage Austen writing and story telling. But overall it does not quite reach the heights of those other two great Austen novels. Still, I rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. It is more a question of whether you like the story or not, since it follows the Austen formula. All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humor and irony.Austen wrote the novel based on contemporay life in England from approximately 1814 to 1815, in the post Napolean period, and it was published in 1816 after her other works. Overall I would rate it as excellent but not her best. It is similar to \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"and much better than her early novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in terms of literary sophistication and the characters, and it ranks behind the two novels mentioned above and \\"Emma.\\" Those three (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Mansfield Park) are her finest works.Most Austen fans will love the book, and I would recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is one of my favorite books -- and probably my favorite Austen, though I go back and forth between this and Pride and Prejudice. P&P is more sparkling and witty; Persuasion feels more mature. Definitely a book to read over and over. And the letter from Captain Wentworth to Anne(you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there!) is the best-written letter in fiction. Read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's last novel, posthumously published in 1818, is about the possibility of having a second chance for love after one's made the mistake of following advice contrary to natural inclinations. The story centers on Anne Elliot, descendant of an illustrious family from the nobility of Somerset. Her mother has died and she lives with her father, an insufferably vain and irresponsible character, who has spent most of his fortune in a stupid way. Anne also lives with her elder sister Elizabeth, another unlikable person. They treat Anne with contempt and humiliation. The youngest sister, Mary has been married to a good man with a good social position. Turns out that the Elliot's have run out of money and they must move to a more humble house in order to lease the manor. The new tenant is an Admiral Croft, married to the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth, a former boyfriend of Anne. Eight years ago, this man had proposed marriage to Anne, but he had been rejected after Anne's family, and in particular a fomer best friend of her mother's, had convinced her that she could find a much better prospect (Wentworth was by that time a beginner in the Navy and didn't have money). Anne has suffered ever since, because she really loved him and the much better prospect seems never to appear. Wentworth himself was deeply hurt by the rejection, but now he has come back from the war rich and with a promising future. The Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves (Mary's husband's family) develop a good social relationship and Captain Wentworth is frequently invited to parties and reunions.The rest of the novel is centered on Anne's feelings and her ambivalent emotions: on the one hand, she tries to be as little as possible in the company of Wentworth, but on the other she is very anxious about finding out if he still feels something for her. But Wentworth is cold and silent with her, showing respect but also letting her know how offended he feels. Mary's sister in law, Louisa Musgrove, falls for the handsome captain, and it seems like they will get married. That is, until she has an accident in the resort of Lyme, which changes the course of action.With a conventional and almost predictable plot, Austen manages nonetheless to write an acute psychological portrait, and a wonderful story. Her prose is terse and fluid, with a subdued sense of humor. Anne is a credible and likable character, always a good friend even if her relatives despise and ill-treat her and her beauty has started to fade. She is fully conscious of what a terrible mistake she made when she rejected a good, hardworking man who loved and respected her, and who is now an attractive option for many young women. Sexual tension is ever present in this world of repression and hipocrisy, and the self-affirming and independent Anne stands above the rest of the characters, as a prefiguration of the modern, self-reliant woman. One of the best by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Even though Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's lesser known novels it is very well written and also a very good story. The story is centered around the romance of Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. They had fallen in love eight years before the novel takes place, but Anne broken off their engagment after Lady Russell persuaded her that he was not a suitable match. They end up seeing each other again after Anne's family runs into money problems and Anne and Wentworth realize that their feeling for each other are renewed. Problems from their past and also their families hurt their chance of a fresh start.I thought this novel was very interesting and another one of Jane Austen's great novels."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"At the end of the day, Persuasion is worth reading because it offers a simple hope for how we can live together. Unlike, say Pride and Prejudice, where in the end the characters more collide than marry, the orbits of protagonists Anne and Captain Wentworth eventually come to revolve around each other.When I read Austen, I often wonder whether the author likes her characters. In Persuasion, it seems like the author strives to make her characters contest to find their proper standing, and neither breeding nor education (nor gender) determines the mettle of a man or woman. However, determining how we can live together, faults and all, is probably more important than the sort of personality and tribulation time trials that some of Persuasion's characters attempt to determine among themselves. More important is the comparison of the various family units, the Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves, and what a wise reader would learn from each.Make no mistake, this is no drawing room bodice ripper, of the \\"she slinked into the room scantily clad\\" variety. And its indolent upper class ever-vacationing denizens may appear quite impossible in today's society. However like occasional dessert, I found it better digested slowly, at the end of a day of intellectual toiling, rather than as a main course, or as a substitute for breakfast, lunch or dinner.I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed this as a younger person. This is apparently the author's final work, and she did not live to see it published. So it is probably the artist at the height of her craft. If she left us with anything to think of how we might all get along, this is, in my estimation, it."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"You know it's very difficult to choose which of Jane Austen's books it the greatest but I can say that this is one I re-read every couple of years. This, the last of Miss Austen's fabulous set of novels, is of the woman who was forced to give up her love and then never loved another. The heroine is more mature than those of her others books, not quite so insentive to others, nor as judgemental. Maybe the most exasperating aspect of this book is that you can see that once reunited, the two still love each other, but obey those deeply instilled lessons in behavior to the point that I find myself almost saying 'for goodness sake, just tell him you love him still'! But that wouldn't be a Jane Austen novel, for you'ld miss the ongoing narrative of families who behave even as families do today, and all of the love knots would not be tied only as neatly as this queen of the early novel could do. Oh, if only she had lived longer, but at least we still, almost 200 years later still have her masterpieces to read over and over!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I am a big fan of Jane Austen. She has so much wit and characteristics within her characters. For one, In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is apparent that a thinly disguised Jane Austen is the heroine. The romantic comedy is played fondly between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, but in this case, it is Anne Eliot and her former beau, Frederick Wentworth. Under &quot;persuasion&quot;, she is forced to lose her regard for him because of his low connections. Seven years past and he again re-enters her life when his sister and her husband rents Kellynch Hall, since Anne's father needed the money. She avoids meeting him, but when they had no choice in their accidental visits, he meets her with cold civility. He courts the rash and young Louisa Musgrove, but an unfortunate accident changes the direction of his eyes to fall upon Anne once more. As the begin a steady friendship, the ones they are involved with fall for others, and they reflect upon what they once had and have a pleasant life together. Anne might not appear as strong as most of Jane Austen's characters, but she still has the firm beliefs of the world and would not allow things such as vanity or fortune to stand in the way of her happiness."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Every person has the power to influence those around us. Although very few people hold such high positions, like the president, to sway the masses, everyone has the ability to influence their friends and family members. Moreover, anyone who is a role model, mentor, or parent has a moral obligation to take their power of influence very seriously. Under what circumstances should you try to persuade another? What happens if your arguments persuaded someone towards the wrong decision, whether intentionally or not? And on the flip side, how much should we allow others to influence us?Persuasion tackles all of these questions and explores so much more. It is a rich, thoughtful novel full of romance, social critique, and, of course, many variations on the theme of persuasion.The novel opens in 1814 with the introduction of the baronet Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall and his three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, is Sir Walter's favorite. Anne is the often overlooked middle child, and the youngest, Mary is an attention seeking hypochondriac, who also happens to be Sir Walter's only married daughter.Sir Walter is a spendthrift, and consequently, his household finances are a mess. In order to get his finances under control, he rents out Kellynch Hall and moves to Bath with Elizabeth. Anne remains behind for a few months, and lives with her sister Mary and Mary's husband, Charles Musgrove, at Uppercross. By coincidence, the tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral and Mrs. Croft, and Mrs. Croft's brother just happens to be a Captain Wentworth, a former love of Anne Elliot. Hence, under these circumstances, Anne and Captain Wentworth are brought together after eight years apart. In their past history, the two were very much in love, but Anne was persuaded to break off her engagement to Captain Wentworth, for he was deemed an unfit husband for her. When the two meet again, there is so much delicious, suspenseful tension between them that lasts throughout the entire novel.As with all of Jane Austen's novels, the language may be difficult for some readers. Just be patient, and you'll likely get used to it.I must admit that Pride and Prejudice remains my favorite Jane Austen novel, but Persuasion is nonetheless an excellent and thought-provoking novel with a simple and beautiful romance. I highly recommend it, and hope that you are persuaded to try it."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Let me just start this review with that fact that I am a HUGE Jane Austen fan. I love the language and I think it's a shame that we don't speak like that anymore. However, this is not my favorite Austen book. There is not a lot going on in this book besides the pining of Anne Elliot and while I was reading this book I kept waiting for something to happen. Although I do have to say that I LOVED the ending, which I won't go into cause I do not want to spoil anything for future readers. I do not want to discourage anyone from reading this book because Austen is great either way but for me personally this book was just a little underdeveloped in comparison to her other novels. Still a must read though for any Austen fan!!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"PERSUASION, Jane Austen's last completed novel was written between 1815 and 1816, with final chapter revisions in August of that year. Published posthumously in late 1817 with her earlier work NORTHANGER ABBEY, each of the novels represents the alpha and omega of her writing career. Even though they are divergent in tone and topic, they each share a commonality in being partially set in Bath and display Austen's trademark play on social strata, money and courtship. Austen finished the manuscript of PERSUASION in declining health which may account for its slim size in comparison to her heftier previous efforts MANSFIELD PARK (1814) and EMMA (1816). Or, quite possibly it is exactly the length that she preferred for her story, allowing for a simpler plot and focus on fewer characters. Its size in no way diminishes it value. Some scholars consider it her finest achievement and readers have long cherished it for its jab at social mobility and moving love story.In 1817 Austen wrote to her niece Fanny Austen Knight in her usual ironic manner, \\"You may perhaps like the heroine, as she is almost too good for me.\\" At age 27, Anne is not your typical Austen heroine. The middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot she is from a distinguished family of a landed Baronet. Her vain father takes their aristocratic ancestry and social position very seriously and expects his three daughters to make prominent matches. Quiet, reserved and not as pretty as her father values, Anne is often overlooked and her opinions dismissed by her family; \\"but Anne ... was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight; her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne.\\" Eight years prior Anne met and fell in love with a young naval officer Frederick Wentworth. Because he did not match her social and financial status, Anne was persuaded by a well meaning family friend to reject his marriage proposal. Wentworth returned to sea and forgets her. Anne never forgets him and remains unmarried. When he returns eight years later a wealthy and successful naval hero he reenters her social sphere with heightened status. On the other hand, Sir Walter's extravagant lifestyle has out paced his income to the point of serious debt and the family must retrench, let Kellynch Hall and remove to Bath. As Anne watches the younger ladies of the neighborhood swoon and play for Captain Wentworth's affections she is painfully aware of her lost bloom of youth, deeply regrets her decision and pensively longs for his favor until a tragic accident at Lyme Regis and events in Bath renew her hopes.In yet another brilliant reading of a Jane Austen classic novel, British actress Juliet Stevenson interprets Austen's poignant story of fidelity and second chances with wry humor and sensitive pathos. Her depth of characterization is remarkable and I am never in doubt that she is relaying Austen's intension faithfully. Those who have previously read the novel will find new enjoyment in this beautifully produced audiobook and those new to Austen's masterpiece will be treated to an unabridged eight hours and forty three minutes of pure perfection. Such equal blending of masterful story and artistic integrity is rarely encountered and I highly recommend it.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I bought them (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"As an Austen fan I was disappointed. To a non Austen fan this book is akin to watching paint dry while listening to a 4 hour lecture on the intricacies of interpretive dance, followed by a cyborg reading the phone book."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I would rank this one as the number 3 Austen book I've read, below Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I like the heroine because she was well-developed. She wasn't purely weak and selfless like many heroines from this genre. The love story was kind of anti-climactic, but I still liked it because it was also not typical of this genre. The heroine wasn't only about pursuing her love. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a break from the cookie-cutter story lines and character development of contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"this is terrible. you cannot read it because the lines are all misaligned. a complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen is my favorite author when it comes to the classics. Her writing is timeless. It's delicate, romantic & sometimes humorous. All these years later you can still read her work and enjoy it.I liked Anne, I think she was just too young and naive when she broke off her engagement to Wentworth and in seeing him again all those years later, she was more mature and knew what she wanted for herself. I like Wentworth, he's now my second favorite Austen hero, the man can write a wonderful love letter. This was a great novel, the storyline was really good.Wentworths love letter is divine!'I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own, than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago'"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Readers of Jane Austin will immediately recognise the basic plot of Persuasion: single women/girls being courted by men of various levels of eligibility. Two sisters (a third is already married) and their father, a minor noble, have fallen on hard times. Sir Walter Elliot has been widowed, they have lived beyond their means, and now they must rent out the family estate and live in diminished circumstances in Bath. The putative heir to the estate, cousin William Elliot, is vain and arrogant, refusing any interaction with the family.The main character of Persuasion is Anne, the disregarded middle Elliot daughter. She is kind, gentle, and tolerant, which puts her is rigid conflict with the rest of her family who are pompously jealous of rank and privelege. In fact, the rest of the Elliot family supplies much of the satire for the novel: their scheming to arrange meetings with their betters and the scorn they show to their lessers. This reviewer might even go so far as to say that the humour is not so much satirical as it is ascerbic - nowhere else does Austin seem to dislike her characters so much, and to make them the objects of such ridicule. This is not a criticism, as this ascerbic wit sets up many funny moments and observations; more, I think, than any of her previous works.Unfortunately, I found this to be the most confusing of Austin's works: I had trouble keeping track of all the characters. Confusion is increased because all the men seem to be named Charles! Luckily, a thorough knowledge of all the characters is not required to follow the main storylines (although the reader might miss a few subtle jokes).I'm not an expert on Jane Austin, nor on English literature. However, I have read most of Austin's works, and this layman's opinion is that Persuasion is enjoyable and the funniest of Austin's works."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I have read a couple of other Jane Austen novels, and I think this one stands with the best of them. Although we all know it will have a happy ending, Austen sustains the emotional suspense of *how* Anne and Wentworth will finally reunite, and I was not disappointed. Wentworth's letter brought tears to my eyes; it was so wrenchingly emotional and bare. Aside from the romantic plot line, this novel also draws a clear and humorous picture of the characters and social dynamics of the time, which I found fascinating. I recommend this book highly, especially to those who may be new to Austen, as it is shorter and less complicated that some of her more famous ones. The ending makes it all worthwhile!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"The novel Persuasion by Jane Austen is very good. Although slow at places, it definatly redeems itself throughout the novel. The protagonist, Anne, is in love with a man, but is persuaded out of love because of his social status. The book is a classic romatice novel, but is not cheesy to say the least. I encourage everyone who enjoys a good novel to read this book, but especially females. This book is centered around the social status and appearance of the people in the early 1800's. The way Anne doesn't care, makes her differant than the rest of the characters, but also helps the reader consider thinking for themselves instead of being persuaded by other people's thoughts. By the end of the novel, the reader has the decision whether persuasion is good or bad. I really enjoyed the novel. The reader just needs to be able to make it through the first couple of chapters, then the book is really enjoyable."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Not all readers are captivated by this quiet, sad, reflective work. But it is also very joyful. It is Jane Austen toward the end of her life reflecting once again on love, companionship and the eternal knot of family, class and society. Anne Elliot is one of the truly abiding heroines of the modern novel: gentle ,wise, politic and balanced. She is a young, beautiful woman thwarted in an early love by societal and family interests. But it is a joy to see her rise again by the recognition of others seeing these same virtues. This is very different novel than Pride and Prejudice but if you don't think it as great a novel meditate again on its resonant power."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"As a fan of Jane Austen and one who ranks \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" among the great literary accomplishments of the millennium, it disappoints me to rate \\"Persuasion\\" as a ho-hum novel. Unfortunately, the book fulfils the expectations of a two-hundred-year-old romance novel from Old England: dull.The book has a strong and compelling intro. Anne Elliot is one of three daughters of widower Sir Walter Elliot, a vain but financially challenged baronet whose daughters have reached marrying age. As a young lady, Anne had a romance with a certain Captain Wentworth, but this relationship breaks up for reasons that are dribbled out over the course of the book, and Wentworth goes off with the Navy for many years. The story line then wanders off in no apparent direction for a couple of hundred pages as we are introduced to other characters and led thru events with unclear purpose or relevance. But Wentworth reappears on the scene and slowly the plot evolves. Austen tries to persuade us to keep reading with mild intrigue over the Elliot estate, conniving cousins, convoluted love triangles, and the ultimate question: will Anne and the Captain reignited their romance?Although Anne Elliot is a strong and likable character, she seems to do little to advance her own cause. Things just seem to happen to her. While Austen's sentence-by-sentence prose is as beautiful and lyrical as ever, she does an insufficient job in the book's middle of persuading contemporary readers, who prefer faster-paced fiction, to brave the huge passages of wordy exposition and press on to the end. Rabid Austen fans, readers of romance novels, and lovers of classic literature will undoubtedly appreciate Persuasion, but I hesitate to recommend it as an introduction to Jane Austen. I'm afraid that if this were her only novel, she'd have been lost to the ages. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I especially love the extra information for further study that is provided within this edition.

She's never gotten over her first love, Frederick Wentworth, whom she was convinced not to marry, as he lacked both status and wealth. Now, at 27, she's fated to be a spinster for life, passed back and forth between her father and equally status-conscious elder sister and her hypocondriac, self-centered younger sister.Frederick Wentworth, on the other hand, did not pine away, but joined the Royal Navy and made a not-inconsiderable fortune. A series of strange events forces them into each other's company again, but Anne is reluctant to show any favoritism for fear of looking like a fortune hunter, and Captain Wentworth has no desire to be burned again.This is one of Jane Austen's quieter novels. We know from the beginning Anne and the Captain will fall in love all over again -- the enjoyment is in getting there. Not quite up there with her other novels, in my opinion, but if you're a fan of Jane Austen or just the genre, it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I'm slowly becoming a Jane Austen fan.

I did my share of Jane Austen in English classes, a long time ago, but picking up Persuasion this Thanksgiving Day holiday, I could not put it down, where in the past, I could. I am in my forties now and seem to have gained a deeper appreciation for Anne Eliot's heroic character-- heroic in the moral sense...if we had had Anne Eliots for Wallstreet Bankers we would not be in the trouble we are in now, and truly, honestly, Austen is superb in subtly building her arc of suspense with enough plot twists worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster...which is why, if she had lived today she'd be a Nora Ephron and have a great movie out every other year.The novel also served as the proverbial mirror, or as so many have argued, true art is holding up a mirror to Nature...looking into that mirror myself, I felt many personal shortcomings vis a vis patient and virtuous Anne, and I think the next generation, my children's generation which I think of as the \\"on demand\\" generation would greatly benefit from exploring this novel and mirroring their own commonalities and shortcomings on someone like Anne...Inez Hollander Lake[...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"My wife loves owning the classics (including Austen) and went looking for a good hardcover publisher of her favorite books.

Since I had just seen the latest Masterpiece Theater version of Persuasion on PBS, that seemed a likely choice. The possibility of two problems loomed as the book was purchased: First, the book and the taped version would probably have major differences. Second, Having been written 200 years ago, the style would also be different, more narrative than action, for instance. I was to discover that sentence structure was also very different. (Although I have read many books in this style in my lifetime, the popular style today is, of course, more fast-paced and active in comparison.)I was quite right about the pacing and the style. At first, it was a difficult read, taking more concentration than modern popular fiction requires. But as the machinations of the Elliott family and their kin unfolded, I was drawn into the story. How could Sir Walter be so oblivious to Anne's favors? How could Anne have listened to Lady Russell and rejected Wentworth's proposal eight years earlier? How could anyone have wanted to wed Anne's sister Mary whose ailments and spells are so blatantly self-serving? And would a man of Wentworth's personality, station, and eventual rise wait eight years to marry in an era when marrying well was so important to the upper and upper-middle classes?All of the shenanigans listed above and many more are documented in detail in the book. There is no way one can get the same flavor of scheming and hoping in a play or film. At least I've not seen one that accomplished that. It is tough going sometimes for the modern reader. However, it is well worth the effort. Seeing society as Jane Austen did is one of those experiences one can most often get only from books.

Anne Elliott is a sweet 27-year-old woman of good breeding and integrity. She is intelligent, thoughtful, considerate. This may come as a surprise, given that, after losing her mother at 14, she has been encumbered with a father, Sir Walter Elliot, and an older sister, Miss Elizabeth, who are both vain spendthrifts and find her inconsequential; both of whom are blind to the fact that Elizabeth's poorer \\"friend\\", the fawning Mrs Clay, is intent on marrying Sir Walter to become Lady Elliot. Her younger, married sister, Mary is selfish and self-centred. The only person in her life who cares about her at all is a friend of her mother's, Lady Russell, who, when Anne was nineteen, persuaded her not to accept the offer of sailor Frederick Wentworth, as he had no position. Lady Russell tries to persuade Anne, when her estranged cousin, William, heir to the Elliot estate, reappears, that it would be prudent to accept his offer. But Anne is suspicious of his change of attitude. This is the last full novel written by Jane Austen, probably her most mature novel, and it is a great pity she died not long after this novel was completed. This novel has intrigue and humour and, of course, romance. Truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"My Thoughts:Persuasion is one of my favorite movie adaptations in the world. I could watch the Masterpiece Theater version over and over without getting sick of it. That's how much I love it. Since I had never read a Jane Austen book before, I decided to go with that one for my Summer Romance Challenge. I have to admit it was not easy at first. The very beginning with the details on the family and friends of the family was a struggle to get through. I think the reason why is because I know the story so well from the movie. Once more dialogue came about, it became very enjoyable.Anne Elliot was once engaged to Frederick Wentworth when she was very young. Since her friend Lady Russell didn't approve of the match, she persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Fast forward eight years later. Anne's father Sir Walter and sister Elizabeth have nearly brought the family to bankruptcy. They have to let the house to someone while they get things back to where it should be financially. The person who takes up residency is Admiral and Mrs. Croft. And guess who happens to be the brother of Mrs. Croft? You guessed it--Frederick, now Captain Wentworth.So now Anne is forced into being around him often, watching him from afar, imagining him as not wanting anything to do with her. Especially when it seems he is preferring the company of another. As time goes on, he gets to see a different side of her, how selfless she is. And when it seems he is attentive to her, Mr. Elliot, her cousin, seems to be very interested in Anne. But where does Anne stand? Does she have a chance with Frederick again?Like I said, this is one of my favorite movie adaptations. Reading the book was like icing on the cake, completely put it all into perspective, getting into the mind of the characters. Jane Austen really is an amazing author. I wish I hadn't taken so long to read one of her novels. Definitely one of the best classics I've read so far.My Rating:Very Good... Stay up late"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This is only the second Jane Austen book I have read, having read Pride and Prejudice some time ago. It took me a little while to get into it. The early chapters feel like they get bogged down in bringing us up to date with the back story. However it's worth persevering as the book gets much easier to read as it develops. Jane Austen's observations on society of that time and the way that she captures the feelings of the protagonists feel so fresh and modern that at times it is hard to believe that the book was written almost 200 years ago.The heroine is Anne Elliott, the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliott: a vain and snobbish man who has been living beyond his means for some time. For financial reasons he decides to rent out his family home, Kellynch Hall, and moves to Bath with his oldest daughter who shares his obsession with status and appearances. Anne goes to stay for a time with her younger sister, Mary, who is married and lives nearby. Anne is easily the most likeable of the three girls, but is still single at the age of 27. Several years ago she met the love of her life, Captain Wentworth, but she was \\"persuaded\\" by her friends and family that he was not an appropriate match for her. She has never forgotten him.As it happens, Captain Wentworth comes back into her life, as it is his sister who has hired Kellynch Hall. However he appears to no longer have any interest in Anne and spends his time with the daughters of Mary's husband's family. In the meantime a new suitor has come into Anne's life, being her father's probable heir. He is pleasant and polite and certainly a good catch - but she finds it hard to let her feelings for Captain Wentworth go. When she finally realises who she is meant to be with, the book feels as alive and the romance as intense as any chicklit novel you might read today.I read the Brandywine edition of the book.

You can feel it jump out at you from the pages and so like the unforgettable characters that make up all Jane Austen's BooksA true masterpiece"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"SLIGHT SPOILERSSo, Persuasion. Austen has an uncanny ability to create characters who are so petty and unlikable that one simply wants to put the book down, for lack of someone with sense. This problem, for me, brings Northanger Abbey to its knees, and weighs down Persuasion for the first seventy pages. It's a while before we get to be inside Anne Elliot's head, and in the meantime we must satisfy ourselves with her imbecilic, preening father and his protegee daughter, Elizabeth. But finally, we get to Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth, to marriage intrigue and the questioning of glances and motives--all of the things for which one absolutely loves Austen. This book provides the goods, so don't give up on it too early.Persuasion is it's own creature, however. I was immediately struck by the difference in style from her earlier book Pride and Prejudice; in Persuasion, Austen strings together dependent clauses as though the story desperately required the reader to be in suspense as to what verb she will next employ. Take, for instance, the reader's first impression of Bath:\\"They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer; the rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.\\"Some will take pleasure in reading these lines, but I personally think they do her no credit. At its best, her prose style is lucid, and suffused with that clean, English wit we expect. That being said, I find Austen more charming than aesthetically stunning, and to my tastes, her simplicity of style adds to that charm. Her convolutions detract from it.This issue was exacerbated by the decision of the editor, Gillian Beer, to not standardize punctuation. Austen has a tendency to interrupt an otherwise complete clause with a comma, which is off-putting to modern readers and detracts from her otherwise fluid style. Likewise, there has been no attempt to regulate her use of the semicolon, which 19th century authors used with abandon. Beer might argue that these editorial decisions might affect interpretation, but I never noticed a moment when emphasis might depend upon an otherwise superfluous comma. Furthermore, if there had been any instance where punctuation greatly affected meaning, I think Beer would have mentioned it in her notes--she was so very thorough. Incidentally, this lack of editorial judiciousness brings me to my final contention with the edition.While there are different opinions as to the proper domain of footnotes, I believe they exist for only a few purposes. 1.) They should explain historical and cultural references that may otherwise be outside the reader's ken. 2.) They should explain a historical use of a word that a modern reader may otherwise not know. 3.) They should give manuscript variations, when applicable. They should not (in my opinion) explain turns of phrase, or help the reader interpret the plot, or offer critiques of the novel. My reasoning is that these three tasks belong to the reader; for an editor to do all the heavy lifting actually detracts from the pleasure of reading the book. For instance, when Mr. Elliot implies that he would like to marry Anne, he says,\\"The name of Anne Elliot,\\" said he, \\"has long had an interesting sound to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\\"To this excellent, shining line of dialogue, Beer graciously provides a footnote: \\"An oblique proposal: her name and his are the same, Elliot.\\" This is completely unnecessary, and for me mars the beauty of the original sentence. Also, it is inconceivable that the reader might not yet know that both Anne and Mr. Elliot share the same last name, as this exchange occurs late in the book. Unfortunately, this is not the only stupid footnote in the Penguin edition. For the sake of space, I will refrain from listing any others.On the whole, this is a fine novel; not as accomplished as some of Austen's other work, but very engaging and fun to read. She seems to be a bit more moralistic as here well, which is not to my taste, but may be to others. Oh that Mr. Elliot and his \\"Sunday travelling\\"--ought he not to be in church? My only complaint with the novel itself (other than the occasional tortuous/torturous sentence) is the speedy resolution, which I felt could have benefited from a couple more scenes concerning the novel's two main antagonists--a confrontation would have been nice here. Also, I felt Austen took the easy way out by not forcing Anne to make a choice between two eligible suitors. Otherwise, if you like Austen, this is probably exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This was my first foray into Jane Austen. I must admit it took a while for me get accustomed to the literary style, but once I got into the flow of it, I quite enjoyed it. I am looking forward to reading more of her classic works!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Although I am an English major and have always loved reading, I confess that when I picked up Persuasion, it was the first Jane Austen book I had ever actually read. Watching the films had made me love the stories, but I had never truly experienced the original text. This is the only one I have read so far, and so declaring it my favorite seems a stretch. However I can say with confidence that at this moment, I can't think of another book I've read this year that I liked half so well.The characters in the book have personalities that range from immature to mature, logical to illogical, playful to disdainful, and shallow to deeply heartfelt. Jane Austen has a true talent of capturing real people, in moments of weakness, in strength, and just about everything in between. Anne's sister Mary is one who feels that the world is never quite kind enough to her, while her father feels a lack of need to be terribly kind to the world. Lady Russell, a friend and mentor of the heroine Anne, is logical and sensitive to family connection so much so that occasionally she cannot see the inherent flaws in those whom she is trying to reconnect. The main character, Anne, is a complex creature through whose eyes it is fascinating to watch the world. She is sweet and humble, yet occasionally sarcastic and unfailingly realistic.Another aspect of the book is the implicit value of integrity. Anne does not do anything which she feels to be untrue or unworthy, and she stands up for what she believes in despite the disapproval of her worldly father. One example of this is when she decides to visit an old school mate who has been both widowed and crippled instead of going with her father and sister to visit Lady Dalrymple, a distant cousin of the family who hold a title of nobility. Consistently throughout the book, there is a deep and unwavering determination to do the right thing.Jane Austen is able to capture the complex relationships between people and the intricacies of human nature in beautiful and captivating language, and her skill of tone allow the reader to be completely transported and involved in the world she writes from. I look forward to reading the rest of the books as soon as I can, for through fiction she seems to speak poignantly about my life in a way I couldn't. Sometimes she goes against the adage of \\"Show don't tell,\\" by summarizing conversations and describing peoples attributes without allowing the reader to see them in action. However, this is a matter of style, and no great downfall for the book itself."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Take this opportunity to read Persuasion, it will take your breath away.Anne Elliot was \\"forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older.\\" She was not given the choice by her family and friends to marry the man that she loved and who loved her. She sent Fredrick Wentworth away to the navy with no promise of ever having their love renewed. Fredrick spends his time in the navy honorably, becoming a captain, and tries his best to forget Anne. Anne, left at home, realizes what a mistake it was to ignore her heart and follow the advice of those who she thought she trusted.Persuasion takes place almost ten years after these events when fate pulls these star-crossed lovers together again. They must find a way to forgive each other, one for being sent away, and the other for never returning.Jane Austen wrote Persuasion at the end of her life, and thus had a different perspective while writing it then she did when writing all the rest of her books. This is the only Austen book written after the two protagonists have met and fallen in love. Austen pulls you into Anne's story, demanding that you stick around until you know what happens between Anne and Wentworth. The reader can easily see the emotions that both Anne and Wentworth feel, while both characters are blind to the feelings of the other.Anne taught me that I have to trust my heart. I can listen to the people in my life that I trust, but they will not be able to tell me what to do to be happy. Anne becomes miserable because she followed the advice of those she loved, but she doesn't blame them because she realizes that they told her to do what they thought was best. I enjoyed watching Anne grow and become an amazing woman who knows what she wants and is willing to stand up to the people in her life.One issue that I had with this book is the language that is used in it; it was not written for our day. The language is archaic and difficult to decipher. It is best to know the basic plot before reading this book or else you will get lost in the details of what is happening. However, the joy that is elicited from being part of Anne's life is without a doubt worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I just recently went through a really rough break up and a friend of mine suggested that I read this book to start working on getting over it. It is a beautifully written book and the story is not at all predictable. It twists and turns and the whole time you find yourself on the edge of your seat, not able to put the book down untill you find out what is going to happen between Anne and Mr. Wentworth... will they see eachother? Will they speak? The characters are all very clear, and all very different. There's the annoying \\" it's all about her\\" sister, the well to do Friend, the loner bookworm, the bitter widow, the scheming cousin, each character is unique. Anne is polite and loveable. Everyone loves her and you will too. In the end, this beautiful love story gives a single girl like me hope that there is that perfect someone out there for me, but you don't have to be going through a loss to love this book. Everyone should read it. It is one of my new favorites of all time!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"this one and northanger abbey are my favorite. both of them are surprisingly easy to read. i like this one best of the two because i like the character of Ann so much, and i like her silly sisters. there are a lot of characters but i never got lost amongst them all. i recommend, for a first time Austen reader, to read this one becasue it is much easier to understand than most of her other works and it really is a good story."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen, and I tend to read it when I have that need for some \\"Austen therapy\\". Anne is much older than any other Austen heroine (she is 28 by the end of the book), but that difference in age has made her more wise, thoughtful, intelligent, and sensitive. She has known the pain of disappointed love, and has lived through it. She didn't \\"die of a broken heart\\" or anything like that. She suffered, learned from it, and managed to come out the other side with her senses intact.Like all Austen heroines, there is nothing sentimental about her or her romance with Captain Wentworth. In fact, their interactions with each other, after an absence of eight years, illustrate how very realistic the story is. Wentworth is angry and resentful, and uses the young, spirited Louisa Musgrove to make Anne see that she has no power over him, even to make her jealous. Most of us have had similar experiences with ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends. The book is completely relevant to the lives of modern readers, which is the very thing that keeps Jane Austen fresh after all these years.Persuasion is also supremely entertaining, with delightful and hilariously vapid characters, such as the vain Sir Walter Elliot, the conniving William Elliot, the the petulant and constantly ill-used Mary Musgrove, and the scheming Mrs. Clay. Any fan of Austen will already have read this book, but any beginner Austen fan, or someone who has not yet ventured to try Austen yet, but is curious, should read this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I bought this for my kindle..50 cents! Goodness I am almost ashamed. Sick with a cold, I read it almost straight through. Don't know how I missed this before. It is a joy. So much better than much of what is put out today."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I have to admit I am a Jane Austen addict. I just can't help but enjoy her witty dialog set in old English times. Sometimes I wish we talked more like they did.

I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is a small novel, but it is Jane Austen at her best. Her commentary on the English gentry and the restrictions of \\"society\\" are well presented in this story of Anne who was once persuaded not to marry a man with no prospects and no station in life, at least compared to hers as the daughter of a baronet. Jane Austen proves there can be passion without being graphic. A great lvoe story!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This book answered a lot of questions that came up after I saw the movie i.e. what's with Mrs. Clay and the young Mr. Elliot? A must read if you really want to understand the movie."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I finally got around to reading this lovely novel by the infamous Jane Austen. It was written in her middle age and published posthumously. Slightly shorter and less intense than Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is still detailed and enjoyable, full of Austen's trademark wit, deft dialogue, and insight into human nature.The protagonist is Anne Elliot, the twenty-seven-year-old daughter of a baronet. Like other Austen heroines, Anne shares little sympathy or similarity with her family members. Her one romantic attachment is over half a decade old - she was engaged to a naval officer whom her friends disapproved of. At the beginning of the novel, Anne goes to stay with her married younger sister. Her father and older sister have been forced to give up their family home because of their spendthrift habits. Captain Wentworth, Anne's former fiance, reappears in her life, and Anne is forced to learn to interact with him in a polite and detached way. She must watch him pursue others, and decide how to respond to her own suitors.The entire novel is engaging and good, though at times I found Anne almost too calm a heroine. I absolutely loved the climax of the story, near the ending. It is so sweet and surprising. Persuasion is not to be passed over by a Jane Austen fan, or anyone who likes an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Anyone who enjoys reading Jane Austen, will be very please with this book.

And, oh, his letter! Just remembering makes me hanker for another re-read! Just so lovely and emotional.If you love romance, this is one of the very best (although I now know to skip the visit to Mrs Smith, at the end, as I don't think it adds anything to the plot)."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"The plot was a bit frustrating due to misunderstandings and lack of communication by the main characters. Austen does meander through relationships well in order to sustain the reader's interest."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I confess: I was expecting a lot more from Persuasion. The premise of the book is interesting: it is the story of twenty-seven year old Anne Elliot. Eight years earlier, she rejected Frederick Wentworth, choosing her duty to her family over her love for him. Now, he's back again as a successful navy officer, and Anne thinks this might be their second chance. But he's courting the Musgrove sisters, and seems determined to ignore her.It all sounds very interesting, and Persuasion is definitely one of Jane Austen's more serious works, but the writing lacked something. It wasn't that witty or that interesting in the end. Maybe if I reread it a little later, I'll like it better, but it just didn't draw me in like Pride and Prejudice, and eventually, Emma. I couldn't really relate to Anne like I did to Elizabeth Bennet or Catherine Morland from Northanger Abbey. There wasn't enough of Wentworth. The background history was kind of vague. I'm sorry to be critical of anything of Jane Austen's, but this one just didn't work for me.Becky loved it, so I have to come a to a reluctant conclusion: We really don't have similar opinions on books. Books that I love she doesn't review, books that she loves I don't enjoy as much (generally.) Books that she reviews unfavorably I like. It's kind of sad.Back to Persuasion. As I said, it's a much more serious work; it's not necessarily about young love and flirtation. Anne is still fairly pretty, but she has to face the fact that if she doesn't marry soon, she'll be an old maid. There was a lot less snappy dialogue, and overall, I think it's just an inferior book. I do look forward to reading For Darkness Shows the Stars, a science fiction retelling of it (review coming soon.)All of my reviews can be read at my blog [...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Love the story and the writer. A must read for Austen fans and all lovers of good love stories and classics."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I know why this is considered a classic. The language used. Contemporary novels will never be written like this. It is like reading from an artists eyes. The way sentences are written is very different to the way they are written now. A lot of thought went into each [sentence] or rather Jane Austin is so gifted it comes second nature.Now for the book summary and highlights. It was tough to get into. About the sixth chapter is starts getting interesting. Often you put down a book if the first chapter fails to capture the imagination, but with a 'classic' you need a little patience and endurance. It is worth the wait.This review is after reading the classics of War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, the Art of War, Moby Dick, Andre Norton's Saragasso Series, Charles Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie, Confucius' Sayings, Common Sense by Thmas Paine, and Treasure Island (to give this context). You see I did not enjoy reading when I was young, but now older and with a 1.25 hour commute on the train (to Brisbane from Gold Coast) and back, I have time !Compared to Charles Dickens, it is an easier read. Charles' book was a tougher read and more complex but it did go into Persuasion but moreso into the realm of manipulation. If you enjopy Persuasion, you should read Dickens' book. Mind you Dickens' book is an even tougher read - I re-read the first seven chapters 3 times ! but it is definitely worth it. Like digging for gold - you struggle a lot, but when you find the gold it is like WOW !Anne Elliott is somewhat ignored by her family (Father Sir Walter and Sister Elizabeth). Her mother passes and their finances are in disarray. Miss Russell a confidant of Sir Walter contrives a scheme to boost their cashflow while moving them elsewhere with little impact to their social-life. Anne who is steadfast and reasonable and even tempered throughout the story demonstrates that not everyone can be manipulated and if you are even-tempered and reasonable, nothing will escape your obsveration.She comes across Mr Worthington (admiral) and initially she hopes to marry him, then the persuausive schemes start and you know throughout the whole book, I'm looking for acts of Persuasion to give this book meaning and the answer is found in the last chapter and Jane Austin neatly ties the story into a happy ending. Through acts behind the seen a third party is after Anne's affections and this person works in concert with other key characters until Anne bumps into an old friend Mrs Smith and the whole scheme is turned on its head !In truth, the major drama surrounds louisa who falls while being silly and nearly kills herself, but the way it is written that part seems trivial and it is used to free certain people and allow certain things to swing in motion. If only Mr Elliot was there sooner and saved Louisa.... There's a thought, then this story may have gone a differnet direction. Read this and see if this review makes any sense at all !?!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is the book a lot of people can relate to, including myself. A story of letting \\"The One\\" get away and the miracle of second chances. The title may not have been her choice (brother Henry named the book after her death), but this is all Austen. It shows how both society and greed for money can be very persuasive.The father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a selfish man who falls prey to extravagants. The widow with three daughters becomes indebted. He is influenced to rent out their home and stay at Bath. He is influenced by his eldest daughter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay (a greedy widow of slight lower class to the Elliots). Lady Russell is a friend of the Elliots and godmother to Ann. The Lady is the cause to the way Anne Eliot (at age 18) loses her true love, Frederick Wentworth. Lady Russell finds this was erroneous for persuading Anne's decision.At the age of 27, Anne Elliot is classified as spinster. Her two very selfish and arrogant sisters have both been indifferent towards their middle sister Anne. Anne has let everyone control her in every way. In my opinion, I can understand Frederick's hesitation towards rekindling his love to Anne.The novel is a favorite of mine. It is shorter than all of Jane's novels and the storyline more simple, but it's still a great love story. I agree that it is like a Cinderella story.

It is immediately familiar in the sense that you can sense it as a work of Austen's, but has some slight differences. Anne is less spunky & for some a less immediate heroine. There is certainly less dialogue between characters as compared to Austen's other works. I feel that these things represent maturity & sophistication in her writing that add much depth.

I have read most of Jane Austen's book and this one certainly did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"It feels a bit silly to write a review of one of Jane Austen's last published and perhaps lesser known novels. Anyone looking at Persuasion has certainly read Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility, and has a good idea what to expect. But I'd like to get a few impressions down.Persuasion focuses on Anne Elliot, middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot and the only person in her family who isn't completely proud and self absorbed. In her youth, Anne was persuaded to break off a relationship with a naval officer that her family felt was beneath her station. Eight years later her former beau, Captain Wentworth, is thrown back into her life, much to her discomfort. She is forced to navigate a passel of family issues and potential suitors in order to find a happy match.There are all the usual elements you can expect in an Austen novel. It is a wry, incisive look at the foibles of human nature; in this case, a contrast between those who value a person purely on their birth or station, versus those who look to personality and character. It has various changes of scenery, from the Elliots' traditional home of Kellynch, to the seaside town of Lyme, to Bath, and draws in a host of well drawn characters. The plot is relationship centered, with one good crisis to drive things forward, and, as I've come to expect, much of it hinges on misunderstanding or deception by characters that aren't all they appear to be on the surface.I liked the book, but I can't say I liked it as much as Austen's more popular novels. Elsewhere she seems to have written even her foolish characters with a sympathetic hand; we laugh at them, perhaps we pity them, but nowhere else to they come off as so one-sidedly unpleasant as in Anne's father and sisters. And, by contrast, Anne is almost the perfect heroine from the start, with little room to grow and few mistakes to learn from. I'm happy I finally read Persuasion--it was the one Austen novel I hadn't read--but it's not the first one I'd recommend."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is about second chances.

I had to do it for a class, but there came a point when I couldn't put it down. I carried it around with me on my phone and every time I had a spare minute I would read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I'm thrilled that this book remains a perennial favorite, despite the theme. These days, so few people are patient enough to wait, to delay gratification, to survive disappointment, to learn to trust again.By the way, the only movie version worth watching is the one with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root. Great casting throughout."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion , . . . . Jane AustenA number of reviewers complained of serious issues with the printing of this book. Fortunately for me, I experienced no such problems.Jane Austen was an excellent author and Persuasion is a superb example of her work. It is a classic novel of England at that time period (1818). It is a complicated story of romance greatly affected by the class system. There is a bit of good ol' dry English humor as a member of the upper class is forced to take a step down and still manages to keep his nose in the air. Then there's a love tale of the past that just might flame up again. Of course there has to be a villain in such novels and the one here does a fairly good job of being secretly nasty."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels. The life lessons to be learned are dispensed in a gentle, non judgmental manner, and the characters could be met at any time in any age. A must read (as far as I am concerned)I purchased the Kindle version so that I have it with me when I travel. Here my issue is that the reproduction was choppy."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Published a few years after the acclaimed PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this novel paints an intimate portrait of country gentry inearly 19th century England. Describing the social milieus with which she was so familiar, Austen alternates the plot development between modest estates and the seaside resorts of Lyme and Bath. Travel aand communication proved serious obstacles, so letters and notes were the more prized and preserved. Austen weaves a tapestry of strict social customs,explaining the value of keeping up appearances, of keeping one's place--which was clearly deliniated by time-honored class snobbery and ritual. Other themes which are quietly included:be wary of schemers, evaluate the counsel of interfering extended famly, and do not trust superficial impressions.Narrated in the usual third person, ths intense story revolves around Anne Elliot, the middle daughter of vain but impoverished Sir Walter. The author might well have chosen to make this a first person novel, since we always know what the modestprotagonist is doing, feeling and thinking. Austen gently ridicules the struggle between vanity and financial reality, as the family's streightened circumstances obliged them to rent out their beloved Kellynch Hall and take rooms in Bath. But where to find suitable tenants for the ancestral home? Their circle includes the neighboring Musgroves, whose son married the youngest Elliot daughter. Fortunately for the marriageablegirls, their limited horizons are expandaded by the arrival of three young naval captains--one of whom Anne was forced to renounce 7 years before. She represents the first victim ofof the art of familial persuasion. Yet her heart still beats fast at the mention of his name...Austen presents many themes and events which also appear in her signature novel; she deftly reveals a woman's intimate understanding of her heroine's private torment. The social ritual between country gentry is almost ridiculous in their extreme scruples regarding proper behavior--even to their own relatives and in-laws. Austen exposes the time-honored web of duty an public behavior, even on vacation. One wonders if the women of Austen's day were taught--direclty or indirectly--to value their own &quot;nothingness,&quot; as Anne puts it. Is a teachable heart (one that can be persuaded to reason, even in violation of its natural instincts, to be admired in that society? Or in our own time? Were Austen's women true Victorian ladies or more rational creatures thanmale authors of the time generally portrayed them? Anne pounced upon the eternal argument which provoked the denouement: which of the genders is more (or less) &quot;inconstant.&quot; These and many other soul-searching issues are elucidated in this short novel (225 pages) which should be evaluated by the standards of a by-gone era. Thoughtful readers must discern for themselves which truths are valid for all times; if they prove universal, then the work is a true classic. An insightful novel which will appeal to most caring women."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This wasn't my favorite Jane Austen, but I liked the main character better than some of the others I've read, like Emma. The main character, Anne, was sympathetic, and you felt bad for her through much of the book when she was putting up with the other insufferable characters. Jane Austen's books always manage to make me very glad that I didn't live in the Victorian Era. It would have been terrible to not be able to escape the very awful relations always described in her books. The expectations of poor relations seem nearly unbearable. I wouldn't have been able to bear the types of jabs Mary aimed at Anne regularly. It makes me very glad to live in a time when a woman earning her own living is not seen as a disreputable person."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"have to admit, Jane Austen's Persuasion was just . . . pretty boring. The book mainly consists of the main character, Anne Elliot, hanging about until finally realizing that the man she really wants is a sailor whose love she turned away several years ago. Anne herself is not particularly interesting, nor are there the really fun, memorable characters like the father in Emma. The only dramatic incident in the book is one of Anne's acquaintances taking a tumble and bumping her head, but she's not really hurt and the whole incident is designed to help dispose of one of Anne's potential suitors. In six months I'll have completely forgotten what this book is about, but I will say it offers an interesting historical look at what daily life might be like in the lower-echelons of the the English gentry. It also demonstrates the high regard that Englishmen held for the navy as one of the few avenues for citizens of mundane birth to advance themselves into positions of power, wealth, and prestige.For essays, John Wiltshire's \\"Modern Interpretations\\" discusses how, although the slow-moving and even mournful Persuasion was Austen's final published novel, she was working on a \\"high-spirited satire\\" at the time of her death. Wiltshire also talks about a couple of recent filmed versions of the book. Maggie Lane's \\"Regency Life\\" has an interesting discussion on the role of the navy during the period in which Austen was writing, as well as the use of seaside resorts as places visited for both recreation and their supposed medicinal effects. Caroline Sanderson's \\"Geographical Settings\\" focusses primarily on Bath and Lyme Regis, while Josephine Ross' \\"A Modern Perspective\\" offers an interesting portrait of Jane Austen's own failed romantic pursuits and how that may have influenced her writing."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Overall, Persuasion was not bad, but I would have enjoyed it more with some plot adjustments.I felt like I was never well acquainted with the object of Anne Elliot's affection, Captain Wentworth. Although Austen described why Wentworth was such a good man, I did not participate much in Anne's love for him (although I did empathize with her feelings). There were great moments and good characters, but there could have been so much more in the relationship between Anne and Frederick Wentworth.Also, I was disappointed that the the end was summarized in narration. The climax of the story pertaining to the romance and to the foes of the family, though starting out well, ended too soon in narration rather than dramatic action."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Anne is the middle daughter of a snobbish and foolish lord living in Victorian England. Her mother died when she was a young teenager, and she has very little in common with her older sister or her younger sister. Anne's older sister is a carbon copy of their father, and the two of them managed to spend beyond their means, to the point that they now have to rent out their home and move someplace more affordable. Anne's younger sister has made a decent match in marriage and is now settled into a life that requires near constant attention from others, especially when one of her frequent imaginary illnesses pops up.Anne is mostly ignored by her family, and they don't know that she once had a brief attachment to a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth. A family friend, Anne's surrogate mother figure, thought Anne would be able to find someone better, and advised her to break off her commitment. Anne took the advice, which resulted in devastation both for herself and for the young man.Now, seven years later, Wentworth's sister and her husband are renting Anne's family home. When the now-Captain Wentworth visits, he and Anne find themselves thrown into the same social circle, and spend many months trying to decide if they still have the same feelings for each other that they did so long ago.I liked this story, with its insight into the amount of effort it took for Victorians to make proper matches and ensure their way of life would continue. I liked the social rankings and the elaborate rules of behavior, which must have been absolutely stifling for someone living through this time.However, I didn't identify at all with Anne as a protagonist. I understand that rules of etiquette were different in those days, and it is difficult for me to read this book without looking through a modern-day filter. However, Anne had no sense of self-value, and only seemed to see herself as important when she was being \\"useful\\" to others. It is true that her family treated her as a tool, but I couldn't see how she could see herself that way and still have been attractive to the men who vie for her attention."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I'm a longtime Persuasion fan, and know the novel well. I bought the Brilliance Audio edition because it's tough to find unabridged versions and I like hearing my favorite old stories aloud.The tapes are certainly sturdy for repeated library lendings, and the narrator is easy to hear and understand, but otherwise Michael Page is the wrong reader for this story! His vocal characterizations are quavery and pinched, and don't usually fit the characters--or degrade them to farce level. The music signalling the end of each cassette is distracting, jarring even.Not a great reading of Persuasion. Not even a good intro to the novel for first timers, and terrible for those of us who know the characters already."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I rate this book three stars. This is the first book from Jane Austen I have read and am not accustomed to her style of writing. I liked this book very much, don't get me wrong, but at times it dragged on, going over tons of social class and position stuff. The end is expected, but suprising at the same time. There is romance in the book, but not enough for my satisfaction. But overall this books is a good one! I would definetly buy it regardless of my personal tastes."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"If (like me) you value Austen primarily for her wit, you may pass on Persuasion.Persuasion is a bit tedious. It's all mincing and moralizing, with none of the wit and good humor that make Pride and Prejudice worthwhile. Persuasion's protagonist, the wilting Anne Elliot, is a doormat for her self-involved relations, whom she not only tolerates but also excuses. Anne's blushing weakness may add to the melodrama (maybe the romance), but it also sucks all the satire out of the narrative. As a result, the reader is deprived of a richly deserved laugh at the pompous antagonists' expense. And without a good laugh, the story is hardly worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Let me start off by saying, maybe my review of this book is not fair- I have, so far, only read about 40% of it and was SO disgustingly BORED that I stopped & went on to another book.My first Jane Austen book that I read was Pride & Prejudice- I LOVED that book! I was very excited to start this book, hoping I would love it just as much as P&P...; but I have the exact oposite feeling about it. I was bored in the begining, but I forced myself to keep reading thinking that it would get better. Finally I just couldn't stand it & moved to another book. After reading so many good reviews on here, I will try to read it again- hopefully the 2nd time will be the charm- ?"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This is my favorite Austen work. it's a bit more mature than her other works. Love lost and regained. This also shows how a young woman can mature into a self-confident and very responsible young woman in the face of a daunting and selfish family. Mrs. Smith who is Miss anne Eliot's close friend and the description of her character in the book is much more enjoyable than any of the movie versions can portray."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth once meant a great deal to each other. But that was years ago before Anne's well-meaning friend and her less-than-good-intentioned family discouraged the acquaintance and Anne was convinced to give Frederick up.With years to think of her decision and years to consider all that Wentworth has accomplished without her, Anne has little hope of seeing him again or changing things between them.That is until a change in her father's circumstance forces the family to rent their estate. Given the identity of the new tenants, it seems inevitable that Anne and Captain Wentworth will see each other. It even seems inevitable that Wentworth will be angry and Anne hurt. Only time will tell if they can once again be something more to each other in Persuasion (1818) by Jane Austen.Persuasion is Austen's last novel. It is also a favorite among several of my friends.*With a book that is already such a large part of the public consciousness and the literary canon, there isn't a lot to say in a review that hasn't been said before.Jane Austen is one of my favorite classic authors so it is not, perhaps, especially surprising that I enjoyed Persuasion. In addition to a story that kept me on my toes,** Persuasion features a lot of strong, or at least interesting, characters. Wentworth is appropriately dashing even at his worst. Then we have Anne who is a delightfully forward heroine for a novel from 1818. It was invigorating to watch Anne come into her own as the novel progressed and she developed her own agency and the wherewithal to pursue her own wants and needs.Like many classics Persuasion is a book many people will read on the merits of its reputation (or for school) or it's the kind of book they won't touch. One review might not change whatever opinion you might have but Persuasion is an obvious must read for romantics and anyone who likes their heroines level-headed and ready to stand on their own two feet.*Though one does add the caveat that Pride and Prejudice first has to be taken out of the equation as Pride and Prejudice is arguably everyone's favorite Austen novel.**My only experience with Persuasion before this reading was Diana Peterfreund's post-apocalyptic retelling For Darkness Shows the Stars. I had never even seen a movie version so I really had no idea what to expect from the story. At. All. It made for a pleasant surprise while reading.Possible Pairings: Graffiti Moon by Cath Crowley, Middlemarch by George Eliot, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banksby E. Lockhart, Saving Francesca by Melina Marchetta, For Darkness Shows the Stars by Diana Peterfreund, The Scorpio Races by Maggie Stiefvater____Sound good?

I only purchased this book because it was free and because I was OK with Jane Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY, introduced by my sister. I promptly forgot about it. The only reason I ever got around to reading it was because I was bored out of my skull, and looking for something to read. I saw this book, remembered NORTHANGER ABBEY, and decided to read the reviews. It looked decent, so I gave it a try.I couldn't put this book down! I stayed up till 11:00 p.m. reading it! Normally I go to bed at 8:30 to 9:00. And just to give you a better idea of how much I liked it, I read it in two days. This is not a \\"short read.\\"Jane Austen has a skill in making characters come to life. I have been able to connect with each and every one of her heroines, though Elizabeth in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is too contemptous of others. Her books give an idea of the value placed in rank back then. It makes one glad for the semi-equality in the modern world. I loved the dialogues, and Mary, Anne's sister is so ridiculous you want to laugh.Anne falls in love with a poor sailor, Captain Wentworth, but is persuaded that she can make a much better match. She spends the next eight years regretting this decision, and wishing she had followed her better instincts. Captain Wentworth makes his fortune, but his pride is too much damaged to return to Anne. Fate throws them together again in the end as Anne's father rents their house to the Crofts, close relations to Captain Wentworth, and they begin to see each other much more often than they are comfortable with. I will let you discover what happens next, as one review spoiled it all for me.I have now broadened my knowledge of Jane Austen's novels. All of them are very good.

The heroine Anne Elliot is an interesting lady caught in a times where women had very little independence and means to pursue their own happiness, and where family connections dictated most social interactions. Her journey to reclaim her love and more important her sense of self is very heartwarming. And her dashing Captain Wentworth, while still a pround gentleman finally lets his own emotions towards Anne steer him, and her to a happy conclusion.

Austen presents a very strong heroine in Anne Elliot, whose only false step in life seems to have been her allowing a trusted friend to persuade her not to marry sweetheart Captain Wentworth. When they next meet, years later, he has made his fortune in the wars, and she has become the official spinster of the family, deeply regretting her decision not to marry him. What happens next is enthralling not so much for the plot, but the detail with which Austen describes the turbulent emotions of the outwardly calm, collected and staid Anne Elliot."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan.

This is quite frankly well written happy tales - much like today's best sellers in pink dust jackets. Persuasion is very similar to Pride and Prejudice - the mood is the same, the excessive one-dimensional characters are the same and the message is quite similar. Still, the strength of the novel, apart from some splendid literary gymnastics, is how it does not take itself very seriously at all. It seems as if Austen simply wanted to write another \\"pretty little piece\\". Call it formulaic, if you like, but Austen knew her strength, as well as her audience.The heroine, Anne, is quite delightful - similar to Elizabeth Bennet in her thoughts and actions. The vain father figure, Sir Walter Eliot, is as comedic as her hypochondriac sister, Mary. The villain, however, is not as good as her other ones - he is bland and dreary, and not all that deliciously bad.My favorite parts of the story are the various observasions of female beauty. Of what does it consist - and how does it change through time? A woman's \\"years of dread\\" are still her thirties - if she is unmarried, that is. The lamentations over hideous crows feet, freckles, faded or coarse skin and the general loss of blom are in many ways just as prevalent in current female literature...Recommended as a sweet little treat - nothing more, but nothing less."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I can't stop reading this book andthe fact that it has kind of an old english doesn't seem to bother me at all."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Not only did I receive my purchase in a timely manner, but I also found the book to be in excellent condition and exactly what I asked for.

Persuasion is probably the most accessible of all of Austen's novels and has one of the most memorable love stories. I'm actually glad that Austen, like Shakespeare, has had a renaissance of sorts due to some pretty good movie versions (this movie was not the finest, but at least it gives one a flavor). Emma is my personal favorite Austen movie (as well as one of my favorite novels.) Even less skillful readers will be drawn in my the fairly straightforwards plot of Persuasion. As a side benefit, all readers will get a good taste of Austen's wit, humor and at times biting social commentary."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen is often noted for her earlier works, namely Pride and Prejudice. Her later books are sometimes passed up, yet they can prove to be quite an enjoyable read.Anne Elliot, a wealthy, yet amazingly kind girl, finds herself in love with a penniless gambler who is making his profession as a sea captain. He proposes. She allows her friends to &quot;persuade&quot; her that this poor captain is not the man for her. He leaves, heartbroken, and over time becomes a wealthy man. He returns eight years later and Anne realizes that she never quite got over the man who stole her heart so many years ago. However, Captain Wentworth seems fairly content without her. Her shyness keeps the debonair captain from ever knowing her true feelings, but like any good Austen novel, the good girl always wins. Anne isn't as impetuous as Elizabeth Bennett, but her sweet nature will keep you rooting for her.

I can only add my voice to those praising her works, which are deceptively unpretentious and straighforward. This one, late in her career, is a bit complicated at first with a myriad of relatives and relationships. But at its core it is a mature portrait of social pressures on women, focused on an intelligent and wise and loving woman who finds a man equal to her. It is not merely a good story, not merely proto-feminist, not merely a satire... it is all of those, and a lovely read."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion, like other Jane Austen novels, contains characters who are class conscious to the point of being absolutely ridiculous.

Sir Walter Elliot and his oldest daughter, Elizabeth, are completely willing to associate with those of a higher class than themselves but will avoid people of a lower class. They avoid anything that would ruin their image. Mary, the other Elliot daughter, is just as selfish but in a slightly different way. Jane Austen's dialogue is difficult to follow at times, but worth the extra work it takes to understand the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Every time I finish another Austen novel, it becomes my &quot;favorite,&quot; and Persuasion is no different. Perceptive, emotional, profound and even painful at times, it still sparkles with Austen's humor and flair for turning a clever phrase. Anne Elliot is a heroine's heroine, and one with whom the reader feels an instant sympathy and affection. If only Jane Austen had been given more time on this earth to share her splendid and amazing gift--but in the little time she did have, she has given all of us who love her work a never ending source of pleasure and enjoyment. Persuasion in indeed a rare and priceless gem."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This book came into my life at a time I really needed it. Perhaps that makes me partial to it, but I found it compelling, compassionate, and greatly moving. Not a general reader of Austen, but compelled to pick it up after viewing the movie, I was impressed with it's insight and its emotional and social commentary. But more than social commentary it is, though to some it may sound trite, a book of the heart and soul. For me it was spiritually cleansing and emotionally purifying. A book of beauty and love, a work which has become a personal favorite."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning to finish Persuasion, a revelation in itself because the first time I picked up the book during my vacation in Jamaica, I barely comprehended it and couldn't get into it and ended up putting it down in exchange for one of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery. I decide to start it from the very beginning, and after about five hours decided I would risk not being able to get up on time in the morning just to see how it all turns out.Jane Austen's books, I've decided, is a little like watching a Shakesperean play (or any of the other British-made films like Snatch or Trainspotting, it takes a while to fall in with the rhythm of the language. Your brain eventually trains itself to accept some of the archaic English as not being gobblelygook, and you find yourself falling into the plot and caring and even admiring the beautiful if somewhat stilted, language.Now I have to admit that I have come into my admiration for Jane Austen late in life (about two weeks ago and I'm 41), and not for not having had exposure to her, either. I do have a degree in English Literature, and Jane Austen is pretty much part of the standard reading requirement for any college or university. I also seem to own all of the books, and I seem to recall doing a paper on Northanger Abbey, even though I couldn't tell you right now what that was all about. This is, however, my first time reading Persuasion, if you don't count the time I tried to pick it up in Jamaica two weeks ago.As an English major, I know that I was supose to revere Jane Austen, but I never understood why. Earlier readings had left no indelible mark on my soul, but for some reason, this time around, I truly was enchanted. With Persuasion, I believe a lot of it had to do with how Austen carefully shapes her characters. These are true people to me, I fancy myself to be Ann, and her two sisters seem to me be just like my two sisters, without the power of the baronet and servants and estates and all that other good stuff that can only come with being a part of that genteel class. Austen lets me live in a world so different from my own, so fascinating in its examination and yet filled with so much of the problems and realities that we would encounter in our everyday lives.Persuasion is a study in human nature. Some might argue that the characters lack depth, for they are either kind and good, like Ann, or selfish and shallow, like her sister Elizabeth. I think though, the genius is in the presentation of such flawed characters - Austen is biting and unforgiving in her portrayals. She is best when she is exposing some unjustness of social mores or grossness of character. But to be fair, even the good can make mistakes and be misled, and the good themselves are trying to determine what their proper place is in this unjust world. It is their goodness which earns them their well-deserved happiness while the selfish and shallow (no one seems truly evil in this book), like in any good fairytale, get what they deserve."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"And, who doesn't? She's my favorite author and has been for a long time. I first read this book about 7 years ago and of course fell in love with it. I re-read it for a book club next week. I very rarely read books a second time. I think this is only my 3rd time.It is a beautifully-written book, like all her others. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot is persuaded by a family friend to not pursue a relationship with Captain Wentworth because of his inferior place in society. Many years later, she is reacquainted with him and her love for him has not diminished. She is unsure of how he feels about her. He is now a prestigious and admired captain; his station in life completely changed from before.They find each other in the same social circles, but his pride and her uncertainty of his feelings prevents them from reuniting. At some point, it is believed that each of them is attached to another.The novel has its funny assortment of characters just like all of Austen's works. And, Austen saves the wonderful union of Anne and Captain Wentworth for the last pages, as in her other books. But, that makes it sweet as you finally read the happy ending. I actually cried as I read the touching letter he writes to Anne at the end."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This was my favorite of all of Jane Austen's novels!

If a person believes himself or herself to be a well-rounded reader, but does not insist upon reading every major work of Austen's, they deceive themselves.I thought I had an adequate idea of Austen's works by watching the films &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; and &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. I decided to read these two books, simply out of curiosity as to how they would stand against the films. I found the movies to be lacking the absolute finest portions of each story, so I decided to read Austen's other works that I had not been familiar with.Persuasion, as well as everything I have read from the pen of Jane Austen, does not disappoint. Well, except that it does, eventually, end. It's worthy of as many accolades as her more famous works, and as the others do, causes a sense of general happiness in its reader."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"There are many reactions that an Austen fan gets when they confess themselves as such. Perhaps a shared fangirl squee. Maybe an \\"of course you are.\\" Plenty of times it's the admission of not getting Austen. Of not enjoying \\"romance novels.\\" Of being confused or bored by her prose.I carefully say that I am a fan, as I haven't yet made my way through all her works. More than anything, I love Pride and Prejudice with a deep, nostalgic, I've-read-it-a-million-times love.A friend of mine recently picked this up for a re-read, and her reading updates inspired me to give Persuasion a try. It took about three or four chapters before I liked Anne Elliot immensely and reading through the rest of the book was surprisingly easy. What Austen writes is more nuanced than just a romance novel. Her books, Persuasion included, are full of humor and smart commentary and little treats throughout the narration.I think it's all the better that my first time reading Persuasion has happened in my mid-twenties. Where while reading Pride and Prejudice I am all giggles and swoons, Persuasion had me relating and nodding sagely. Anne Elliot is the Austen character I've found so far the easiest to relate to. We've all had our opinions persuaded, we've all felt overlooked, we've all questioned the decisions of our family, we've all questioned our own past decisions. There we find Anne as she finds herself once again moving in the same social circle as Captain Wentworth, \\"the one that got away,\\" to put it tritely.Anne is to be appreciated as a more mature Austen character. She has many admirable traits and many quirks that made me like her. I loved that at 27, and sort of lost in the shuffle of her life, losing consequence and being overlooked, her happiest moments are when she feels useful. Yes, girlfriend. I also loved that often times, she had to retreat, and sit in silence and consider her own thoughts.Though I didn't feel the relationship between Wentworth and Anne quite as much as Darcy and Elizabeth, I loved the themes the plot set up let Austen explore. I loved the relationship between Admiral and Mrs. Croft. It is not often that Austen gives us peeks of long lasting, happy marriages, and in the Crofts she comments on what she thought it ought to be. Sharing the reigns while driving sort of thing. A second favorite moment came when Anne was discussing the differences in feeling between women and men. More than agreeing with anything that was said, I loved it in context. And, of course, that conversation led the way for THE romantic moment in the book, Wentworth's letter to Anne.At the end, I can't really compare this to Pride and Prejudice. I loved that one longer and better. That said, I also can't give Persuasion anything less than five stars. For any faults you might find in Austen, she was not a one hit wonder. Here she provides another book to fall in love with, and I have no doubt that I will visit Anne again. And again, and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"My favorite Austen book with Pride and Prejudice a very close second. This is a faster read packed with emotional impact and enjoyable characters."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Tantor Media ordinarily produces superb quality audio books -- for example, the Pride and Prejudice recording. However, Tantor's choice of recording artist for Persuasion coupled with overly-long chapters, falls way short of the kind of recording that Jane Austen deserves. This review is not about the novel, which I think is lovely, if not superlative, like Pride and Prejudice or Emma. The recording artist speaks Anne Elliott's parts in an almost-whisper with a slow cadence -- almost like a young schoolgirl's voice. This is not only contrary to the character, who is strong and smart, but is really ridiculous! Anne is an adult and should speak in an adult voice. Also, the artist over-enunciates long and complicated words -- as though she is seeing them for the first time. Therefore, the recording as a whole lacks the smoothness and polish that Austen's writing provides. As for the chapters, Tantor cheapens the MP3 recording by having one track per Austen chapter, which means that some of the climactic chapters are well over 30 minutes long. If one wants to back up and listen to a missed line -- say when driving -- one has to listen to the whole of the chapter (at least that is how my car's MP3 player functions). If Tantor wanted to produce a more user-friendly production, the tracking would be every 5-10 minutes at most. So overall, a disappointing production of a lovely novel. Even so, I have listened to this audio books at least three times so far, and probably will again."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been expressed in the earlier 200+ reviews. This romance is delightful and the focus on second chances was especially appreciated. I think if Austen had lived longer, she would have gone over the book more throughly. The end did feel a little rushed. However, it still had wonderfully drawn characters and a completely satisfying romantic ending.Specific to Kindle: Several errors around quotation marks -- blocks of description or narrative were put into quotation marks, making them seem like part of a conversation. While it was easy to tell what was going on after a line or two, it was still annoying."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I found myself completely immersed in Jane Austen's Persuasion. It was a book that I could not put down for I did not want to leave the fascinating world that Ms. Austen has created. Anne and Captain Wentworth were lovely characters and I enjoyed following them throughout their journey. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a beautiful romance novel or a great story in general."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"What is my favorite Jane Austen book? Not that I don't love them all but that honor would have to go to Persuasion. It's more mature in tone than her other works, featuring an older heroine. Anne Elliot is 27 and has lost her bloom after being persuaded to break off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth 8 years previously. I love Anne Elliot and it's a tough call to choose between her and Elinor Dashwood for a favorite heroine.Unlike some of Austen's other books, my opinion on this one hasn't really changed at all over the years. I've loved it from the first time I read it and my love has only grown with each rereading. I had the impression before reading it that it would be more on the depressing side, like Mansfield Park, but it's really not. It has the usual cast of satirical, amusing side characters, like the vane Sir Walter and snobby Elizabeth, the hypochondriac Mary, etc. I feel like it's the most romantic of Austen's works as well. You can feel the tension of the unspoken feelings between Anne and Wentworth throughout the whole book until it all comes out in Wentworth's beautiful letter. It makes me swoon every time!The only complaint I really have for this book is that it's so short and a bit truncated. I believe Austen's failing health made her rush things a little bit and cut out some originally planned material. IIRC, she had intended to include some more about Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Clay, but I'm okay with how it ended up."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I purchased this book to read as an assignment for school in my British Literature class and am extremely pleased. I was not sure if I would like Jane Austen but this is an well written love story that kept me wanting to read more with every page I turned. Excluding the first chapter that explains how important family is to Sir Walter Elliott and Elizabeth of course. Although it is important to understand why most actions are done in the book.[...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This was a typical Jane Austen love story and a well-written piece. I actually found it quite quick. My only gripe is that this story (compared to \\"Mansfield Park\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\") is quite incomplete in descriptions about the mannerisms between some characters *at the time of their occurance* that, though explained fully in the last couple of chapters, a reader would not find them as easily recognizable as one would hope. I was slightly shocked to see the motives behind two of the characters. It was a good read but it did feel a little incomplete."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Austen's novels are characterized by their limited plot and their freedom from deep philosophical musings, complicated image patterns and symbolism. As a result the reader is presented with a skilfully crafted novel in which setting, character delineation, acute observation of social interaction, accuracy and realism are all very important. The early novels were characterized by the use of irony, humour and satire. These are much less evident in Persuasion, as Austen seemed more concerned with the sympathetic and sensitive expoloration of her heroine's character and situation. Persuasion is a simply structured novel, for its plot is concerned only with bringing Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth together. A major theme of the novel is Austen's examination of pride and vanity - pride in one's social position and vanity of one's personal appearance. The idea of persuadability is tied up with another major concern of the novel - the right quality of mind. As the novel develops, Austen strives to achieve a right balance between contrasting opposites. I started to read the book reluctantly (as it was for school); but when I was familiar with the characters and the language, it was very enjoyable. If you have ever been in love, or thought yourself to be, or even had a crush on someone; you will identify with Anne Elliot's behaviour when she is around Captain Wentworth. It was amazing how real the characters came to be, and the events which occured can be compared of those today. I recommend the book to anyone with an interest in love stories. It was the first Austen book I have read, and it will not be the last."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too \\"nice\\" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes. Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's *Persuasion* was her last book before she suddenly, unfairly died, and it is profoundly different than her earlier works.In this book, Anne Elliot, the protagonist, is past the bloom of her youth, all of 27 years old. She gave up the love of her live, Captain Wentworth, when she was twenty because she was persuaded that he was not socially a proper match for her. Considering the vast importance of a proper match, or a good match, in Jane's earlier works (such as *Pride & Prejudice* in which Lizzy Bennet, who is essentially penniless and perhaps soon to lose her home, makes the ultimate \\"good match\\" in which she marries Pemberly, er, Mr. Darcy) it is interesting in this book how Jane examines the results of declining a socially and economically imprudent match. Anne Elliot's life is blighted when she gives up love merely because Wentworth is not enough for her. She becomes an old maid. This book is an admonition to the flighty young girls who sought \\"good matches\\" at the expense of love. It's a grown-up's book.*Persuasion* also funny as all heck. That first sentence, \\"SIR WALTER ELLIOT, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt,\\" is a damning statement about people who don't read good literature, but only read books of mere facts, like the Peerage. Anne's older sister is just as daft and great for an eye-rolling laugh.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I have read all of Austen's novels except Northanger Abbey, and I found this one to be in the top three, along with EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (my personal favorite). This book is very unique compared to her other masterpieces.Let's begin with a summary. Anne Elliot fears life as an \\"old maid\\" as she reaches the age where most women during the pre-Victorian era are supposed to be married. She regrets not marrying the one man she truly loved, Captain Wentworth. At the time, he was not considered suitable. Now almost seven years later, Wentworth returns, having made his fortune and is now considered a fair prospect. Now every girl is fawning over the strong, sea worn Captain Wentworth. Emotions Anne thought she could never feel again overpower her. Despite her attempts to control her emotions, she realizes that there is no man she could even consider marrying over him. The question now is does he feel the same way? This is a page turning novel that you just keep reading wondering if Anne and Wentworth will ever get it together.I found this novel so different in a good way for many reasons. First, there really isn't any fair leading lady or dashing young man. Anne Elliot, I believe, is Austen's most realistic character. Don't get me wrong EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE fans, I love Emma and Elizabeth and admire them for all their characteristics. However, I find myself wishing I was them rather than relating to them. I loved how Anne was quiet, but beautiful and witty at the same time. She also is very proper and doesn't really know how to compose herself in front of the man she loves. She is too influenced by what other people think, like many of us. I personally loved reading about a character who I myself can relate to in many ways. Yes, Anne is flawed but she's real.Second is the eternal question that haunts us all when crossed in love....does he feel the same way? Austen was an early psychologist of her time and really understands human behavior. I loved how Anne (and Wentworth as we find out in the end) really is fearful of getting hurt and really doesn't know what to do with herself. It's just so real and life like and I guess she gets lucky because of the ticking clock with Wentworth, but I believe it provided hope for those during Austen's time and now who are faced with the same problem. I loved how Austen wrote about this which I think really kept me reading the book.Well, I could spend all day talking about this book, but basically I'm saying read it, it's not quite as long and detailed as Austen's other works but strong at the same time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Many would have Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; determine her status as one of the greatest of all novelists; however, this critic will always stand by the quiet and profound maturity that defines this lovely masterpiece &quot;Persuasion.&quot; Here the characters are all terribly human and flawed and the narrative so touching without ever resorting to maudlin prose. There is an underlying sadness in this book which tells the reader that at some point in her life, Jane Austen loved deeply. This book is a celebration of that love; indeed, she would not have felt comfortable mourning it before her family or her readers. Therefore, instead of indulging in self-pity, Austen gratifies the soul by telling the story of one woman who refuses to sacrife her integrity and &quot;secures&quot; the man she loves in her way and in her time.

But she's not sure if he does! Especially with the Musgrove sisters now in the picture. Not that she's lacking for suitors, but they just pale in comparison with Capt. W!What a classic. Jane Austen, 200 years ago had the romance and chemistry right. Even for an ordinary girl like Anne who had let love pass by her once! Oh the suspense. You didn't know which Musgrove sisters Captain W was going to choose... let alone be sure if he even harbored any feelings for Anne! Or was Anne going to fall for the smooth and suave Mr. Elliot, her cousin? But all the waiting was worth it. Oh, the letter that he writes to Anne at the end is so worth it! I think the romance between Anne and Capt. Wentworth rivals any of the contemporary romance stories."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austenites such as myself dive in most willingly and blissfully into her stories. We bask in the sway of waves bearing her lively pitch, her precise and playful interaction with the language - and we bemusedly acknowledge that such magic has never even yet come close to being rejuvenated by anyone, despite so many attempts made within the some 200 years since her novels were written.PERSUASION quaintly commences on a quiet country estate in Regency England, and on a fanciful whim journeys on through to the seaside resort of Lyme, thence onward through the social promenade of Bath. The story follows Anne Elliot, daughter of snobby baronet, Sir Walter Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter, in between older sister Elizabeth, the apple of her father's eye, and married younger sister, Mary Musgrove. Jane Austen makes very good use of her exquisite wit in the depictions of shallow, haughty Elizabeth and selfish, frivolous Mary.Anne, however, is cut from a different cloth. Having fallen in love at age 19 or 20 with a handsome young man of no fortune, Anne denies her passion for what she sees as her duty and breaks her engagement with Frederick Wentworth - after, of course, some persuasion from Lady Russell, a friend of her late mother. Then, some eight years later, after Anne has apparently lost her youthful bloom, Captain Wentworth returns - still very handsome, and now quite rich after having made his fortune in the Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.As Captain Wentworth brandishes warm, flirtatious attention upon the young, lively Musgrove sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, sisters of Mary's husband Charles, Anne silently harbours the certainty that her deep affection and love for Wentworth had never faded despite all those years apart from him, and that his aloofness bears witness that his feelings for her have forever disappeared. She all the while keeps those pangs of loss and regret subdued, and stays steadfast in her knowledge of what is right and what is good in the complex modes of interaction with others. After her father's frivolity with money has necessitated moving his family to Bath and leasing out his estate, Kellynch hall, Anne must search for her place in the world.Although PERSUASION may not be the wittiest, nor the liveliest, nor the brightest or most luminous of the six novels written by Jane Austen, one cannot deny that it is perhaps the most moving. Our heroine's allure takes the reader gently into that era of innocent romance, that beautiful country where sometimes what once had been lost might inexplicitly, almost magically, be found...if sought."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"&quot;Persuasion&quot; was Jane Austen's last novel, and the more sober and pensive quality of the book, as compared to some of her earlier works, most notably &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, reflects her maturity both in age and as a writer; no one in their early 20's could have written this book. The heroine of &quot;Persuasion&quot; is Anne Elliot, seven years after she rejected, at her family's insistence, the young man she had fallen in love with at 19, when he was just starting a naval career and was too poor, in the eyes of her pretentious relatives, to be considered acceptable marriage material. Now he has returned, financially secure and promoted to captain, and she finds herself still in love with him. Without giving away the rest of the plot, the book gives a powerful argument for following one's heart instead of the prejudices and snobbisms of society. Anne does not have the same appeal to many modern readers as Elizabeth Bennet; she is more shy, retiring and reflective. But as the book progresses and she finds the strength to act on her feelings, she grows in personality and character. This final work by one of the greatest writers (and my personal favorite) in the English language is a lasting testimony to her incredible talents as a novelist."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This is the last novel that Jane Austen finished before she died.

Captain Wentworth comes back eight yers later, successful and rich looking for a wife. Jane Austen weaves her magin threads and the story unfolds with unforgettable characters and final union of two people who had loved each other all these years inspite of social prejudice and class difference.Of all leading men in her books, Captain Wentworth is the most dashing man with his good looks, intelligence and fearlessness of a strong man who knows his own value inspite of social injustice.This is the kind of book to read over and over again. and every time you read, Jane Austen will take you to the charming regency time in Bath."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"While more expensive versions may have slightly better readers this version was overall a great value."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"In my opinion, this is Jane Austen's greatest book. Anne Elliot is a beautifully written character, and Austen subtly conveys her strength of mind and depth of emotion with the best of her skills. Many critics have declared that Austen's greatest talent was creating characters that stay in character without getting stagnant, and I think this novel is the best showcase for that talent. Though often not as comical as some of her other works, this novel is a beautiful portrait of hopeless lovers, and the dialogue (always done well by Austen) is superb. What makes this novel stand-out in my mind, is that though it includes somewhat less of the social satire than her other books (though it is of course still present), it creates a very honest portrait of family relations and how filial duty can not always inspire love, even in the best-mannered of individuals.For those wondering what exactly makes Austen a truly classic author, and not just a fun feminine writer, I suggest a close reading of Persuasion."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Although Persuasion is generally overshadowed by Jane Austen's more well-known novel, Pride and Prejudice, this is a beautifully written, poignant love story about the strength and endurance of love. Anne receives a proposal she very much wants to accept but is discouraged by a friend of the family who is advising her in the place of Anne's deceased mother. Anne listens, breaks off the relationship, and then regrets her decision. She turns down at least one other proposal that we know of (Charles, who later marries her sister) because she still hasn't gotten over her love for Wentworth. Through a series of coincidences, Anne meets her beau again eight years later and the spark is still there although they both try to keep their feelings hidden. They finally acknowledge their love for each other and ignore the protests of friends and family who would keep them apart. There's a very interesting discussion between the characters in the book about who keeps love alive the longest in the absence of the one they love -- men or women. If you haven't tried this one yet, I think you'll find it very satisfying."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persusion is the story of Anne Elliot, a girl trapped in a classic example of listening to bad advice.Anne falls for the charming Captain Wentworth, and after many sunny days spent toghether, the couple decides to marry.When Anne tells this to her dear and only friend, Lady Russell, she is informed that he is too poor and far below her status as a daughter of a baronet. After succumbing to Lady Russell's persuasion, a broken-hearted Anne ends the engagement. The miserable pair then goes their separate ways.Eight years later, the Elliots are struggling for money and decide to lease their house and move to Bath,leaving Anne with her sister Mary. Who should be their new tenant, but Cpt. Wentworth's brother. Anne and Wenworth are soon thrown together again. This begins a journey of reconciliation, leaving the reader with the constant question,\\"Will they forgive their past and rekindle their love?\\"I thought this was an excellent literary classic that truly captures the point and makes a great romance without being sappy or the characters being shallow. I would recommend this book for middle school on up, and primarily for girls. I can't picture many males sitting still for this one. The characters are perfectly molded, and some, like Sir Walter are humorous and very entertaining.I would give Persusion 5 stars and 2 thumbs for an excellent novel!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"The subject of unlikely love is one we will never grow tired of, and as long as that is true, Jane Austen is an author we will always treasure. She always gives us such enthralling glimpses into live in nineteenth century England that we can little help but wish ourselves back to a time when love was courtly and appearances were everything. Somehow, she knew that love went beyond her society's rules. She knew that rank and name were not enough to silence love. In PERSUASION, she gives us all that she gave us in Pride and Prejudice. We shake our heads at the embarrassing families, yearn for the hero and heroine to admit their feelings to each other, and long for the man who causes trouble between the heroes to just go away. But, this time, not only do we have the suitor who keeps the man of our heroine's dreams at a distance, we have a malicious sister. We see Anne struggle with internal and external pressures while she deals with the seemingly outright malice of her sister, Elizabeth. Elizabeth is mean! She is not indifferent or aloof, but downright nasty and greedy. Her sister's happiness is something she would rather not see until her own is firmly in place, and she seems like the type to use sabatoge to succeed. I, for one, will never tire of reading of the ups and downs of a forbidden or unlikely love, and always feel a sense of exultation when the dashing man and striking young woman finally feel free enough to admit their feelings to one another, despite the dirty looks their pairing may draw."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Having read all of Jane Austen's books, I've been very impressed with her style. Reading Persuasion, I immediately noticed the difference between shy Anne Elliot and Jane Austen's other characters: Emma, Elinor and Marianne, Elizabeth Bennet, Fannie Price, and Catherine Morland. Anne is not the most beautiful, the cleverest, or the most-spirited. She is shy, quiet, thoughtful, somewhat plain, and honest. She reacts to emergency situations calmly and clearly, proving that she does have a backbone. I think the fact that she is older and more mature than Austen's other characters shows a maturity in Austen's writing. I highly recommend this book to those who love Jane Austen and can understand being shy and strong."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"is Austen's novel which begins with Anne Elliot thinking about a lost love instead of a future love.Beautifully written, it is a novel that makes readers wonder if there is going to be the \\"characters meet and finally get married\\" ending that is so typical in Austen novels. Anne Elliot is 27, unmarried, and living at home with her father and older unmarried sister who are concerned about appearing more wealthy than they actually are. When the family is convinced by Lady Russell to rent out their home and move to a more economical space, Anne ends up going to care for her younger sister Mary Musgrove.Anne's visit with her sister's family becomes uncomfortable once Captain Wentworth becomes a frequent visitor there. Wentworth is the love that Anne regretfully let slip away, having been influenced by her good friend Lady Russell that his social status was inferior to Anne's. Wentworth and Anne are both convinced that their relationship is over and their communication with one another is formal, yet limited.Anne is not sure what to make of Captain Wentworth's interest with Louisa and Henrietta (Charles Musgrove's sisters), and more than one gentleman takes a romantic interest in Anne. Both Anne and Wentworth distance themselves from each other in an attempt to forget that they ever loved each other.It is when Anne is away from Wentworth, and at home with her father and sister that she begins to realize how much she loves Wentworth. She wonders if she is too late, if the chance for love has really passed. Even though she loves Wentworth, Anne is still concerned about what her father and Lady Russell will think of him.Readers can only speculate as to the ending of the novel, which appears to be more uncertain than the endings in Austen's other novels. The art of persuasion, as well as social status, and the contrasting views of the elders and the youth, makes this novel one of Jane Austen's best."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"It's another great book of Jane Austan.

Her diction is very fine, she is a joy to listen to, and the sensitivity and perceptiveness of a Jane Austen heroine comes across in the narration.This version is abridged. About 40% of the words are retained and 60% discarded. The plot comes across intact, but much of what makes the novel great (the asides, reflections, commentary) is discarded. If you don't mind sitting for a 9-hour version instead of this 4-hour version, check out the unabridged \\"Persuasion\\" audiobook read by Juliet Stevenson. Ms. Stevenson comes across as more of a neutral observer, but she changes her voice more for the various characters.That's not to take away from Amanda Root's uniquely fine reading. If you're big on \\"Persuasion\\", get both. That's what I did."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface?

It is however the polished work of a mature author, and easily holds its own with her other finished novels.As the story opens, Sir Walter Elliot, a vain and foppish baronet facing bankruptcy, is persuaded to rent his home and move his family to Bath in order to economize on expenses. The middle daughter, Anne, unmarried and ignored by her family, is shocked to learn that the prospective renters are an Admiral Croft and his wife, whose brother is one Frederick Wentworth. Eight years earlier, Wentworth, then a young naval officer lacking wealth and status, had wooed Anne, who was persuaded by her mentor, Lady Russell, to reject his suit on the grounds of his lack of prospects. The kind-hearted but much put-upon Anne is left behind by her family to close up the house and to take care of her hypochondriac married younger sister Mary, who lives nearby.While visiting with Mary and her husband Charles Musgrave, Anne encounters the now Captain Wentworth, wealthy with prize money and looking for a potential wife among Charles' two sisters. Wentworth is distant and correct with Anne. When Wentworth proposes a visit to the seaside village of Lyme Regis, Anne is included in the group. While there, Wentworth appears to settle on Louisa Musgrave, only to have Louisa be seriously injured in an accident. The practical Anne takes charge in the crisis, causing Wentworth to take renewed notice of her.Anne ends up in Bath, where her family pursues a meaningless round of social calls. A handsome and long-missing cousin materializes to reconcile with the Elliots and to pay court to Anne. The long-suffering Anne must balance his suspicious attentions with the unclear intentions of Wentworth, who follows Anne to Bath.Anne still loves Wentworth, but hardly dares to hope that he will pass up younger and more attractive women to renew his relationship with her. The inarticulate Wentworth finally finds his voice in a note to Anne, giving her another chance to make the right choice.In this final novel, Anne wrestles with a dilemma common to Austen heroines, whether to marry for love or money and security. The younger Anne was persuaded not to marry for love because Wentworth lacked the money and prospects to give her the security of her station in life. In revisiting that choice, Anne concludes that the advice was correct under the circumstances but proven wrong by subsequent events. Anne believes in marrying for love; the further implication of her internal argument is that she and Wentworth should have waited for each other while he acquired the financial security necessary for their successful life together.\\"Persuasion\\" is a well-written and moving story, filled with the usual well-developed characters and often biting social commentary of a Jane Austen novel. It is very highly recommended to her fans and to those readers looking for an excellent period romance."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I would recommend reading the book before or after seeing any adaptation of Persuasion. It helps to get to know the main characters a little better. Buying this book is well worth the money, because you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Austen's wit and character analysis is brilliant."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion, Austen's final completed novel, is set in 1814, an interlude in the long Napoleonic wars. The men are home from the campaigns, with fortunes made and loves lost. It is a time for healing and renewal, while time allows. Austen herself was in deteriorating health and did not have long to live. For her characters too, there is a sense of time running out.In fact, although it is completed, there are signs that Austen would have reworked or further developed some of it, had she lived. A major character (the one who did the initial persuading) is never fully realized, other characters are similarly neglected toward the end, and the novel is relatively short.Persuasion does not have the depth of characterization of Pride and Prejudice, or quite the passion. It also lacks the cynical edge that is found in much of her work. The prose never reaches the sublime heights that she achieves elsewhere, but it is always very fine nonetheless. This makes for a slighter, more comfortable read, and a promise that, only love faithfully, and autumn must somehow pass into summer.There are references in the novel which will be obscure to most of today's readers (for example, \\"the inimitable Miss Larolles\\") and an edition with notes would be a good idea, if you can find one. The Signet Classic edition has no notes, but has quite a good introduction by Margaret Drabble, although it summarizes the plot, so read it after the novel, not before."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This came in a timely faschion.

They get engaged but her mother's great friend and her own trusted friend, the widow Lady Russell, persuased Anne to break the engagement with him. The reason for this is, that the young officer possesses no connections to the upper-class and is therefor not worth to be with Anne according to Lady Russel.But after eight years, Anne, who truly loved Frederick Wentworth, is still unmarried and destined for spinsterhood. Until her mother has lived there was no problem with the income at the Elliot family, but according to the fact that her father wasn't careful with the money, they are now facing the situation that the family estate is gone to Admiral Croft, Wentworth's brother-in-law and the Elliots (Anne's father Sir Walter Elliot, her elder sister Elizabeth) need to move from Kellynch hall to Bath.Before Anne moves to Bath she spends some time with her younger sister Mary and her husband Charles Musgrove, as well as his sisters Louisa and Henrietta at Uppercross. Captain Wenthworth so far had success in the wars, which brought him a considerable fortune and now he is looking for a wife to get settled ashore. He and Anne meet again at Mary's and Charles house, but though Anne still has feelings for him she tries not to show them clearly. And furthermore Louisa\`s and Henrietta\`s trials to flirt with Frederick Wentworth and get him attracted, makes it more difficult for Anne to be in the focus.But on a day-walk at Lyme Regis it came to an accident when Louisa falls from a cliff thinking that Captain Wentworth catches her, which he didn't. The only person being calm and starting to organize the necessary steps to be taken after this accident was Anne. This inititates that Captain Wentworth's feelings for Anne came back. But when they slowly start their relationship again, there is another admirer of Anne, her cousin William Elliot, who seperates them again by spreading rumours that he and Anne are going to marry soon...This is a wonderful heart-moving novel and the letter at the end written by Frederick Wentworth to Anne is absolutely romantic. But this novel is also full of irony, for example when Mary wants to follow her husband for a dinner while here son is ill and she makes recommends about men and women, or when it is spoken about Bath (a place Jane Austen hated herself much): But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!

When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together.

Still, a good read, if you're an Austen or romance novel fan."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This book might have been a small chapter of a tremendous book. Perhaps it was curtailed by intent. A shallow, somewhat childish plot serves as background for significant character development of Anne Elliot, initially portrayed as a shy retiring late 20s wallflower, but every character, including her Wentworth, view Anne as an intelligent obviously gorgeous woman. What we do have in Persuasion is the admirable psychological manipulation by Anne of her own environment, and though we may be less than entranced by a tale of the English idle rich, we do have a woman of strong mind weaving through a soap opera society of parties, walks by the sea and cards. If able to ignore the vacuous background of the novel, we have good, somewhat humorless auto-pilot type writing showing perhaps more potential than actual accomplishment. I read Pride and Prejudice 30 years ago and remember absolutely nothing about it except that I liked the book. Persuasion very likely will leave a similar impression."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen wrote Persuasion as her last novel. She influenced her characters to be moderate people who lived within the same town as she grew up in. This town is to be called Bath.Anne, the main character of the novel, is the sister of Elizabeth and Mary. The family is well respected in town. They live with their father, Sir Walter Elliot, who without great thinking puts the family into dept. They then move to Bath and leave their house to Admiral and Mrs. Croft. Mrs. Croft is Captain Wentworth's sister, the man Anne had once fallen so deeply in love with. Anne goes and visits the Musgrove family where again she meets Captain Wentworth after not seeing him for so long. The Musgrove family, have two children and Captain Wentworth focuses his attention on one in particular.They travel to see another family in which Mr. Elliot falls in love with Anne. After only knowing her for a short period of time they later find out that they are cousins. Anne forgets about Captain Wentworth for awhile and focuses her attention on Mr. Elliot. They become engaged and Anne finds out Mr. Elliot's motives. Forgiving Mr. Elliot Anne stays with him. As time goes by she hears that Captain Wentworth proclaims that his love for her has never gone away.Jane Austen portrays the story as a love story but with a little twist and turn to it. Where family members fall in love and sides are taken. Based in the pas it has a present kind of love to it. Love triangles, family ties, and friendships that go on and off.Persuasion needs a lot of attention. You have to focus on the little details and be interested in old literature and the time period in which the book was based and written in. There were certain things that become uncertain and unclear to understand.The way Jane writes isn't really as typical as most books teenage children would read. She sets her stories on other books she has written and being sick while writing this book, it could have been a little better. Not to say it was a horrible book, but you really have to have the time and heart to read it.If you are a serious reader and can really get into a book, this is a good choice. It portrays a love story that could happen in today's society but has other aspects that allows you to know that it was set back in a time period when love wasn't the one thing everyone was looking for and willing to talk about."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This is probably my least favorite Jane Austen novel.

Definitely one of the most hopeful and satisfying endings and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"My first impression of Persuasion was that Jane Austen writes some interesting and detailed characters. Right from page one, Sir Walter was my favorite character. He's a jerk, yeah, but he's hilarious. I don't know that the characters in this book are as modern as they are in say Pride and Prejudice, but the author's brutal honesty, especially about the less appealing characters, is always entertaining. The whole story made me really think about how much other people influence our lives and whether or not that is always a good thing.And can Jane Austen write a romance. The flirting, the dashing hero that you want but can't have, and that beautiful love letter! I do have to say that there was one major climactic scene that just felt cheesy to me. Oh the horror!

It's all very tedious. I don't find a clever word or thought in her books. I only got through 1/2 this book, and then, in boredom, threw it aside for SINISTER STREET by Compton Mackenzie. Besides, there were many characters introduced throughout the novel, and I couldn't keep them in mind. They were not at all developed as characters. They were relatives and friends, and I didn't care about any of them for they were not portrayed in enough detail to distinguish them apart.I guess, I will give up on Austen.

Most great literature is so wonderful because of its timelessness, touching on universal feelings and ideas. While it may have been groundbreaking in its time, it is so dull now. We women have already established our desires of equality in culture and have already acknowledged at least an inkling of what feminine independence is but this novel is a back step. Also, it is so predictable. Of course all of the characters will end up married, and most likely to their man of choice. This book is dull and predictable and is restricted by its time period. If you want to delve into the past then maybe pick it up, but otherwise, it's unexciting, and it still feeds on social classes and marriage as a woman's reliance on a man for social and fiscal support."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This little book took a bit longer than usual to fall on my doorstep, but I was impressed with the quality of the book as it was bought used.

It is often criticized for being too short and not up to par with Austen's other novels. Persuasion was in fact written during the onset of the disease that eventually killed the author. Her final novel may indeed be considered different from her previous novels. It is the only Austen novel where the female protagonist is close to becoming a spinster. Persuasion is a very different type of novel with a love story told in retrospect, an unexpected villain, and an unintentional, but very bad piece of advice that negatively impacts many lives.The main protagonist in this book is Anne Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot. Sir Elliot was once a man of property and weath, but his ostentatious manner of living has considerably dimished his fortune. The great Elliot family retain only a much respected name and a fine estate named Kellynch Hall. Sir Walter is forced to confront his inability to retain the standard of living once enjoyed at the estate. He is asked to consider many options, including trimming down the number of servants, but all options seem appalling to the proud Sir Elliot.Under the advice of a family friend, Sir Elliot agrees to let Kellynch Hall and retire to Bath with his eldest and middle daughter. Sir Elliot is not the only one in the family who takes the advice of the much respected Lady Russell, a widow and friend of the deceased Lady Elliot.Anne Elliot was once engaged and very much in love with a poor, but honorable naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. Anne, however, broke off the engagement after Lady Russell convinced her that it would be a grave mistake for a young lady of her station to marry someone so far beneath her.Eight lonely years go by for Anne, and the years have not been kind to her. The author writes that her beauty has considerably dimished. One who may have known Anne years ago would hardly find her recognizable. Over the years, Anne has forced herself not to think \\"of that person\\" as Anne often refers to Frederick Wentworth. The reader is immediately aware of Anne's lingering feelings for the man she heartlessly and foolishly rejected.She is forced to confront her feelings when the family that leases Kellynch Hall turn out to be relations of now wealthy Captain Wentworth. There is much awkwardness and dread as Anne prepares to face the man she once loved and let go. Captain Wenworth, however, appears indifferent and one would hardly suspect from his cold behavior towards Anne that the two were ever even acquainted!Throughout the novel Anne desperately looks for and finds small little details in Captain Wentworth behavior that the love he had for her has not diminished entirely. But can he forgive her for snubbing him?I absolutely adored this novel about the one who got away, but there is so much more to the story than just Anne and Captain Wentworth. The book is full of lively characters, such as Anne's pompous father, her self-indulgent sister, Elizabeth, and many others. Most people are aquainted with Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but Persuasion should be recognized for the fine novel that it is."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This was the first JA book I've ever read, I really enjoyed it, and not in small part because of the footnotes, and discussion included in this penguin edition.

That is what Anne Elliot does. Frederick Wentworth is a dashing naval officer, but well beneath Anne's station. She is, after all, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, baronet and master of Kellynch Hall. Not only is Wentworth a penniless officer, he is also ambitious and confident. According to Anne's particular friend Lady Russell, those qualities are unbecoming in a man. And so, out of safety, Anne severs her engagement to Wentworth. Fast-forward eight years. Anne is now twenty-seven, still single, still disinclined to marry. Her father has little money and is now forced to let Kellynch Hall to a well-respected admiral. Among the admiral's society is Anne's former fianc&eacute;, now Captain Wentworth, well respected and very rich. Anne's love for Wentworth reemerges, but is it too late? Is his indifference so big that he won't even speak to her? Could she somehow persuade him to give their love another try?This is Jane Austen's final finished work. It was published in 1818, one year after her death. Persuasion is a masterpiece and my second favorite Austen (after Pride and Prejudice). This novel contains Austen's signature comedy of manners, but it's not her funniest effort. It is, however, her most romantic. Whose heart doesn't break when Anne watches Wentworth court both the Musgrove sisters, and listens to her sister and brother-in-law argue over who Wentworth should choose to be his bride? Who hasn't choked up with The Letter? (Persuasion fans know what I'm talking about.) This is the third -- or is it the fourth? -- time I read this book, and I still tear up when I read that bit! Persuasion is a wonderful novel, but it isn't perfect. Various secondary characters are either one-dimensional or underdeveloped, and I would have liked the scenes in Lyme to be expanded, for those are my favorite scenes. Alas, if you're an Austen fan, there is plenty of her signature stuff here: the pretentious gentry, the unscrupulous opportunists, the parties and get-togethers and courtships and descriptions of the countryside. I like that this novel is partly set in Bath, giving it the genuine Regency setting that makes Jane Austen unique. If you've never read Persuasion, I cannot persuade you to read this enough! And if you've read this and are a fan, may I perhaps persuade you to read it again?"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Although also a romance like Austen's better known novels, Emma and Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is a subtle one, with a theme not of whirlwind passion but of constancy and devotion. The main character, Anne Elliott, was very much in love with Captain Wentworth as a young girl, but was persuaded by friends and family to reject him as a husband. Broken-hearted, Wentworth went to sea, and the novel actually begins when he re-enters Anne's life eight years later, having made his career and his money.Anne is a character to whom the reader can easily relate: introspective, analyzing everything and flawed, able to make make mistakes and recover from them. She narrowly averts an unhappy life by not letting her friends and family persuade her again to marry her cousin, who has money and manners but turns out to be quite despicable. And while Captain Wentworth does not have the dash or charm of a Mr. Darcy, he is Anne's one true love, as prone to the follies of a broken heart as she is subject to the strong influence of those around her.The underlying theme is about choices and following one's heart. If Anne had only listened to her own feelings instead of allowing others to sway her, she would have found happiness sooner. Despite what seems like an afterthought of a speech at the end of the novel, when Anne justifies her earlier behavior, this seems to be a strongly feminist novel, advocating the rights of women to choose their own way in life and their own partners for life, rather than be guided solely by considerations of fortune and class.This is also one of Austen's funnier novels, particularly the scenes featuring Anne's sisters and father, who are incredibly self-absorbed. Their dialogue--constantly misreading the situation in their own favor or stating something when the opposite is true--brings a welcome lightheartedness to the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I'm persuaded to find this a most charmingly written story.

In this reader's eyes, neither of these extremes occurred with \\"Persuasion.\\" It most definitely had its romantic moments. Captain Wentworth's culminating profession of love to heroine Anne make that case better than I ever could: \\"You pierce my soul. I am half agony and half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. ...

Her latest novel Persuasion continues the theme of society, love, and marriage and how money and jealousy interferes. Published posthumously, Persuasion is a dramatic story about persuading others of love, adhering to wishes of family and society, and the subtle hints that foretell every climatic chapter.Widower Sir Walter Elliot lives on his Kellynch-hall estate with his two daughters Elizabeth and Anne. Both girls had unsuccessful chances at marriage: Elizabeth was turned down by Mr. Elliot, a family cousin and heir to Sir Walter's estate who married a plain woman of fortune instead; Anne had a great affair with a Mr. (now Captain) Wentworth, a naval officer who had nothing--and was therefore ineligible--to marry Anne. As Sir Walter falls deeper into debt, the Elliot family leases the estate to an Admiral Croft in order to save money. And Admiral Croft, naturally, is a great friend of Captain Wentworth, who reappears eight years after he and Anne parted. Can Anne persuade Captain Wentworth to lover her once again? The answer lies in the story.Like in her other novels, Jane Austen incorporates the manners and social customs of the early 1800s in her novels. The novel speaks of the \\"great war\\" with Napoleon that the British Navy fought, and the characters are forever thinking about money and royal connections. Anne very much wanted to marry Captain Wentworth when the first fell in love. But English custom demands that a couple gets approval of their marriage from the bride's family. And as Captain Wentworth was poor at the time, the Elliots strictly forbade Anne from marrying him, and she didn't. Throughout the novel the characters also maintain an air of sophistication and elegance--an air required of everyone in the British court. And as Sir Walter Elliot was known in court, the whole family had to behave with \\"utmost decorum.\\"\\"It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\" (Austen 197).Foreshadow is prominent in the novel. In Chapter 2 both Captain Wentworth and Mr. Elliot are mentioned, assuring the reader that they will be prominent main characters. It was not until the end that the characters discover the reason behind Mr. Elliot's first marriage, but one character hinds that \\"money, money was all that he wanted\\" (Austen 178). After page 17 it becomes obvious to the reader what would happen between Anne and Captain Wentworth, for \\"repeating his name so often...was a new sort of trial on Anne's nerves\\" (Austen 44). Little hints along the way suck the reader deeper and deeper into the story.Although \\"Proper English\\" is intimidating when reading Jane Austen's stories, her plots are classics in love and marriage. Anyone who has gone through a painful break up or a dramatic relationship knows just how much money, family and jealously can ruin a relationship. Austen dramatically tells the stories of her heroines while maintaining a 19th century setting, and drops subtle hints along the way to keep readers hooked. Persuasion is a classic that is understood and loved by all who read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I am not quite sure why Persuasion is not quite as good asSense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice. It is a well constructedstory, and if anything, the secondary characters are more amusingthan those in her other novels. However, the main charactersare just too restrained (maybe repressed is a better wordhere). Their exchanges, and frequently lack thereof, makes it a bitfrustrating. However, this is still an excellent read - entertainingfrom start to finish."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Everyone else has said all there is to say about Austen, her writing, and this plot. I want to thank Penguin Classics for the endnotes in this edition. They were comprehensive, clear, attractively presented (instead of being wedged into the text), and helpful to 21st-century readers of this early 19th-century novel. The scholarly introduction (with a spoiler warning, how thoughtful!) and the biographical timeline help place the book in both literary and chronological context, and were substantive additions to this work."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This novel, written by the mature Jane Austen and published after her death, reveals the strengths of Austen's art. First, she is a careful and exact observer of human character, as compared to those that base a novel of emotion or behavior. Second, she is totally aware of class distinctions and the determinism that is created by a rigid class structure. She explores how character is independent of class but often mistakenly associated with upper class persons. Third, Austen is also a comedic writer, full of wit and funny portrayals of hypocrites, though many may find fault with my interpretation below since this aspect of Austen's art is rarely discussed. Fourth, Austen carefully portrays the world of 17th century upper class women which could be viewed as oppressive, paternalistic, and deterministic. However she continually portrays women as resilient actors rather than victims.She was a superb observer and interpreter of human character. This is different from those contemporary authors who are more likely to explore emotion and behavior. Character in the work of Austen is destiny and good character eventually leads to better outcomes and poor character leads to worse outcomes. Whereas at times her characters exhibit emotion, they are more likely to withhold emotion and when this withholding is done carefully and discretely, Austen would see this as signs of good character. Whereas she has high regard for honesty, she seems to see honesty as having both a proper method of presentation and to have proper timing in order to have impact. The letter Captain Wentworth writes to Anne Elliott at the end of the novel is a perfect example of suppressed emotion transformed into carefully strategically timed truth-telling.Class differences play and huge role in the works of Austen and Persuasion explores this with the romance of a rich girl of noble family in love with a handsome but middle class young man who both have reversal of fortune and 8 years later re-encounter each other. Anne Elliott is surrounded by a father, two sisters, and her deceased mother's best friend; all of whom use social class as a cognitive short hand for who is worthy and who is not. Anne is the character that can penetrate the smoke of social class to see the true strengths of character underneath. Interestingly, when Persuasion was written, the Napoleonic wars were over and many young men who made their fortunes in the British navy returned with fortunes into English society. Here the new rich encounter the old landed rich, a formula for social upheaval. Austen perfectly articulates this as the Elliott family vacates their ancestral home, Kellynch, and rent the mansion to an Admiral and his wife.Austen was witty and could be considered a comedic writer. Her descriptions of human folly, prejudice, snobbery, and hypocrisy are all skillfully handled. She never preaches. She allows the snob, the fool, the hypocrite to reveal themselves through their speech and interactions. The outburst of Anne's father, Sir Elliott, upon hearing this his daughter is visiting a sickly poor school friend instead of visiting barely know distant rich relatives is priceless.In summary, Austen's Persuasion is a good example of Austen's considerable skill at character analysis and revelation and development of character in social interactions and social contexts. She is delightful to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen. I give this book 5 billion stars."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is an utter delight to read. This book was written almost 200 years ago but the story could just as well have been written today. It is still fresh and gives a tremendous light on the life and mannerisms of people that lived long ago - nothing much has changed i take it! Jane Austen is witty and has the tremendous ability to describe situations and relationships. She is also the master of suspense. Persuasion is a moving story that describes the human ability to patiently and agonisingly wait for happiness or love as it were. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will never forget the character of Miss Anne Elliot. A delightful read indeed."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I hold very firmly to the belief that this book cannot be fully appreciated in a first reading.

Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"In Jane Austen's last novel, Persuasion, we meet the Elliot family: Sir Walter and his daughters, Elizabeth, Mary and the youngest daughter Anne.

When the reader meets Anne it is more than 8 years later and circumstances have brought her and the now Captain Frederick Wentworth back into each other's lives. Will they be able to rekindle their relationship or did Anne's initial refusal ruin all hope for them to be together...?Reading Jane Austen is truly refreshing!

I would recommend this book to any whose a Jane Austen fan."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is an interrupted love story, not as piquant as Austen's other novels, but stimulating and provocative in more subtle ways. In a way, it is a study of how we are influenced or persuaded to make choices in our lives, both from within and without, and it is also a study of character. Anne is by far the most likable character, and it is her innately good character that is contrasted with all the others, but for me, Anne is far too restrained to be wholly likable. In one scene, Anne translates an Italian libretto, which she does with great skill, but she refuses to go beyond mere translation and discuss the music due to its romantic nature, which would be inappropriate. The overriding concern for all the characters is always to be socially correct. Persuasion lacks any really spritied characters. But then, why should all stories have spirited characters? There's nothing wrong with a story about more ordinary people. And the way Austen has these \\"ordinary\\" people talking, it is pure literary pleasure to read and savor the English language expressed so eloquently."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"My sister had been raving about Persuasion, but after reading a few of Austen's books, I was very relunctant to read it. When I had to read something for English class, I chose Persuasion--hoping I wouldn't be bored out of my mind. Shortly, I was drawn into the world of the heroine: Anne Elliot, and could hardly put the book down! Although Persuasion is predictable, it is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"In my opinion, Persuasion is probably Heyer's most underrated book. Most people read Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibilty and Emma, but Persuasion doesn't get nearly as much attention, which is very sad as I think it's probably Austen's best-written novel. Perhaps people don't read it because it's about an \\"older\\" hero and heroine, and the heroine is not beautiful, nor is she very spunky or spirited. The story also develops in a much more subtle way than some of Austen's others. Whatever the reason for its lack of popularity, however, it definitely deserves a wider following.Not only is it the most romantic of Austen's books(in my opinion), but it also has the greatest characters! They're funny, silly, stupid, and manipulative- and therefore, completely memorable. And the hero and heroine are just the sort one wants to cheer for, and see settled happily. I admit that P&P;, S&S; and Emma are fun reads, and they'll always have a huge following. Persuasion won't ever reach that level of fandom, but it's definitely on my favorites list and deserves a reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is one of my favourite novels by Jane Austen. Like in all her other novels Jane Austen describes with wit and style the life of a cute heroin. At that point Anne Elliot is slightely different, because she found her real love when she was a young woman, but she had to break her engagement, because the family matters wanted her to. After a few years she still loves the man she broke up with. As she meets him again a couple of years later, he has made a lot of money as Captain . At first they try to keep out of their way, but that seems to be impossible. They meet eachother really often, because the relatives of Anne want him to mary one of their daughters. The love is still there , in both of them, but manners and doubts make it impossible to tell.Like in all Jane Austen's novels there are implications and disaccords that let you always hope for a Happy End .And for my opinion Jane Austen wrote the most romantic loveletter in that book."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Musgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Musgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Musgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"My husband got me the Kindle for Christmas. I'm an avid reader, and my husband and kids get tired of all the books around the house! I've found it enjoyable for reading many things (can't use it for textbooks where I need the pictures), and it is lightweight which I need for my joint problems.Anyway, I have always loved Jane Austen, but this was one book I hadn't read yet. I had read that this was one of her last books, and that some of the tone of her books changed as she got older. Austen died most probably with breast cancer, so she most probably was dealing with some symptoms at this point in her life. I don't know if she was aware of her situation, that she may die soon, but this book has a certain poignancy in it. It doesn't seem as hopeful or as humorous as her other books that look at life for women in the early 1800's.By this time, she knew she would not have an opportunity to marriage. It's sad that women in England back then, especially those of the trade class/genteel middle class, were so dependent upon men choosing who to marry. They couldn't hold jobs, they had no rights as concerns inheritance, everything in their future depended upon their getting married. But during their lifetime they knew nothing different. Austen dealt with all of these problems, and the very real possibility of injury and disease and death curtailing the lives of women in this novel.She also dealt with snobbishness among the upper classes. That part of the book is hilarious as usual. She really knew how to draw these people, and their attitudes.By the time I got halfway through this book, I had a hard time putting it down. I really wish someone would write of our day and age, in this tone and with this ability to draw people. I haven't ever seen a writer to compare with her...I don't think I ever will."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"At 19-years-old, Anne Elliot was a beauty who fell in love with naval officer Captain Wentworth. The two shared a whirlwind romance; but the fact that Captain Wentworth was lacking in the financial department, caused the two to part ways. It wasn't that Anne wanted to say goodbye to Captain Wentworth; she was more bullied into it by Lady Russell, a friend of her deceased mother. Ten years have passed. Anne is now twenty-nine-years-old. Over the years, she has met no other suitor who tickled her fancy in the way that Captain Wentworth was able to. Thus, she has never gotten married. The fact that her father, Sir Walter Elliot is heavy handed when it comes to spending only makes Anne more convinced that she will never have a significant other; after all, she would not have much in terms of money to bring to a relationship. But then Captain Wentworth comes back.While the ten years which have passed have done little to mar Anne Elliot's beauty, they have done much to decrease the amount of money still left within her family. As a baronet, Sir Walter Elliot is obsessed with keeping up with the times, this means draping himself in all sorts of fashionable garb, and displaying his social rank for the world to see. When not glancing at himself in mirrors, Sir Walter Elliot spends his time with the scheming, husband-hungry, Mrs. Clay. Mrs. Clay, who has befriended Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, would do anything to catch herself a husband. Elizabeth is the same way. Unlike Anne, Elizabeth is just as obsessed with social status as her father; and both Elizabeth and Sir Walter Elliot look down upon Anne. Anne's other sister, Mary, who is married and has children, looks down upon Anne just as her sister and father. Mary expects Anne to wait on her hand and foot at all times - even when she is a guest in her own home. Anne is usually happy to oblige; but when she finds that her home, Kellynch Hall, will be rented out, and that she and her family must take up residence in Bath, she is quite disappointed. That is, until she runs into Captain Wentworth. Captain Wentworth is more dashing than ever before, and Anne can't help but feel the same attraction to him that overwhelmed her ten years ago. But with so much time gone, Anne can't tell if Captain Wentworth still feels the same way about her; and with other women vying for his attentions, she can't help but wonder if the two of them will ever be together again.I will admit that it took me a few chapters to truly become interested in PERSUASION; but once I was introduced to Anne Elliot, there was absolutely no turning back. From the moment Anne Elliot enters the story, you can't help but fall in love with her. She is demure, kind, intelligent, spirited, and debonair, in her own right. She is so willing to please those surrounding her, that, at times, the reader can't help but wish that she would lash out, and speak up for herself. Yet, perhaps, if she did just that, she wouldn't be as much of an appealing, lovable character. Captain Wentworth's quiet, shy, timid persona can be infuriating at times, but he is still a dashing, handsome male lead that you can't help but swoon over. The confusion between Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot, regarding their relationship, can, at times be trying, as the reader wants to see the two of them together; but the mishaps produce a piece of dry humor that is entertaining and adds to the storyline. PERSUASION presents a whirlwind romance that you can't help but get swept up into!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Wow! Last night I stayed up to 2:00 am, determind to finish this book. I could not last the whole night without wondering the ending, whether it be happy or sad. And so, I finished my first Jane Austen book. I loved this book and everything in it. The characters were amazing!! If you haven't read this book you're missing out!! Now, if you are still in question as to whether you have the ability to read such a book, no worries! Just pick this book up and READ it!! You won't be sorry!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I have now read all of Austen's completed works and wrote reviews for all them as well ^-^. (I'm feeling very proud of myself by now) It's not my favorite, but it's definitely not the worst. And for Jane Austen, even the worst is an enjoyable, entertaining read; I only mean the worst compared to her other novels not on a general scale.To get down to the book, it was quite different from the others. Anne is twenty-eight at the start of the book, she is plain and unattractive having lost her \`bloom' seven years earlier due to the loss of her love, and isn't as witty and sparkling as Elizabeth Bennet or Emma. Yet you don't come to despise her; she's not weak. And when you come to think of it, her agreeing to break off her engagement with the hero was a wise thing to do at her age. If he hadn't acquired a great fortune or perhaps died in service, then where would she be? Plus the fact that she was young and smothered with disapproval all around and the woman she thought of as her mother was dead against the match.So anyway, she also has the most despicable family out of any of Austen's other novels-even Mansfield Park-they are conceited, selfish and self-important. The sad thing is that you realize that people like Sir Walter really exist, people who care solely for appearances and rank. Even Anne's sister Mary, perhaps the nicest sister, is selfish without really meaning it, and treats Anne the way a spoiled child treats it's parents; nicely when it wants something, but all the while thinking: what else do they have in their lives to do but to cater to all my whims?There are a few trivial things I didn't like: first that Sir Walter Elliot is such a snob; Walter is my absolute favorite name! Austen gave it a pretty bad impression. Secondly, I wish that James could have married Anne; I really liked him, much better than the hero, and he suited her so well! I didn't really like the hero of this book; I'm a sucker for the rich, dashing gentlemen of her other novels. You don't really know the hero of this book so well.Anyway, like all her books, the prose is outstanding, her usage of the language remarkable and the reader's attention is never lost; Austen's greatest gift. I have always loved Austen's style of writing, it's great! Great book, highly recommended! Add it to your classics shelf. Don't have one? Get one!!!=^-^="},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"As a big fan of Austen's, I read this book and wasn't disappointed. All of Austen's trademarks are there: her witty commmentary of the British elite, silly men and women who both exasperate and amuse you, and a good love story. Persuasion is about Anne Elliot, who after breaking off an earlier engagement with Captain Wentworth, is suddenly in his company 8 years later, and longing to rekindle the romance. This book wasn't as fun as Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the struggle between Anne and Wentworth doesn't resonate the same way as that between Elizabeth and Darcy. Neither characters are particularly arrogant (though Wentworth is hostile at being rejected before), but it's still interesting to see how the two will find one another among the silliness of the people and situations around them. Jane Austen just has a way of keeping her reader in suspense, no matter if you feel sure you know the ending. The question is always How will they get together rather than if, and the How here will please any romantic reader satisfactorily."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I downloaded the sample chapter onto my Kindle and yes, the line breaks are strange. It does not read flush left to flush right, but rather like poetry in couplets. Which is ironic, given how poorly poetry line breaks are done on many e-readers."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Austen created a literary treasure with this book. The story has all the the usual Austen charms, yet also deals with lost love, age and family pressures. Anne and Wemtworth are qonderful charecters."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"All of Jane Austen's heroines are unique in different ways; Emma Woodhouse was rich and had no pressing need to marry; Fanny Price was shy and introverted; Lizzie Bennett was witty and self-mocking; and Elinor Dashwood had to share the spot-light with her younger sister Marianne. Anne Elliot's defining attribute is that she is considerably older than her literary fellows; for at the grand old age of twenty-seven is nearly past her prime (in the eyes of her contemporaries) and entering perpetual spinsterhood. In a time when a woman was defined by her society almost solely on her success in marriage, things are not looking so good for Anne.This is especially bitter for Anne considering she was once in love with the handsome but poor Frederick Wentworth, but persuaded to break relations between them on the advice of her deceased mother's dearest friend Lady Russell, who disapproved the match. Regretting such an action in the years that followed, Anne has almost reconciled herself to a life of maidenhood, surrounded by self-absorbed relatives.However, fate is about to give her a second chance. Set (and written) as the Napoleonic Wars were ending, Anne learns that Captain Wentworth - now a wealthy and respectful officer - is about to re-enter her acquaintance. After her father is forced to rent out their estate in order to pay off debts, Anne travels to Uppercross Cottage to stay with her sister Mary Musgrove, unsettled with the thought that one of the tenants left behind is the sister of Captain Wentworth. Settling in with the Musgroves and the beautiful Henrietta and Louisa (Mary's sister-in-laws), it is only a matter of time before Mr Musgrove returns with Captain Wentworth in tow.Anne is understandably nervous given their unhappy parting, but forces herself to remain calm and polite in his presence - and to her sorrow he behaves the same toward her, focusing his attention on the Musgrove girls. To stir things up a bit, Anne also meets her estranged cousin Mr Elliot, who is immensely attentive and charming toward her and almost certainly intends to make her his wife.Anne herself is neither pretty nor witty; rather she's patient, kind-hearted, sensible and part of a family that doesn't deserve her. It's not that her father and sisters are unkind, but one can feel Anne's discontent and loneliness in being part of a family that places importance only on riches and rank without any conception that their minds are weak and uninformed. As the only sensible person in a world of self-absorption, Anne trudges through her duties unnoticed and uncomplaining. But she's not perfect, for every reader knows that she's made a mistake in giving up the love of her life (though she comes to a surprising conclusion concerning it in the last chapter, placing her duty to society and family above the demands of her own heart), and as Frederick and Anne dance around each other, hopelessly trapped by the silence that conformity demands, the modern reader will share their frustration in their inability to speak their minds, especially in a world where there are no such restrictions.But of course, this is an Austen book and you don't have to be physic to know that a happy resolution is on its way - but the way in which it is settled is perhaps Austen's most touching union between two characters, made even more poignant by the fact that that it's taken them two tries to find one another. One feels especially happy for Anne, who truly deserves some joy in her life - her reaction to the warmth of the Musgroves' familial life is heartrending when you realise her surprise and appreciation for it is caused by the lack of such warmth in her own family.\\"Persuasion\\" is the shortest of all Austen's novels, as well as the last one she wrote before her death, which should appeal to those who are a bit stretched for time. It's not her best, most beloved or most famous novel, as many of the character simply aren't as vivid or involving as some of her other novels, but it contains the same themes of social commentary, verbal wit and wry insights into the human condition that Austen is famous for. A sweet, slim novel about loyal, love and second chances."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This was the first time I read this book.

This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Gillian Beer writes a fascinating Introduction in this Penguin Classic Edition, in which she discusses Miss Austen's portrayal of the double-edged nature of persuasion. This complete and unabridged edition also contains a biography of the author, an Afterword, a new chronology and full textual notes.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.JANA"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time.

Simply put, it is my favorite book. While not everyone holds this novel with the same high esteem that I do, I urge those who have NOT read &quot;Persuasion&quot; to buy it.This book has meant different things to me at different times in my life. I have often reflected why I find the story so fascinating and believe it is because it so accurately portrays the human spirit and exposes our flaws and strengths with such transparency.Jane Austen reveals those who are so superficial that they see no goodness or worth other than beauty and wealth (Anne's father and sister); those who are so dependent that they do not listen to their own heart - but instead leave their most important decisions for others to make (Anne herself); and those whose pride has been wounded.And perhaps what is so captivating, Austen lets the reader vicariously &quot;undo&quot; an error in judgment. This is an excellent and timeless novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This review is for the Norton Critical Edition of Persuasion, and has two parts: a review of Persuasion itself, and a review of Norton Content.No educated person disputes Austen's contribution to the literary world. While her particular craft may not be palatable to all types (whose is?), I maintain that of all Austen's works, Persuasion is the one to hold the most appeal to those unfamiliar with her literature. It could be a \`gateway drug', introducing the reader to Austen, or it could be a delightful \`one-book stand'; whichever way works for the reader.Concealed within Regency trappings is a universal story: there is a \`mythic' quality to it in the sense that C.S. Lewis defines myth. The story reaches through space and time to grab the heart and attention of the reader, compelling her both on and deeper. When the novel opens, Anne Elliot faces the prospect of meeting once again a man with whom she was compelled to break off an engagement nearly eight years prior. While relatively little outward action takes place, Austen builds tension through Anne's inner conflict. Peripheral issues, such as the nature of the change in social systems in this turbulent time in Britain and the place of women in society, serve as complementary fare that highlights the mounting dilemma that Anne faces. In Austen style, the resolution and denouement are highly satisfying and truly ingenious, and the reader is left with meaty material to savor for days to come.The Norton contribution to Persuasion is indispensable. Though I was previously familiar with Persuasion, a favorite professor of mine introduced me to the commentary and contributions within this edition. The preface lays out a road map of sorts for the rest of the book. Included immediately after the conclusion of the novel is the original ending-something that even the non-lit majors in my class found interesting. A fabulous selection of backgrounds and contexts follows, with items such as Henry Austen's \\"Biographical Notice of the Author\\", and a selection from Richard Whateley's \\"Review of Northanger Abbey and Persuasion\\", entitled \\"A New Style of Novel\\".Additionally, modern critical commentary is included from Austen scholars Marilyn Butler, Ann Astell, Claudia Johnson, and others. Appearing at the end are a helpful chronology and selected bibliography. Patricia Meyer Spacks did a fabulous and much appreciated job in editing and pulling the work together. This edition is highly recommended, both within the classroom, and without.--The Medieval Chick"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"One of the major sources of contention and strife in my marriage is the disagreement between my wife and me over what is the best Jane Austen novel (yes, we are both more than a bit geekish in our love of words and literature--our second biggest ongoing quarrel is about the merits of the serial comma).For my money, there are three of Austen's six finished novels that one can make a good argument for being her \\"best\\":\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (the popular choice, and my wife's)\\"Emma\\" (the educated choice--most lit profs go with this one)\\"Persuasion\\" (the truly refined choice)Harrold Bloom in \\"The Western Canon\\" calls it perhaps a \\"perfect novel,\\" and while I disagree with some of his interpretations of the characters (yes, blasphemy, I know), I wholeheartedly concur with his overal assessment.While all of Austen's novels are generally comic, \\"Persuasion\\" is the most nuanced. It's been described as \\"autumnal\\" and that word suits it. There's a bittersweetness to it that you just don't get in Austen's other work.The novel it comes closest to in terms of character and plot is probably one of her earliest novels \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\" Like Eleanor in that novel, Anne is older and more mature than the typical Austen heroine. In fact, she's dangerously close to being \\"over the hill\\" at the age of 27(!). Love has passed her by, apparently.But unlike Eleanor, who one always feels will muddle through even if she ends up disappointed in affairs of the heart, there's something more dramatically at stake with Anne. She is in great danger of ceasing to exist, not physically, but socially. When we meet her, she's barely there at all. Although a woman of strong feelings, she is ignored and literally overlooked by most of the other characters. In the universe of Austen's novels, the individual doesn't truly exist unless connected with the social world, and while Anne has a stoic strength, we understand that she is in some senses doomed if things don't change for her.This is where we see what the mature Austen can do with a character type that she couldn't when she was younger.This edition also has the original ending of the novel included as an appendix, which gives us a rare and fascinating look in to Austen as a technical artist.I read this novel as an undergraduate, and have reread it several times since. I even took the novel with me to Bath on a trip to England, and spent a wonderful summer evening reading it while sitting in Sidney Gardens, across the street from one of the homes Austen lived in during her time in Bath, listening to Mozart's Piano Concerto #27. It's one of my favorite memories.More than any other of her novels, \\"Persuasion\\" shows how Austen dealt with profound existential questions within the confines of her deceptively limited setting and cast of characters. Those who think Austen is simply a highbrow precursor to contemporary romance novels or social comedies are missing the colossal depth of thought that is beneath the surface of any of her novels, this one most of all.Austen is nearly unique in the history of the novel for the consistency of her excellence. While most novelists have a clear masterpiece that stands out among their work, and usually a fairly sizable number of works that are adequate but not enduring, all of Austen's novels stand up to repeated readings and deserve a wide audience among today's readers.Having said that, \\"Persuasion\\" is simply the best of the best."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Certainly one of the greatest literary minds of all time is that of Jane Austen, an author who has been much-maligned by her unfair modern association with \\"chick-lit\\" (it's nice that \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" was based on \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but that should not reflect unduly on Austen's work). The trick is that while Austen's novels do tend to center on a romantic plot they are imbued with many other facets that make them so much more than trifling entertainments. Sharp social commentary is particularly prevalent in all of her novels, perhaps none more-so than her final work, \\"Persuasion\\" -- with its deft handling of a woman's place in society and of the difficulties imposed by class barriers. Its focus is on Anne Elliot, middle child of the pretentious Sir Walter, who has no use for her in his life -- choosing to favor his eldest daughter Elizabeth (who, truly, takes after her father in all selfish respects) and to offer regard to his youngest, Mary, at least as a woman who has fulfilled her purpose by marrying satisfactorily. Years earlier Lady Russell, a family friend who became a sort of surrogate parent to Anne after her mother's death, persuaded Anne to break her engagement to her beloved Frederick Wentworth, believing him to be an inferior sort of person who would only make Anne miserable in time. Now, eight years later, Wentworth is a successful captain in the British navy who has proven that he would have been a more than worthy match for Anne in situation as well as affection. But when he comes back into her life, Anne must live with the consequences of her earlier decision as Wentworth appears to have moved on -- actively seeking a wife right under Anne's nose. Anne also finds herself being courted by her cousin William, who would be a perfectly sensible match for her, but since her heart still belongs to Captain Wentworth she cannot bear to consider it. The plot conventions will be familiar to fans of Austen, but that does not detract from the sharpness and enjoyability of the tale in the slightest. The keen observations are on target, and \\"Persuasion\\" has the added benefit of having some of the best characters in the Austen canon this side of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Anne proves to be a heroine worthy of Elizabeth Bennet's approval, and Captain Wentworth an amiable counterpoint to the steelier Mr. Darcy. Mary's histrionics are reminiscent of the wailings of Mrs. Bennet, providing blissful comic relief without becoming too overbearing. Best of all, naturally, is the omnipresent Austen wit -- an incomparable achievement in all of her novels, on fine display here in \\"Persuasion\\". Anyone who has not yet experienced Jane Austen is missing out on some enjoyable and delightfully thought-provoking reading, and should get started as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I know a lot of teens who, when I tell them I am reading Jane Austen, say, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; because they have read Sense and Sensibility first, before trying any of her easier works. Persuasion is the easiest book of Austen's to get into, to follow, and to love. She makes the characters real by explaining them in many situations. When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together. Persuasion is my favorite book of Austen's, and if you read it, it will be yours, too."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's PERSUASION is essentially a comedy of manners--a work in which the characters must negotiate a complex code of conduct in order to survive, much less achieve their ends. And in a certain sense the novel is indicative of Austen's great talent, razor sharp, laced with irony and wit, and remarkably phrased. And yet PERSUASION is quite unlike Austen's other novels in the story it tells.Eight years earlier, Anne Elliot fell in love with a man named Wentworth. Her family and friends disdained the match, arguing that the man was below her in station and lacked any fortune with which to maintain Anne in her accustomed mode of life. Persuaded to reject him against her own will, Anne broke off the engagement--and thereafter found herself unable to love another even as she endured the follies of her father and two sisters. But Wentworth has returned, having made his name and fortune with the British navy, and it is now his turn to reject her.Published in 1816, PERSUASION is the last novel Austen completed before her death a year later, and it is remarkable for a very autumnal tone. Unlike such Austen masterpieces as PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and EMMA, the herione is not a spirited, quickwitted young women on the verge of matrimony; the hero is not a dashing gentlemen of great estate; there is no verbal duel between the sexes. It is instead the story of a commonsense and pleasantly ordinary woman who considers herself past the likelihood of marriage--and who now wishes only to escape the emotional pain and humiliation visited upon her by a suitor from long ago.While PERSUASION does not really stand along Austen's greatest works, it is nonetheless a very fine novel, a delicately wrought tale of opportunity lost and the passage of time, told in the uniquely piercing style so typical of the author--and while, of course, all eventually comes right for the romantically downtrodden Anne, it has a touch of melancholy quite unlike the tone of her other novels. Austen readers will find it a delight.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's words come to life like notes on a page played by a musician. That most capable \\"musician\\" is Juliet Stevenson, well-known movie and stage actress with the acting chops of the Royal Shakespeare Company behind her. Her training and experience on the stage really shows as she creates individual and convincing voices for each of the characters and highlights the biting and keen observations of the narrator. I had read the book before listening to this audiorecording, and I was amazed at how much I missed. She really brings out the nuances of each character, fully exploiting every detail of each character (Anne's father's vanity, Elizabeth's self-absorption, Anne's self-consciousness and tiny glimpses of her emerging hope) and triumphs with the climactic passage toward the end where she brings Captain Wentworth's letter to life. You can hear the passion and fear in her voice as if it were Captain Wentworth himself. Treat yourself to a Jane Austen reading that brings the text to life."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen has been one of the most influential writers of all time. Her beautiful love stories will always be remembered. Her work was ahead of its time, which is why a lot of today's writers emulate her style. My favorite Austen novel is Persuasion.After the heroine, Anne Elliot, was talked into leaving the man she loved, an attractive and financially challenge man named Frederick Wentworth, she felt she couldn't possibly marry a poor man. Eight years later, however, Wentworth returned to his homeland with a fortune and a place in society. It is obvious that those were the times in which social status was the most important thing, not love. Jane Austen had created a beautiful story that people can still relate to. The characters are beautiful and the story is memorable. I have read Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but in my opinion, Persuasion is her best work.This is a beautiful piece of literature, and if you haven't read it, I suggest that you do."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"The language is so Old World, I found it difficult 2 understand.

I haven't read many, and I can't seem to read them in succession, but I am reading them. This is the second Jane Austen novel I've read, and I really couldn't tell you which one I liked better. I think it would probably have to be this one. Maybe it was because I had already had a little practice with Pride? I don't know. But this one, to me, seemed to be a love story from the start, and also seemed to be much sweeter, somehow. But I'm not sure what it was that struck me closer to the heart, because Pride was just as much so...wasn't it? Anyway, if you want to read the classics, and can get past the old english, which to me is kind of elegant, then give this a try. It is a good read, after all..."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"It's no Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the style is strained and nearly unbearable for the first ten or twelve chapters. I could sense the writer struggling against writer's block or imagination failure or something, and it took forever to plod through the staggering, wordy, pieced-together writing of the first third of the book. I doubt it would ever have made it past the slop pile nowadays. A second or third draught might have been a good idea.Anne was very wise and introspective, and while it works great later in the story, in the beginning, I came about half an inch from reaching into the book and cuffing her a good one. Seriously, quit with the pity party Miss Elliot and quit sabotaging yourself.Seems that there were quite a lot of serendipitous plot engines, too. I had a wee bit of trouble suspending my disbelief in some of the more convenient circumstances that occurred later on, and while a little bit of coincidence is never a bad thing, when multiple instances of situations reading like they were manufactured with the express purpose of working out something mentioned no more than two pages (or paragraphs) back, I start to feel like I'm being forced at gun point over a rickety bridge of plot points rather than being gently guided along a carefully crafted path of meticulously arranged thoughts to the inevitable, but still rewarding conclusion.If you have to read this for some strange reason, I'm sorry for you. You'll have to commit to the beginning. If you're reading for leisure, suffer chapters one and perhaps two, then skim the next eight or ten. You won't miss too much, and the writing becomes much more tolerable thereafter. And, if I'm wrong and you find yourself lost, skip to the last three chapters, because they're all anyone ever read this book for to begin with, and you'll get a fairly good summation of it therein."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Beautiful story, have read it many times and will continue to do so, love Jane Austin the title tells the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion has been on my must-read list for a long time, ever since I read Sense and Sensibility and became an Austen fan.

As it is an old classic favorite there is really nothing to do but give it high marks."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"The experience of reading _Persuasion_ is closer to that of reading _Jane_Eyre_ than it is to reading _Emma_ or _Pride_and_Prejudice_. Anne, our heroine, is a cut above those around her. She suffers through her social life and keeps her observations to herself. As in Austen's other books, there's plenty of wit to enjoy from the outside. But there's also a deep identification with Anne that brings out the poignancy and suspense of the romance until by the last twenty pages I could hardly stand it. And ahhhh, the payoff. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"A wonderfully clever novel. This was my first Jane Austen novel,and I wasn't disappointed - although a bit surprised that it wasn't boring as I feared. This is the story of Anne who loses her chance at first love. When she has a second chance at love with the same man, we fear she will fail again, but Austen keeps the reader on the edge of the chair in suspense and (sometimes frustration). What a master at turning the phrase, of creating so vividly the class conflict, and the tension inherent in Victorian manners. A definitive exploration in the art of persuasion. Now I'll have to read some others, but I chose Persuasion as my first, because it got the best Amazon.com reviews. Sounds like a poor reason I know, but I was afraid that I might find Austen's work too far away from our own times to find compelling. I need not worry."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"If you are a Jane Austen fan, as I am, you will surely enjoy Persuasion. The basic premise is about a young woman who was persuaded to let the love of her life get away, but now he has come back and she's wondering if she still has a chance. Books from this era accurately reflect how actions of individuals were always to be moderate and proper. Nowadays there would be no reason for this book because more likely than not the individuals involved would simply confront each other with questions to find out how the other felt. But back then being so forward was unheard of. So what we have here is a book filled with sexual/romantic tensions that makes for a very exciting read. Jane Austen's biggest flaw, in my opinion, is not milking the climax of her stories for all they're worth. When you reach the scenes in her books that everything has been leading up to, they are always brushed over with scant details and little actual dialogue so that you can't really feel what took place. A bonus about the Austen novels is that they are not so long that it is intimidating just to open them. Overall I would rate this as the best Austen book."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book that I have read, and I loved it dearly. So much so that I devoured it in two sittings, two days! Seeing the 1995 BBC movie version made me go out and purchase the book. The book and movie are excellent if you are an incurable romantic such as myself. The writing is brilliant, the characters well-crafted. Anne is a heroine of today, thoroughly modern in every way! Amanda Root and Cirian Hinds do a remarkable job in the movie. Please do yourself a favor and read the book though first."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century. Austen was always demure but she had claws and her books are much more about sex than most of her contemporaries' work. (The act itself, of course, is never mentioned).Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance, which burned brightly when the two protagonists were younger, and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but, unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's, these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen, if these people were real, afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice: how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and, in Persuasion: how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own dysfunctional family? No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.)One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique are her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this \\"critique of the family\\" more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines: she is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.We know, by reading any of Jane Austen's books, of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows:\\"(Anne and Cpt Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\\"That might seem sardonic enough, but here's the clincher!\\"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which... taste cannot tolerate - which ridicule will seize.\\"Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be: intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read: it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Not always the most popular of Austen novels but definitely reflective of her older amd more mature style. It is interesting as this is the first time that the Napoleonic Wars are actively referred to, and yet the only novel she completed in peace time.Written at the end of the Napoleonic Wars it is about Anne, daughter of a somewhat snobbish small country gentleman whose idea of himself is far exceeded by his actual worth. She has been persuaded to refuse the only offer for her hand in marriage to a low ranked officer. Now years later through a bad coincidence he has returned to the neighbourhood. He has done well in the wars and is now highly ranked and wealthy from his prize money.Anne must contend with her own feelings even as she sees him happy with the daughters of her neighbour - perhaps ready to chose one of them as his wife.This is very much the conflict of class over substance, of appearance over reality and of the ability to trust one's self over the persuasions of others around.Letters play an enormously important part in Austen's novels, and the use of a letter in this book is wildly romantic and almost dangerous in the context of the situation.I love this novel, it involves an older, more mature heroine, and one who really deserves to be loved. It has much gentler sequences in it than say the rambunciousness of Pride and Prejudice.I may be biased about Austen, but I believe they make some of the best reading about - funny, wildly romantic and deeply satisfying to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"If you're interested in reading some Austen and haven't before, I would recommend you read Persuasion first as it is the quickest read and, in some ways, the most fulfilling (I know that's subjective!). But I found this book SO \\"lovely\\" and much more fast-paced and intriguing than some of Austen's others. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite by far, but this is a great second. The characters are fabulously complex with the frustrating exterior of serenity. Also, if you are interested: there are some great commentaries on women's position in society during the 19th century in Britain which I found so interesting. Specifically a conversation toward the end in the final party!If you love this book, or other Austens, READ READ READ Reading Lolita in Tehran. It's fabulous and makes Austen so much more interesting and intellectual!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"There is no doubt how I doat upon Jane Austen's novels. Add &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the list. Her last finished novel, published after Austen's death, &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a mature novel in more senses than one. Our heroine, Anne Elliot, is in her late twenties, by far older than say, an Elizabeth Bennet (&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;) or an Emma Woodhouse (&quot;Emma&quot;). In addition, Anne seems to have more freedom to move socially and personally than most of Austen's earlier heroines. Within the restrictive pecking order that governs Austen's ficitional world, this is saying something, since Anne is often presented as limited by family and 'connexions'. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a subtle work, as Anne's actions generally take place outside of, and even in spite of, the fashionable circles her family frequents. All of this combines to form a novel of understated depth and skill.&quot;Persuasion&quot; begins in 1814 - turmoil unsettles the Elliot family of Kellynch-hall - Sir Walter Elliot and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, live beyond their means upholding family and social pride, and are feeling pressure from creditors and friends to reconstitute their lifestyle. Reluctantly renting their estate to an Admiral and Mrs. Croft, Sir Walter and his darling Elizabeth retreat to a smaller situation at the ultra-fashionable resort town of Bath. Sir Walter's middle daughter, Anne, stays behind with an honored family acquaintance, Lady Russell, intending to join the rest of the family shortly.In retirement thus at Uppercross, Anne is shortly confronted by a change of society - including the return of two men of consequence in her past, a cousin and former heir to her father's estate, William Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, with whom she broke a long engagement eight years before. Throughout the novel, Anne finds herself forced to negotiate her way through the flippant vanity of her father and sisters, the reserved judiciousness of her adviser Lady Russell, and her unfortunate friend, Mrs. Smith, while contemplating the possibilities of reestablishing her family's estate with Mr. Elliot or rekindling her affections for Captain Wentworth.Having recently read &quot;The Romance of the New World&quot; by Joan Pong Linton, I found myself drawn in &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the overarching theme of middle class industry and social advancement versus the supposed inherent virtues of landed nobility. With the exception of William Elliot, who only anticipates an inheritance, none of the novel's various suitors, Wentworth, Captain Benwick, Charles Hayter, etc., are directly linked to landed money. Especially in the cases of Wentworth and Benwick, service in the Royal Navy is most often and most convincingly presented as an avenue for monetary, and increasingly, social advancement. A brief scene in which the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple notices Captain Wentworth in a crowd is enough to show us the virtues and attractiveness of a self-made man in Austen's largely aristocratic (if minor aristocracy) fictional universe.There is in &quot;Persuasion,&quot; as in most of Austen, a good deal of time afforded to character development, especially in the context of what I like to call background-checks. In &quot;Persuasion&quot; however, moreso than usual, Anne Elliot is largely left to herself to decide how to proceed in her own most sensitive matters. That she operates outside of her family's regard, and that of her own trusted friend Lady Russell, makes her unique, strong, and more assertive and self-sufficient than many Austen heroines. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is an excellent, intimate novel, with many exquisitely crafted moments of pain, pleasure, and humor. It is one I cannot wait to read again."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"For those familiar with Austen's work, Persuasion will be both familiar and somewhat different. All of Austen's works are simple romances, but this one is another unique part of her writing. In most of her novels, Austen had a young heroine, who is blocked from the hero by rivals. In Persuasion, the heroine is Anne Elliot, who is 27 and cannot marry the hero, Captain Wentworth, because of a previous aborted romance. Their history blocks them, but they still manage to overcome it.Austen again manages to create believable characters with sharp wit. However, while good, this book in my opinion isn't in the same great class as Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park or Emma. For me its partially because of its Autumnal air and its rather tiresomely familiar at times. Anne's father, Sir Walter Elliot's character is vanity from beginning to end. Why Austen chose to always have a negative father caricature is a mystery to me. The theme of the navy versus the nobility is also very prevalent. Other lesser characters, such as the Admiral and his wife, Lady Russell, William Elliot and Mrs. Smith are truly alive. So despite my misgivings, Austen sharpened her art enough for a book that makes a great read. It is a read that people will continue to experience for years to come."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth were happily in love and ready to be married - until Anne's friend Lady Russel persuades her that Captain Wentworth, a poor man in the army, is not the man for her. Eight years later, however, society brings them together again. Anne still loves him, and she must divulge if he still loves her, a hard task considering all the lovely young women who would do anything to marry the handsome and now wealthy Captain. Persuasion is a story filled with jealousy and uncertainty, as well as passion, simple joy, and a powerful, unconditional love.Persuasion is my third Austen novel (the first being Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility); I loved it. It kept me up late at night - midnight and later. I finished it in four days, which is a record for me as I do not read classics very quickly.In one word, I would say this is a simple book, in the best sense. It is written well and the way the events of the story are played out build the characters' personalities, their way of living. The story progresses in just a way that mirrors Anne's feelings for Wentworth... In the beginning, there is no word of a Captain Wentworth, and Anne's life is happy. At least, on the outside. As everything falls into place, however, Anne becomes more and more unnerved and unable to conceal her love, the love she's had all along. The tension between the Captain and Anne Elliot was substantial and realistic. I was very impressed and am every excited to read and re-read all of Austen's wonderful novels. They're sitting on my shelf...waiting!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Ms. Austen writes a fantastic story for the most part. The gossip was a little much at times. And the stereotypical situations and feelings were accurate even if a little annoying. The story flowed fairly well. I was impressed with keeping all the different characters and traits separate. Just a lot going on and different story lines. I was impressed with how much was in the book and everything was wrapped up neatly. Some things hadn't happened yet but you knew what was going to happen.I truly felt for Anne. She was trying to follow the influence of a friend since her mother was dead. I understand but she finally had to figure out for herself what was right and stick to it. Things seemed to go better now that she was older. Family and friends didn't fight things for her so much. Of her family members I loved her older sister Mary the best. She had her moments where she would get \\"sick\\" or get frustrated with her husband for making plans when plans were already made. But she had to learn to speak up as well. The women just kind of sat back and did nothing sometimes.All in all, I enjoyed the book. The drama was a little bit overwhelming but I had to find out how it ended. I wanted to know if Anne and Fredrick would end up together. I could see how things would all play out or at least how I hoped it would end up. Ms. Austen is an amazing author and I cannot wait to read more of her work."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"This is the story of second chances.

The title for this review comes from the letter that was written out by the hero. I LOVED THE LETTER, the most sensual love letter that I have ever read.Not even one kiss in this book, but while reading it, it is like you would take a deep breath and hold it until the end. Beautiful choice of words keeps your mind of state mesmerized. I loved the way that author wrote about every feeling or thought the heroine had in a presence of a man that she loved for so many years. Also, how she was in apprehension of an every meeting with him and weighting every word that he has said. The climax in the book was when he handed her the letter to pour his feelings buried inside for her. What a beautiful letter! The writer also has a great way to describe human nature. The writer grabs you with rich words.But the book is full of making acquaintances which was a bit too much for me in this book. But it is regency area after all."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"What a surprise to find a character like Anne Elliot hiding between the pages of Persuasion. If you met Anne Elliot today, chances are you probably wouldn't remember her - but she would remember you -- so unused are we to being observed quietly and subtly. She is not a typical heroine, by modern standards, who speaks her mind freely and is a person of action. Elizabeth Bennet in Pride &amp; Prejudice comes to mind when I think of modern heroines -- outspoken and clever.What makes Anne Elliot a peculiar heroine is her ability to listen and observe -- two qualities most of us would consider rather passive. I find it interesting that at the opening of the book, Anne Elliot is described as a woman who is past the first bloom of youth and you get the sense that life is passing her by. But these qualities give Jane Austen the opportunity to capture the subtle inner workings of Anne Elliot's heart. Anne does not have beauty as a means of getting her way; the idea of having her own way to get would be unthinkable to her. So we are left to focus on her thoughts and feelings.So much in the book is left unsaid which in turn speaks volumes. It is quite delightful to find a character who is defined not only by the things they say but by the things they don't say; by what they do and the things they don't do."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I enjoy all of Jane Austen's novels but find this one to be my favorite. It is the most thoughtful and emotional and relies less on external events than the other novels. Anne Elliot is older than all of Jane Austen's other heroines. Her maturity shows in the way she handles her family's financial problems, her reunion with Wentworth, the events at Lyme, and the final happy moment when they reconcile. The ending was fulfilling and satisfying, and all that I could have hoped for, after, literally, reading Anne's thoughts."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"In Mrs. Croft's statement &quot;we women don't want to be in calm waters all our lives&quot; Jane Austen and her heroine, Anne Elliott, move beyond the domestic, from the bracing sea air of Lyme, to glimpses into the seafaring adventures of the Navy brethren. This to me is the predominate appeal of Persuasion - Anne, in her approaching maturity, is reunited with her former suitor in what we may expect is a deeper, more heartfelt love, having endured separation for so many years and she has the prospect of joining him at sea. My heart leaps to see her escaping domesticity and the dull social duties as exemplified by Sir Walter and her sister Elizabeth. Of course, Austen's use of language is perfect. My favourite Austen novel. The film adaptation with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds exquisitely captures the mood and characters of this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I've just finished reading 'Persuasion' and I loved it.

I've read all of her works, and this is one of my absolute favorites. Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \\"acceptable\\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story.

But the second half of the book changed my feelings and I grew more agitated reading it - will Anne and Captain Wentworth ever realize that they still love each other? There it was!

Austen's tale of true-love's fulfillment impeded by the perceptions of others' views about the appropriateness of the parties involved leaves the reader questioning his or her own pursuits of love.Austen writes of the how the road to one's soul-mate sometimes takes a long and twisted journey, through time, one's self-doubts, and the perception of others. It may take Anne and Capt. Bentwick over eight years, but true love prevails as Austen's fans all know.Also, Austen takes her sharp-witted pen once again to people's views of love, social climbing, societal views on women, and status-bound troglodytes. Austen still inspires today readers to question his or her own motives in love, as well as the motives of others.Finally, Austen wraps this beautiful tale of true love in the exquisiteness of her style--both vividly concrete and syntactically challenging--and her character study of the status-quo breaking heroine."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I chose this reading because I am a Jane Austen fan and have not read Persuasion since in high school.

He tries to drown his sorrow in his career in the Navy while she stays quietly at home and suffers the Cinderella-like treatment she receives at home.Circumstances throw them back together again 7-1/2 (I believe) years later; Captain Wentworth did well in the war and is now the object of all the young ladies.

It combines all the elements that make an Austen novel an Austen novel. Sir Walter is a most hilarious buffoon, Mr. Elliot is as evil a villain as there can be, Mary is the quintessential spoiled, selfish baby sister, and Captain Wentworth (sigh) is her most dashing, romantic hero. Yes, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Darcy, but his love and devotion were not tested for &quot;eight years and a half.&quot; IMNSHO, someone who is NOT moved by Captain Wentworth's letter has a heart of stone."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon.This edition includes a chapter that was omitted in the completed version, it was kind of a first draft option and Jane Austen chose another scene instead. I don't know if other versions of this book have that chapter. It was interesting to see the alternative ideas Jane Austen had."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion, Jane Austen's last novel, is the story of Anne Elliott and Frederick Wentworth, two young lovers who are persuaded to be separated rather than marrying when they first fall in love around age nineteen because of lack of prospects. The story picks up eight years later when circumstances have changed and the now Captain Wentworth has returned to the area with a successful career and Anne's family is now reduced in financial status. Anne wonders if perhaps Frederick might still harbor feelings for her, but this being Austen, things never go smoothly and there is quite a lot of wondering and subterfuge, and colorful characters to keep things amusing.This is not my favorite Austen; things started off quite slowly and there is not a great deal of dialogue. I did enjoy the fact that Frederick and Anne rediscovered each other relatively later in their lives, and as always, the build-up to the happy ending kept me smiling. While Persuasion doesn't have quite the emotional zing that Austen's earlier works do, it is still enjoyable. I doubt there's such a thing as an Austen novel that won't capture you in some way, and Persuasion accomplishes just that in its subtle, quiet style."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Those who read PERSUASION by Jane Austen tend to view it as a book primarily concerned with marriage in the typical Austen romantic comedy sense of young ladies seeking to marry upward and young men also seeking partners--but not necessarily to each other. While much of Austen's novel deals with precisely that, to view this solitary strand of thought as Austen's most telling point is surely to miss that point totally. In PERSUASION, Austen took her earlier PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and sought to show that her view on how single women relate to their families, their friends, their proposed husbands and to society at large underwent a significant change from the latter to the former.In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, Austen places Elizabeth Bennett squarely in the traditional role of the 18th century woman who sought somehow to gain economic equality with men in such a way so as not to upset or circumvent the established social order that dictated that women must obey their parents and marry the men whom they selected as suitable candidates. Miss Bennett uses reason and general smarts to cause changes in Darcy that would in turn cause changes in the larger social order that acted as a behind the scenes puppeteer. The comedy then was a function of a small change in Miss Bennett causing a larger one in Darcy. In PERSUASION, Austen takes the similar plot of a young woman breaking up with a man that perhaps needed breaking up with and updated it to include Anne Elliot doing much the same thing with Captain Wentworth. In Elizabeth Bennett's case, Darcy determined not be chased away. In Anne Eliot's case, Wentworth made no such determination and left the scene for eight years. The difference between the two acts of breaking up and their respective reconciliations did not lay in a profound change in the social order. What changed was Jane Austen, who became more finely attuned to the winds of Romanticism that were then wafting from one country to another. The relentless focus on rationalism that dominated the Augustan Age had slowly morphed over just a few decades to one in which human feeling and emotion trumped human reason.Austen, in her choice of \\"Persuasion\\" as the title, subtly implied that what was at stake was not simply potential marriage partners waltzing a predictable if unstable dance towards the altar. Rather, she wished to point the reader in the direction of seeing not only how and why persuasive rhetoric might impact on lovers' lives, but also to ascertain the consequences of treating emotional people as if they were devoid of those emotions. In Miss Bennett's case, \\"persuasion\\" was used in the context of rational discourse used to alter the world view of Darcy. In Anne Elliot's case, it was used to fortify the existing social order at the expense of using \\"right reason\\" to convince Anne to break up with Wentworth on the grounds that he was simply too low on the economic and social pecking order to marry a woman who is supposed to be a few rungs higher than he. Actually, Austen satirizes Anne by implying that, if anything, her loftier position in society, exists mostly in her and her father's eyes, not at society's at large. Anne differs from Elizabeth Bennett in that in PERSUASION, Anne sees that she has erred in being falsely persuaded but is allowed to show and vent emotion in re-establishing accepted marital order even if the somewhat stodgier and old-fashioned social order balks. As Anne Elliot uses both head and heart to win back the love of a man who felt rightfully scorned for no good reason, Jane Austen focused attention on basic human romantic entanglements that for many frustrated lovers remain tangled even today."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of Austen's shorter, simpler pieces, sweet and charming without as much intrigue as her other novels. It tells the story of sweet, quiet, even-tempered Anne Elliot, a plain spinster disregarded by her family because she is not attractive enough for them. Anne's only share of romance had been years before, with a naval man deemed beneath her --- a man named Wentworth, who she was persuaded to reject because of his lower connections.Anne's father is a lazy spender who cares more for his vanity and title than his family, and spends them all to the point of bankruptcy and they are forced to move to Bath, giving up their long-time home of Kellynch Hall. While the rest of the family moves, Anne is left to take care of the more menial tasks and visit her sister --- a woman who delights in \\"fancying herself ill.\\" While visiting Mary and her family, Anne is once again thrown into the company of Wentworth --- now CAPTAIN Wentworth.As is typical of Jane Austen, this novel is filled with charm, wit, and humor. The story is perfectly thought-out, with just enough twists to keep it interesting, and enough romance to make you sigh. The characters are flawlessly designed.I laughed and I cried in this novel. After \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" this is my favorite of hers."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Any person considering reading PERSUASION by Jane Austen must have several thoughts in mind before beginning. This book is a classic, written by a master. It requires an investment of your time, your patience, your understanding and your attention. It is a book to be savored, not galloped through as if it were a modern fiction bodice ripper. If you are willing to approach this book with an open mind, expecting only to receive pleasure from the written word, you will most likely enjoy it tremendously.I read a lot of modern romance fiction. One of the things I have noticed on researching a book through the Amazon review system before I buy it is that so often reviewers state that they were able to finish the book in two hours, three hours, four hours. Do they honestly think that is a compliment to the author? One thing I can guarantee here, you will never be able to say that about PERSUASION. Slow down, read for pleasure, read for the pure joy of observing Jane Austen's manner of combining words. Her punctuation style is totally different from modern fiction. It requires that you hold thoughts in your mind long enough for her to have completed her lengthy and complicated sentence structure.Fans of Jane Austen often say that one specific book is their favorite. My favorite is the one I happen to be reading at the time. I've read them all multiple times and am always able to find nuggets of pleasure either not noticed before or now understood from a fresh perspective. PERSUASION is a book which shows very clearly Miss Austen's feelings on the English class system and how appearances are very often deceiving. Anne Elliot's own family is (in their minds at least) in the top strata of society. In actual fact, they are very small fish in a wide pond and do not amount to much except when within their own corner of England. Anne spends much time with the Musgrove family and all those surrounding that happy, boisterous group. Although lower in the social standings, they are loving, kind and generous, traits which are totally lacking in her own father and older sister. Anne is considered of no consequence to her family yet is loved and admired by those outside her social set who can see her value and worth. This is a story of young love lost with the opportunity to reclaim that love when maturity has given new insights into reasons, details and personalities. This book does not specifically leave you with a \\"happily ever after\\" feeling. Anne will never be mistress of Kellynch-hall, probably never even live there again. Captain Wentworth is a career naval officer with all that implies in his future service during wars. And yet, you cannot help but feel that Anne and Frederick will be quietly, calmly, gloriously happy for their remaining days. Partially because of the eight long years of separation which allowed them both to mature and grow and partially because they are just so very right for each other.Do not begin reading this book expecting a \\"romance\\" novel as written today. If you do, you are doomed to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I recently finished reading Jane Austen's Persuasion. It wasn't originally within my reading plans for the year, but I was inspired to read it by both The Lake House and the recent Pride and Prejudice film.Jane Austen's work is notable for reflecting on the class structure of its times. Written in the early 1800s, at the time of the end of the Napoleonic Wars, England's upper classes are well structured, with rules in place to dictate exactly who has greater stature, and constricting how discourse occurs, and how romance should proceed. In Persuasion, the main character Anne Elliot finds herself ruing the decision she made some 8 years previously, that saw her send away the man she loved, because her family saw that the man had little stature. Well, he went off to fight in the Wars, and has come back, as many have come back, with greatly changed riches and improved stature. Anne finds herself still in love with the man in question, and over time the poor man finds that he has not changed his thoughts either, and they persuade themselves to re-unite, and marry, finally.Some of what's observed, herein, is how the rules of society are changing to accommodate the newly-rich...and how Austen distinguishes between \\"gentlemen\\" (those who act as good people) and those with stature, but then doesn't allow her characters to be guided towards the gentlemen so easily. In today's terms, we would think Anne Elliot foolish for turning her back on love because her parent says the man is not a good match, because of stature, but these things happen even today. So, I think in this respect that the novel remains a good reflection on how poorly people navigate through the minefields of love, and how poorly people can themselves fare when they don't act according to their own true wishes.This was Austen's last completed novel, as I understand it. It was a little more adult in terms of how it handled its themes, and it surprised me with some of its skill. A major character nearly dies part-way through the story; it happens abruptly, and it is handled as a natural abrupt event in a way that was momentarily shocking...a true sign of skill. Definitely, this is worth a read for fans of novels of this time period."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"It being my 27th year of spinsterhood (the same age of our heroine Anne Elliot), and being Austen-inclined, I picked up (and consequently couldn't put down) my beloved, aged Complete Works of Jane Austen in order to reread Persuasion, a close third favorite (only just after her masterpiece P&P and the profound S&S). Oh, Jane, how I love you, my most favorite author. So funny; I was cackling with laughter at your comedic timing, your witty and ironic eye, and your amazing attention to detail in human psychology, character, and behavior. Not just moved to laughter, but even to tears (Captain Wentworth's final love letter still gives me collywobbles). Falling into Jane's books is like falling into a vat of literary chocolate. Oh, yes, there is the beautiful love story (one of her absolute best, by far her most mature, perhaps her most moving and emotional) between the broken-hearted and angry Captain Wentworth and the spinster, past-her-prime Anne Elliot, torn asunder years before because she was persuaded that he was unworthy of her, now reunited, yet distant. (How Jane so perfectly and honestly describes the pining, unrequited heart!) But--as with all of Jane's works--the love story is really only a vehicle for her greater messages and observations about society, reality, human psychology--messages that are still profoundly pertinent. It's not only that her characters and situations could be walking around onto on our concrete streets. It's that Jane knew humanity down to its core two hundred years ago. When her incredibly real and troubled characters find romance, it is a meeting of internal discovery. Persuasion, needless to say, is about the necessity of finding the balance between yielding to outside forces (i.e. advice) and staying true to your own desires and conscience. What human being hadn't had to contend with that? This book is perfection itself. Still powerful, meaningful, humorous, moving, and utterly delightful. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"The magic and sheer excellence of 'Persuasion' lies in the personalities of the variouscharacters: Anne Elliot, the heroine of the book, is quiet, caring and proper but beneaththat surface of hers, she's a woman who has loved and lost. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot,and her sister, Elizabeth are like mirror images of each other, both are shallow, self-proclaimedsnobs and conceited. Captain Frederick Wentworth, Anne's love from her past, is just excellent!He's the male image of Regency cool: tall, handsome, a man of hard work and lady-killer.As a novel, 'Persuasion' is a thoughtful insight into the women left behind because ofbad choices, yet it is never self-pitying. I couldn't understand why while I was reading the bookand at the end, I saw what Austen was trying to show.That is the wicked factor of 'Persuasion', Austen allows you to eitherbe persuaded or dissuaded.As a social commentary, it is subtle in how it mocks certainaspects of society such as the 'dandies' of Regency England, the men who indulged in vanity,personified by Sir Walter Elliot. Yet, the books acts as a platform for the debate of marriagebegs the question, is marrying outside your station suicidal?One critic said that 'Persuasion' was like a Regency version of the Cinderella tale: Anne Elliotis Cinderella, Cpt. Frederick Wentworth her Prince Charming and Lady Russell as theWicked Stepmother. This is a blatant over-simplification! Persuasion is at first sight abeautifully crafted and touching romance but is also a book of many layers.Last Thought: Enough to convert an Austen cynic into an Austenian."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" accomplishes the feat of rewarding both extremely casual and deeper, more analytical readings. It certainly contains enough genuine insight into humanity, and social relationships in particular, to be considered a \\"serious\\" novel. But \\"Persuasion\\" defies the stereotype that accompanies this genre. Rather than being ponderous and solemn, it is instead a work of sheer joy to read. Readers are treated to a complex novel that reads like a summer beach book.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \\"Persuasion\\" is how it balances the depth and richness with pure entertainment. Anne, her sisters, her father, and of course Captain Wentworth, are all very complex and fully fleshed-out characters. At the same time, however, they are all delightful people to read about. Anne in particular is charming and compassionate. Austen's prose is wonderful; witty, intelligent, and clear. And the story itself, a tale of people in love, is universal in its appeal and yet never once becomes formulaic. The novel, then, is a fantastic success in every possible way. It provides the richness of great literature with the charm of the greatest writers. I can't recommend \\"Persuasion\\" highly enough."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Sometimes there's nothing better than settling in with an old favorite. Austen's Persuasion is a story of rediscovering what is lost. More than lost, what was let go. With her apt view of society of the day, the story still bears out all these years later."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Just what you'd expect from a Jane Austen novel. Romance, suspense, jealousy, unrequited love, all of it. By far one of the best books I've read since Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's books really draw the reader into the story and cause the reader to empethize with the heroine. She knows just how to tug at a person's heart strings through the plight of the main characters. A wonderful book, and one that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I love all Jane Austen's books, but this is my personal favorite. The way the characters interact is very humerous, but the story is touching. I feel more of a connection to Anne than to any of Austen's other characters, and I love the way she and Wentworth fall in love... again."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is a very good book. It's slower than the contemporary novel, which is to be expected (it is nearly 200 years old, after all). Like all of Austen's other novels, it is of course a social commentary. It's a story of delayed love and patience. It's been called her 'most romantic.' The idea of the old love, Captain Wentworth, coming back after years apart and both parties still being in love IS very romantic, but I disagree with it being her most romantic. It's a very sweet story, and also pretty straightforward. It was a lot of fun to read, and a good story."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"As an avid fan of Jane Austen, I began reading \\"Persuasion\\" with great expectations. Although I cannot say I am dissapointed, I must admit I did not like Persuasion as much as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility.First of all, although I sympathized with Anne when he was slighted by her own family and she was taken no notice of in the company of foolish women just because she is not as pretty and \\"fragile\\" as them, maybe because she is not as strong and passionate a character as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, I could not particularly attach myself to her. Still, I read the novel from beginning to the end in a very short time because it has more than enough to keep our interest. Especially the character of Mrs. Croft, the sister of Captain Wentworth is worth notice; because among the \\"ailing\\" and \\"fatigued\\" women of the higher classes of that time, this woman who walks long distances with her husband, who accompanies him on long sea journeys and takes the reins of their carriage to manoeuvre out of the way of a post is very interesting. In this novel, Jane Austen says quiet a lot of things which can be thought quiet feministic. Well she says similar things in P&P;, for example she makes Darcy say that Elizabeth's complexion is greatly improved after a long walk, when Bingley's sisters criticize her for such an unlady-like behaviour.Another thing about the novel is that we don't really know the feelings of Captain Wentworth. It is true that the letter he writes to Anne at the end is full of love but I didn't feel his passion as I did Darcy's when he proposed to Elizabeth the first time.All in all, I recommend the book to readers who have read Austen's other novels. But as a first read it may not be so enjoyable as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Though not as well known as the novels that established the author's name (Pride and Prejudice, Emma), Persuasion is certainly worth your time. It's extremely well-written with superb characterization. The plot isn't too original by today's standards, but is interesting nonetheless. Anne Elliot, the smartest and most pleasant by far of three upper class sisters, is 28 and still single. At 19 she fell in love with and almost married a dashing naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. However, great pressure from her family and relations &quot;persuaded&quot; her to reject Frederick due to his lower station in society. Frederick was greatly hurt and promptly went off to engage his energies in naval action.Eight and a half years later, Anne still hasn't met another guy she likes as much as Frederick and remains single. But now Frederick returns from war, retired, extremely wealthy from privateering with mercenaries, and more mature. He's ready to settle down and a chance family connection puts him back in the same neighborhood as Anne! He's still upset with Anne. And this time, other women are catching his eye too...While not up to the standards of Anne Bronte's outstanding The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Persuasion is a good classical romance novel. I think it beats out Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd on plot and characterization, though Hardy's prose is generally more powerful. Nevertheless, Austen can be quite poignant when she wants to be: Wentworth's shocking letter to Anne at the end of the book moved even me, a generally left-brained emotionless creature!A highlight of the novel is the illuminating social commentary that Austen subtly inserts into the prose. Clearly, she felt that the class system entrenched in British society at the time had its shortcomings. The endnotes in the Penguin edition do a good job of explaining the finer points of Austen's many jabs at class-conscious folks including Anne's self-absorbed father Walter and hopeless sister Elizabeth. Anne's other sister Mary is rendered superbly by Austen as a basically good-natured woman unfortunately marred by a touch of vanity. I personally know a Mary or two.Recommended to all adult readers!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I'm surprised that the other reviewers on this page are so lukewarm to Persuasion. True, it is not a perfect book, but I found it immensly enjoyable and well written. It is different to Austen's other novels, and having just finished Emma the difference was obvious to me, but it is also a completely different kind of book. It is written by an older and more serious woman than the one who penned Pride and Prejudice and Emma, and tells the story of an older, though still relatively young woman, who is haunted by a terrible choice she made several years ago to please her family and friends.The book is far more Romantic than anything else Austen wrote, and I also found it more streamlined and focussed. There are no chapters on how to set the table, like there were in Emma.I was a little disappointed in the end, as Austen doesn't record the conversation between Anne Eliot and Captain Wentworth, but instead tells us in a detached way what topics they spoke of. Still, that's a fairly minor quibble against what was really a very good book."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"i've read this book twice, and it has highly recommended itself both the times. its a more mature work of jane austen perhaps it being her last book.anne elliot, the heroine is reserved, elegant and reflective ..she had fallen in love with a very desirable young man, wentworth, but his connections and moreso his position in society made it not all desirable for anne's beloved friend, lady l to allow her to continue her relationship.now 7 years later they meet again to renew their love and affection; he being a captain now and possessing a large enough fortune. though at first he receives the attentions of louisa musgrove and anne the attentions of her cousin, mr. elliot, the heir to her father, they soon come to realise that what felt from the heart is the truest meaning of love. with the help of her many friends anne soon returns the affections she once held for captain wentworth."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Although the social formulas are not compatible with the present times, I was moved by the power of the emotions and the psychology of all the characters.

After reading it for the second time, I agree. None of Austen's other go as far to explore the inner thoughts and feelings of her heroines. Despite the fact that Anne is not as outgoing and witty as Elizabeth Bennet or as delightfully engaging as Emma, she is engaging nonetheless."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's Persuasion stands shoulder to shoulder with the best of the author's work. Emma and Pride & Prejudice are equally extraordinary novels and I don't think one has to engage in a tug of war over which is best: each has its charms and delights. The story of Anne Elliot, who enters into an engagement at age 20, only to succumb to family pressure and break it off, is 28 and alone when we meet her. Time has proven what she instinctively knows: Frederick Wentworth was the right man for her and she was foolish to let him go.His reappearance sets the stage for what is, at once a masterpiece of comedy, romance and satire. Anne's vainglorious father and sisters are deftly skewered, but in that mocking but never mean Austen style. The appearance of an estranged cousin and Captain Wentworth's apparent attachment to a neighborhood belle complicates matters wonderfully until we reach the inevitable happy conclusion.What sets this novel apparent, I think are two characteristics. Picking up the story eight years after Anne's mistake is a wonderful device. We don't meet a perfectly sensible woman (Elizabeth Bennett) or a delightful ingenue (Emma Woodhouse). Anne Elliot is a mature woman, indeed by social standards close to an old maid, and one left to regret her own poor judgment. Her situation is one any empathetic reader can identify with (who hasn't judged wrongly in Romance?) and creates a humility that is quite appealing. Unlike Elizabeth and Emma who need to learn the error of their ways, Anne already knows--she simply needs to be excused them.Secondly, unlike some Austen works, characters are far more dimensional. Anne is weak, but well-intended. Wentworth acknowledges he is bitter and resentful and acknowledges he fails to initiate a reconciliation out of pride, losing further years they might have been together. Elliot pere and Elliot the heir are quite cartoonish as is sister Elizabeth. However Anne's friend and confident and her sister Mary are more nuanced and therfore more appealing than most of Austen's minor characters.Is Persuasion worth reading? Without a doubt! Where does it fit in the Austen cannon? I think in the first rank. But everyone should decide for themselves."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Austen's last is one of the famed four -- Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and this novel, the most melancholy but also perhaps most romatic of the quartet.

It was too tense and agonizing. The suspense was almost painful: here is this young woman in her late twenties, still in love with a man she rejected because of family pressure eight years ago, and he comes back into her life. At first he seems cold and distant, but then she begins to think that maybe he still loves her too. But in this society, the woman can't speak first. She can't simply say to him, \\"I still love you, and I'm sorry I didn't accept your proposal eight years ago. I was given bad advice by my family.\\" No, she has to wait for him to put aside his pride and ask if maybe she's changed her mind about him. She's on pins and needles the whole time, and there are terrible humiliations, and she's treated very badly by her family, but in the end it all works out.Still, it's so painful to think that women once lived like this: utterly dependent on marriage for survival; dreading being an old maid; prevented from doing any kind of real work at all; prisoners of a rigid class system; and silenced by rigid gender role conventions."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed work before her death.

It focuses on a relationship who have a second chance to re-ignite true love but whether or not they will depends on so many things that make a good story and are still applicable today.A crazy family, social expectations, unforgiveness, competing love interests, and a little bit of that classic Austen wit that bites in just the right places.It's shorter than Austen's other works as well, and the plot less complicated and detailed than Pride & Prejudice and Mansfield Park.If for no other reason than the famous \\"you pierce my soul\\" letter, this should be a must on everyone's read list."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Persuasion is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Persuasion, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, works inspired by Persuasion,comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading and criticisms.

Austen had only 11 months to live when she completed it in 1816. Austen is the best writer in the language at taking a few upper-middle class rural families, a few love stories and arch social commentary into the heady mix that is her literary genius! Her observations of the social mores and balls, clothing style, music, literature, architecture and daily life of Regency England(1811-1820-the Prince Regent George IV assumed responsibility while his father George III became insane). is superb in its comic prose.The tale's main theme is how humans are persuaded to perform and also avoid moral actions which will determine how they live their lives. Eight years prior to the novel's opening we learn that Anne Eliot had earlier rejected the proposal of British naval officer Frederick Wentworth. She was persuaded to pursue this action due to the advice of her of a well meaning wealthy woman.Now Anne's impecunious and fatuously highfaultin baronet of a father has to lease his home due to pay his many debts. Her older sister Elizabeth is a hypocritcal prig who has to be one of the most odious creatures in Austen's work. Captain Wentworth returns to the village of Kellynch since his sister and her husband have rented the Eliot home. (they have departed for the watering hole of Bath). Eventually Anne and her Wentworth met, reconcile and are wed. Along the way we meet such characters as Anne's idiotic sister Mary and her husband who spends most of his time hunting. There are also a few subsidary love stories featuring Anne's siblings and the Musgrave girls. The fall of Lousia Mulgrave off the cob at Lyme is famous at is shows Anne that Wentworth still has feelings of love for her.The novel is lighter and less complex than such tomes as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Emma.\\" It was published in four volumes along with Jane's early work \\"Northanger Abbey\\" following her early death.One is left to wonder how many more small but elegant literary gems would have been produced by Miss Austen. Her books take us back over 150 years to a relatively stable and staid society. If one would be allowed b by the literary gods to invite three authors to dinner this reviewer would choose: Samuel Johnson, Oscar Wilde and Jane Austen. \\"Persuasion\\"will be broadcast on the BBC production to be shown on Masterpiece Theatre this autumn. Hopefully viewers of the series will turn to the real McCoy and enjoy the many pages of the preacher's kid named Jane!"},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"excellent book, love the characters and its an easy and quick read. i love reading the books more the watching the movies."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"My favorite Jane Austen book.

It's one of her shortest. It was published posthumously, and I think that she meant to flesh it out or add subplots, like her other books.As it stands, it's a wonderful work. *Emma* is supposed to be Austen's masterpiece, but I think *Persuasion* is a more mature work and, probably, more personal. The main character Anne Eliot is Austen's best character: mature, responsible, intelligent, and more wise than witty. She was persuaded to not marry for love when she was young, but to wait for a chance at a wealthier man. That chance never came, and now Anne is past her bloom, probably unmarriageable, and her inane father and sister are shoveling the family's little remaining money out of the coffers as fast as they possibly can. Anne gets a second chance with the man she loves, a chance that Jane may not have had.It's beautifully, and poignantly, told.I love Jane Austen.

Though she loved him and continues to love him, he could not provide her with the security and prestige her family felt was her due. He goes off to sea and Ann settles down to a life of servitude to her family. Years later, a wealthy Captain Wentworth returns with the idea of marrying -- not Ann but one of her young in-laws.When I first read Persuasion, I was too young to understand Anne's position. Being utterly selfish, like Anne's family or utterly cowed, like Anne at the beginning of the book, was foreign to me. It took some life experience on my part to be able to appreciate the theme of duty to oneself vs duty to one's family.Though much shorter, Persuasion is a harder read than Pride and Prejudice. It takes time to warm to the main characters. If you give it that time, Anne and Frederick's love story is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"extra period piece. Jane Austin at her best.

The story took place in the 19th century in Kellynch hall. Anne and Captain Wentworth was in love. Anne's father didn't wanted Anne to married to Captain Wentworth because of the social class. Eight years later, Captain Wentworth returned having made his name and fortune with the British Navy, and its now his turn to reject her. Anne still love Captain Wentworth but her father persuaded her not to married the man of not having good money. The three main characters of Persuasion is Anne Elliot, Captain Wentworth, and Sir Walter Elliot. The theme was Social mobility. Sir Walter objects to letting the house to an admiral because the navy offends his two most valued traits.Persuasion is for teenagers to adults type of audience. The romance go toward older people. This is a type of book for people who are mature. People who are older would love this book more than a younger person because the book is a classical book. Persuasion was a very appealing book. The was very awkward. They should change the ending because it sound crazy. They should made it sound like they got married instead of them engaged. It was a good book because it show how someone was persuaded to not married someone. Anne was in the world because the person she love , she couldn't get married to him. The story shows how much trails they had to go through to get together. Persuasion is considered to be a classic because it show how people got married in the 19th Century. The 19th Century romance was beautiful. It is also considered a classic because they married their cousins a lot in this story, they didn't mind if they married their cousin. Now these days, that crazy to married your cousin. I really recommend this book to people who like to read literature. So I believed that adults should read this more because they would be interested in it. I also recommend for people who love to read books. I rate this book \\"Persuasion\\" a three star becuause the ending was not good, they should change the ending. Everything else was about the book was good."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award. Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.

It was the first and last of Austen's that I will read. She may well have captured the mores and social rules of the time, but she didn't create characters I could really care about. I stuck with it to the end and found the revelations about Mr. Elliot to come out of nowhere and the ending romance to be something we could see coming from the very start. I'll take Edith Wharton over Austen any day."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"I am a fan of Jane Austen's work, but this is definitely not her best novel. It was written later in her life and lacks the emotion and plot that are so captivating in her earlier works. Read 'Pride and Prejudice' instead."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"this applies to all of austen's books. by the time you get to 'persuasion' you get pretty tired of it. same story lines, same themes, same devices. i read this book at the same time as dickens' 'dombey and son'. and after 200 pages of 'dombey', i never picked up 'persuasion' again. i got about half way through before i dumped dainty jane. there's just no comparison when you put them side by side. austen is really not so much a true novelist so much as she is some kind of prose playwright. her novels are really plays embellished by narrative descriptions of what people think and feel. they lack the full recreation of a physical world outside the minds of her characters. one is never even told something as basic as what her characters look like, much less how they dress, act or move. and one gets only the sketchiest descriptions of places and things, much as you'd find in a play. compare this to the rich and vivid imagery of dickens or flaubert or proust and it becomes obvious how far short of novels austen's books really fall. read any play and the resemblances to austen's books become all too apparent.still, austen is a good writer. she just isn't in the same class as the aforementioned great writers."},{"Title":"Persuasion (World's Classics)","review":"after reading P&amp;P and Northanger, i just couldn't slog my way through another of her books. but this one looked more interesting than any of her other works, so i thought, &quot;why not, i'll give it a try.&quot; big mistake. by far her worst (that i've read, but i still have emma and s&amp;s to go, and no plans on ever reading mansfield park). but i think it is safe to say i am not a fan of austen's. she's dull, and she turned an interesting idea into a dull book. i only gave her two stars instead of one because the premise behind the book was such a good one."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"This novel utilizes records from the thousands of hours of therapy Sexton underwent (most notably with Dr. Martin Orne). As a result of this, the slant of this biography is more psychological than previous books. It is scrupulously detailed though, which is a real treat for those who want to know what her life was on a micro-level. It is fascinating to read the excerpts of her therapy sessions and then be able to relate her actions to her psychological state of mind and see how all of it influenced her poetry.This is not a particularly literary biography - so if you are a PhD in Literature, it probably won't add anything to your understanding of Sexton's use of meter or rhyme schemes. It rigorously follows the events of her life but does not spend much time on her formative years. However, the scope and depth of Middlebrook's psychological research is wonderful, and someone who appreciates both psychology and literature will enjoy this book immeasureably."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"Diane Wood Middlebrook's biography of Anne Sexton was balanced and insightful enough so as not to be too intrusive; it is simple and direct, as I believe this biography ought to be. It could be much more. True. But that would somehow seem indecent. It is a written work that will tantalize many readers to want to know more of Sexton's earlier life and later chaotic often disgusting behavior. Anne Sexton did indeed have some major psychological problems. She envied Sylvia Plath's suicide and inflicted mental abuse on her family that trangressed the boundries of chaotic. She has often been criticized for the themes that she used in her poetry: her mental breakdowns, her severe shortcomings as a wife and mother, her liberal use of female bodily sexuality, her 'womanism' and other scattered amorphous problems that she endured but that is not fully covered with very much depth in this work. To deny Sexton's mentle problems or attribute her abhorrent behavior to simple staments that she 'wanted attention' is to cast away the deamons that led her to commit suicide in the first place or write the highly noted poems &quot;The Operation&quot; in All My Pretty Ones, for which she garnered a National Book Award nomination or &quot;Mother And Jack And The Rain&quot; or &quot;Menstruation At Forty&quot; in Live or Die, for which she won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. This biography has also been condemmed for the use of private conversations that Sexton had with her psychiatrist, Dr. Martin Orne, a fact that had and still does many in the profession gravely unhappy. In the forward and book jacket to The Complete Poems of Anne Sexton by her friend and fellow poet, Maxine Kumin, she states: &quot;The stuff of Anne's life, mercilessly dissected, is here in the poems. Of all the confessional poets, none has had quite Sexton's 'courage to make a clean breast of it' ...Anne Sexton has earned her place in the cannon.&quot; Whatever her morals (or lack of them) or major priorities which always came second, she was one hell of a fantastic, little understood poet who truly added something unique to the genre."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"You don't have to be a poetry afficianado to find this uniquely well-researched biography fascinating. Middlebrook makes ample use of the beautiful-but-mad-housewife-turned-poet angle, but does the more challenging job of examining the contradictions between Sexton and her work. Controversial access to Sexton's therapy records aside, Middlebrook explores the humanity behind a disturbed (and disturbing) woman who used any means at her disposal--sex, therapy (at the same time, in some instances), alcohol, drugs, her children and her poetry--in an attempt to stay afloat."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"Since references to Ms Sexton's work in Portugal are almost non-existent, I cannot remember why I became interested in her. I have some idea that the british poet Neil Curry very favourably mentioned to me the book by the same author on the Plath/Hughes case and perhaps that led me to Sexton's biography.This work is certainly as accurate as any biography can be. The author was invited by one of Ms Sexton's daughters to write it, so she must have had access to all the material available which gives a firm foundation.As an author, we can only be surprised how someone with such little formal education and in a relatively short time was able to produced work which earned praise, a Pulitzer prize included.As opposed to that, Ms Sexton private life was tragic. \\"Attended by devils\\", I'm borrowing from a Joan Plowright's sentence on her husband, Laurence Olivier, she was so disturbed that she was unable to perform the simplest everyday life activities and most of her life she was under psychiatric care. She depended on other people even to cross a road, a strongest example cannot be given.We can only imagine the nightmare that her husband, and later her daughters, had to endure during some 25 years. All the time a mother-in-law was there to provide some stability to household life and her husband was prepared to put up with a lot of suffering (he knew about Sexton's multiple sexual affairs, for example) always hoping that she would get better and for a normal family life.Since people are not saints, it is only understandable that from time to time there were terrible anger outbursts.This biography raises a few non-trivial questions.First, in my opinion, nothing but medical care legitimates the access to the medical archives of a patient. I strongly disapprove of their being used in this work.Second, at a differently level, it is utterly disgusting that a psychiatrist, or a medical doctor for that matter, allows himself to get sexually involved with a patient. I see no reason for him not to be banned from the profession right away.Third, it is clear that with the remarkable exceptions of Dr Orne and his mother among probably others, some people treating Anne were incompetent, the last one not being even a psychiatrist but a psychiatric social worker... How is it possible that with her medical history, full of suicide attempts, alcoholism, hospital stays and so on, someone can say that \\"... Sexton had recently shown significant gains and that the decision to seek a divorce was reasonable\\"? (page 371, opinion of Dr Chase).Sexton went ahead with the divorce, both daughters were angry at the wayshe treated their father, some friends tried to talk her out of that decision, provided care and, nothing that were not to be expected, gotfed up.The foreword, written by Dr Martin T. Orne, after all the man who suggested she try poetry, ends as follows:Sadly, if in therapy Anne had been encouraged to hold on to the vital supports that had helped herbuild the innovative career that meant so much to her and others, it is my view that Anne Sexton would be alive today.Well, it is a rather assertive statement BUT she might."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"Biographies are a tricky business. To tell the truth about a person's life, to be fair and thorough without being unkind is a fine line to tread. Diane Middlebrook certainly didn't flinch at giving the reader the dirt on Anne Sexton. From her series of extra-marital affairs to her daughter's memories of Sexton's inappropriate, incestuous behavior--all of it was fair game in Middlebrook's book. She even quoted from audiotapes of Anne Sexton's therapy sessions. This is a biography of a woman brutally exposed, psychologically naked and under a spotlight; strangely, I think that Anne Sexton would be at peace with this enormous invasion of her privacy.In addition to the lurid personal details and the deep analyses of Sexton's troubled psyche, Middlebrook shows the reader Sexton's intense determination and devotion to becoming a famous poet. Anne would sit at her typewriter for hours everyday, working on poems. She was also very aware of the benefits of creating a dramatic public persona.Sexton would walk up on stage in a striking black cocktail dress with red lipstick and a seductive swagger. Her throaty voice would cast a spell over the audience as she read her poems. \\"I am a middle-aged witch. . .\\" she would begin, and the room would be spell-bound by both her glamour and her bold confessional poetry. But underneath it all, she was a nervous wreck, unable to give a reading without a quick shot of liquor to make her knees stop shaking!Diane Middlebrook's biography was so piercing, so unforgiving, it was, at times, truly uncomfortable to read. I felt almost voyeuristic, pouring over these shocking private details of Anne Sexton's life. Yet, Middlebrook's book did give me an amazingly powerful feeling of intimacy with one of my favorite poets. She revealed the fragile, flawed Anne Sexton behind the public shell of dark glamour.Any fans of Sexton's poetry that want to understand the woman behind the words should go ahead and get this book; just be forewarned that Middlebrook does not try to flatter Sexton, only to be truthful."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"This biography reminds us we need to read Anne Sexton, as she was one of this country's fore-most confessional poets.The biography was engrossing, and elucidated many things I had not known about Sexton, or had only vaguely heard discussed.Such difficult times she and her fellow confessional poet, Sylvia Plath, lived in.One cannot help but wonder how things might have been different for Sexton and Plath, had they been born a couple of decades later.Very well worth reading."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"This advice applies to anyone who has stumbled upon this page whether or not you like biography or poetry or Anne Sexton. It is one of the few biographies I have read that I would describe as a true page-turner. Yes, Sexton's life has all the ingredients of a page turner. There's incest, there's adultery, there's substance abuse, there's mental illness. All this in the life of someone whose adulthood began as a rather typical 1950s housewife. Middlebrook does not spare us the gritty details, but neither does she exploit her subject for mere sensationalism. Always, even in taking the controversial step of using Sexton's psychotherapy tapes, she demonstrates respect for her subject and for the surviving members of Sexton's family. When her evidence is conflicting about what really happened, as in the case of Sexton's memory of an incestual episode with her father, Middlebrook presents us with the various views of family members and friends and gives us their reasons for believing what they do. Then she presents her own conclusions. Above all else, this is the story of a woman's survival, of her finding herself and saving herself through poetry despite little education and little interest, at first, in art or poetry. Sexton's first poem was a sonnet she wrote after seeing a lecture about sonnets on TV."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"This biography is a psychologically compelling, fascinating portrait of Anne Sexton the person.

The author Middleton is so adept at being unbiased toward the at times somewhat narrow, but riveting, scope of Sexton's experience (I accused her delicate side-stepping in an earlier review as being &quot;dull-witted&quot;) that I have been attempting to read between the lines. I haven't gleaned any &quot;truths&quot; but because of this, keep coming back. I think the strongest thing about Middleton's account is the sense of the universal story of a family struggle, and the bond of the family which guided Sexton's poetry and had much bearing on her life. This is important for me to tell myself, I find myself feeling, in reading this one &quot;too many times.&quot; I hope Middleton writes more biographies of women."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"I have not been able to disregard the fact that this brilliant biography by one of the most important poets of our age appears to have been forgotten amid the heat of commerce. But there is another kind of commerce: one in which women have an expertise. When one of us is felled by tragedy, like the huge loss of Anne Sexton, it touches each and every one of us as we learn of its happenstance. One does not have to be a poet, an artist or suicidal to get this. Our collective history as women struggling to balance our lives within a largely patriarchal society with love, home, marriage, divorce, children, career, and faith in whatever form or not - is a burden to which few will admit. Anne Sexton, however, met all of the latter head on with genius artistry and with all the passion and complexitiy any soul could bear. Indeed, as Diane Middlebrook brilliantly writes - she bore it for as long as she possibly could with more grace, style and courage than most. In fact, not only is this biography essential as a purchase, but take the time to collect (if you can...) everything Anne Sexton wrote. You will never be quite the same. And I can only guess that she would have liked that...."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"The biographer here had an unusual advantage: Anne Sexton's daughter gave her access to taped sessions Sexton's psychiatrist had made of his sessions with Sexton. This disclosure of what are normally privileged sessions raised eyebrows, but I did not find the disclosure obtained from these tapes that revealing. It was obvious to anyone who came into contact with her that Sexton was a very disturbed person, and her doctor does not seem to have come to a definitive diagnosis. It may well be that she suffered from some physical defect of the brain that could not be diagnosed during her lifetime.What is clear is that Sexton made life difficult for those closest to her, such as her husband and her children. Wildly unstable, she demanded more than anyone could give, and gave back little in return. On the other hand, she was one of the major poets of her time, and talented writers can get away with being miserable people. A weakness of this book is that it not very strong on Sexton's poetry, which is the only reason people are interested in her. Still, it is well researched, and is likely to remain useful to those interested in Sexton for years to come."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"Middlebrook wrote a pretty good biography of one of our more important poets, though I'll say that Sexton is an example of the artist being more interesting than the art.

And believe me, that woman was really screwed up."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"Biography is amazing. I was captivated - not just because Anne Sexton is such a fascinating subject, but also because Diane Middlebrook is such an amazing biographer. Her honesty and integrity were so admirable, and I never felt she was judging Sexton. Middlebrook beautifully presented the great, the good and the bad. She wanted to give a full picture of Sexton. I love the little anecdotes, how Sexton would saunter on stage a few minutes late to a reading, her frightening addition to alcohol, her mental illness (the baked potato thing just left me befuddled), her sexual voraciousness, her purity to writing and her writing methods and her eccentricities. I fully empathize with Sexton's family, who did all they could to cope with the situation. I really enjoyed this book. It made me want to read Sexton's works, which I enjoyed as well. Definitely a biography worthy of the great Anne Sexton."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"Ms. Middlebrook provides an extremely detailed look into the life of Anne Sexton. By using interviews, Sexton's writings and recordings of Sexton's therapy sessions, Middlebrook leaves no stone unturned in her lengthy book on Sexton.

Overall, however, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to admirers of Sexton or fans of good biography."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"This was a national bestseller when it came out in 1991.It really is a very good book. Ever since my \\"Sylvia Plath phase,\\" I have wanted to read a biography of Anne Sexton.It leaves me wondering about the values people choose to praise. I'll leave the others to opine about her poetry.I think the moment Anne Sexton surprised her loyal and faithful husband for a divorce encapsulated about all one needs to know about her. She proudly admitted to being an addict: addicted to alcohol and prescribed medication.She was born in 1928. She committed suicide in 1974. Forty-six years old. \\"A middle-aged witch\\" [Chapter 17] at age 42 (1970).She was forty-one years old in 1969. I graduated from high school in the spring of 1969. From p. 321 in the biography:In 1969 it seemed harder than ever to to be parents of teenagers [Anne and her husband Kayo had two young teenage daughters, Linda and Joy]. [The Pill was approved by the FDA in the early 1960s; its use spread rapidly in the late part of that decade, generating an enormous social impact. Time Magazine placed the pill on its cover in April, 1967. -- wikipedia] Suddenly, even in the suburbs, everyone was in drug trouble, if marijuana was the drug in question (letters indicate that Anne too sneaked a joint now and then during Kayo's absence; he loudly disapproved of pot). The point wasn't so much the drugs, though, as the \\"drug culture,\\" which made parents lose their bearings. Nineteen sixty-nine was the year of Woodstock; albums by Janis Joplin, the Jefferson Airplane, and the Doors, prescribing sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, were hard to get away from. These new media stars were white, middle-class young people with good educations who had seemingly evolved in a single generation into sleek, charismatic animals of a new breed. Their music surged into suburban homes and, like a tide lifting all the boats, made parents worry about what their own children were up to. Sexton reported that her daughter Linda had \\"fallen in love with a hippy with long, long hair. What do I say? I'm kind of a hippy myself.\\" Should Linda go on the pill? If she smoked, shouldn't she pay for her own cigarettes?But this is what Linda saw. Their parents felt routines were very important for the family, and dinner as a family was an important routine. The parents \\"banned\\" Linda and Joy from the kitchen while dinner was being prepared. Anne and Kayo were sloshed on martinis by the time dinner was served at eight or nine o'clock. \\"Daddy would open a small package of frozen peas, maybe bake those small boiling potatoes, one apiece -- no salad, no desert. Mother would gag down a drumstick. She was hardly able to swallow anything solid; she'd often get up from the table and vomit her food,\\" according to Linda. One night her mother fell face first into mashed potatoes at the dinner table.According to Middlebrook, \\"the dearth of food had nothing to do with the Sextons' financial situation, as during those same years they ordered champagne by the case.\\" And then Middlebrook tries to rationalize the reason for the dearth of food. The bottom line was that both parents were alcoholics.And then folks wonder how \\"Woodstock generation\\" could have come about.This is an excellent book. It's another tile in the mosaic that became the Woodstock generation."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"This is an extraordinary individual who lived through her language that spoke of her creativity and powerful forces of mental agony.

What was needed here were in-depth insights, an emotional full-color panorama of one of the century's most intriguing famous people, the unfolding of the many emotional dichotomies that operated within Sexton.Instead, this biography is nothing more than 488 pages of sterile commentaries of the woman's life and heady, highly technical reviews of her work. Middlebrook merely grazes the tragedies and disappointments in Sexton's life -- many so universal. If Middlebrook does have an emotional observation about her subject, she well and erroneously hides it. I particularly took issue with Middlebrook's superficial discussion of the abuses Sexton underwent as a child and then perpetrated on her own children, especially the eldest.I am not suggesting that Sexton, a child abuser, should have been presented as a pitiful creature, someone who should be glorified and admired, no holds barred. One of the book's basic flaws was the absence of separating Sexton, the person, from Sexton's poetry. As beautiful and haunting as her poems are, Sexton herself was a selfish, cruel woman who, despite every privilege and opportunity presented to her, was so self-absorbed that she cared nothing for her two most miraculous creations, her daughters, except how she could creatively and psychologically benefit from having children. Like they were her little science experiments, discarded at the slightest whim. That so aptly exemplified the driving force behind this woman, that it is a shame it was never presented in human terms."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"One of the best biographies I have read in years. I think I can now better understand Ms. Sexton's poetry and her madness. What a profound effect our childhood's have on our entire life. I highly recommend this book to Sexton lovers. You'll come away with a deeper understanding and love of her poetry."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"She was beautiful, sexual, sensual, always uncomfortable in her own skin, and a poetic genius. As Anais Nin did, Sexton attempted to seduce her therapists and at least once succeeded. She envied Sylvia Plath's suicide, and eventually staged her own, having planned it for years. She was in therapy most of her adult life, and this account of her life would be a useful read for any student of psychology. Sexton's problems were much the same as those of any average American woman, so one likes her and identifies with her. But she did not handle her difficulties so well, and so one comes away feeling a bit saner, a bit more competent. Middlebrook succeeds in making a compelling life into a compelling read."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"Obviously I do not think so. Sexton was I think more aware of the impact she was making and what &quot;turf&quot; was available to women writers in the Fifties. Same as today -- the body. Writing about her own body she could reach for universality. But Middlebrook is not willing to really examine her poems except to analyze their &quot;clang&quot; or rhyme scheme, and after awhile comes off as kind of dull-witted; eternally pointing out that Sexton can rhyme. The meaty stuff of why Sexton became a celebrity, commanded high speaker fees (for her time) on such small book sales Middlebrook doesn't go into. I would rather read the biography by Sexton's daughter Linda if I can find it. I think Linda also forgave her mother for being sexual, later; but I may be wrong."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton - A Biography","review":"Patient records are privileged; Dr. Orne justifies releasing tapes of Anne Sexton's therapy because the daughter of A.S. approved. He wrote the preface to the book, displaying a rather passive attitude to the malfeasance of the therapist who slept with A.S. And does the end--understanding creativity/a poet's life and death--justify the means? Do outpourings in therapy tell readers about where creativity comes from, how it is shaped, the interplay of life and art? I doubt it. People &quot;edit&quot; their therapy talk, too, though differently from their public utterings. Readers may be seduced by these secrets, hoping to find answers that cannot be given, even--maybe especially--by therapists. I think the biographer overplays her hand, and might have done a better book without the controversial tapes."},{"Title":"A Guide for Customer Service in the Beauty Industry","review":"This Guide is simply written yet exceptionally effective.

Different authors study the same programs and come to opposite conclusions. Since they all offer elaborate defenses of their methods, making sense out the analyses becomes a matter of statistical nit-picking. Meanwhile, they don't say much about how or why educational competition works. This book approaches the issue from the opposite direction: it doesn't offer any statistical proof of anything, but it provides a challenging look at the reality of educational competition.What I really liked about this book is that the author doesn't try to prove that school choice does or doesn't work. Instead, he dives into trying to understand how it affects the public schools in the community. Using extensive interviewing, research, and document collection, he offers the deepest look I know of into how school choice competition actually plays out. The reliance on interviews and historical narrative also has the plus of making it much more engaging than the standard analysis of school vouchers. The book also offers some important insights regarding urban schooling and the nature of urban school reform.This is a book that is definitely worth reading for anyone interested in school vouchers, or even those who just want to learn more about school reform or urban schooling."},{"Title":"Revolution at the Margins: The Impact of Competition on Urban School Systems","review":"This book provides an evaluation by an educational and governmental researcher of the impact of several schemes of the 1990's setting up voucher and charter schools - paying poor parents if they withdrew their children from inner-city state schools and enrolled them in the private sector. As previous school reform efforts backed by liberal-leftists had failed children, and as court-propelled desegregation led to White flight, many of America's inner-city schools became so appalling that even Democrat-voting Blacks wanted the opportunity to seek private education - and linked up with Republicans to achieve that goal. Frederick Hess's concern here is with the argument of pro-choice campaigners that the new private schools, far from threatening public schools by creaming off brighter children, would actually stimulate much-needed reforms in the public sector; and his strategy is to interview heads, teachers and administrators in three public authority areas which allowed some degree of parental choice - Milwaukee, Cleveland and the Edgewood district of San Antonio, Texas.Regrettably, Revolution at the Margins says rather more about educational research than about the impact of pro-choice initiatives. Essentially, Hess finds virtually no result at all from competition with the politically well-entrenched public sector. Bureaucrats occasionally mobilized themselves to a little mendacious propaganda (hanging banners outside public schools saying 'High Standards Start Here'), to teaching test-taking strategies to children, and to mounting legal actions to cramp the style of choice schools; but usually there was no action beyond verbal \\"lashing out\\" (for example at the \\"racist and rapacious\\" proponents of choice). Behind and explaining such inertness lie the 'education systems' of the (Black and Hispanic) slums with their low wages for, and high turnover of teachers. An area that *did* risk union wrath by sacking scores of teachers one spring found it had to re-employ them all, in different schools, by the autumn. Since only idealists and incompetents will work for low wages, yet need self-respect, state teachers would simply shrug off the arrival of competition and continue in their own favoured (\\"idiosyncratic\\", says Hess) ways - telling Hess \\"we have too much on our hands to worry about vouchers and charters\\" and \\"you're lucky we're here to provide this service\\" (even when 40% of state teachers had themselves stopped sending their own offspring to state schools). Quite often, because of high pupil turnover in slum schools, teachers had literally no idea that their school was indeed losing pupils to the private sector. In any case, the size of the challenge in the three schemes studied was slight. Hess concludes that only really large choice schemes will prove sufficiently \\"fearsome\\" to make state teachers change; and that, even then, change will be unlikely without background 'institutional reform' needed for the last thirty years but never adopted - notably, giving heads the power to sack weak teachers. State educators are in an impossible position, apparently, after decades of liberal-left misrule. \\"Imagine,\\" Hess writes, \\"a private sector producer whose consumers disagree about what kind of product they want; who depends on the support of both consumers and nonconsumers; whose executives are largely unable to evaluate, hire, fire, reward, or sanction employees; and whose product is hard to judge. Any executive, whether Henry Ford, Jack Welch, or Bill Gates - would struggle in the face of such odds.\\" Thus \\"there was no evidence that competition bulldozed away inefficiencies or forced systemic efforts to reform policy or improve practice, as officials had neither the incentive nor the ability to mount aggressive assaults on organizational culture or procedure.\\"Yet, as if all this were not depressing enough, Hess's method of arriving at his conclusions will make grown men weep. It is not just that Hess's 'research' involves none of the normal listings of subjects interviewed, questions asked, percentages favouring different answers, etc. Hess is content to provide the kind historical record of developments that could be, and probably was culled from local newspapers - supplemented by a few conversations of his own. This method results in pages littered with dollar signs, numbers and capital letters as the various outlays are made, as votes are taken, and as unions express outrage; but even this is not the worst.A specialist volume like this should present, first, a testing of whether choice schools produce better end-of-the-year results for pupils than could be expected from their children's starting IQs; and, secondly, a testing of whether such value-added results occur with increasing frequency in state schools after the arrival of private school competition. How else could one possibly say whether either set of schools had truly been doing a good job? Yet test results are scarcely mentioned in this volume, and value-added calculations not at all - and this despite the book being endorsed on its dust jacket by half-a-dozen worthies from the world of educational research. OK, since Hess believes test scores are largely determined by socio-economic circumstances (and never mentions education professor Arthur Jensen), it might have been less problematic for him to ask the children and their parents if they became *happier* as school choice was expanded; but Hess does not even consider, let alone use this humdrum route. Frankly, one wonders what hope there can be for America's children when even a sympathizer with 'choice', as Hess apparently is, cannot imagine and discuss a reasonable way of evaluating the experiment that has been underway in the cities. Hess is right as far as he goes: \\"So long as school systems are governed by rickety bureaucracies, run by managers bereft of data or tools, staffed by employees who have little motivation beyond the intrinsic, charged with producing ill-defined and ambiguous outcomes, and faced with few penalties for poor performance, efforts at substantive improvement - whether market driven or not - will be stifled.\\" But educational research, too, turns out to stand in similar need of data and re-tooling. One thing is sure: experiments in allowing parental freedom will continue by popular demand so long as educators and educationalists persist in the dismal set of attitudes and practices that this book casually reveals."},{"Title":"Revolution at the Margins: The Impact of Competition on Urban School Systems","review":"Hess explores these issues in a unique and interesting way."},{"Title":"Quantum Field Theory of Many-body Systems: From the Origin of Sound to an Origin of Light and Electrons (Oxford Graduate Texts)","review":"The other two reviewers have both noted that the book may not be a good starting point for a beginner, and I entirely agree.Think Weinberg's three-volume QFT, or Feynman's Lectures on Physics. These books are good, full of insights, and will teach you a lot more if you already have some basic understanding of the respective subjects. However, you will suffer if these books are used as introductory texts.That said, I find Wen's book generally a good read, and it nicely explains several concepts that I didn't understand until now. Well, I am a field theorist in my 4th year of grad school-- not exactly a beginner. But still.One such instance is the section on Berry phase of a spin. Granted, Wen pretty much just throw at you the concept of a coherent state, but that part I learned just all right from other places. What's important is, Wen's book explains the next step \\"coherent state --> Berry phase\\" clearly. It's the only comprehensible derivation I've seen so far. (See, for example, Fradkin's Field Theories for Condensed Matters for an **unintelligible** derivation.)I do sometimes find Wen's narrative style annoying.

That event is at the heart of Sunshower, but the book is much more than a story of a suicide. It is largely a survivor's tale, eloquently and unflinchingly told by his wife, Karen. With the grace of a poet and the insight of someone who has lived through the unthinkable, Karen Kenyon chronicles her life with Dick and the process of coming to terms with his end. In sharing this ultimately affirming story, Kenyon explores the most profound questions any of us can ask about life and love and the mystery that is every human being. I strongly recommend this beautiful book."},{"Title":"Sunshower","review":"As a psychotherapist in private practice, I am often asked to recommend a book to help someone through a &quot;dark wood.&quot; This is such a book. Ms. Kenyon is fiercely brave in her telling of her husband's suicide and what came after. How does one survive the unthinkable, sort out enough of (for so much here is unknowable) the grief, guilt, anger, self-blame, and fear so that life is again possible for those left behind? How does anyone go on to reclaim some right place in the world and some right place in the heart for the loved one who has chosen to die? This book is filled with the quiet courage too often unacknowledged of just keeping on, of continuning to do what feels right and necessary when life is so difficult we're not sure we can stand it. Ms. Kenyon shares with us her courage, guidance, wisdom, even humor. She makes us a map of those places the ancients used to mark by saying, &quot;Here Be Dragons.&quot; She helps us find again a world that remembers light, hope, laughter. What Elisabeth Kubler-Ross saw and recommended some years ago in SUNSHOWER is as relevant now as it was when this book was first published.

I decided to do that because King finally teaches me so many things I should have learned &amp; understood in the basic botany and ecology courses I took ca. 20 years ago.All in all, this is a wonderful book and I would have credited it full five stars if it wasn't for this one weakness. There is not a single picture in the book. Some pictures would indeed have been most desirable, especially from laymens' point of view, for example in connection with the descriptions of anatomical details of leaves. Therefore the readers of the Finnish translation will be privileged in enjoying King's fine and clear text supported with pictures - provided the original publisher agrees to this."},{"Title":"Reaching for the Sun: How Plants Work","review":"Where does a giant sequoia's 1500 cubic meters of volume come from if not soil? How is it that most grasses are not killed by flooding when even a brief period of waterlogged soil will kill many other plants? Why does snow melt near flowering crocuses? What is the 'carbon cycle'? The 'nitrogen cycle'? Is the incredibly complex system known as photosynthesis really fundamental to virtually all life on this planet? Professor King offers and then answers (to the best of our present knowledge) these rather obvious questions as well as others that we may not have thought to ask.For this reader, the first six chapters were the most fascinating. Of photosynthesis, King says; \\"There are lots of carbon dioxide and water molecules in the air, oceans, lakes, the soil, and inside living organisms, but the chances of any of them simply coming together in the right way to produce even a single molecule of glucose are extremely remote.... is not likely to have happened in the billions of years carbon dioxide and water have existed ... Yet, green plants form glucose from carbon dioxide and water every daylight hour during their growing seasons. Having accomplished that impressive feat, plants then go on to produce a seemingly endless supply of sucrose, starch, and cellulose from the glucose.\\" And of plant's partnerships with nitrogen fixing microbes: \\"It is, arguably, not to strong to call this process miraculous. The nitrogen fixation carried out by certain microbes at normal temperatures and pressures in and around plant roots we can match only through the use of enormous amounts of energy in the industrial Haber process; temperatures of 300-400C and pressures greater than 350 atmospheres.\\" Indeed, the botanical world is one of incredibly complex biochemical machinery! Machinery on which we all directly depend.The chapters that follow examine the chemical strategies by which plants survive and reproduce. Where the text speculates about evolutionary pathways, we see, as is typical of such texts (and as Behe, Lovtrup, Yockey, Spetner and others have pointed out), that what is basically assumed to explain 'development' on large scales, \\"is not so clear\\" at the biochemical level, and as King concedes, \\"is not known,\\" and \\"remains a mystery.\\" What might be the origin of such complex biochemical machinery, if, as King says, \\"organisms do not put energy and materials into processes that have no function.\\"? It's difficult to see how Darwinian gradualism could design such complexity (unless we are simply predisposed to believe that it did). While King occasionally visits Darwin and these biochemical problems, this volume generally pursues other considerations. The human histories of plants -- in terms of perfumes, the spice trade, agriculture, poisons, intoxicants, and medicines -- are extensively considered in the later chapters.The books greater strength, however, is its revelation of \\"how plants work.\\" If plants interest you (and they should), then you are the reader that Professor King wishes to educate with this volume. It's an interesting book, although I would have liked further consideration of photosynthesis and less of perfume."},{"Title":"Reaching for the Sun: How Plants Work","review":"King offers a fascinating tutorial on plant workings in an uncommonly effective format. He describes chemical and biological facts that are common in text books but rare in more digestible books (carbon dioxide + water + sunlight = glucose + oxygen, leaf stomata and guard cells, etc.). He uses this scientific foundation to explain plant characteristics that everyone observes. For example, where does most of the huge mass of a large tree come from? (It isn't the soil!) And how do plants detect the changing of seasons so reliably? King also offers fascinating examples of interdependencies between plants and animals. Plants that have developed highly specialized flowers to attract specific insect pollinators. Seeds that do not end dormancy until their case is weakened by passing through the digestive tract of an animal that ate the fruit that contained the seed. Such concrete evidence of interdependency in nature is a more compelling argument for the importance of preservation and ecology than many of the published naturalist journals which paint picturesque images but lack the substance of King's contentions. Wonderful reading!"},{"Title":"Reaching for the Sun: How Plants Work","review":"The book is OK, very typical book that is written by a professor. First 5 chapters are quite informative, read able, and give reader a feeling how plant work (he did a good job here). The next 12 chapters is putting the reader to sleep. I recommend the author need to rewrite the material so commom person can understand. The book failed to mention reproductive system of the plant. There are some part that I like is the little side story about how people did an experiment to prove a concept (good here.) All in all, I give it a 2 1/2 rating.

The title of the book and cover page speaks volumes on 'Maya' Philosophy which is explained with a scientic idea illustration to make more sense and a comparision of Maya with science. For the first time the author critically analyses and explains the 'Maya' philosophy in a scientific way with semantics, laws, logic, mathematics, language, fables etc. to give it a better sense to western thinkers. A must read book of comparitive philosophy for all global thinkers, philosophers, professors, students who take Philosophy as their study. A must book for all libraries worldwide. This book is dedicated to my mother and it is a great contribution and tribute by the author to the subject Philosophy and Philosphers. The book is published unedited, without spell checks,punctuation, without grammer, without good formatting but still is great with bombastic vocabulary, with Indian English and the subject flowing directly from author's heart. The title with scientific idea illustration shows the fifth dimension to Albert Einestien's four dimensions. The fifth dimension is the 'Real' i.e God which is added by the author in explaining, analysing his way of thought.

For example, in which chapter would you hunt for Howard Hughes? Aviation? Business Leaders, Economists, Financiers, and Publishers? Newsmakers? Then again, why would I want to hunt? A purely alphabetical listing would prevent quite a few headaches, or an index would end my misery altogether.Or would it? Because unless you live and breath the autograph world, the abbreviations in this book will befuddle you. The abbreviations and what they mean should be printed on each page, even if in very small print, because locating the abbreviation keys (different in each chapter, it seems) is an exercise in utter madness.Finally, with all the advertising in this book--yes, advertising, starting with a full-page ad on the inside-front cover!--it should be priced like a large magazine at maybe $5.95 or so. The $24.95 cover price seems hard to justify with so many ads--including ads interspersed throughout the book, 24 consecutive pages at the back, and one big ad that dominates the back cover! It's a book-a-zine!I'll give Baker's book two stars out of five for its comprehensive coverage of the autograph field, but not more. I'm still trying to locate a few signatures, but with no index, I'm getting tired of hunting."},{"Title":"The Official Autograph Collector Price Guide","review":"The author is a member of the respected Universal Autograph Collectors Club, which is a non-profit organization comprised of autograph collectors founded in 1965. The UACC gave high marks to this book, which is why I gave it a try.The author does an excellent job of providing an overview of the various markets (historical figures, presidents, celebs, etc.) and gives some solid insight into collecting and what to look for. It's obvious he knows his stuff.I'll have to agree with the first reviewer, though, in that the book is not easy to navigate. There's no comprehensive alphabetical listing of the people named in the book, so you'll have to hunt for what you're looking for, assuming what you're looking for is listed somewhere.Most annoying are the abbreviations used. I'm a long-time collector, but I found myself desperately searching for the meanings of several of the abbreviations used - and they were not easy to find. A brief table at the beginning of each chapter defining these abbreviations would be fine, or just spell them out in smaller print on each page. Not difficult.The ads in the book didn't bother me as it's a reference book, not a novel you'd sit down and read cover to cover. But what did bother me was the many typos and misspellings throughout (i.e Marrtin instead of Martin). This could have easily been avoided by having someone proofread the final draft. Easy!To Mr. Baker's credit, it is obvious he did exhaustive research for this book, and a lot of the information he shares is interesting and informative. I hope when it's time for the fifth edition that he seriously considers adding an alphabetical index and double-checking the text for misspellings.

But poor editing (or writing -- it's hard to tell who made the errors) jarred me from beginning to end, starting with the first page.What jarred me? Firstly, a poor technical knowledge; i.e., a Pistole '08, called a P-'08 in the book, is a Luger semi-automatic pistol. Dold called it a 'revolver,' which is not a generic word for a handgun.Secondly, a poor choice of words; the author or editor apparently doesn't know the difference between 'critical' and 'crucial.' Believe me, there IS a difference. Likewise, he doesn't know the difference between 'poured' and 'pored' when used in the context of intense study of documents, or of 'tick' and 'tic' when writing of involuntary nervous movements.Lastly, there was too much gratuitous sex. WAY too much, described in unnecessary detail in an obvious attempt to make the book appeal to a mass market.Those things spoiled a good story for me."},{"Title":"The Last Man in Berlin","review":"This is a very good mystery-thriller, painted on the canvas of the doomed Berlin, and subsequently, doomed mid-twentieth century Europe. It carries with it some of the sadness of the wonderful Alan Furst novels, true to the time and the despair of the Armageddon our forefathers were powerless or impotent or too ignorant to avoid.Harry Wulff, the last man standing, is a successful detective wanting only to protect the people, the Berliners, from lawbreakers. Of course behind Wulff are the raging battles of the Nazi Party, the communists, as well as the criminals. This is Berlin in 1931 and 1932. Hitler is not Chancellor yet and the Reichstag has yet to be burned.His love of his partner Johanna, who won't marry him because she is Jewish, his loyalty to his friend Barlach, and his devotion to his father is touching and grounds him. We are dealing with an honorable man in dishonorable surroundings.Hot on the trail of a psychopath he seeks the advice of Johanna, much like Spenser seeks the advice of Susan Silvermann. But Spenser survives and Harry is left almost on the brink of madness himself.There was for me almost too much sex and a great deal of it was lurid and uncomfortable. The pschopath kills tranvestites; there is more than a hint of his incestuous upbringing; the Nazis use prostitutes with special skills.Yet Dold writes a compelling novel and I will read him again, and probably again. 4 stars.

I'm intrigued by cave diving, but am not yet a cave diver, so I don't know for sure, but question if some of the equipment discussed in absolutely up-to-date. The addresses for instructors and phone numbers for Florida recompression facilities may also be in question. I'm trusting, though, that the National Speleological Society (NSS) is not continuing to print something that promotes dangerous, discredited, technique. Moreoever, I've seen this book in the dive shops in north central Florida, and it still seems to be in use for cave diving instruction.First, for those who judge value in the book by the quality of printing, note that this booklet is a typewritten, photocopied, booklet, copied on 8-1/2-x-11 in paper and folded in half with a cardstock cover. I just mention this so someone expecting more is not disappointed.The book is divided into 10 short chapters, each 3 to 8 pages long, and the book can be easily read in its entirety in one evening. Each chapter begins with an actual accident report and an accident analysis leading into the subject of the chapter, whether it be silt, lights, guidline, air supply planning, etc.. Each chapter focusses on one aspect of proper cave diving, and thus the book divides techniques into small, easily digestible, pieces. Each chapter tells you what it needs to without adding extraneous information to complicate your understanding.Note that the book focusses on cave diving technique in Florida, and warns the reader that different techniques may be appropriate in other locations.I think that this book is a good, inexpensive, introduction to cave diving for someone with a curiosity about this sport, whether or not you plan to pursue it. The book is also written by the probably best-known person in the field of Cave Diving. (Don't let the fact that Sheck Exley died cave diving cause you discredit the information in this book - he balanced the risks with the rewards and willingly chose to push the limits of cave diving.)It would be irresponsible of me to conclude this review without a warning. An open water diver armed with the this book might think that they know enough to safely cave dive, but PLEASE do not attempt cave diving without training from an appropriate agency. I am an open water divemaster, and do not feel that I yet have the experience to even begin cave diving training.

This easy-to-read and affordable book presents a creative new &quot;from the grass-roots&quot; model for Sunday School which is being adopted by many churches acrosst the country.While I'm sure having Dennis Rodman show up on a Sunday morning would add some color to any Sunday School program, in this case &quot;WoRM&quot; refers not to the outrageous Chicago Bulls rebounder but to the &quot;Workshop Rotation Model.&quot; When the co-authors of Workshop Rotation: a New Model for Sunday School found themselves as new colleagues on the staff of a Presbyterian church in Illinois, they realized something needed to change in the children's Sunday School. They were confronted with sagging attendance, low teacher morale, difficulty recruiting new volunteers, a budget straining to afford costly curriculum which was of limited use, and a building that looked depressing even on a bright sunny day. Many church education leaders can relate to their dilemma. Armstrong-Hansche and MacQueen's solution was to reinvent the entire structure of the program. The result was what now goes by the term of &quot;the workshop rotation model,&quot; or more simply, &quot;rotation.&quot; Word of the new enthusiasm for learning and burgeoning attendance at their church spread, and WoRM is now used in many churches across the country.In WoRM, the school year is divided into six or seven &quot;rotations&quot; of approximately five weeks each. The age-level classrooms in the education building are transformed into &quot;workshops.&quot; Sample workshops include drama, audiovisual, art, Bible times, computer skills. One and only one Bible story is the focus for each rotation. Each class spends one week in each workshop, rotating to a different one each week. By the end of the rotation, they have encountered and internalized the story in several different ways. Workshop leaders are recruited specifically for their skills in a particular area and are only obligated to teach for one or two rotations. They only need prepare one basic lesson plan for the five weeks, simply modifying it slightly for the different ages. Each workshop space is creatively decorated in a way that promotes its theme. Heavy wooden Sunday school furniture and bare walls disappear in lieu of canvas backdrops and art stools. Armstrong-Hansche and MacQueen freely admit that their model bears some resemblance to what has been done in limited ways for years as part of intergenerational learning events or Vacation Bible School. Their contribution was to devise a coherent way for their entire Sunday School program to function on the workshop model all year long.After their first year using Workshop Rotation, not only had the children's enthusiasm skyrocketed, but so had their volunteers. They had people walking up to them at coffee hour asking if they couldn't please teach Sunday School! Most importantly, they found that the level of biblical literacy among the students had increased dramatically. Encountering the same story for several weeks in a row enabled students to explore it much more deeply. The variety of learning styles incorporated in the workshops ensured that each student experienced the story in multiple ways and internalized it. Even those students who only had 50% attendance due to joint custody arrangements or traveling soccer leagues were learning and wrestling with the stories.In this short (91 pp) book, the authors outline the basic structure and advantages to the rotation model. They give enough information that you can understand their vision and begin to ponder if or how it might be helpful for your parish. More detailed resources are listed at the back of the book. One of those resources is a website, www.rotation.org, which includes scores of free lesson ideas written by the authors and by educators in other churches which have adopted the model. The website would be a great first stop for learning more about &quot;Rotation.&quot; Even if you are not inclined to entirely restructure your Sunday School along WoRM lines, I would encourage all parish CE Committee chairs or parish education staff to at least read this book and check out the website. The book is easy to read, and at the very least will give you some wonderful ideas for the next time you want to use &quot;activity centers&quot; at a parish event, although it will probably give you far more than that."},{"Title":"Workshop Rotation: A New Model for Sunday School (Strategies & Resources)","review":"Exactly what someone who is frustrated with problems of having a successful Sunday School program is looking for.

I found the writing style an intriguing change from the books I've been reading lately. Many authors present good plotlines with mediocre writing, or mediocre plotlines with mediocre writing. When I picked up Trick of the Eye and read the first page, I was blown away. Here, FINALLY, was an author who actually forced me to think.In this book,twelve-year-old Richard is a socially handicapped boy in eighteenth or nineteenth century England who can converse with paintings. Upon talking with the characters in a painting of a farm, which is in his dining room, he is caught up in a mystery that he knows he has to solve, without quite knowing why. The reader literally learns while Richard remembers the events nine years ago which made him who he is today.I appreciated the symbolism in the book a great deal, and while Richard's memory itself was rather cliched, it provided an interesting and surprising background to the whole story. Those of you who found the writing tiring, maybe you should go pick up a book with mediocre writing style that doesn't challenge your mind at all. Don't complain because you actually had to think."},{"Title":"Trick of the Eye","review":"A book for older teenagers or adults, with an intricate plot that requires attention to detail. That being said, it's a rewarding read, emotionally rich; and the reader is rewarded with a shattering conclusion. I particularly loved the protagonist, whose psychological growth unfolds as the plot progresses. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Trick of the Eye","review":"I was attracted to the cover of this book because it reminded me of \\"The Girl with the Pearl Earring\\" which was a book I loved. Unfortunately this book was nothing like that one, except that they both involve paintings.This book was like reading one long therapy session. It follows the journey of 12-year-old Richard as he struggles to remember something that has happened in his past. He is able to communicate with characters in paintings and they give him clues to follow as he tries to track down one particular painting that will be able to answer all his questions. It appears to be set in England maybe in the late 1800's or early 1900's, and he is a very polite and proper young man.I found this book very difficult to get through. For one thing, the author uses a lot of incomplete sentences (especially when the painting characters are talking) in an attempt, I think, to create suspense. The thoughts are never fully disclosed, but instead of being intrigued, I was frustrated. I could tell early on that the boy was going to have to remember something painful from his past and I even tried to rationalize that a therapist was showing him various paintings to get him to relate his feelings and remember the event, or that he was mentally ill and was imagining talking to the characters in these paintings. But I was wrong. He apparently was really conversing with them as they also able to relate their feelings when this horrible event took place.The majority of the book is Richard's quest to find the essential painting. The final two chapters are actually the story. It wraps up the entire \\"mystery\\" cleanly and we presume that Richard will now be \\"healed\\" and no longer bothered by unexplained nightmares.The entire book is very innocent and clean up until these final chapters where we discover some mature themes have occurred, and that all the essential paintings were in the same room when these events happened. The concept sounds great, but unfortunately I found the author's writing and style to be lacking and he just didn't achieve that story that could have been very intriguing."},{"Title":"Trick of the Eye","review":"I must say that I absolutely hated this story.

Not the least of the attractions of this book is Fadiman's charming 60 page introductory essay about his life as a reader. What follows are 900 pages of good reading, including 51 selections by 36 authors. Most are short stories, but there are also humorous sketches, essays, selections from novels, and odd-ball things such as a letter by Oliver Wendell Holmes.Fadiman's literary tastes can perhaps be described as upper middle class with a bit of emphasis on the macabre. The authors represented here include Thomas Mann, Somerset Maugham, George Santayana, James Thurber, E.M. Forster, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, and Katherine Ann Porter. Fadiman's erudite essays introduce each selection.The 1920s and 1930s were truly the golden age of the short story, due no doubt to the proliferation of magazines and their demand for good commercial writing. The stories Fadiman has selected for this anthology are the best of their type.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Reading I've Liked - a Personal Selection Drawn From Two Decades of Reading And Reviewing Presented with An Informal Prologue And Various Commentaries","review":"This is a collection of short writings by a number of authors.

The adage &quot;Never judge a book by its cover&quot; did not hold true here. When i looked at the cover, my first impression was slightly negative. Then i browsed through the book. There are so many pictures completely out of focus! At first i thought my eyes were faltering, but that's not the case (quite yet). Go to page 61, 103, 106, even the photo of the author's son in the dedication! This should be unacceptable, especially in a book that tries to convey suggestions and ideas for projects in a visual way.I did not care much for the romantic quotes and new-agey messages interspersed among the pages.

But the book is actually contrary to Thoreau's ideals. Thoreau's ideas are inspiring in saving our world today, which is getting buried in a moutain of non-needed commodities. Thoreau supported conservation and opposed anti-environmental practices such as fashion. In the child's book the bear Henry tries to build a simple house but does it all wrong; the little house is terribly too small. Thoreau showed how a person could live consuming little. This book laughs at a childlike figure who tried that. It would be better to read \\"Walden Pond\\" and tell the child about Thoreau's ideas than to buy this book for the child. One can only say it's based on Thoreau's life if you entirely ignore his ideas and focus only on the fact he physically built a cabin by a pond. When my father (a lawyer like me) died, he had one book in his briefcase--\\"Walden Pond\\" in paperback. It is a treasure, and, sadly this book is like a mockery of the book and a mockery of the childlike bear who tried to accomplish something."},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"Henry, a sturdy looking bear wearing a large hat and workclothes, is building a cabin in the woods. He borrows an ax and cuts down twelve trees for framing, buys an old shed, takes it apart and uses the wood for the walls and floor. He builds a front door, finds two used windows and some old shingles for the roof. As he's building, friends stop by to look at the cabin and check on his progress. Emerson comments that it seems too small to eat in. &quot;It's bigger than it looks,&quot; replies Henry and shows him his garden out back. &quot;When it's finished, this will be my dining room.&quot; Friend, Alcott thinks the cabin will be too dark to read in, but Henry shows him a sunny spot right outside. &quot;This will be my library.&quot; And when Miss Lydia shows concern that there won't be room for dancing, Henry shows her the pathway down to the pond, his grand stairway to the ballroom. On July 4th, Henry's cabin is finished and he moves in. He eats in the &quot;dining room&quot;, reads in the &quot;library&quot; and dances in his &quot;ballroom&quot;. When it begins to rain, he hurries back to his cabin, where in a very wise and amusing way he shows us that his new home is just perfect..... D.B. Johnson is back with a marvelous sequel to his award winning first picture book, Henry Hikes To Fitchburg, based on the life of Henry David Thoreau. His simple and inspiring text is sure to be a springboard to interesting and thoughtful discussions. What does a home really need, and how big does it have to be? Mr Johnson's creative and expressive, light-filled illustrations enhance the story beautifully, and capture the imagination. With an author's note at the end &quot;About Henry's Cabin&quot;, to help fill in the details of how and why Thoreau built his cabin, its cost, and his two years living at Waldens Pond, Henry Builds A Cabin is an engaging and unique little treasure youngsters 4-8 shouldn't miss. &quot;Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think they must have such a one as their neighbors have.&quot;"},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"I'm 12 but I really like this picture book. I learned a lot about what Henry Thoreau was trying to do when he built a cabin by Walden Pond, and it was fun learning it through this book. The illustrations are funny and I like how Henry solves his problems. I also like Henry Hikes to Fitchburg, which is even funnier because Henry makes his friend learn a lesson in a funny way. I also recommend another great book about Henrey Thoreau, that especially girls of all ages will like, Louisa May and Mr. Thoreau's Flute. It talks about how Henrey Thoreau helped Louisa May Alcott learn to like the outdoors and learn to like writing. Henry's funny in that book too so I think readers will like it too."},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"What a delightful book! Based on Henry David Thoreau's time at Walden pond, this simple, direct little tale first recounts how and with what he built his cabin. By emphasizing Thoreau's skill and his use of recycled old house parts, the book enlivens his self-sufficiency and his critique of materialism.The best parts are the three guests who interrupt Henry's work, each one suggesting some shortcoming in Henry's construction. The cabin is too small to eat or dance in, they suggest, too dark to read in. Each time, Henry beautifully and effortlesy turns these criticisms upside down. He patiently (and with quiet enthusiasm) explains that by living in nature he has annexed all of the space and sun and beauty around him. His cabin is the entire woods and the whole pond. Thoreau's individualism emerges through these confounding, whimsical dialogues.D. B. Johnson, the author, conveys all of this in graceful, clear, subtle little exchanges. The talk is all quite concrete and easily grasped, so kids have no problem with the story. Yet Johnson's language also carries Thoreau's deeper meaning, in clever and refreshing ways.The zestful, kinetic pictures provide rich pleasure. Click on the sample pages and see for yourself! Reminiscent of early cubism and of the figurative work of Kazimir Malevich, the illustrations divide the picture plane into coutless little segments. Johnson blends them pleasingly yet also uses them to demonstrate the wonder that every little corner of nature holds for the alert eye. In his fragments of the field of view, Johnson might include a butterfly, a squirrel, a rabbit, a cardinal or bluejay, rain drops, falling leaves, on and on. Trees and pond, sky and clearings all appear active, filled with spirit. Kids will love finding and noticing and searching, for these illustrations continually surprise: they make your eyes think! Pieces of nature intersect through the cabin windows, and the wonderfully broken view swirls around Henry and his visitors in a vivid depiction of our connectiveness to nature--one of Thoreau's central beliefs.In sum, an efficient and expressive meeting of story, thought, and imagery."},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"We borrowed this book from the library and I must buy a copy for my 3yr old. He loves it. The illustrations are unique and so pleasing to the eye. They are a little abstract but not too much so you can't see what is being conveyed.Henry builds a cabin but his friends doesn't think it's big enough. Henry says it's big enough for all kinds of things. In the end, you find out what the cabin is perfect for.Delightful read and a sure bet for a Baby Shower Gift!"},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"Henry Builds a Cabin is a delightful little book, that playfully riffs on themes from Henry David Thoreau's classic work \\"Walden, or, Life in the Woods.\\" Henry decides to build a small cabin along the side of Walden pond, and his friends Emerson, Alcott and Lydia worry that it won't be big enough. He reminds them, gently, that there is space enough outside, and that we live narrow lives when we consider that we can only be at home when we are indoors and confined.The illustrations are nice, a whimsical variation on cubist style. What is most impressive is how simply the story is told and how much of Thoreau's character and background and thinking the author is able to pack into just a few easy sentences. Johnson is clearly well-versed in Thoreau's background, and clearly admires him -- and at the same time treats his story with a light and silly touch that is very appropriate for a children's book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"This book rocks. What else is there to say?If you want your kid to see nature as a regular part of life -- and what else will make him/her want to take care of the planet? -- then buy this humorous and beautiful book about living without barriers between yourself and the outdoors.Brilliant. Wildly angular pictures a plus."},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"My kids love this book. It's fun especially knowing the historical background. The drawings are charming and we have fun searching for animals."},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"In this, the second of D.B. Johnson's picture books about a bear modeled after Henry David Thoreau, the author takes another short piece from Walden to riff on, this one about how Thoreau built his cabin. In the picture book, the bear named Henry builds a small cabin in the wilderness, using borrowed or inexpensively purchased materials. One by one, his neighbors stop by to tell him that his cabin doesn't have enough room, doesn't have enough light, doesn't have the space for dancing. Henry assures each of them that his cabin is \\"bigger than it looks,\\" and he shows each of the questioning neighbors and friends where he will eat (outdoors), where he will read (outdoors) and where he will dance (outdoors).I like this book very much, just as I like what Johnson is doing in bringing the concepts of Walden to children, but the logic in this book isn't as tight as the logic in Henry Hikes to Fitchburg, where everything works perfectly. The faulty logic here is that Henry cannot eat outdoors during the deepest months of winter, nor can he read outdoors during these months, nor dance. I think the real concept behind Thoreau building a small cabin is that its size sufficed for everything he wanted to do -- that neither he nor we need huge houses."},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"I am surprised by the \\"baby-preschool\\" reading level listed for this book.I suppose the simplistic nature of the sentence structure and story line renders it so. In fact, this book was the very first my son ever received- a gift sent from an uncle after he was born. My son is six and reading chapter books, but we still read this one (and all the Henry books) and it is still one of our favorites. The illustrations are unique and continuously fascinating. We are still finding little details in the art that make us smile or further our understanding of the story. I love that Thoreau's ideas can be taught to young children. I enjoy being reminded of them- not in the complicated carbonfootprintcarpoolpoliticallycorrectisthisrecyclableandinwhichbindoesitgo kind of way- but rather the very basic principles of our impermanence and relationship to a larger world outside our door. There is an\\"appendix\\" of sorts at the end. It lends a page to Thoreau and his cabin, listing the actual cost of the materials he used: a whooping $28.12 1/2 ( Thats right- don't forget the half penny). My first grader is drawn in by the \\"real story\\" now, but his intimate knowledge of the book and love of the bear, Henry, has feed his understanding of the deeper concepts."},{"Title":"Henry Builds a Cabin","review":"If you love Thoreau, or if you don't know who he is yet, read this darling book."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill","review":"Using the glamorous backdrops of Miami Beach, Coconut Grove and The Keys to the dangerous Everglades swamps, Ms. Graham once again develops a plot that is all heat.Lust and trust get Kyle &amp; Madison through their ordeals as their wealthy extended families play their roles in tracking down a serial killer.Madison's psychic *gift* of being able to see the victims, but not the muderer and Kyle's FBI expertise, has this once step-brother &amp; step-sister as a team working together at all odds.Fun, romantic, mystery reading.

The credability that this &quot;mad &quot; person could have fooled so many was beyond belief. That is for starters but even the romance part was purely physical and there was very little I found that made the couples work as a couple... Several couples are worked on in the book but not one seemed to have a strong basis for a relationship... I read the book through as I tend to do to see how all well it tied in but ... being a romance reader and I read about 25 books a month or more... I was not impressed .

A foreign female artist, who was invited to paint a portrait of the Empress Tzu Hsi for the St. Louis Exibition, Miss Carl originally wrote in order refute untrue newspaper accounts of her visit to the \\"Dragon Lady.\\" The book reads like a charming and interesting personal diary and gives the reader an unprecidented look inside the royal court by the working artist who was treated like an honored guest. It was interesting to me how the Empress, taking into consideration her time and place, seemed not unlike the current Queen Elizabeth with regard to public decorum and adherence to tradition. I feel this book helps to give a more rounded view of the Empress as all humans have many aspects to their personality. The book is nicely bound in a hard cover and includes some photos and drawings by the author. I would have liked the cover to be more artistic instead of a generic \\"text-book\\" type cover but overall the quality of reproduction is good.

Well, come on, his life ended sadly; it just slipped away from him. So I guess this review is more or less a memorial to him.I suppose we'll never know if he actually wrote the book. I suspect his mind was still working in 1971. For his sake I hope it was. But this major figure in modern bridge only got one review, before mine, and that is gross and disgusting.I'm not an expert bridge player; in fact, I am very much average. I got hold of a bridge partner a few years after the book came out, and surprisingly I had the same kind of results the above reviewer had. We finished much higher in tournaments than we had any business doing. I remember thinking there was bound to be a stampede on Precision, but there wasn't. Strangely enough it was all very quiet (except for the Italians who were beating the world and whose Precision was far beyond mere mortals' understanding).But I'm glad Goran's Precision is still out there for sale. I think it is a true classic, but unlike other classics, it's time never came ... and then it went.

Because of that, I I feel that the title is a little misleading.The strategies are mostly quite helpful, and the tips are generally easy to follow. However, I feel that some of them go into too much detail, while others lack enough detail. Rather uneven.Also, I've accessed the author's tips sites (www.kipstips.com and www.winningclientsinawiredworld.com).

But it most certainly is not at all like the sound bite debates of Cross Fire. Great breath and depth in the arguments of the participants - anguished arguments about the relationships between means and ends, justice and freedom; and finally personal responsibility.Camus corectly sees Stalinism, read terrorism, an an unmitigated evil. Yet, he sought to live as neither victim nor executioner. That caused him no end of grief, especially as he confronted the Algerian situation. Nevertheless his arguments call to mind the views of the Polish and Czech dissidents in the 80s. An anti-politics, a living \\"as if\\" one were free. No crusade to eliminate evil from the earth, no war; rather a third way.Sartre on the other hand saw Stalinism as an understandable, even necessary, response to the injustice inflicted on the wretched of the earth. His understanding of human nature, dare one use that term in discussing Sartre, was such that chioce was required in all circumstances. By this time, in Sartre's thinking, no third way was possible. If the choice is between victim or executioner, he would choose executioner.Sartre is correct, one must choose. Camus is correct, there is a third way. Enter the debate if you dare. There is no easy exit."},{"Title":"Sartre and Camus: A Historic Confrontation","review":"An excellent treatment of the historic confrontation between Sartre and Camus following Camus' publication ofThe Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revoltand the venomous review of the book in Sartre's Temps Modernes periodical.

John Marcher, the protagonist, is re-aquainted with May Bartram, a woman he knew ten years earlier, who remembers his odd secret- Marcher is seized with the belief that his life is to be defined by some catastrophic or spectacular event, lying in wait for him like a &quot;beast in the jungle.&quot;May decides to take a flat nearby in London, and to spend her days with Marcher curiously awaiting what fate has in stall for John. Of course Marcher is a self-centered egoist, believing that he is precluded from marrying so that he does not subject his wife to his &quot;spectacular fate&quot;. So he takes May to the theatre and invites her to an occasional dinner, while not allowing her to really get close to him for her own sake. As he sits idly by and allows the best years of his life to pass, he takes May down as well, until the denouement wherein he learns that the great misfortune of his life was to throw it away, and to ignore the love of a good woman, based upon his preposterous sense of foreboding.James' language can be a bit stilted at times, and some of the dialogue may strike modern readers as out-dated. However James was a master of the novella format, and with The Beast in the Jungle he has written an engrossing psychological drama, which left me speechless at the very end. Pick up a collection that also includes The Turn of the Screw and Daisy Miller if you haven't already read them, they are accessible (more so than some of James' full length novels) and great examples of the format's potential."},{"Title":"The Beast in the Jungle and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Several months ago I was sitting in a restaurant enjoying drinks with a girl from my past who I had all but forgotten and had recently randomly encountered again. Over the course of catching up and revealing forgotten moments she said this story reminded her of me... I took it at face value and bought the 4 dollar book... It took me several days to read, (I'm a product of the american education system...) and was astounded by how relevant the experience was to our relationship. Granted, ours is an incredibly unique and personal situation, this story was well worth the read and granted me a great deal of perspective on my own experiences."},{"Title":"The Beast in the Jungle and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Henry James has always been one of my favorite writers even though many readers are put off by his very stylized writing. When I first read &quot;The Beast in the Jungle&quot;, I must admit that I was completely blown away by its powerful message. This is a type of mystery that never loses its power although you already know the ending. There is no way to describe certain moments in the story that give us a glimpse into the very soul of these characters that manage to become real to us throughout this story. Marcher's incredible egotism blinds him from seeing the truth in his life and thereby destroying not only his own life, but also destroying the life of the woman who could have helped him learn how to live before it was too late. Henry James was a master writer and to quote the words of T.S. Eliot: &quot;Henry James is a difficult writer for English readers because he is American, difficult for Americans because he is European, and I ignore if he is possible for other readers.&quot; Yes, Henry James can be a challenge for many readers, but the reward is all worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Beast in the Jungle and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"The story that lurks in this ornate writing from another, more embellished time will seize you with its power. And this story is not for the weak minded or those whose spirits shatter at the slightest confrontation. You, like John Marcher, will have the uncomfortable feeling that something Terrible, &amp; Permanent is going to happen to you from reading this story. And you're right, but you don't know how right. The fate is something far worse than you think. Don't find yourself in a graveyard weeping over your May. You've been warned. This story is not dead paper and ink, or electrons over the internet. It waits for You to Enter The Jungle. And it is far better for some not to enter this Jungle, and be awakened to the Beast that even now watches you and prepares to leap."},{"Title":"The Beast in the Jungle and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"In this basically two person novella, John Marcher, believes that something, not necessarily wonderful, maybe even terrible-but something-would eventually spring on him unawares, like a beast in the jungle, and ultimately determine his fate. May Bartram, his friend throughout these many years, agrees to wait with Marcher to observe his destiny._The Beast in the Jungle_, in its quiet, psychologically incisive, and intimate way, is the tragedy of a man who is too passive, too timid, too self-absorbed and self-centered to attempt even in the slightest manner to take life in his own hands to shape his future. Marcher is certain that May Bartram can provide him with all the answers to the impending great event, but he only succeeds in slowly draining the life from her. May Bartram, patient and wise, is the true hero of the piece. It is only at the end that the truth is revealed to Marcher. The jungle finally becomes empty, and poor, pitiful, ineffectual John Marcher never even witnessed it."},{"Title":"The Beast in the Jungle and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This Dover edition - titled The Beast in the Jungle and Other Stories - provides three short stories that are among the finest of their genre, although defining the genre itself is not without difficulty. Only The Jolly Corner might be classed a ghost story. These superb studies of obsession might be best described as nuanced, subtle, and intellectually haunting, and are among the best short works of Henry James.The Alter of the Dead (1895): George Stransom \\"had perhaps not more losses than most men, but he counted his losses more: he hadn't seen death more closely, but had in a manner felt it more deeply.\\"The Beast in the Jungle (1903): John Marcher had from his earliest time, deep within him, \\"the sense of being kept for something rare and strange, possibly prodigious and terrible, that was sooner or later to happen\\" and he had in his bones the foreboding and conviction that it might overwhelm him. Despite its suspense and deep sense of despair, this classic tale has been described as sluggish and overly ornate. Be that as it may, this foreboding tale is memorable.The Jolly Corner (1908): Returning after decades in Europe to his vacant, empty home in New York, Spencer Brydon would in the gathering dusk \\"wander and wait, linger and listen, feel his fine attention, never in his life so fine, on the pulse of the great vague place: he preferred the lampless hour and only wished he might have prolonged each day the deep crepuscular spell.\\"I have read this collection on three, perhaps four occasions. The works of Henry James, like that of William Faulkner, continue to improve with subsequent readings, undoubtedly the mark of great literature. For the reader unfamiliar with the writings of Henry James, this little collection would be an excellent introduction to his challenging prose. I highly recommend this Dover edition."},{"Title":"The Beast in the Jungle and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This is a brilliant examination of the darkness within.

It is one of the best books that I have read. I could not put it down. I have had some sea adventures myself but nothing like this. I have recomended it to all my marine friends but have not been able to locate it until today."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"This book is an unexpectedly riveting episode-by-episode story of the Foundation Franklin, a marine salvage tug that sailed out of the ports of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the 1930s and '40s. This working ship, built in Scotland in 1916 to craftsman's standards, eventually found itself unused in a Hamburg shipyard in depression-strapped 1930 where it was identified as a possible vessel for the Canadian maritime salvage fleet. From that day to its final heart-stopping drama, the trials of this unprepossessing high seas coal-fired tugboat are recounted in all their adrenalin-filled reality in Mowat's gripping and evocative prose. Managed by callous profit-seekers, officered by experience-hardened seamen and crewed by men desperate for employment, Foundation Franklin's story is, as well, a slice of social and commercial history. The mood is workaday danger, fortitude, struggle and courage, marred by a single passing dismissive remark about &quot;union mechanics&quot;."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"I first discovered &quot;Grey Seas Under&quot; about 15 years ago, appropriately enough as Able Seaman on an Ocean Salvage Tug. I was immediately enthralled. Out of the many books on the sea I have read, this one remains very dear to me (not that you have to be a mariner to enjoy it). Grey Seas Under is the true story of the ocean salvage tug, FOUNDATION FRANKLIN and the brave men who battled the North Atlantic to save hundreds of ships and thousands of lives. Farley Mowat, a master srory-teller, passionately desribes the exploits of FOUNDATION FRANKLIN with geat admiration and humor. Grey Seas Under is a true masterpiece saga of the sea. I've read this book probably 6 times in the last 10 years and I'm sure to re-read it for many years to come. I cannot recommend this book enough. I also highly recommend &quot;The Serpents Coil&quot; also by Farley Mowat, another first-rate tale of the sea."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"This is probably my all-time favorite book.

I suppose the Rodney Dangerfield of maritime subtopics. Even the term tug boat rings a bit derogatory. Disregarded and disrespected. But . . . .I am excited to report my discovery of this extremely well authored true story of the proud ship, Foundation Franklin. Built by the British as HMS Frisky in 1918, and between the Wars, rescued from a mothball yard in Hamburg and put into service by Foundation Maritime Company as a deep sea rescue/salvage tug out of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Renamed \\"Foundation Franklin\\", the Franklin and her men performed heroically for decades, extending through and beyond WWII, saving hundreds of ships and thousands of lives, often operating under absolutely deadly conditions.I'm impressed. I learned something about a little part of the world and the men/ships that work it which I will never forget, nor forget to appreciate. Farley Mowat wrote superbly in this work, which was at times pulse-pounding. I learned to grow fond of the Franklin, and mourn her absence maybe as if I had steamed on her myself.A rather obscure topic and title, but this is a great maritime story, lived out and told in the tradition of The Cruel Sea and The Caine Mutiny. Very much recommended."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"Another Farley Mowat adventure in northern waters. He gives you your money's worth, and more. Great writer, and a sweeping subject: rescues at sea."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"The ocean-going salvage tug, \`Foundation Franklin' was more than a match for the worst the North Atlantic could throw at her, including Force 10 hurricanes and Nazi U-Boats. Perfect Storm, eat your heart out! Here is the real book about the great-hearted men and their staunch little ships that survived blow after blow from the Atlantic and bobbed up for more.If the author, Farley Mowat is sometimes guilty of over-the-top prose---well, he lived and worked on the Franklin, and he loved her sturdy lines, her jaunty roll, and every rivet that held her together while she rescued ships that were Goliaths to her chubby, little Baby Huey. No work could have been more dangerous; none required a higher degree of seamanship and courage than dropping a line on a berserk, lunging, steel-hulled freighter, and then towing her through the maw of a mid-December gale, or the shoals and \`sunkers' of the Newfoundland coast---something the Franklin did so many times that her crew lost memory of all but their most freakish or man-killing expeditions.\\"Grey Seas Under\\" will give you an interesting perspective on the true maritime heroes of World War II. Farley Mowat doesn't pull any punches when he describes the tension that existed between the expert seamen on the ocean-going salvage and rescue tugs, and their relatively \`amateur' counterparts on Canadian and American naval warships. Some of the funniest scenes in the book involve convoys of merchant ships under the \`protection' of corvettes and destroyers. Once a U-Boat had been sighted and the merchants steamed for cover, it was up to the Franklin to rescue the ones that ran into each other or shoaled themselves. Usually, the tug had to perform her duties without any cover from the warships.\\"The days the salvors (tugboat seamen) spent tethered to fat and crippled merchantmen, crawling along on a straight course at a speed of two or three knots like mechanical targets in a shooting gallery, were the kind of days that would drain the courage from the most heroic man alive...The Germans knew, that for every rescue vessel sunk there would be a score of crippled merchantmen who would never make safe port.\\"This is a great book about men against the sea, even though the language gets very nautical at times. Read it and you will learn all about Lloyd's Open Form, and the tricks that wrecked merchant masters play to cheat tugs out of their salvage fees. You'll learn to tell the difference between \`Monkey Island' and the poop deck---and the difference between \`brass monkeys' and true seamen. You'll thrill to the dangers of sunkers, beam seas, and Arctic white-outs. You'll bite through your pipe-stem, just like the Franklin's captain did during those tows when his sturdy little tug steamed back into port with barely enough coal in her bunkers to \\"cook a pot of beans.\\"Someone ought to make a movie out of \\"Grey Seas Under.\\" It's got everything---romance (between man and ship, at least); life-and-death adventures; heroism; humor; and the treacherous ice, wind, and sea of what the author respectfully refers to as \`the Great Western Ocean.'"},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"I have read this book twice and I loved it. Mowat wrote as if the tug was a living thing. It was wonderful. I actually cried at the end when Franklin came into the harbor with barely any power left and covered entirely with ice, thus ending her life. The people who captained Franklin intriqued me as well. In the book they were the only ones that really cared for her."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"Farley Mowat can make the stars sing with the sheer beauty of his writing. His writing is a little old-fashioned by today's standards, (all the better) but his craftsmanship is unsurpassed. You ARE there. You feel everything his characters felt, you see what they saw. The book ends happily and I know it, but I cry through the last chapter every time I read it because his writing takes me there. One hedge: the book does start slow, but if you keep plugging away, you will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"This is one of the best sea stories that I have ever read. It makes &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; look like a sunday afternoon at the lake.

Read it and pass it on to someone else!"},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"I read this book several years ago, and as I read recently Sebastian Unger's book &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; I kept thinking how much more vivid were Mowat's descriptions of the perils of Atlantic Ocean ship salvage. Mowat knows the sea like a seaman (see his other books), not a blowfish journalist like Unger."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"Oh Ye of faint heart, do NOT read this gripping tale of the Foundation Franklin, a rescue/salvage tugboat that sailed the Canadian Maritime Provinces for many years. Do NOT tear the pages as you frantically flip them from one spine-tingling adventure to the next. Do NOT hesitate to wipe the freezing saltwater spray from your brow as you marvel at the courage and sheer bravado of the Captains and Seamen who risked their lives to help vessels in distress in the turbulent waters of the North Atlantic. Farley Mowat brings it to you in spades with this excellent book, I CANNOT recommend it enough! I would give it 6 stars if possible. An Uncle of mine served aboard U.S. Navy salvage ships in the early 60's, and after reading this book for the 3rd time was still in awe of the skill and seamanship displayed in these tales. If you do not beg, borrow or steal this book, shame on you...the pages of my copy are growing ragged from constant re-reading! ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you want to read a book of the sea that is gripping, heart-pounding entertainment, this book was written for you. Mowat conveys the story to the reader with true and unusual insight. I don't think anyone has ever done better. The reader will marvel at the grit and determination of these men."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under","review":"In the early 1900's, as big ships crossed the Atlantic Ocean, severe weather complicated by mechanical failure, frequently ran them aground or caused them to &quot;take on water&quot; in the unforgiving open ocean.As the gale winds began to blow, the big ships would seek safe harbor. Not so for the salvage and rescue ships running out of Nova Scotia. The more intense the storm, the more likely they would get an urgent call to leave home port and take the full bruntin order to salvage a foundering ship or rescue the survivors.The salvors make their living in the chaos of wind, sleet and an ocean streaked white with rage.Absolutely amazing feats of men against the sea and the massive forces of big ships &quot;on the rocks&quot;.The story line follows a salvage ship, the Foundation Franklin, from its own recovery, refurbishment, and baptism into the salvage business. The author breathes life into the old ship with eloquent imagery and dry wit. He explores the stalwart character of her crews, which evolve throughout the book; a collection of individual short stories revealing each fantastic rescue.Well worth reading if you like real-world adventure and appreciate the power of the sea."},{"Title":"Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition (Publications of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies)","review":"Fazlur Rahman is truly one of the greatest scholars of Islamic History, in addition to being very controversial. In this book, Fazlur Rahman explores the transformation of the Islamic intellectual tradition, ranging from philosophy and ethics, to jurisprudence. He brilliantly exposes and analizes the tension that exists in the interpretation(s) of the Qur'an. Rahman ambitiously demonstrates that for Islam and the Qur'an to be what Muslims actually claim them to be, comprehensive in scope and pertinent for every age and society, then Muslims must re-evaluate the Qur'an in positive ways, and in light of modernity and its challenges. In a similar vein, Rahman argues that for Islam to truly demonstrate its principles of social equality and justice, Islamic scholars must re-examine their methodology and hermeneutics. Amongst several other things, Rahman critiques the repetitive rhetoric and anti-philosophical trends that the Islamic intellectual communities faced during Islamic Medieval times.This work is a significant contribution to understanding the Muslim world today. It is a genuine search for broadening the scope of Islam by extrapolating upon its inherent egalitarian principles. It is also a beautiful re-evaluation of the Qur'an, by having studied it throught the context of its revelation. I recommend this book for Muslims as well as Non-Muslims interested in the study of Islam and Islamic Intellectual History."},{"Title":"Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition (Publications of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies)","review":"Here's a sample of the book's prose. After describing the challenge to some traditional Islamic tenets posed by Izz al-Din Ibn Abd al-Salam al-Sulami, and others, Fazlur Rahman writes \\"But orthodoxy had developed an amazing shock-absorbing capacity: all these thinkers were held in high esteem by orthodox circles as great representatives of Islam, but such statements of theirs as had radical import were invariably dismissed as 'isolated' (shadhdh) or idiosyncratic and were quietly buried. It took real rebels like Ibn Taymiya to make any perceptible dent in this stieel wall of ijma (consensus.)\\"I love it.

The previous review suffices, but I just wanted to add a note about the work's content. During my first reading, I thought that the work was overly bogged down with a discussion of education and its development throughout Pakistan, Turkey, etc. However, upon a second reading, I found this to be the most profound and impactful section of the work, as this is the locus of the true reform of Islam and its true modernization will occur. Thus, this work is partly a late scholar's dream for the future of his religion.

It was the first occasion that an orthodox scholar refused to close the gates of inquiry, and maintains that Islam mandate these gates remain open allowing in questions and solutions sensitive to particular societies; it claims that the Quran requires particularity and not immanence in realising what is a Muslim way of life and refuses to yield to the sheer weight of orthodoxy. Fazlur Rahman is brave and determined not to let the ideologues, the obedience automatons from hijacking the wonderful Message. This is despite the fact that one may critique his theory in Chapter One (also included in Kauzmann's Liberal Islam anthology); his other book 'Islam' is also an inspiring read."},{"Title":"Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition (Publications of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies)","review":"Arguably the greatest Arab-American intellect of the 20th Century, the late Fazlur Rahman's writings are essential readings for the Near East scholar, whether novice or PhD Candidate.

In essence, he breathed back into Islam the very life that the Western Orientalist saps out of it.As for the book itself, it is a critique of Islamic education, i.e., Islamic Intellectualism. For Rahman, a genuine understanding of Qur'anic weltaunschunng was misconstrued, in effect overlooked by early Muslim thinkers, whose pupils were forced consequently to pay a tremendous price: when Medeival Muslim hakmit (philosophy) attempted to apply an Islamic veneer onto its clearly Hellenized rational interpretation of theology, Islamic Orthodoxy crushed it \\"by its sheer weight.\\" Hence the historically truncated hakmit found only in Sufi and Shi'ite schools. Ironically, the orthodoxy did not have a handle on the Qur'anic weltanshunng either: as orthodox scholars developed Islamic jurisprudence and theological doctrine their atomic focus on individual suras outside of the situational context necessary for proper deduction, they too missed the point. Thereby eliminating the once rich intellectual heritage's future of organic and original thought. Tied to Islam's clash with the West and ostensible Modernity, maintaining an appologetic Islamic veneer to justify Western and Modern currents is ultimately self-defeating. Unless the on-going peripheral struggle to restore an organic, genuine understanding of the Qur'an succeeds, this situation will unfortunately continue to increase in the post-colonial world.

It seemed like it focused more on selling cockatiels as a fun family pet or giving the author an outlet to proclaim her love for cockatiels than actually giving usable advice on how to care for and train them. Another reviewer actually stated it perfectly: \\"Diane Grindol is, no doubt, a very nice person. However, I hear a lot of Diane and not so much useful, objective, and in depth advice about how to take care of cockatiels.\\"The book also felt cheap to me, from the low-quality materials, to the amateur typesetting, to the obviously poor editing job it received (if it was edited at all). You could possibly overlook those tragic pitfalls of the book if the information was impressive enough to outshine them. But I found the numerous, glaring typos and ridiculously bad typesetting so distracting that I actually wound up buying a different book.

I ordered this book only a few days ago and it is here already, I got it used and it looks like it is new.Now the book itself: This is a very thought out book, I have chickens now, and I have had Finches for many years, and as I grew up I had Budgies and Canaries. All of those are very different. My chickens molt but I was not aware that Cockatiels do also. I am sure that if my Charlie started to lose his feathers nexrt month, I would have thought he was sick, this book explains that the molt at about 6 months and at that time it might be possible to tell the sex as soon as the feathers start to come back. This information alone is worth the price of this book, it goes on and tells all the illnesses that befalls Cockatiels.A very important subject that is fully covered in this book are food choices, the foods that will encourage good health and ones that will not, it also tells you which ones might cause death to your bird. Now that I just acquired my first Cockatiel and am a bit nervous owning my first small Parrot I really needed some help. I never pass up a chance to learn something new amd if it means helping the animal in question ik5tis worth it.. Just thumbing through this book and stopping to learn a few key points I learned more in a half hour with this book then I would if I were to search the internet for weeks.I have been searching the internet for advise and suggestions to make my Charlie happy and healthy. I now have an enormous amount of usable information in one small book that I can keep at my fingertips as apposed to searching web sites. I like this book and am very excited to be able to learn all I can about my precious pet that will be with me, hopefully, for many years to come...

I really relied on Amazon reviews to help me choose the 2 books we used (the other we chose was from the Animal Planet series - was lucky enough to find it in a near-by pet store after identifying it on Amazon). We ordered this book with express shipping on a Thursday night - I think it came on Saturday. I read it quickly and marked the \\"scientific\\" parts for my 11 year old to read himself (as opposed to information that was more \\"pet\\" related). He's a pretty competent 5th grade reader, but not a super reader, but he did fine reading sections on his own. We then read the pet parts together. Between the two books we were surprised to learn as much as we did - we had thought we were pretty well-versed in cockatiel info. I would have liked a little more in-depth info in this book, but for a \\"Dummies\\" book it was pretty good and would make a good starting source for someone thinking of getting a cockatiel or who has recently acquired one. As a bird owner I would encourage research before purchasing a pet. Birds - especially parrot-type birds - can be a surprisingly big (and fun) commitment.

I never made it to the \\"cat room\\". I wandered into a \\"miscellaneous pets\\" area just off the entrance, and found cages of bunnies and ferrets and other creatures including a pair of bonded cockatiels. When I was a child, my grandmother raised love birds, and I had always wanted my own bird, but the presence of cats made that difficult. Currently catless, I decided to take the birds home. After I purchased two cages, and a few other things at the shelter, I made a trip to the local bird store for seed, pellets, cuttlefish bone, toys, and other assorted necessities the shelter folks recommended. When I told the proprietor of the bird store I was a new owner, she recommended COCKATIELS FOR DUMMIES.Over the past few weeks, I've been seeking all the information I can find about cockatiels. Although my daughter and daughter-in-law have pet birds (love birds, parakeets, and a dove) none of us knows much about cockatiels. Diane Grindol's approach to happy and healthy cockatiels includes advice about preventative health care maintenance, but she also provides plenty of suggestions for ways to bond with your bird. She gets down to the nitty gritty with: what to feed your bird and why; how to maintain his or her cage; why wing clipping, toenail trimming, and other grooming matters; what it means when a bird molts; how to distinguish between nutritious and poisonous plants; how to avoid bird hazards like scented candles, the toilet bowl and Teflon-lined pans; what to do if your boy bird masturbates on his food cup; and how to avoid reproduction without stressing the female, but the best tips involve how to have a good relationship with your birds.Grindol's book is perfect for a novice like me who knows plenty about wild birds but precious little about caged birds (actually two cages since the male was a bit hen-pecked so he spends part of the daylight hours in a separate establishment). So far, I am doing really well with my feathered friends who have a place of honor next to my PC (but far enough away they won't be radiated). If you're thinking about getting a bird, I suggest you read the DUMMIES book first. Birds require much more time than a cat, but for me it's worth it."},{"Title":"Cockatiels For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I ordered this book from another website the minute I found ot it was available, and it is one of the most helpful resources I have found.

It also offers varied and less confusing advice than the other books on diet and basic care, and some very good taming and training tips.

There's excellent advice about choosing, housing, feeding, training and caring for one or more of this wonderful species of bird, and solid advice about handling emergencies, choosing a vet, etc.And as other reviewers have mentioned, this book's insight into cockatiel psychology and development is exceptional, and it really helps to understand why a bird might be behaving in a certain way, and what this behavior might communicate.Previous to acquiring a cockatiel, I owned a halfmoon conure for a number of years, and although I'm an experienced bird owner, I learned a lot from this book.

The writing is amateurish, the plotting hilarious and the lead character is an early example - in a LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG line - of bad homosexual fantasy figures: the masculine, muscular, beautiful, unpretentious and helplessly desirable hetereosexual man who succumbs to his true desires for men. Ridiculous and full of gay self-loathing - these characters serve no purpose except to make gay men dream about the impossible and feel badly about themselves.It's not a new novel so I guess I can't say it follows a trend but it sure is a trend setter.I know it's just an \\"entertainment\\" but it's a silly one at that. The murder, mayhem, sex and glamour are depicted in such a silly manner - it's difficult to take anything seriously. It may have worked in the 70s for a reader COMPLETELY unfamiliar with a certain gay lifestyle but no longer.If you want thrills, prepare to be bored and if you are the least bit tired of all the cliched depictions of the gay \\"ideal\\" - prepare to be annoyed.I could go on but I've gotta call the friend who advised me to read this and ask him what the hell he was thinking.I could not recommend The Lure any less."},{"Title":"Lure, The","review":"Wow. I just finished reading this book, which I purchased on the basis of all the positive reviews. I can honestly say that I WANTED to like this book.I WAS drawn into the book early on. For the first 200 pages or so I was very excited to read what would happen next. (this in spite of how a straight main character is written to view gay life: things like 'the gays' filled the streets, etc...phraseology from a gay author who was trying way too hard and wound up sounding silly and dated)The last 170 pages or so are outrageous. I don't mean in a good way. The book goes from plausibly suspenseful to being so off the deep end that it actually made me angry.I honestly don't know how Stephen King can declare that this book is an authentic look at gay life in the 70s. Last I heard, Stephen King isn't gay. And how can ANYONE say that it is well researched in general, when the subject matter and plot twists take such ludicrous turns...I really can't recommend this book at all...and I can't understand how anyone else grounded in reality or with any appreciation of thrillers or suspense fiction or gay lit...or ANYTHING...could enjoy this book.Still want to read it? I have a copy I'll sell for CHEAP!"},{"Title":"Lure, The","review":"I read this book in 1980 when it was featured as the Monthly Selection of the Literary Guild book club. I have since re-read the book 2 times. The setting is definitely dated. However, I believe it is a very important work because of the fact that two different book clubs featured the novel as \\"Selection of the Month\\". In 1979-1980 a book that featured the gay community, no matter what point-of-reference was unheard of. For readers that never experienced that era, the subject may seem ridiculous. However, this novel did much for the isolated in rural areas of the country that read a \\"mainstream\\" novel on a subject such as The Lure's. This novel's importance goes far beyond the subject, setting and characters included in its pages."},{"Title":"Lure, The","review":"Thrilling, funny, sexy and imaginative. I've re-read this one numerous times; it holds a permanent place in my library. A great story representative of its era. Sadly so much of Picano's other work is full of pretense. This is, I think, his only book where all of his characters are just that - and likable as well. A fun ride!"},{"Title":"Lure, The","review":"Felice Picano has written an involving and intriguing tale here, and it is very well-done!

It didn't take me much time to finish it as it's usually the case. This book is still good after all those years.Noel Cummings finds himself helplessly sucked into a very different life. Through it all, the reader can't help but to feel with Noel, forced by the police to be tbe bait -Lure- to capture Mr. X, the killer. To do so, he tries to find his way in New York's gay life, all along, trying to fit in.Fascinating to the last page.I remember that I liked \\"Like People in History\\" by Felice Picano before, and I didn't imagine that I'd read or like any other book by Mr. Picano.

I think this one is even better."},{"Title":"Lure, The","review":"Take the mystery skills of Stephen King and Dean R Koontz, add the Character Sketches of Armistead Maupin of 'Tales of the City' and you have Felice Picano's 'The Lure'.Its truely brilliant writing, for start to finish.

It's three years since I've first read this book and I still consider it's the best or one of the best books I've EVER read. It's a great thriller and beautiful romance, it's funny and sad, and it's simply impossible to forget it once you've finished reading. It'll stay with you till tthe end of your life, every word of it. I can't think of a comparison that would be good enough to give you an idea what the book is like.

It is set at a time in New York that was loved, feared, and now, perhaps missed. You won't soon forget Noel or the most interesting cast of originals he meets and loves. Believe me, you'll be reading it under your desk at work, like I was, because you'll be compelled to read on to the end once you start. Felice Picano continues his masterful fiction in more recent works: including Like People in History -- also a wonderful book"},{"Title":"Lure, The","review":"There's nothing wrong with this book. Nothing at all. Everything Picano put into print in this fine piece of fiction is absolutely mesmerizing. It is impossible to stop reading it. It will grip you tightly and take you away to the fantastic world where Picano weaves a web of crime, corruption, love, sex, hatred, and kink.If you read this book, you will never forget it. I think it is the finest example of mystery fiction in the last half of the twentieth century.Heterosexual Noel Cummings stumbles across a murder in action. He tries to prevent it, but fails. Subsequently, he is drafted into service as an undercover operative searching for the killer in gay New York. When he enters the world, he can see right and wrong as plainly as black and white, but over time, he begins to question reality as he knows it. The murderer keeps on killing and Noel is always just one step away from him.Picano is one of the best writers of this or any generation and The Lure is quite possibly the finest book he's ever written. When originally published, The Lure was on the Book of the Month club list and was an instant best seller. Time has not taken its toll on this book even though the action takes place some twenty years ago.Set aside a few hours to be swept away to a dark and scary world where you don't know who your real friends are. You'll not regret it."},{"Title":"Lure, The","review":"It is the sort of book some of us don't normally read: a crime/detective novel. It's not a world many of us know much about: rich crooks, violence, drugs, bent policemen, where you cannot trust anybody because nobody is what they seem to be.One of our members thought that it was a typical detective story in that nothing important happens between the finding of a corpse and the d&eacute;nouement, the discovery of \`whodunit' at the end. Everything in between is \`a plot disaster'. Another, however, thought it was a clever use of the detective genre to introduce the gay underworld at a time when most people hardly knew that it existed and to chart a voyage of self-knowledge which passes through choppy waters. (Though that would have been better portrayed had the book been written in the first person) It doesn't seem to take itself too seriously but then, suddenly, it does. Is the cook who is into martial arts meant to reflect the author's sense of humour?\`A touching period piece,' said one member of our group, \`A lot better than some of the junk/trash we sometimes read.'\`Not hard work,' said another, \`a ripping read. Lots of tension'As one of our members said, \\"Despite being put off by the personality of the author as revealed in the Preface, I was surprised that I loved the book and perhaps for the following reasons:1. Its pace seemed to match that of the time...i.e. speed and cocaine fuelled2. The posh sluttiness of it all and how superficial it was (J G Ballard would have liked the empty decadence)3. Heroic attempts to describe certain aspects of gay culture from sex to clubbing; especially the clubbing, it struck a 'real' note in terms of how I imagined Studio 54 culture might be - and what a country cousin British gay clubbing probably was in comparison...4. gay businesses was interesting and could have been better explainedHowever, 5. The psychological stuff towards the end was daft...6. having to suspend disbelief that he didn't check out it was the police from the go get.\\"There are some vivid descriptions: of an acid tip, of the vibrant music in a night club where you can feel the pulse coming from the speakers in your arteries. Straight sex is described better than gay sexSome bits are unconvincing: that straight academic can transform himself within eight hours and pass as gay without anyone suspecting that he is a plant, a spy.There are some less than felicitous descriptions, e.g. \`'Her hair like a thick curtain of night sky.' And a loose end: What happened to the motorbike?Something I had to look up: an 86 - to refuse to serve an unwelcome customer, coined after Chumley's bar and restaurant at 86 Bedford Street in Greenwich Village, New York City and not to be confused with an eighty-eight which involves doping something odd with a two-headed dildo."},{"Title":"Lure, The","review":"I read this before in the late 80\`s it was great then and is even better the second time around. I only wish the ending was a little different. Picano\`s best by far....it makes you not stop reading."},{"Title":"Happy End: A Melodrama With Songs (French's Musical Library)","review":"Overshadowed by the two masterpieces that sandwiched it ('The Threepenny Opera' and 'The Rise and Fall of Mahogony'), Brecht-Weill's 'Happy End' is generally dismissed by Brecht scholars as 'inadequate' (following the repudiation by the playwright himself), rushed as a profit-seeking sequel to the spectacularly popular 'Threepenny' Its premiere was a bourgeois-baiting farrago, and the show humiliatingly closed after two days. its importance today lies as a source for some of the greatest songs written in the 20th century, including 'The Bilbao Song', Surabaya Johnny' and 'The song of Mandalay'.'Happy End' was cobbled together from a variety of sources (Shaw, Sheldon, crime serials etc.), but officially credited, for copyright reasons, to an non-existent short story by the non-existent Dorothy Lane. It finds Brecht in blithely playful mode, with a suprememly silly story, set in a mythical Chicago of 1919, about a gangster falling for a Salvation Army preacher, framed against an even more improbable backdrop of failed robberies carried out by Runyonesque goons (although they predate the American by nearly a decade), led by a sinister Japanese doctor, The Governor (in a part written for Peter Lorre), and a mysterious lady of disguises, The Fly.the play is a festive mixture of menace, satire and farce, with the gangster plot spilling into the Sally Army one, and vice versa, each making the other ridiculous. The play makes brilliantly inventive use of slides, film, snickeringly ironic intertitles and a multi-level stage defining the two realms - the play's funniest scene has The Governor breaking into an SA meeting to murder an errant hood, before leading the faithful in song, conducting with his Browning. An absurd conclusion full of daft coincidences, and a two-fingers at capitalists, and you have wonderful entertainment Brechtians shouldn't be so sniffy about (especially if you have Weill's glorious score beside you - jaunty, melancholy, parodic, exotic, disturbing: surely his best?).This translation by Michael Feingold is a 'loose' adaptation which played on Broadway (with Meryl Streep and Christopher Lloyd) and the West End (Bob Hoskins) in the 1970s. Whatever of Brecht is missing, his cherishably flat, cynically comic tone is beautifully captured."},{"Title":"Happy End: A Melodrama With Songs (French's Musical Library)","review":"When you hear the names Weill and Brecht together, it is easy to assume 'music'! This product, called \\"Happy End-a Melodrama with Songs\\" has none of the songs in it. It is only the script. The lyrics are there, since they are part of the dialogue, but the music is not. If you are looking for the music to Happy End, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Poison Frogs - Jewels of the Rainforest","review":"Wonderful book with beautiful picture.Even if you don't have anything with frogs I think you will have something with frogs after looking through this book."},{"Title":"Poison Frogs - Jewels of the Rainforest","review":"Lots of great, full page photos!

If you have any interest in poison dart frogs, you'll love this book. The photography in this book alone justifies its purchase price. However, this is not merely a picture book. The extensive text includes information about the species, including their habitat range, biology and behavior. Although a short section on keeping the frogs in captivity is included, the hobbyist looking for information about captive care will be disappointed. Even the author readily admits that captive care of poison frogs is not his interest. There are several better books about captive care (including, paradoxically, a very nice one by this same author). However, the hobbyist looking to better understand the nature of his or her pet in the wild or anyone with an interest in frogs should enjoy this book"},{"Title":"Poison Frogs - Jewels of the Rainforest","review":"This book is a MUST for those interested in dart frogs.

The pictures in the book are high quality, glossy and the animals he photographed are representative of the species. Every one I know who breeds Poison Dart Frogs has one (at least one) of his books - many of them have broken bindings from so much use.My fault with the book is with the accuracy of the information within the book. If you are interested in getting into dart frogs and learning how to breed them then get another book! Save your money and buy some of the less expensive books and scan the Internet for breeders and information. You will learn a lot more through this process than through the book.

It contains many amazing photos of the various Poison Frog species, along with descriptions and valuable info. I just love this book!

It was written too long ago to be of any serious use to folks keeping Dendrobatids. Care information is paltry and the taxonomy is (now) inaccurate. Some photos are misidentified (The \\"*Epipedobates femoralis*\\" on pg. 230 is *Lithodytes lineatus*- not even a Dendrobatid!) My largest concern is that it has no information or insight into the rampant smuggling/habitat destruction that is currently a major concern of Poison frog keepers. Some of the frogs photographed (including one on the cover!) are injured or sick. There are photographs that amount to advertisements printed in the book.This said, the photos are very nice, and there are an abundance of photos of species not commonly available in the hobby. The large format makes it ideal to showcase just how beautiful the frogs are."},{"Title":"Poison Frogs - Jewels of the Rainforest","review":"Awesome book!

Many of the pieces are lavishly appliqu&eacute;d and embroidered, and included in the pattern guides are appliqu&eacute; instructions as well as some sashiko stitching patterns.The text is somewhat dry and pompous, but ignoring that, there really is a good selection of widely varying quilts displayed and ought to excite much interest. It certainly is good to see a large number of quilts on one theme from different artists, there is no opportunity for the designs to be stagnant and self replicating. ..I would also recommend Kumiko Sudo's excellent patchwork & quilting books to anyone interested in the Oriental styles.kotori 2005"},{"Title":"The Changing Seasons: Quilt Patterns from Japan (Dutton Studio Book)","review":"If you love quilts you must see this book.

I also showed this book to my boss, who thinks it a wonderful book, also."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Correctional Psychologists: Guidance for the Prison Practitioner","review":"Correctional psychology is one area where clinical psychology and criminal justice converge. Yet, what actually happens to criminal defendants who are sentenced to prison? Who is concerned with their mental health? Why should we even care?In this volume, psychologist Kevin Correia provides an insider's look into the practice of correctional psychology. The book provides an overview of prison life, which is generally both less volatile and more complex than the garish portrayals shown in movies and on TV. The book helps clarify the often dicey institutional status of a mental health practitioner working in an institutional setting where the primary concern of most other staff is just to keep the lid on. Roles of the correctional psychologist include management consultant (and here, psychologists can score points with skeptical prison staff by providing practical tips on dealing safely with inmates); suicide, violence, and sexual assault prevention; hostage negotiation; family and employee crisis intervention; and psychotherapy, which is likely to be concrete and focused, e.g. substance abuse counseling or sex offender treatment.The book dives into the nitty-gritty nuances of conducting psychological interventions with prison inmates, including issues of privacy in the fishbowl environment of a correctional facility; developing a healthy skepticism and professional distance to guard against inmate manipulativeness; handling deception and malingering; coping with threats and intimidation; and dealing with severely mentally ill and coldly psychopathic inmates, all the while endeavoring to develop some kind of working therapeutic relationship; The author also provides guidelines for integrating psychological services with the activities of other staff members, so as to forge a collaborative, rather than adversarial, relationship with the people he or she has to work with every day.Aside from a somewhat overly detailed two-chapter digression on the clinical and psychometric assessment of malingering, this book is crisply written and is suffused with a sense of enthusiasm and optimism that has the reader questioning the standard view of prison psychology as either the wasteful coddling of unrepentent career criminals, or as some baleful professional purgatory that a psychologist might find him- or herself consigned to until a \\"real\\" job comes along. Relentlessly realistic, this book nevertheless delineates the important clinical contributions that correctional psychologists can make in a world that most dismiss as hopeless.- Laurence Miller, PhD, International Journal of Emergency Mental Health"},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk","review":"Where Angels Walk is an unforgettable book of God's love, help and intervention in our lives through the love of His Angels. All the stories are true and unbelievably remarkable. God has told us, &quot;Ask and ye shall receive&quot;, and that includes the asking for help for our loved ones and for ourselves.This is a book that will renew your faith and reaffirm God's love for us. It is at the darkest times of our lives, when we feel alone and abandoned, that we are loved the most. Help is there and we just have to ask for it. As Joan Anderson says, &quot;...that, whatever their failings, God is holding them gently in the palm of His hand.&quot;Reading the numerous stories, you will discover that angels can take many forms and not just the heavenly beings we were taught about as children.Read this book to renew your spirit, increase your faith and to uplift your life. You will NOT be disappointed. This book is a gem. And remember that you are loved and that miracles do indeed happen!"},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk","review":"What a beautiful tribute to the Angels in our lives!

Thanks to Joan Wester Anderson for sharing her gift of writing and speaking."},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk","review":"I sent it to an inmate I correspond with in prison whom I have been evangelizing to and he couldn't thank me enough. He said he couldn't put the book down and that it confirmed his desire for proof that God does bend down to earth often or sends his messangers. He was so impressed with the book he lent it to his cell-mate and he is evangelizing himself. I couldn't be more pleased. Our God is an awesome God who gives proof and help and guidance.

I am someone who has had his interventions many times during times. God in heaven has forewarned me and even sent me an angel that disappered after saving me from drowning. Disappearing after they help is a sign of a heavenly visitor. Funny how the lifeguard ignored me at 7yrs old but God didn't after I prayered to him in the water. I haven't ever forgotten it.

Some of her stories originate from personal experiences, others from those who shared their experiences, only to portray the presence of something, someone special coming into their lives and bringing about a sense of peace.In one of her stories, on a snowy winter day, the rescue of her son comes to light through a mysterious event, and a stranger who brings her son through a nearly catastrophic event. Not that anyone actually saw a winged angelic spirit; it was more of realizing the presence of someone who suddenly came into his life and helped him through a situation.Reading these short stories may touch your heart enough to have you recall an event which seemed hopeless.......until a special happening brought someone close enough for you to feel God's presence in the form of a messenger who bears an angelic character.If you've ever come through a car accident safely, despite damage to the car, or if you've stepped away from something that looked dangerous, perhaps, you, too, were walking with an angel. Maybe, even if you look deeper, someone was in need of help, and you were the angel in their life. Don't be too surprised if you've had several such experiences.Today, these stories are syndicated and featured in several publications. The message is this: You are not alone, and the angels are walking with you!"},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk","review":"It was so neat to be reminded of our angels being ever present.

We just have to realize and be open to them."},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk","review":"The book has a lot of uplifting and inspiring stories about angels. When reading it I was inspired to research the concept of guardian angels further. A lot of the stories are very convincing, others seem more coincedental and not necessarily the work of angels. But above all there was one aspect I did not like about the book. I was under the impression that this was going to be a more open minded book to different religions and ideas. But throughout the book the author went back to Christianity and especially Catholicism. If that is what people believe then that is great, but I was expecting to see more stories that were not necessarily religious in nature, or at least are not only Christian. Angels are supposed to work miracles in everyone's lives, not just Christians'. I believe the author, being raised a Christian and still being a Christian, chose to only use stories that were Christian in nature. I found that very disappointing and was looking forward to hearing a more open minded look at the angels."},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk","review":"I received this book from a friend, then picked it up to read a few years later, after I'd done Scriptural research on angels for a project. I enjoyed the book. It was certainly an easy read, because of the format of many short stories. And I appreciated the whole approach on which it was based -- asking people everywhere for their own true stories of encounters with angels. What we read about angels in the Bible tells us how they quickly move in and out of people's lives, often to carry a message or to help in time of need (Peter's prison scene, one of my favorites!). The accounts in this book seem to jibe with those Biblical accounts. But more than that, angels show how God takes care of us, and that's the message I get from this book."},{"Title":"Where Angels Walk","review":"As the past proprietress of an Angel Store, we sold this book by the truck load.

Adorned in black and white, Tice depicts wonderful images of America, with a few images of Yorkshire and Esonia as well. Time seems to stand still in the photos, and one can just gaze and ponder and get lost. Another aspect of his work, which really appeals to me, was that I wanted to reach out and touch almost all of the photos. The texture contained in most of the photos, is just incredible.The majority of the photos were shot in his native state of New Jersey, and one can get a feel for the complexity of the images presented, from the bounty of nature to the scenes of industrialism. Tice seems to capture the essence of the people he photographs, as well as showing us the beauty in nature and all around us.A wonderful collection of glimpses of different parts of America from 1953 to 1999.

Benedict XVI","review":"Bunson's book went to press in early May during the first weeks of Benedict's new pontificate and serves the general reader as a \\"Benedict Primer\\". There is information on the last days of Pope John Paul II, the unforgettable funeral Mass, the conclave, and the many accomplishments of the priest/theologian/cardinal who became Benedict XVI. Bunson also includes an eighty-year timeline that shows the intersection of various cultural milestones with events in Benedict's life.Included are lengthy excerpts from key speeches and homilies and coverage of the high points of then-Cardinal Ratzinger's tenure as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the arm of the Church responsible for protecting truths that come to us ultimately from Christ and the Apostles.Kudos to Mr. Bunson; having such a well-written book on our new Pope available so soon is a major feat. It likely will serve as a reference for future writers wanting a description of the historic events that surrounded Easter 2005."},{"Title":"We Have a Pope! Benedict XVI","review":"Great primer on who the new pope really is...plus an excellent overview of what has transpired in the last month at the Vatican.The book begins with an overview of what led up to the election of Benedict, his first addresses and an overview of his life. I found the issues facing the papacy both in the section entitled \\"The Vacant See\\" and at the end of the book where the author Matt Bunson details how the Pope is likely to handle these issues fascinating.The book also includes a list of popes dating back to St. Peter, as well as a very helpful glossary."},{"Title":"We Have a Pope! Benedict XVI","review":"Dr. Bunson does a magnificent job of covering the transition from Pope John Paul to Pope Benedict. He gives a thorough treatment of the issues the cardinals had to wrestle with going in to the conclave and gives insight into the process. In the last part of the book he provides a brief but thorough biography of the pope and great insight into how the pope's background and convictions may shape his papacy.Some nice features include: the full text of his first two homilies as pope; two appendixes that cover the entire bibliography of works in English by the pope as well as a list of all popes; a glossary of terms; great color photos of the pope.I am amazed that such a thorough treatment of the transition and issues came out in such a short period of time. Even though I followed the events closely, this volume is fresh and provided new insights. This book was not thrown together -- it is clearly the work of someone who reflected deeply on the transition and has a thorough knowledge of the Vatican and the man who is pope. I have read several of Benedict's own works, but wish I would have read this first. It really helps to put the other writings in context. Thank you Dr. Bunson!"},{"Title":"We Have a Pope! Benedict XVI","review":"For those of us glued to our television sets during this Spring's events during the passing of Pope John Paul II and the election of our new Holy Father, Benedict XVI, this book brings back many touching memories of a special time in our Church's history.Matthew Bunson, Catholic author and historian, has given us a timely (but not rushed) account of this transitional time. Highlights of the book include a chronology of Benedict XVI's place in the Church history timeline, a first-person retelling of the funeral, conclave and election process and events, lovely and high quality color photos, and a look ahead at the Church our new Pope will lead into the future. Also included are a comprehensive list of the Pope's prior publications, a complete list of popes, and a helpful glossary.Bunson's book is well written, highly detailed but also very readable. A book to enjoy today and to share with our children in the future when we recount our memories of this special time."},{"Title":"We Have a Pope! Benedict XVI","review":"Bunson has written an orthodox and thus reliable guide to the great events of April 2005. He also provides analysis of the challenges facing the Church and the likely course of the new papacy, with appropriate humility. In contrast to the wildly inaccuarate prognostications of the secular media and liberal Catholics, Bunson is able to put his finger on what was really going on in the conclave: a move to challenge the relativism that threatens the truth. The best part of the book is Bunson's detailed biographical information on our new Pope. The book even includes a list of books by former Cardinal Ratzinger that are available in English. Read Bunson's book first and then begin the intellectual and faith adventure of reading the treasures that have come from the pen of our new Pope."},{"Title":"We Have a Pope! Benedict XVI","review":"It's only been a short while since Cardinal Ratizinger became pope and when I bought it I expected it to be a quickie slapdash collection of articles. It's much better than that. Matthew Bunson touches on the days before JPII died and the outpouring of grief and love that occurred after his death. He gives a straightforward peek into the conclave proccess and finally introduces the reader to Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict 16.You will find a quick run down of Joseph Ratzinger's life and get an idea of just how much John Paul the II respected and relied on Benedict 16. If you didn't know who Cardinal Ratzinger was before or if you got your image of him from the knee jerk reactions of the media We Have a Pope is a very good place for the average soul in the back pews to start getting an idea of who the new Holy Father is."},{"Title":"We Have a Pope! Benedict XVI","review":"This book is great, but once again, the author and publisher have erroneous info that was published. In this book, St Maximilian Kolbe is listed as a martyr in Dachau...ahhhh! He was martyred in Aushwitz, which is listed in just about every bit of published info about him. In another book, he has St Gianna Beretta Molla as being born in South America. The dear doctor and mother never left Europe. She was born and raised in Italy! This is another common and well-know fact about this saint. Please check those facts before they get to print!!"},{"Title":"We Have a Pope! Benedict XVI","review":"I enjoyed reading this book! Dr. Matthew Bunson does an excellent job of describing the events surrounding the transition from Pope John Paul II to Pope Benedict XVI. He covers the events surrounding, and immediately following, the death of John Paul II on April 2, 2005. Then he covers the funeral of John Paul II, which seems to have had the largest funeral attendance in human history. Then he covers the period leading up to and including the conclave. He discusses the issues that the conclave was dealing with, leading up to the white smoke and bells announcing the election of Pope Benedict XVI on April 19, 2005. He also covers the events immediately following the election of Benedict XVI, up to the Installation Mass on the following Sunday. In the final section he includes a chapter discussing the life of (now) Benedict XVI, his life before he became cardinal, including his studying for the priesthood, and his role in the Second Vatican Council. Another chapter discusses his life as Cardinal Ratzinger, and the final chapter discusses the tasks which lay ahead of the new pope. So this book is a great introduction the new pope, and a great account of his election and the events preceding it. In addition, it includes pictures of the new pope, and also includes his homilies at the Funeral Mass, as well as at the Installation Mass. At the beginning the book also includes a chronology of his life (and world events surrounding it). At the end it includes a list of books written by the new pope, as well as a listing of all the popes of the Catholic Church, as well as a glossary. In short this book is an excellent resource for those wanting to learn about Pope Benedict XVI, and helpful for those wanting general information on popes or papal elections."},{"Title":"100 Years of Cowboy Stories (Roundup Books)","review":"My dad loved this so much for father's day that he's forcing me to read it.

Happy Trails"},{"Title":"The Lusitania: Unravelling the Mysteries","review":"My efforts to acquire this book were quite considerable but very much worth it. The debate about the sinking of the Lusitania is one which still has much life in it. Mr O'Sullivan has engaged in a extensive research both archival and forensic to try shed light on what happened that May afternoon in 1915. His results are a direct challenge to the coal dust theory of Dr Ballard's 1993 explorations. Mr O'Sullivan also lays out his research into the functioning of British Admiralty in general and the function of Room 40 in particular. His conclusions don't let the admiralty off the hook of responsibility but then it doesn't find them guilty of deliberate planning to set the ship up either. I will not say any more but recommend you buy the book and read it.What I can comment on is the copious quantity of illustrative material. English artist Stuart Williamson has contributed four first class paintings that are worthy of Ken Marscall himself. Mr Marschall's work is also featured as well as rare paintings, photographs(including a hitherto unseen side profile of U 20) and rare colour newspaper cartoons that comment on the sinking. Overall an excellent book. The only criticism that I can level at the book, with great reluctance, concerns the reproduction of Mr Marschall's work. The images lack the sharpness of the originals as seen in ART of TITANIC. However this does not stop me giving the book the highest possible rating and recommending its purchase by anyone with an interest in this field. The best 24 pounds I have ever spent!"},{"Title":"The Lusitania: Unravelling the Mysteries","review":"The Lusitania was the ship that was simply loved by a Nation. State-of-the-art when launched and the very first passenger liner to be equipped with steam turbines, she became the fastest Liner on the North Atlantic passenger routes. She was popular with passengers and a resounding commercial success. This was a ship that had everything.Suddenly, all that came to an end on 7 May 1915 when she was torpedoed and sunk. The reaction - both at home and abroad was simply incredible. Although the loss of the Titanic - just 3 years earlier, was still very fresh in peoples minds, this was different. That had been an accident and those bodies had been buried in far-away Canada. This time they were buried in Ireland and the photographs of the day said it all. This was viewed as one of the most diabolical and savage acts of all time - and even helped bring America into the War.The Lusitania - Unravelling the Mysteries is hardback measuring 12 in x 8 in and contains over 130 pages of solid information, facts, maps, paintings, photographs and even cartoons - all reproduced from the time in question. The Author commences with his own background and reveals how he is well-qualified to write a book such as this. In a skilfully planned book, he provides all the relevant information and paints an excellent scene with his various descriptions of the Lusitania and other, similar ships - with their Peacetime and Wartime roles. He then moves on to the German submarine menace, British Intelligence and the code-breaking of the day as he carefully and deliberately provides a fully detailed prelude to the sinking with details of other submarine incidents off Ireland - that were never relayed to the Lusitania.Then we have the tragedy itself and, of course, the aftermath. There are distressing photographs of dead children and heartbreaking stories of those who survived - having lost all other members of their family. There is the grief that overwhelmed Ireland and photographs of both the Memorial in Cobh and one or two of the more dramatic headstones - \\"Foully Murdered by Germany\\" and \\"Victim of the Lusitania Crime.\\" The Sham tribunals and the way in which blame was wrongly laid at the feet of the ship's master - Captain Bill Turner, in a bid to deflect public opinion away from government ineptitude are covered in great detail as is the fact that the ship was carrying munitions (as was common practise) and therefore, a justified target of War.Concluding with a chapter on \\"The Mysteries Unravel, the author brings a semblance of sense to what happened almost 100 years ago and includes two photographs taken by Scuba Divers in order to bring the story of this great ship right up to date. The book ends with the a cartoon depicting the Mother of \\"Civilisation\\" kneeling on the beach and weeping for those lost on the Lusitania.A poignant and thought-provoking account and one that is expertly crafted - this is simply a first-rate book. How sad that the wreck itself has never been designated a \\"War Grave.\\"NM"},{"Title":"The Lusitania: Unravelling the Mysteries","review":"While I think this was a good book I also think that there was a lot of information presented that had little to do with the Lusitania or the sinking. I concede that you must persent background information but the entire first half of this book dealth with the rules of the Sea at the time, The British Empire's instructions to merchant ships, Churchill's directives, etc. I think that this is great information but felt that it might have taken the space of more information that could have been presented on the ships story itself.Missing also, is the German U-Boat side. What did they think, why did they do it? There has to be information in German records on this, why were they not consulted when presenting the information in this book?I did enjoy the analystic view of the cargo and if it actually contributed to the sinking. The clues that were traced in the sipping manifests. The book also explores the theory that the sinking was actually caused by Churchill's directives to ships at sea, making them enemy combatants in a time of war.This is a decent book but I think it should be read as one of many on the subject and not taken as the sole source of information."},{"Title":"The Lusitania: Unravelling the Mysteries","review":"Maritime disaster buffs will enjoy the new theories and fresh opinions on the tale of the ill fated Lusitania.

Unlike the Victorian era following it, the Regency era was quite wicked--a time of serious partying, mistresses and lovers, and gambling into the night. This books provides a wealth of information and covers just about every aspect of the era as it pertains to the beau monde or those of the upper class or aristocracy. In detail, the book explores what a gentlemen or lady of the time would have worn, what they would have eaten, how they decorated their houses, how they were brought up, how they would marry, and most importantly, all the hedonistic pleasures they would indulge in. This book also provides a section on the most famous people of the era and a dictionary of popular slang. Great fun.

This book is EXTREMELY hard to find but an EXCELLENT resource for the Regency period. Laudermilk covers just about every aspect of life of the Regency period, including class, politics, fashion, military, and daily life. Social customs, clothing, travel, and environmental conditions are covered. Its not an extensive book, that in-depth covers all the above subjects, but excellently highlights them for readers of all stages of interest in the Regency period of England. I used it for an undergraduate research paper and have been searching for an affordable copy ever since. Unfortunately, it is out of print and those that purchased the book know they have a gem. The cheapest used price is $300! I wonder if my public library knows how tempting it is just to pay them $50 and never return the book next time I check it out."},{"Title":"The Regency Companion (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, Vol. 841)","review":"I love to read about the Regency, but most histories, while excellent for giving a sense of the time, are not specific enough and organized in such a way as to clarify the details of day-to-day life, even for the upper classes. This books is superb. It is very entertaining to read straight through, and answers those detailed questions that allow one to concretely visualize the setting.i imagine that this would be particularly invaluable for writers. I'm not one myself, but it must be frustrating to try and find the precise descriptions to create a truly vivid world. This books is quite specific. One may know that Classical, Chinese and Egyptian furniture were popular during the Regency, but this stipulates when each one was most fashionable. Most writers manuals that I have seen try to treat the Regency with the Victorian, and the information simply isn't in depth enough for a century that saw such enormous change. Each chapter includes a glossary of related terms, and there is another at the end of the book. Also included are a timeline, small biographies of important people of the era, details of famous places and buildings, and an extensive bibliography. The book is indexed, although not as thoroughly as I would like.A wonderful addition to any Regency collection - I hope that it is reprinted sometime soon for those not fortunate enough to have their own copy. The other book that I would recommend as a Regency reference work is Jennifer Kloesters' Georgette Heyer's Regency World. That is much more a guide to the era than to the author's works, and gives many of the nuts-and-bolts of daily living (chiefly for the upper classes) than can be so difficult to find. The two books have slightly different emphases, and I would recommend using both, if possible."},{"Title":"The Regency Companion (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, Vol. 841)","review":"This book is a must-have for anyone who enjoys or wants to understand the Regency period from 1811-1820. It is a reference book that not only characterizes the lifestyles of many famous people that lived back then but also covers language, fashion, the reasons for marriage and more.History students and authors of historical romances are other people who will find it interesting. Published in 1989, you will probably have the best luck finding it at your local library. If found, the copies that people are willing to sell are listed for ridiculous prices.I have read quite a few romances from this era and, honestly, I developed a bitter taste for this group of people who expected to be served everything without question. Boredom occurred so both sexes turned to self-gratification and not with the most pleasant results. Still, I found it an education and a necessary book with a wealth of knowledge.

John Reed?s &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot; reached a large audience in the United States and internationally. Many wanted to know why an entire planet could be thrust into war. In an attempt to address that issue, some decided that nationalism, governmental agendas, realpolitik, racism, class warfare, capitalism, Democracy, and corporations in bed with politicians and militarists were to blame.Nationalism was part of it. German unification and Balkan nationalism played a role. Governmental agendas and realpolitik always have played a role in conflict. Since Communism addressed the concept of &quot;one world government&quot; and a &quot;world without borders,&quot; some concluded that Communism offered the answer to these problems.Racism was never an original part of the war, but would emerge as an ugly by-product. The Turks unleashed an open can of worms resulting in &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and genocide pitting Christians against Muslims, Turks against Arabs, secular vs. religious. In Germany, an easy scapegoat began to emerge: The Jews. Lies began to spread that Jewish banking interests profited from the war. In the American South Jewish influence was an affront to their sensibilities. The Ku Klux Klan rose again after a period of dormancy. The KKK?s &quot;mandate&quot; pitted them against a &quot;worldwide Jewish conspiracy&quot; somehow in league with Papal domination. They said Catholics pledge allegiance not to the U.S., but to the Vatican. But few Catholics and fewer Jews lived in the South. Many blacks did. They were becoming a more prominent segment of society. Blacks were emerging as professional athletes in the Negro baseball leagues, and as musicians in the jazz world. As they asserted themselves, this infuriated the white underclass.But the most pernicious thing that emerged out of World War I were Westerners who believed that the war had occurred because of the failure of capitalism, Democracy, and corporations who were in bed with politicians and militarists. When Reed?s book came out, a segment of society allowed themselves to believe that the new political system in Russia should be given a chance. Communism became &quot;the answer&quot; to society?s many problems, including racism and poverty. The failure of Communism, already evident by 1920, was not exposed to the world. Reed either chose not to write about the thousands and thousands of famine victims, the secret police, the crackdowns and forced marches, the banishments, assassinations and disappearances, or he was controlled by the hierarchy, and not allowed to see it. He probably did not want to see it. He had found his story and he was going to stick to it. The great failure of the free press, of governments and political figures, of humanists and truth-seekers, was the failure to pin Russia - Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and the rest of them - down before they became too powerful. To expose them for what they were.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;..."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"To appreciate this book, you have to understand what it is and what it isn't.This is top-notch journalism, by someone with a lot of insight into what he was seeing, and a knack for turning up in all the right places. It gives you a vivid, unparalleled *flavor* of the Russian revolution of 1917, the first victorious working class revolution.But it's still *journalism*. It's not an organized chronicle of what happened, beginning at the beginning and introducing events and ideas in a logical order. On top of that, Reed arrived in Russia at the climax of the revolution, after seven months of intense activity by an overwhelming cast of characters. If you read it too casually, it's like starting a textbook by reading the last chapter.To get the most out of the book, I suggest reading Reed's introductory material carefully, probably returning to it more than once as you read the book. If you need more help, there's a good summary in the last two chapters of \\"Revolutionary Continuity: the Early Years\\" by Farrell Dobbs.Your efforts will be well-rewarded. It really is great journalism.For a definitive history, I highly recommend the widely acclaimed masterpiece, \\"History of the Russian Revolution\\" by Leon Trotsky. If you like one book, you'll like the other. I promise. Please read my review. (Click on \\"See all my reviews\\" above.)Some reviewers complained that Reed doesn't explain the revolution's shortcomings -- the Russian revolution obviously turned out badly in the long run. But not everyone agrees that the revolution was fatally flawed from the very beginning. I don't. It's hard to read Reed's book and believe it was anything but an authentic popular revolution. For what went wrong, I recommend \\"The Revolution Betrayed\\" by Leon Trotsky and \\"Lenin's Final Fight\\", a collection of Lenin's last writings."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This is a most powerfully written American radical journalist's eyewitness account of the Bolshevik seizure of power--recording the excitement of the October days and the beginnings of John Reed's own revolutionary disillusionment.Ten Days That Shook the World is the classic account of the Russian Revolution of November 1917 by a western journalist and has been admired worldwide since its first publication in 1919. Lenin endorsed it as &quot;a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events so significant to the comprehension of what really is the Proletarian Revolution.&quot;Already based in Europe and sympathetic to the cause of the Russian Revolution, Reed was able to observe dispassionately exactly what was going on and to find out not only what the Bolshevik leaders were doing, but to move among those on the streets and note experiences of the masses of ordinary people. Witnessing first-hand the day-to-day events of the Revolution, he captures in vivid and graphic detail the atmosphere of that time.An extraordinary document of history in the making, this newer edition is the first with contemporary photographs, while a new introduction by Harold Shukman, University Lecturer in Modern Russian History at Oxford University, sets the work in context. Published to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, this illustrated edition will appeal to anyone interested in modern history. And quite possibly re-ignite a political polemic.Warren Beatty dared to make the film Reds, which gives us a poignantly epic visual view of John Reed, his life, his loves and his fierce beliefs as read in Ten Days That Shook The World."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"\\"Ten Days That Shook The World\\" is the account by John Reed of what he saw during the Russian Revolution. Reed was an American Communist and journalist who is the only American known to be buried in the Kremlin. Throughout this book we read a series of observations and dialogues reported by Reed, virtually without comment, although his bias is apparent. We read his reports of political meetings, encounters with minor officials and his observations of events occurring during those turbulent revolutionary days in Petrograd.This book is a classic case of missing the forest for the trees. The view is too up close to permit the reader to see the big picture. One does not look here for the history of the Revolution. We look here for its spirit. Here we see the swirling chaos, hear the repeated buzz words and get a feeling for the competing factions which fashioned the Communist tyranny which emerged from the Revolution.In writing this book, Reed gives the reader a view of himself and other American Communists who saw in the Revolution the future that worked. His view can best be summarized in his comment that, while watching a funeral, he realized that the Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven because they were building a world brighter than any which heaven promised. This hope is in stark contrast to the now known Communist record.Overall I enjoyed this book as it taught me some more about the Russian Revolution than I had learned from other books which I had read. (See my Amazon review of \\"The Russian Revolution\\" by Alan Moorehead.) For that it was worth reading."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This book is one of the most biased books ever written, but this shouldnt be taken as a criticism. This is one of the those history books that was written by someone that was actually there at the time things were happening, and the author made it clear that he was not trying to present \\"both sides\\" of the story. He was going to present the \\"people's side\\" (at least at that specific time). You dont have to be a communist to enjoy this book. In fact, you can compare the dream the people had at that time with what they actually got later. Beautifully written, this book makes you live the revolution. As you read it, you find yourself walking down the same street with the people at that time and listening to them talk and argue and even fight. Thanks to Reed's amazing style you can visualize the whole thing."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Mr. Reed's depiction of the events in Petrograd leading up to the October Revolution was gripping, well-balanced and thoughtful. The book was not marred in the least by the fact that he was a well-known Communist. Those who percived that are probably either ultra-anti-Communist or perhaps misinterpreted Mr. Reed's work. All in all, an excellent book."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Reed's work definitely evokes the heady atmosphere of the Bolshevik Revolution, when it actually seemed as if the working class might rise up as one and seize the reins of power and therefore of its destiny. It is the classic account of Red October as told from the viewpoint of an &quot;outsider&quot; who identified with the Revolution as a member of the universal working class. However, it should not be forgotten that Louise Bryant was not only present as well but also wrote an account of her experiences. Six Red Months in Russia is the indispensable companion to Reed's work; the two should be read in tandem. As of the date of this posting (05.23.03) it is in print from Powell's Press. Get it while you can. It is a neglected gem of reporting from the Revolutionary frontlines which should command an equal amount of respect as does Reed's Ten Days that Shook the World."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Reed's work is most exquisite; it acts as a very effective summary of the revolutionary events. As far as such goes, it is singularly unique in its singlety of focus. Further, it acts as a most helpful resource as regards obtaining an understanding of the underlying dynamics of the revolution; recorded by an American witness (and the only American to be entombed in the Kremlin), it is an original and wholly constructive study--a must-read for any student of revolutionary thought or conflict dynamics."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"John reed was there. He witnessed the Russian revolution firdt hand . A great book for a student of history esp. of Russian History. Reed brings to life the emotional and sweeping moment in History that was to shape the 20th century"},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"John Reed, Harvard Class of 1910, epitomized the best of the pre-World War I bourgeois radicals. Unlike the vast majority of his Class and class he cast his fate with the working people and oppressed of America at a time when the dominant left bourgeois movement- the Progressive movement- was busy applying band aids to the increasingly inequitable capitalist system. The radical movement is always in need, sometimes desperately in need, of intellectuals to tell its side of the story. Despite some exceptions, like Reed, the intellectuals then, as now, either stand on the sidelines or at most acted as \`fellow travelers' to the movement. Reed on the contrary put all his energies into the movement. As a journalist he sought out all the radical hotspots of his time starting with his coverage of the Mexican Revolution, through the various workers' strikes of the 1910's in America culminating in his coverage of the heroic period of the Russian Revolution. His journalistic account of the Bolshevik seizure of power, Ten Days That Shook the World, stands even today as one of the best eyewitness accounts of that turbulent time in Russia. Reed had access to many elements of Russian society, from the revolutionatry workers quarters in Vyborg and Kronstadt to high society in the shadow of the Winter Palace, and mined those sources for his material. He brings the passion of the partisan in the best sense to his work.Revised and Updated Review- July 5, 2008I, on more than one occasion, have mentioned that for a detailed history of the ebb and flow of the Russian Revolution of 1917 from February to October of that year your man is the great Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky. Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is partisan history at its best. One does not and should not, at least in this day in age, ask historians to be \`objective'. One simply asks that the historian present his or her narrative and analysis and get out of the way. Trotsky meets that criterion. I have also mentioned in that same context that there are other excellent sources on this subject, depending on your needs. If you are looking for a general history of the revolution or want an analysis of what the revolution meant for the fate of various nations after World War I or its affect on world geopolitics look elsewhere. E.H. Carr's History of the Russian Revolution offers an excellent multi-volume set that tells that story through the 1920's. Or if you want to know what the various parliamentary leaders, both bourgeois and Soviet, were thinking and doing from a moderately leftist viewpoint read Sukhanov's Notes on the Russian Revolution. If you need a more journalistic account for the period of the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks and the immediate aftermath, the book under review, John Reed's classic Ten Days That Shook the World is invaluable.If we do not, as mentioned above, expect our historians to be \`objective' then we have a lesser expectation of those journalists who write the \`first draft of history'. Reed makes no bones that he is a partisan of the Bolshevik led social revolution that he was witnessing. He, nevertheless, tells his story reasonably well for those who are not partisans. Moreover, Reed seems to have been everywhere in Petersburg during those days. He is as likely to have been reporting from Petersburg's Winter Palace, the seat of the Kerensky's Provisional Government, as Smolny, the seat of the insurgent Soviets. We can find him among the bourgeois politicians of the City Duma or at the Russian Army General Staff headquarters. Hell, he was in Moscow when things were hot there as the Soviet forces tried to seize the Kremlin. He is at meetings large-Peasant Soviet size- or in some back room at Smolny with Trotsky's Military Revolutionary Committee that directed the uprising. To that extent, as a free lancer on the move, he covers physically during this period much more territory than Trotsky could as central director of the action and thus has more first hand observations.Reed's style tends toward straight forward reportage with little obvious sense of irony in the various situations that he is witnessing. Of course, against Trotsky's masterly ironic sense he is bound to suffer by comparison. Nevertheless Reed gets us into places like the City Duma and into the heads of various characters like the Mayor of Petersburg that Trotsky, frankly, displayed no interest in dealing with. Probably the greatest compliment that one could pay Reed is that he is widely quoted as a reliable source in many historical accounts from Trotsky on the winning side to someone like Kerensky on the losing side. For those who want a quick but serious overview of the dynamic of the October Revolution then here is your man. Add in his companion Louise Bryant's separate account, Six Month in Red Russia (if you can find it), and some very good primary source poster, pamphlet and newspaper material in the appendices of Reed's book and you are on your way."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This is not the easiest book to read and desparately needed editing before being published. John Reed, being an American socialist journalist, was obviously biased although he occasionally tried to hide it. John Reed's account is also confusing in many places trying to distinguish the various factions in play during the Bolshevik Revolution. Under normal circumstances this could rate as maybe two or three stars.So why am I being \\"generous\\" with five stars?There were factors that contributed to the \\"sloppiness\\" of this book. The US Government confiscated Reed's notes when he returned to the US and he fought for seven months to get his notes back. Once he got the notes he went into seclusion. If the book reads like something that was slapped together in around ten days it is because the book was slapped together in around ten days. Given the circumstances the book was a good eye witness account of the turbulent days of the events in Petrograd, Moscow, and other parts of Russia in November 1917.Regardless of what one may think of Lenin, Trotsky, Kerensky, Korilov, and other important players in the revolution these individuals and others played a critical role in a critical event that \\"shook the world\\". The book is especially interesting as it relays the hopes of the individuals in the early days of the revolution that was admittedly tense, confusing, and at times brutal. When the book was written Russia was in the second year of a civil war between Russian \\"Whites\\" and Russian \\"Reds\\". If the Whites had won then this book would have been just a footnote in the annals of political journalism. But the Reds won and what Reed witnessed turned out to be the start of something big that was to be a major impact on the world for decades to come.The book was also written by an American socialist journalist whose opinion was framed in the hopes and dreams of the Russian proletariat. It is not tainted by the harsh and brutal reality that was to occur in the post-Lenin Russia as Reed -- who died in 1920 -- had no idea of what the future would be. He thought many wonderful things will happen as a result the revolution. Instead, a power struggle ensued after Lenin's demise and the Soviet Union was plunged into a dark hole from which many of the key characters of this book did not emerge.It is also interesting that one of the book's harshest critics was Josef Stalin. Stalin was treated as a peripheral character who is mention maybe twice in the entire book. To make matters worse one of Stalin's bitterest rival, Leon Trotsky, emerges as one of the stars of the revolution without whom it probably would have failed. Stalin was to ensured Soviet historical accounts did not repeat that transgression.Regardless of what one may think of Communism and Socialism this is a critical book that accounts for the very earliest days of the Soviet Union. It is not the easiest book to read but it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This book is great not only for papers and reports on Russia's Revolutions, but also for readers simply interested in the story of the Bolsheviki. It reads like a great novel, and there are plenty of helpful notes and explanations to help the less knowledgeable reader with this topic in history. Reed shows a lot from the point of view of the Bolsheviki. A very fascinating twist that sets it apart from other books on the subject. First-hand experience gives Reed great subject matter and accuracy. Pick this one up!"},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Reed's exciting and excited eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution of 1917 is a valuable historical contibution to understanding that momentous event. Reed was &quot;into&quot; the revolution more than any foreign journalist at the time. As an active sympathizers, he was full of nervous energy that comes from the expectation of something wonderful and inevitable. The Messianic hope of Marx was to be realized. Communism was supposed to triumph and usher in a totally new era of human relations.Reed does get bogged down in details at times. For example, when he describes the multitiude of Russian political parties that operated in 1917 in a fragmented society that was coming apart at the seams. Reed would later die of typhus in Russia. His ashes were interned in the Kremlin wall, an honor reserved for the select few friends of the government or those who contributed towards its establishment or strength.Reed succeeded in conveying the atmosphere of anarchy, ferment, excitement, and struggle. I think that the ideological promise of the Revolution--classless society and workers' paradise--was a hollow hope. Yet it did accomplish an important historical transition: old political structures (monarchy, tradiditional aristocracy) were wiped out, and after the civil war, the new industrial society was born. The Russian Revolution was a transition to the modern world, which is full of struggle and tragedy, and not a portal to Earthly paradise as Reed and communists had hoped."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"More characters than a Tolstoy novel!This book has changed the way I read history -- it is more rewarding to read history than to read about history.John Reed's first person account of the Bolshevik Revolution has allowed me to formulate my own theories on how a political and social theory can reach critical mass and change the world and transform a nation.The revolution seems to have been like a wildfire or mania fueled by an unceasing supply of newspapers, propaganda and reports. The Russians would read anything and out of all of the varying ideas it was Lenin's that held sway. An amazing occurrence of political Darwinism.It is a stirring read in these ambivalent times and I do not think that Reed's intent was subversive, merely journalistic. This alone must have scared the pants off of the western capitalist class of the time.In light of what Russia is experiencing right now it holds the fascination of watching a car accident."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"\\"Ten Days That Shook The World\\" is an often confused and pedantic book designed to serve a murderous cause, so much so in parts it reads like \\"Helter Skelter\\" if written by Squeaky Fromme. But beneath the surface lies a worthy piece of history written by a journalist whose eye for detail and complexity is sometimes the equal of his partisan passions.John Reed writes here of the October Revolution of 1917, in which the Bolsheviks, hardline communists who played but a small role in the popular overthrow of the Czar months before, \\"soared...from a despised and hunted sect... to this supreme place, the helm of a great Russia in full tide of insurrection!\\"The October Revolution (which actually fell on November under the old Russian calendar Reed follows in this text) was not then a battle against monarchy but against fellow socialists, moderates like Alexander Kerensky who were continuing the Czar's war against Imperial Germany in hope of securing a peace agreement Russia could live with. Meanwhile, Russians suffered and died, and thus a cry went out to replace Kerensky. It was led by Bolsheviks like Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, who claimed Kerensky was selling Russia out and demanded he be thrown on what Trotsky vividly called \\"the ash-heap of history\\" along with all other socialists who would conciliate with Russia's middle class. And what to replace them with? Why, the Bolsheviks, the only group who could be trusted with power of any kind. Naturally, when they got it, Trotsky signed a peace with the Germans even Reed termed \\"disastrous\\".It's tempting to review the revolution here more than the book, especially as Reed saw this book as a \\"how-to\\" manual for the Western proletariat. But \\"Ten Days\\", after a dry and extended set-up, develops an energy as it follows in often touching vignettes the ten days when Kerensky's regime was decisively overthrown. It was written in a famously short time and published in 1919, when the story was still fresh and before the Soviets had a mind to rewrite their own past to eliminate discordant voices and inconvenient friends.Reed, as others note, seems everywhere here; talking to Trotsky, eating potato soup with Bolshevik soldiers from a common tub, sweating illiterate sentries checking his passes, even at one point meeting counter-revolutionaries in their hideout while a rightist leader, \\"for whose arrest the Military Revolutionary Committee would have paid a fortune\\", sits writing on a toilet.One notes throughout this book a tendency for Reed to ascribe to the common man of Russia one voice, a voice that unfailingly corresponds to the Bolshevik cause, never mind that there were a number of other parties enjoying vocal support. Such emotional declarations are approving noted, as is the derision heaped on those who speak differently. The people often appear as one collective mass, whether walking contemptuously past a church where they once worshiped or telling Reed that the only thing worse than being under the Czar is capitalism.But Reed is too good a journalist to leave it there. The fact is \\"Ten Days\\" now and then, almost offhandedly, poses a number of questions that would become uncomfortable to Soviet dogma. At one point, after Kerensky is sent running for good, a question about freedom of the press is raised, by a Bolshevik no less. Trotsky answers that such freedom has no place in a Revolutionary society, because newspapers can be used as a tool of bourgeoisie oppression.\\"Who's oppressed now!\\" Reed records a voice crying out. \\"Cannibal!\\"Cannibalism is what happens with revolutions all too often; it did here. Reed may have been on the wrong side, but in moments like this he cuts through the propaganda and tedium to deliver a message worth heeding."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This is Jack Reed's well-written but highly partisan and pro-Bolshevik eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution. Reed's Soviet Socialist biases drip from every page like an oily coating, and this may irritate readers who are not quite so utopian as was Reed. TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD is all but useless as an objective history of the event, but it is extraordinarily useful as a subjective interpretation of the birth of the first Communist state, and therefore, it is an interesting, fascinating, and valuable document well worth reading."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"A classic study of the Bolshevik Revolution in October/November, 1917 in Russia. Truly an excellent vision of the struggles that workers faced at the time from the inherently oppressive capitalist and feudal capitalist system. A blueprint for today's communists which demonstrates the urgent need to smash the capitalist state and to dispose of private property. The facists will hate this book as it shows an example of their inevitable demise through their own self-interest"},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"John Reed's book, \\"Ten Days That Shook The World\\", presents a challenge to well-meaning scholars of the October Revolution everywhere. The continuing debate over comrade Reed's accounts of the events of the socialist triumph over the bourgeois Kerenskyite oligarchs has been overshadowed by the present-day temporary setback experienced by the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and its struggle to resume its true and rightful place as the vanguard of the international proletariat. As Engels wrote in his classic work, \\"Materialism and the Apostasis of the 18th Brumaire\\" (Progress Press, Moscow, 1957), the inevitability of achieving a worker's state is far from a seamless upward trail, and will, from time to time encounter momentary challenges and obstacles thrown in the path of progess by counter-revolutionary and capitalist elements.How does the proper historian view Reed's work? Clearly, as comrade V. I. Lenin wrote his original introduction to \\"Ten Days\\", Reed was at his best in reporting on the empirical reality of the proletarian movements inside Petrograd. As comrade Lenin and others later commented, Reed could be excused as a \\"revolutionary journalist\\" (a bourgeois conceit, of course) for failing to correctly observe the deviationism underlying the Plenkhavites and so-called moderate Socialist Revolutionaries, not to mention crypto-anarchists and other undisciplined romantic individualists. Reed erred in not uncovering the Menshevik centrist trend in the Russian Social Democratic movement, lead by Trotsky and Bukharin, arch-conspirators and chauvinists who were rightfully expelled from the Party in 1927. Indeed, it was with comradely restraint and generosity that comrade Lenin granted a state memorial to comrade Reed's memory....Regrettably, truly objective scholarship has all but disappeared since the unfortunate events of the past decade. Perhaps the best critical analysis of the contradictions in Reed's works is found in comrade S.I. Klepov's monumental and enthralling six volume work, \\"Annals of the Sixth Comintern's Sub-Committee On Far Eastern Labor Relations in the Baikal-Irkutsk Regions (Progress Press, Moscow, 1937 (sadly, now out of print)), in which at page 708, he writes, \\"The American J. Reed fails to dialectically confront the errors of so-called moderates but in reality bourgeois roaders such as Zinoviev. He can be excused many of these faults due to his education in the infantile American labor movement and its inability to grasp such fundamental necessities as party discipline... As we know, \\"facts\\" are not the same as \\"truth.\\" Shorn of the necessary empiro-criticism guided by the steady hand of the Party, Reed's \\"account\\" of the November revolution are but an empty shadow of the genuine proletariat victory.\\" Truly such words were written on pages of gold!Surely we cannot improve on comrade Klepov's correct analysis. Comrade Reed's work, while flawed, can be forgiven as a good and indulgent father excuses an errant but well-meaning child."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"The world was certainly changed by these days that shook the world; Reed is accurate about that. He also does a solid job of explaining the background to the Bolsheviks' power grab from the corrupt &quot;ancien regime.&quot; This is a good book for those of us interested in how a perverted, twisted, and destructive ideology was able to take control of a great nation and manipulate the levers of power to the tune of 37 million deaths over its lifespan. Now that communism (at least from the semi-peripheral states such as Russia) has been consigned to the dustbin of history, it is well worth a re-read."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Although this book may be so brilliantly written by John Reed, I found it to be too laden with historical details, and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her (him)self with the makings of the Russian Revolution for the first time. The book provides with a glossary of Russian terms, events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so I found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there. However, due to my lack of knowledge of Russian history I was unable to piece together any of the information. So, in frustration I gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a &quot;history buff&quot;. From this experience I learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing, it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book. The rest of the book should be written according to that outline. A glossary of main events would also be helpful. On the other hand I do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner. Anyway, if you would like to expand your knowledge about the Russian Revolution, I highly recommend this book. However, if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"I took Sheila Fitzpatrick's &quot;History of the Soviet Union&quot; at the University of Texas the same semester &quot;Reds&quot; came out, so it was only logical that I would read John Reed's book on the side. One had a hard time believing that he could be so calm and cool about the thuggish agenda proclaimed by Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Stalin, _et al._ Then, when the Berlin Wall came down and Gorbachev called an end to the Soviet Union, we obtained access to Soviet state archives. What do you know! John Reed received payments of over $1,000,000.00 from the CPSU in the 1910s and 1920s! Who else ever got _more_ money, in current dollars, than this Communist agent? Maybe I.F. Stone.It's stunning that American publishers, etc., still give this fellow attention even after we know that, as Solzhenitsyn says, over 65,000,000 people were murdered by the Soviet Communists (and that's not counting the cost of their alliance with Hitler). Amazing moral obtuseness at the heart of American culture.It's a boring book, too."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"This is an excellent account of the Russian Revolution told in story form and should be included in your study of the Revolution. The author was an American journalist and active participant in the American Labor movement aiding strikers in Paterson, NJ. In 1919 he chaired the meeting which founded the Communist-Labour Party, later the Communist Party of the U.S.A.. There is no such thing as an \\"objective\\" and neutral study, all sides are bias, so this book should be read with the so called anti-communist accounts to balance this study out.There are a lot of details and yet it is told in story form. I think the other book to read on this subject is the History of the Russian Revolution written by the source itself, Leon Trotsky. Also Trotsky's book, The Revolution Betrayed. Then you can go to writings of Lenin. I found a short book on a couple of essays by the German Socialist and contemporary of the Socialist movement, Rosa Luxemburg, is very significant as an analysis. In this she criticizes much of Lenin and Trotsky's centralization as opposed to opportunism and the disbanding of the Duma and so forth, an excellent read! There are also quite a few modern books on the Russian Revolution as Richard Piper and others. This book is an excellent place to start and should not be excluded in this study.This book as scores of statements Reed took from the many of the Bolshevik - proletarian and the bourgeois newspapers, documents, announcements and decrees of Kerensky and the provincial government, short conversations with Bolsheviks, Cadets, Cossacks, Mensheviks, proletarians and bourgeois alike. What I found so helpful is that Reed, as an sort of neutral in between person, was able to interview many of the opposing sides."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Having just finished John Reed's great work of historical journalism I would call it compelling, articulate, a page-turner, etc. It is unfortunate that Reed died so young and was unable to see what his idealistic heroes set loose upon Russia and later the world. Reed was undoubtedly a good man and I don't mean to discredit his character, just his logic.That aside, this work is fascinating in that it presents so many of the pivotal events in the formation of the Soviet Socialist system from the point of view of someone who was right there while it happened. Add to this the fact that he was an American and thus understood the American sensibility and you have a work of near genius. For the average American reader, this work must have been illuminating for reasons of its style as well as its content.Reed does have obvious bias in favor of the Bolsheviki, indeed Trotsky is portrayed as a demigod, but he is able to sympathetically depict the plight of the nation of Russia near the close of WWI and enlighten the reader to the numerous causes of the Revolution, and why it must have seemed so inevitable and right to those who experienced it.Overall a stunning work of journalism and history, highly worth your time."},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"Although Ten Days That Shook the World is clearly totally biased towards the Bolsheviks, it is still an interesting read. It does an excellent job of revealing the dramatic side of the Russian Revolution, and it gives the events of the revolution the sort of immediacy that can only be achieved by on-the-spot reporting. There are also many facinating quotes and interviews with leaders, like Trotsky. It is an engaging and exciting book, and it is very well written.However, it is not really ideal (never mind ideal, it is pretty useless) for a research project or for real information. Unless you are pretty familiar with the events of the revolution, it would probably be confusing (he uses many terms without really explaining them and is VERY detailed). Furthermore, the book was written by a dedicated believer in the regime right after the event occured. Reed did not have the benefit of hindsight in writing his book - and he was blinded by his faith in socialism. Some of the events in the book are somewhat inaccurate, and Lenin and Trotsky are totally idealized! One thing that shows how biased Reed was towards the Bolsheviks is that Lenin himself states that the book is an accurate depiction of the revolution. This would seem like a good thing, but actually, when the revolution is depicted in way that is favorable to Lenin, one thing is for sure: it is completely inaccurate! For instance, the book leaves the reader with the impression that the Bolsheviks had planned the revolution much more carefully than they did in reality (it was more a lucky break than anything else).Nevertheless, this book is irreplaceable as a first-hand illustration of what the revolution was like. Even though some of the information cannot be trusted completely, it is still a facinating book!"},{"Title":"Ten Days That Shook the World","review":"I only read this again (first time in college) because I am going to St. Petersburg later this year and I wanted to remember the story of the Russian Revolution which took place there.

Mitchell describes a world that has left us and makes it seem as if it were still with us; I think that I'd give this book four stars just for the characters and the insights alone....But one could say the same about writers like Iceberg Slim; certainly, he too described shady characters in works like 'Pimp' and 'Trick Baby'; today, those seem more annoying than invigourating, and his writing more self-aggrandizing than reaching toward a verismilitude. Mitchell seems with us. His work could stand alone as a work of fiction rather than one of journalism; if it is six-hundred and eighty for pages (I think it is...) all are worth reading in multiple.I highly recommend this book. And I'm usually not a fan of works of this type. If I were to be, another neat book that is vaguely similar but a lot older is Hamilton Holt's 'The Life Sotries of Undistinguished Americans as Told by Themselves...'"},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Up in the Old Hotel is a collection of humorous stories about everyday people. I would highly reccomend it to anyone. Many of the stories had me laughing out loud. Up in the Old Hotel is a little peek into the past since the stories were written in the 30's to 40's era. The essays include descriptions of people and a few places. The reader is really able to see how these people lived and how they interacted with the world and people around them. I highly commend Josheph Mitchell for writing this funny, enlighting, intuitive book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"If an ordinary writer had tackled some of the stories in this volume, they might have bored readers to tears. But Mitchell is a master and his command of language is entrancing. Many of his characters are unforgettable and this book makes you thankful that someone saw the value and the human interest in these characters who most might cast aside as eccentric messes. Mitchell likes people, he finds them endlessly fascinating, and that oozes from every page. Up in the Old Hotel is one book I keep in my bookcase and will go back to again and relish."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"From the first moment I opened this book, I was riveted. It is very difficult to describe the wonder of it. It is more than characters, place, time. It is beyond all that. You enter a different universe, where you walk the city streets and country roads of a great city, yet are intimately connected with private lives. My personal favorite section is &quot;Mr.Hunter's Grave&quot;. I picture myself wandering thru those old country cemeteries, smelling the wildflowers and seeing the tombstones of those long past, the cries of the sea birds and red-winged blackbirds in my ears. If you haven't read this book, DO SO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I predict you will return to it again and again, especially in those small hours of the morning, when all is quiet, and you need a good friend to tell you a great story."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites - even non-New Yorkers will be engrossed. A loving, lyrical, touching and humorous description of a New York that died long before I was born - but Mitchell makes it come to life. After reading this book, you'll walk around Manhattan with newly keen eyesight - sometimes you may actually feel like you caught a glimpse."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"this guy was a great writer. some blurb somewhere compared this book to joyce's dubliners and that's right. it evokes new york city in the early part of last century and the dignity of its bums. mitchell's outlook is that we're all going to die, you know, but look at the things that people do beforehand! it's flattening and haunting and immensely comforting, his outlook. as the book goes on the stories become more explicitly about death (and fish), so the early stories are better. if you don't know anything about joe gould like i didn't when i read the story you are in for something that will stay with you. one more thing, my favorite story in this book is the title story, which at first struck me as anticlimactic, but seems more and more profound every day."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Unless you have an extraordinarily adept system of tracking the books you've lent to friends (or friends far more diligent than mine) you should strongly consider buying two copies. I lent my hardcover to a friend, and mourn it. I will lend it no more, having made the same mistake with a subsequent softcover. This is a book into which you can escape. It is alternately hiliarious, troubling, deeply sad. You can pick it up and read one piece or go through it cover to cover. Mitchell was a genius. Brilliant non-fiction writers like John McPhee and Tracy Kidder had their way paved for them by Mitchell... wanna see courage in print? Here it is."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Joseph Mitchell writes and I become the wiser. His first story on McSorley's Irish Pub prompted my visit to same last week when I visited NY. The visit made me pick up Mitchell's book and read it all over again. Every story is worthwhile despite subjects that would, at first, seem uninteresting. His profile of Joe Gould was one of the best pieces of non-fiction writing I can recall. If only a dozen guys in the world could write this way about real people."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"You don't have to be of a certain age or from a certain time or place to appreciate Joseph Mitchell. He transports you. He sees things the rest of us miss, or if we notice them at all, he sees in them things we don't. He takes us places unknown, and disappearing, as Charles Kuralt did in \\"On the Road.\\" What he writes is literature. You can recognize that, even if what he writes or how he writes it doesn't particularly appeal to you. It DOES appeal to me! He could make a grocery list a rewarding read. If I had to be marooned on a desert island with one book, this would be the one. I write this on the occasion of buying yet another copy to give as a gift (to the surgeon who commented knowledgeably when he found me reading the Memoirs of U.S. Grant). If there were room to store them I'd buy a googolplex, not to run out if it goes out of print again."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"This large, 1st Rate collection gets twinned with 'Bottom of the Harbor' tho all the best items in the latter are alsp reprinted in the formet.

I recently ordered a copy from Amazon to give my son, an aspiring writer. This book is for anyone who appreciates good writing and, given that most of the pieces were written in the 1940's, recent American cultural history. Good writing? No, it's matchless. There's a reason this book has 33 5-star reviews and two 4-stars. Read any of them, they're all on the mark. Buy several copies; share the wealth."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"I have been known to complain that five star reviews are given out way too freely. In this case, however, five stars may not be enough. In fact, I am surprised that some reviewers ONLY gave this book four stars, but to each his own. Other reviews have already very eloquently praised this book, so I will not repeat them, except to confirm they are on target. The book is 716 pages, and I only wish it were longer. If you enjoy great writing, great storytelling, great (and real!) characters I could not imagine a better choice than Up In The Old Hotel. It also transports us to a different time and place in America, one that existed before I grew up, but one that this book almost makes you long for. If you do not read this book, all I can say is, it is your loss."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Joseph Mitchell, a fine writer for The New Yorker magazine, put together a wonderful grouping of short stories during his many years of searching out the people and interesting places in New York City which was his beat for many years. I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy a good story about ordinary people, or one of an interesting landmark s such as McSorley's Bar and the people who frquented it during the 1920's and 1930's. It has been at the same location since 1854 and is still there today. My favorites are the first story, The Old House At Home (about Mcsorley's) and Mr. Hunter's Grave, towards the end of the book. Many others are excellent and bring out the heart of the city and its people. To me it brought back New York as it was then with kids \\"roasting mickies\\" as I did as a child in New York. G. H. Owens"},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"A book that covers the nooks and crannies of lower Manhattan. Oddball characters are brought to fullbloom under the author's pen. He knew how to listen! Towards the back some great essays ongrowing up along the Carolina coast."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Joseph Mitchell may be the best writer ever to have worked on the 'New Yorker' staff (the other contenders would include Edmund Wilson and A. J. Liebling). Every story in this long book is worth reading, and re-reading; the later pieces, from 'The Bottom of the Harbour' and especially 'Joe Gould's Secret' are tours-de-force of reporting. Mitchell invests his characters with so much life that they take on almost mythical proportions, without ever sacrificing their humanity. Although Mitchell often chose to write about people on the margins of society -- a homeless beggar like Joe Gould, a bearded lady, the hard-drinking Hugh Flood -- he never did so in a patronising manner. He admires these people not because of their struggles or hard lives, but despite them: he sees them, and makes us see them, as fellow human beings, not social welfare cases. Mitchell freely admits that listening to Joe Gould was a strain, and that Gould could be, like people who own houses and property and know where their next meal is coming from, selfish and mean-spirited; far from making Gould unattractive, this serves to make him come alive - homeless people don't become plaster saints, and it's silly to pretend otherwise. A key component in these stories is Mitchell's own persona, which is much like his prose style: quiet, unassertive, but immensely attractive. It is a great pity that, for whatever reason, Mitchell fell silent for the last thirty years of his life; but any sadness can be assuaged by dipping back into 'Up in the Old Hotel', where Mitchell's brilliant handling of detail and character -- and his shapely way with the structure of a profile, always dovetailing to a perfect close -- can be sampled time and again."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"While strolling in Soho, a friend dragged me by the ear into a small bookshop, bought this book for me and told me I had to read it. This kind of situation seldom works out for the best -- so many people have pressed mediocre books into my hands over the years, and I have slogged through them out of guilt. This volume hooked me from the start -- I very nearly missed by plane back home that day, as I became so deeply engrossed in it. Mitchell somehow managed to hold on to a wide-eyed wonder and appreciation for all things human throughout his long life. To read this book is to understand that below the surface of things -- old abandoned hotels, the oysters on one's plate, the raving lunatic on the street corner -- is a complex, moving, eloquent, fascinating story, available to anyone who would invest the necessary time, effort and love to extract it. Few of us can summon the necessary energy, but Mitchell could. I can't think of anyone who would fail to be interested in these stories, but New Yorkers past and present should, in particular, find this book fascinating."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"One day, it would have to have been the very early 70's, we were in the car with my grandfather, driving through the Bowery, and he pointed out the window at one of the derelicts and casually mentioned : I went to school with him. School, in this case, was Harvard Law School, back when that still meant something. He said that the guy had fallen on hard times and had refused repeated offers of help, so we drove on and he went along his merry, though entirely demented, way. Had this occurred just a few years earlier, that bum might well have been Joe Gould, whom Joseph Mitchell immortalized in the pages of The New Yorker.Up in the Old Hotel is a collection of Mitchell's otherwise hard to find essays, in which he lovingly describes haunts like the Fulton Fish Market and McSorley's, one of the last bars in America to admit women, and profiles various fisherfolk and colorful denizens of New York City's nether regions, most famously, Joe Gould, the bohemian character with whom he is inevitably and eternally linked. Mitchell first wrote about Gould in 1942, in a piece called, Professor Sea Gull. Mitchell's great skill as a writer was to let his subjects seemingly speak for themselves, but to in fact render their words in compulsively readable fashion. This works particularly effectively with Joe Gould who was a fountain of words anyway. The story relates how Gould, a Harvard grad, subsists on practically no money (one of his tricks is to make a soup out of the ketchup in restaurants), his propensity for making a spectacle of himself as he starts flapping his arms and declaiming poetry in the &quot;language&quot; of sea gulls, and his life's work, the nine million word Oral History of Our Time. Within the pages of hundreds of composition books, of the kind we used to use in school, Gould claimed to be writing a history of the world in the form of the conversations of ordinary people as he heard them speaking every day &quot;&quot;What people say is history.&quot; It was this idea that beguiled Mitchell and his readers, made Gould into a minor celebrity, and ultimately formed a tragicomic link to Mitchell's own career.You see, Mitchell gradually came to suspect that Gould's magnum opus did not really exist. When, upon Gould's death, Mitchell went in search of the Oral History and could find only a few garbled fragments, he decided, with some qualms, to expose the hoax that he had such played a central role in propagating. The result was the elegaiac Joe Gould's Secret which was written in 1964 and proved to be the last piece Joseph Mitchell ever published. For the next thirty years he showed up at The New Yorker every day, went into his office and seemed to work, but never produced a word. He became legendary for his &quot;writer's block,&quot; a staple figure in the many novels featuring a New Yorker like magazine, such as Bright Lights, Big City. Rumor had it that he was emulating his hero James Joyce and writing a Ulysses-type novel set in the New York he knew so well. But like Joe Gould, his masterwork does not appear to have been committed to paper.There are many fine essays in the book, but you really should, at least, read these two Joe Gould profiles. They stand as masterpieces of the journalist's art on their own, but when Mitchell's subsequent problems are taken into account and the eerie parallels become clear, these stories become transcendent and genuinely haunting.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Yes, as the other reviewers have already noted, it's true that Mitchell captures a sense of place and character as well as any writer working today, but the real reason to buy this book is the opportunity it will give you to revel in the rhythm of some of the most hynpotic sentences you will ever read by an American writer. If you think I'm exaggerating, then just open the book to a piece called &quot;The Rivermen&quot; (pg 574) and read the opening paragraph, in which Mitchell describes the Hudson River and his sighting of a sturgeon:&quot; ... it rose twice, and cleared the water both times, and I plainly saw its bristly snout and its shiny little eyes and its white belly and its glistening, greenish-yellow, bony-plated, crocodilian back and sides, and it was a spooky sight.&quot;If you love sentences like this, get this book. I've been teaching college composition for a dozen years, and can think of no better model for clean, elegant prose."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"I just got done reading this book and I'm sad that it's over. I figure I'll wait a couple of months and then read it right the way through again. I won't go into a lot of boring detail outlining Mitchells fantastically readable writing style and the ease with which he relates incredibly detailed stories and histories he's heard from other people, suffice to say this book will take hold of you and it won't let go. I just feel like this is the book I've been waiting for all my life. Never before has a book fascinated me so much. What struck me most was that I never once became tired of reading it, even right up to the end...usually with a 700 page book I'll be pining for the end by page 500, or I'm bored of the style or the subject matter - not so with \\"Up in the Old Hotel\\". It'll have you both regretful that you weren't around 60 years ago, or else wondering if such interesting characters still exist in New York today. Of note are the two incredibly detailed and accurate chapters about gypsies, and the fictional Mr Flood stories. Oh what the hell, it's ALL amazing stuff. I think I decided that Mr Mitchell is the best writer who ever lived by page 100. How come I never knew about this book until I saw it piled high in a second hand book store - and how come they aren't forcing kids to read this alongside such classics as \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and \\"Life on the Mississippi\\"? I intend to make it my lifes work to turn as many people as possible on to this incredible book. Don't hesitate, buy it!"},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"I was so engrossed in this book that everything else stopped for me for about a week. Joseph Mitchell's language is easy and clever, always informational and so entertaining that you read every word instead of skipping. The sentences themselves are so beautifully crafted that you find yourself anticipating their rhythms in your head as if following along with a beautiful melody. Not only does he tell you more than you'll ever want to know on any subject he writes about, but he does it in such a respectful, compassionate way to the subject of his attention that you can't help but love him. My favorite story was &quot;Up in the Old Hotel.&quot; Throughout this entire tale, I was entirely riveted waiting for the disclosure, excited in a way that only the very best movies elicit. When I'd read it, I laid the book down and thought about it for a long time. It was such a cliffhanger, and deeply interesting. Joseph Mitchell has definitely had his influence on other writers -- for instance, I seem to sense that Susan Orlean (&quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; -- another excellent book crammed full of interesting information and human insights) who also works for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; is a disciple of his. I will definitely be revisiting this book to experience his magical world, and I have it in my library of &quot;don't lends&quot;."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"I was first introduced to this author through his obituary (odd, I know). He appeared in an anthology of obituaries (Last Word - Obituaries from the NY Times) and I was intrigued enough to buy this collection of stories and profiles that appeared mostly in the New Yorker in the 30' and 40's. What a talent! His work is evocative and caring. The most ordinary citizen (or not so ordinary) has a story that he hears and probably no one else listens to. He conveys to his reader a gentle sense of life andstruggle and humor."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Joseph Mitchell is perhaps the best argument for never bothering to write again. He has said it. Why bother?This book is a collection of four books, including the classic Joe Gould's Secret (the last piece he ever wrote). He shows us what writing is meant to be: lyrical, poetic, filled with detail and observation, full of life about life full of meaning.The Rivermen, which details the life and times of Edgewater, New Jersey, is my favorite piece. It dodges and meanders, building a backdrop and developing some characters, and then WHAM, the meaning of life. I remember my wife asking me what the piece had been about, and I think my only clear response was: everything.He has style, and he also has meaning. His prose drives the reader toward his final sentence, and like Joyce he manages to leave the reader awed at his conclusions. And wiser.Of course, the most astonishing aspect of all is that it was all true. I suppose that shows how much meaning we miss in the living of life."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"I had read, and re-read, Joseph Mitchell's \\"McSorley's Wonderful Saloon\\" as a 15-year old and promptly lost the copy, but the book stayed in the mind and I have been looking for a replacement over the last 30 + years!I had little hope of finding the book again as I thought it must be out of print and, being from India, I assumed Mitchell was one of those obscure and unrecognised American writers.I knew little or nothing about him until recently but I wanted badly to get hold of the book again, so powerful was the effect of the writing even after 30 years.Imagine my surprise and delight when I traced, on the Net, recent editions of all of Joseph Mitchell's works - I promptly ordered both \\"Up in the Old Hotel\\" and \\"My Ears are Bent\\".Up in the Old Hotel is a collection of four of Joseph Mitchell's published works:McSorleys,Bottom of the Harbour, Old Mr.Flood and Joe Gould's Secret. And with the addition of My Ears are Bent, I now have all of Mitchell's published works.Up in the Old Hotel is the one to go for and, within the collection, McSorley's remains my favourite for it is Mitchell at the height of his reportorial powers - the eye for detail, the unerring instinct for a good story, the ability to bring the obscure and seemingly mundane into pulsating life.Most of the stories in the Old Hotel collection - almost all of them from real life - are about New York street life, about the people in the Bronx or the Bowery that one would pass by without a second look.Mitchell writes about freaks and oddballs and also about ordinary folk engaged in apparently obscure,hum-drum occupations such as a river fisherman or a community of African Americans on Staten Island.He is the proverbial Fly-on-the-Wall(with composite eyes) and this gives a rare immediacy to his stories and, while he sometimes bludgeons you with detail, he takes you there - be it a Bowery flop-house or a speak-easy, with the characters and their lives, thir hopes, their fears, coming alive in all candour and engaging sidelights .Mitchell awakens you to the human interest and, indeed, the essential humanity in his (real) characters and that is his special quality as a writer.These are period pieces about a New York long past but they have a contemporary feel about them; as you read on, you begin to appreciate that the faces, the appearance and the occupations may have changed but the characters remain and that the people are essentially similar to you and me whilst being different, being themselves.I wish more of Mitchell's Southern stories had been included in the collections for they have the same appealing quality of his Big City pieces but with a different setting, context and a different set of characters, Hopefully, all of his New Yorker output will, one day,be published.Meanwhile you couldn't do better than get hold of Up in the Old Hotel and My Ears are Bent (though the latter is somewhat patchy and uneven, it is the young Mitchell discovering his metier, honing his skills) and read the stories and re-read them, perhaps every three years!"},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Whenever I can't think of something to read, I pick up Up in the Old Hotel and read a story or two out of it. I've probably read it 4-5 times and never get tired of it. It captures a lost era of American life that is what I think of when I imagine America in its finest light. Reminiscent of Tortilla Flats and other Steinbeck and even On the Road in a way - a gentler time in our history."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Mostly biographical vignettes of a motley assortment of eccentrics and crazy characters.

What makes these pieces stand out from all the other New Yorker/Sunday Times pieces that I've read is the dignity with which Mitchell depicted the people he portrayed. It's very moving."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Up in the Old Hotel is a masterpiece. I've read it so many times (it is my ultimate desert island book) and have yet to tire of it. The essays (and the few short stories that are included) are timeless, generous works of genius. Joseph Mitchell captures his odd and wonderful subjects as richly realized individuals, and appreciates the smallest of beautiful, dark and humorous nuances. His vision is presented so humbly and offhandedly, yet with absolute precision and so much respect. You truly feel a part of the experience. I'm not sure there is anyone who could write better. All of the essays are amazing, but my favorites are Mr. Hunter's Grave, The Old House at Home, Mazie, and Up in the Old Hotel. The short stories in Section II of the first book are heart wrenching. This book also makes a really great gift."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"All of these reviews seem to focus on the East Village stories. I have to admit that the reason I read this book was because I went and had a few beers at McSorley's and had an amazing afternoon with a british playwright who thought that the servers didn't like him. I was given a copy by a friend when I told him about my experience and I spent many wonderful nights reliving my NY stay. But the Black Ankle stories are where it's at if you ask me. Food and characters and places you only dreamed of visiting. Uncle Dockery and the Independant Bull might be one of the best stories I've read in the last ten years. Joseph Mitchell's stories are American treasures. I have never said this about any author before, but I swear to God, he's another Mark Twain and I can't believe that nobody knows this."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Mitchell, a well known reporter has filled a role in history that will always be remembered and loved by those who lived the life he wrote about.The people in his stories are unique and have qualities some would find interesting.

Mitchell's evocative description the famous pub in &quot;McSorley's Wonderful Old Saloon&quot; puts the reader in the bar with him. And in addition to describing places with attention and nuance, Mitchell is equally adept at bringing to life a cast of Old New York characters that range from a street preacher to a movie house ticket seller.In the end, Mitchell's greatest achievement is that he evokes a time and place like few works of nonfiction ever do. Writings about New York City are everywhere, but good writings about the Apple aren't so easy to find. And along with A.J.

It flows, as profiles and stories aimed at \\"The New Yorker\\" often do, very well. Joseph Mitchell combines his Piedmont North Carolina roots in the fiction included with his outsider-insider's knack at recording (perhaps with a bit of editing and improving, who knows it being the '40s) his fellow denizens of the Bowery, the fishing fleets, and the boardinghouses that once comprised so much of vanished Manhattan.This nostalgic appeal feels even in the late '30s articles very strong. Mitchell records not only Joe Gould in two extended and slightly overlapping entries about this enigmatic fellow turned down-and-outer, but others as compelling if less annoying. The glimpses of McSorley's introduce the collection reprinted of that name, and among the twenty-odd selections, I liked the masterful manner in which the back-to-back social commentary of Mohawk high steel walkers and the tipsy beefsteak celebrants were introduced and sustained. There's much on gypsies, one of Mitchell's passions, as seen by the cops. Mazie of the theater district, Lady Olga of the beard, and the rather cruel trickster Santa Claus Smith all gain noteworthy starring roles. These earlier vignettes and profiles for me proved the most intriguing.Stories follow, with an ear for the vernacular and a tone not dissimilar from his non-fiction observations. Some are set in the same environs as the essays, others in his native South. \\"Old Mr. Flood\\" offers three long looks at local fishing. I admit about zero interest in clams, but the skill of Mitchell's diligent attention makes you--as with John McPhee's geological studies in the magazine in later years--learn as you follow a chronicler of the hidden terrain underneath our eyes and noses. However, the increasing documentation with all things maritime once upon a time in New York City may not keep you reading every salty word as closely as the tales set on the sidewalk or the tenement do.Finally, after much more of the same adding to the anthology titled \\"The Bottom of the Harbor,\\" I confessed I was happy to find the title story \\"Up in the Old Hotel\\" with its peering into the dust of an abandoned ferry hotel above the Fulton Fish Market enticing, back to a landlubber's curious gaze upward. The article chasing down lore and legend about the giant rats on the waterfront may haunt you, to say the least.Therefore, ending this with \\"Joe Gould's Secret\\" (given away in the paperback preface of this reprint edition by David Remnick) feels appropriate. The stages of interest, disgust, fascination and forgiveness play themselves out in Mitchell's hearing and telling deftly. And, the parallels to Mitchell's own career, in its second half, will also linger as a parable."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"Each story provides a wonderful portrait of people living in real life under what could be strenous and demoralized circumstances during a period in our history when money was tight but families were tighter. It provides a window into the lives of real heros, those who confronted life with tenacity and grit without allowing the weigh of it to break them. I love that it contains a mix of true life stories and fiction; it truly is a compilation of several books within a book. I have thoroughly enjoyed spending my evenings reading this collection. It is unlike the usual, predictable short story anthologies. It's charming."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"I've got a photo somewhere around here of me standing in front of McSorley's, down on 7th Street, not looking too much like a tourist, I hope. I've also got my mom's copy of \\"Here at the New Yorker,\\" by Brendan Gill (1975). He has a lot to say about Mitchell: his broom closet of an office down a narrow, dusty corridor, overlooking sleepy hollow: his ever dwindling, but eagerly awaited output, unlike the volumes of output from his best friend A. J. Liebling. The flyleaf depicts these two icons, along with but 34 others. (Cheever curiously absent.) Page or two bio inside, around page two-something. Not much about North Carolina in either book, except \\"Old Hotel's\\" preface is all about Robeson County."},{"Title":"Up in the Old Hotel","review":"I wanted to find a copy of a collection of short stories from the New Yorker about New York. It's an older book, but it's not out of print. Nevertheless, I couldn't find it at any of the bookstores I tried while I was in New York.Instead, a kindly bookseller directed me to this book. It turned out to be exactly the type of book I was seeking. It's a collection of pieces that Joseph Mitchell wrote about odd New Yorkers he ran across in his work as a journalist during the thirties, forties, fifties, and sixties. It is actually a book within a book, in a recently published collection of out-of-print books by Mitchell, titled Up in the Old Hotel.I was fascinated by a little story that I discovered about Mitchell that I ran across while researching his life further. Mitchell interviewed a down-and-out fellow back in the thirties who claimed to be writing an enormous book, compiled in many volumes, about New York that consisted solely of conversations the fellow had had with people he met. A number of literary figures befriended this fellow over the years. Many years later, in the sixties, after the fellow passed away, Mitchell searched for the volumes of the book and he was dismayed to discover that the book was a figment of the fellow's mind, that nothing had ever been written. After writing this piece, Mitchell never wrote another word for publication, though he went into work every day for many years."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"Hilary Mantel often includes the theme of exploitation in her novels, but nowhere is it as prominent as it is in The Giant, O'Brien. Set in the 18th century, it is the story of the nave Irish giant Charles O'Brien, who, poverty-stricken, allows himself to be taken to London where he will be a &quot;freak&quot; for the amusement of the public. Everyone wants to profit from him, from his Irish friends who accompany him, to the agent who contracts with him and the people who house him. Amiably, he tells tales on his travels to amuse his companions, all paralleling in some way the freakishness of his own life and all ending badly: a proud woman's beautiful child is taken and a &quot;yellow child, its skin flapping, its eyes running and its nose snuffling&quot; is substituted; the seven dwarves are beaten to death, &quot;each dwarf watching the pulping of his brother&quot; while &quot;Snow White&quot; is punched in the face, spat at, and driven from the cottage by fire; a pig-faced girl, instead of being rescued by the love of a prince, lives a long life of loneliness. Sensitive and creative, the Giant is a marked contrast to Dr. John Hunter, a &quot;scientist&quot; who collects bones, does research on diseases, and even accidentally inoculates himself with syphilis, allowing him to study it more closely. Hunter's goal is to acquire the bones of the Giant. As both the Giant and Hunter become more ill with the progress of their diseases, the book reaches its climax, leaving the reader to ponder many of the conflicts Mantel has illustrated-creativity vs. scientific research, naivete vs. knowledge, hope vs. despair, charity vs. exploitation-and ultimately, the big question: in what ways, if any, have humans risen above the level of animals."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"There is much food for thought in this odd yet entertaining dark short book. Hilary Mantel tells the story of Charles O'Brien, an Irish giant, who comes to London to make a living as a 'freak' or sideshow exhibit. He is accompanied by crude Irish ruffians and a villainous agent, Joe Vance. The story of the Irish giant runs parallel to the story of the Scottish surgeon and anatomist, John Hunter.The novel can be interpreted in many ways, attesting to the superb talent of Hilary Mantel. The lives of Giant Charles O'Brien and Scottish surgeon John Hunter have some striking similarities. Whereas O'Brien sees the vast poverty, social deterioration and economic oppression of the Irish people by the English; John Hunter is no stranger to tragedy as the youngest of 12 children he is always fed last and eventually thrives as a wild child in the Scottish countryside. Here he learns from nature but also is devoid of human sentiment and compassion. He watches as almost all of his siblings die until he, his older brother, and older sister are all that remain. He has seen much death and is well acquainted with death. The giant begins to grow signaling his death while John Hunter begins to deteriorate from a sexually transmitted disease that infected him accidentally when he was trying to infect a homeless man so that Hunter could watch the natural progression of the disease in this homeless fellow. John Hunter desires the skeleton of the giant and pursues him. John Hunter buys corpses. The chapter where he lectures grave robbers on how to rob a grave is creepy and interesting. Hunter now tracks the giant who believes that his body must remain intact if he expects to go to heaven on judgment day. This is the basic armature of the book, but it really is much more than just this.First, Mantel develops a clever comparison to the life of Jesus in her novel. O'Brien gathers disciples around him, many of whom are scruffy and criminal. Like Jesus, he approaches the downtrodden and asks them to join him. In Ireland he rocks a starving boy until his last breath while telling his mother that the boy is the inheritor of kings and will sit on a throne. After the boy's death, he asks the starving woman to join his group on the way to London. Later his group has their own Mary Magdalene in the person of Bitch Mary, the twelve year old prostitute. He provides fables and tales to entertain and instruct his wayward disciples, inflicted with naive youth, mental retardation, and criminal intent. As Jesus enters Jerusalem to preach his message and then to die, so too does Charles O'Brien enter London to tell stories, make a living as a sideshow freak, and eventually to die. Like Jesus, the disciples disappoint and eventually betray him, willing to sale his bones for cash even though they know the giant feared this would mean he can't go to heaven on judgment day.The fables told by the giant are odd and haunting and are wonderfully integrated into the short novel. One is a story of a beautiful young mother who nurses a demon baby and loses her own healthy human baby; another is an odd tale of Snow White sleeping with the 7 dwarves until they are killed by suspicious villagers; a third is the tale of pig faced girl who isolates herself from cruel human society the older she becomes. They all end badly, they all emphasize either exploitation of the innocent or man's inhumanity to man.Much of the novel revolves around human cruelty to other humans. This novel perfectly exemplifies the concept that man is prey to man. There is structural exploitation, which is seen in the relationship of Ireland to England and the vast amount of capital punishment that occurs to the Irish poor for stealing food for their starving children and other 'crimes' that the socially and economically oppressed commit in order to survive. One interesting passage is a list of all the young men and women that the giant knows who were hung by the English for a vast range of petty offenses. Irish women are called \`bitch' by the English. Thus the young 12 year old prostitute, Mary, becomes known as Bitch Mary. Thus vast structural oppression occurs in this novel. However, the squalor of everyday oppression of master to servant; landlord to renter; criminal to victim; and pimp to prostitute is evident throughout this dark little novel.Underneath all the social commentary, the poverty, and man's inhumanity to man is a subtle and well developed theme. For Charles O'Brien is a man who spins myth. He is almost a walking myth himself. He instructs with tales of woe and calamity yet underneath the woe is a spirit of generosity and compassion and a belief in the power of the well-told tale. O'Brien is contrasted with John Hunter, a man who is obsessed with heartless inquiry. He buys corpses and studies anatomy endlessly. Yet his aim in not for the betterment of the human condition, but primarily for his own unquenched desire for knowledge. He may practice surgery but primarily for his own intellectual gratification rather than for the relief of suffering. So, at first sight, it appears that this is a novel about myth versus science; fable versus inquiry; sentiment versus objectivity; emotion versus reason. It is to Hilary Mantel's credit that the novel is not that obvious. For in the end, the squalor and depravity of the human condition bring down both Charles O'Brien and John Hunter. Both are betrayed by trusted servants; both are betrayed by their own bodies; both are eventually betrayed by the limitations of human existence. It is this haunting bleak reality that is Mantel's message. For in the end the human capacity for greed and evil drowns both myth making and science making."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"The Giant, O'Brien is a testament to the diversity of Mantel's gifts as a writer--it is both not as psychologically rich and much more earthy than many of her other works (A Change of Climate, An Experiment in Love, Eight Months on Ghazza Street), but it is no less compelling. The novel follows Charles O'Brien, out of Ireland into the streets of late 18th c. London to escape poverty, giving us a stark image of the time and place: many characters cannot recognize stairs because they have never seen a house big enough to warrant them. The Giant O'Brien himself is an island of humanity in a sea of crass and self-serving petty people, the real monstrous freaks of the novel, who live off him--and his corpse.It is also a richly symbolic account of the storyteller: the imaginative vision of his surroundings (he sees his starving compatriots as &quot;the sons and daughters of gods and kings&quot;) which is the source of his art as well as the lines of influence--as the giant tells stories and leads his troupe to become tellers in their own rights. What is more, Mantel's account of the giant's adaptation of the Snow White and Seven Dwarfs tale is stunning--the violence in the tale is not only consistent with traditional tellings of fairy tales, but it clearly emerges out of the world in which it is told.The fragmented narrative is consistent with other Mantel novels, but it seems more fragmented here, and this makes for challenging reading, but it says so much about the world of late 18th century Ireland and the streets of London. The novel confronts the harshness of its world--abject poverty in Ireland, expoitative London--and the violence it fosters is compelling. Mantel's picture of the plight of poor Irish women is especially disturbing but it reverberates with a powerful truth."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"I was completely entranced and delighted by this book, and disappointed by the reader reviews of it. Hilary Mantel's style is spare - nothing more than the strange essence of her story. There is no spoon-feeding here, and thus, is probably not for mainstream tastes. But it's great, quirky transportation to a truly other time and place. Oh yes, and fine good humor with the pathos! Was really sorry it ended so quickly."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"I have read several other books by Mantel, and enjoyed them all. But this one stands out, not just as an enjoyable read, but as an excellent piece of literature. Mantel is a reliably good author - engaging, smooth, and honest. But sometimes, an author manages to rise above \\"good,\\" and create something truly unique, something that breaks the rules, takes risks and succeeds in charting new territory. This is what Mantel has done in The Giant O'Brien.The Giant O'Brien is based on the true story of the Irish giant, Charles Byrne, who was exhibited in London in 1782. In all likelihood, Byrne had acromegaly, a pituitary disorder that causes abormal growth. (Andre the Giant, from the Princess Bride, suffered from this disorder, as did Lincoln.) Interwoven into Byrne's tale is the story of John Hunter, the famous Scottish anatomist. During that time, anatomists had to rely on the pickings of the gallows, or on body snatchers, the so-called \\"resurrection men,\\" for their subjects. Hunter, in his dedication to collecting and analyzing new specimens, becomes obsessed with the Giant, and their paths cross - with heart-rending predictability.What marks this novel as exceptional is its blend of highly contrasting narrative styles. The fanciful and utterly charming tales of the Giant, which, in keeping with the events of the novel, grow darker as the story unfolds, contrast starkly with the poverty, filth and bleakness of London in the late 18th century. Mantel enjoys shocking her audience with her gruesome portrait of the times, yet these, and other shocks, are balanced by the touching naivete of the Giant's followers, whose fall from grace is not actually so much a fall as a recognition that they are already flat on their backs. Other stories have featured these themes - urban poverty, desperation, obsession - but nowhere have I seen them treated with more humor and wit than in this novel. For, in spite of the subject matter, this book is frequently hilarious. It is also quite beautiful. Mantel is a master of lyrical writing; her scenes are like paintings.Beyond beautiful writing, humor, and worthy subject matter, what makes this book special is that it is not really about the Giant, his followers, the obsessive anatomist, the poverty, or the failure of dreams. These are motifs. The real theme is the \\"resurrection men,\\" who appear sporadically throughout this novel. They mirror and elucidate the Giant's charming, and ultimately horrifying, tales. For it is the writer who resurrects characters, and who tells their tales. Mantel is the true \\"resurrection man,\\" and her task, like the Giant's, is to charm, to horrify, and to raise the dead."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"I loved this book, but then I love Hilary Mantel's writing. Some people find her dialog hard to follow but I don't seem to have that problem - maybe I get so buried in them that the conversation works for me. This one had me missing my subway stop. The Giant O'Brien is wonderful both with her depictions of 18th century Ireland and England and her characters, even the ruthless ones. I think she made John Hunter out to be a little too evil maybe - it was interesting to read about the real Dr. Hunter. He is described in biographical sketches as being very humane and kind although he did have a temper and it is a fact that he violated O'Brien's (Byrne's) dying wish to be buried at sea. Mantel also makes him out to be somebody who has wonderful manners, playing at this very well to get what he wants although the Giant isn't fooled. If you google Charles O'Brien and John Hunter you can find a photo of the interior of the Hunter museum in London with the Giant's skeleton on view. You can also find a drawing of the real O'Brien standing between the Knife (Knipe) brothers, the tallest identical twins ever known. The fourth giant in the book is also based on a real person, Patrick O'Brien. There is also an ongoing battle by severly people who want the Hunter museum to make a plaster cast of the skeleton and honor O'Brien's wishes finally and have hin buried at sea. Don't know if any of the other characters are historical figures but they were compelling nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"This book was pretty good. I like how the surgeon gets different body parts of people to study them. The surgeon then gets interested in the giant. Sometimes it gets confusing because sometimes I do not no who is speaking. If you were interested in a almost secretive book with cultures from England, and that takes place in London, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"Hilary Mantel has a unique ability to tell a story through the conversations of her characters. The book is carried along by each character's thoughts and words. This story told in the Irish dialect of its subjects, is at times amusing and often poignant, but ultimately depressing. Frankly there were no surprises in this story. It ground along with the giant and his retinue heading for their predictable end.After reading Mantel's last book, Bring Up the Bodies, I was really disappointed in this one. She has certainly honed her craft since this early work."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"Unusual and interesting novel giving description of the Irish downtrodden trying to survive in London, juxtaposed with the intricate methods used by medical experimenters to obtain corpses. Mantel does an interesting weaving of the two stories and brings it all together in the end. Ending re: Medical person is a bit strange."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"Hilary Mantel's writing allows her readers to enter into the world of 18th century London in a very tactile and gritty story in The Giant, O'Brien. The brutality of the life of recent immigrants from Ireland is well imagined and described in this tale of a Giant with an entourage who arrive in London hoping to make their fortune exhibiting him as a freak. The darker side of the the story involves John Hunter, a scientist ,or anatomist who uses a team of people to obtain corpses of varying types in order to study anatomy. The paths of these two disparate groups cross and the result seems inevitable from the beginning so hopefully this knowledge won't keep anyone from reading the book. I found the short novel quite compelling and Mantel's fragmented style as others have pointed out moves the plot along rather briskly. I was slightly disappointed in the ending. For me it didn't seem commensurate to the buildup and I thought the book ended rather abruptly. Overall I would recommend this as a fascinating and fanciful historical novel from a writer who has been recognized as a masterful story teller."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"I was assigned to read this book as part of an American/British modern lit. class, alongside many classics such as Heart of Darkness, Mrs. Dalloway, the Great Gatsby, etc...and this book falls short in comparison. Unlike many other reviewers, I did not have trouble following the style of the book. However, when it was all said and done, I had a great deal of difficulty determining what, if anything, this book was trying to say.Part of our assignment is to write 350 words about the theme of the story. Throughout the book I tried to write notes about any possible theme, and nothing solid surfaced. The cost of desire? Well, it may have led to the downfall of O'Brien and Hunter, but not so much the others around them. In fact, 4 of the book's least savory characters, the Claffey brothers, Slig, and Kane, end up with a nice little freakshow racket. Man's inhumanity to man? It's a weak theme, but definitely appropriate. There is certainly a juxtaposition between the two main characters, one is an intelligent and kind man who is publicly displayed as a freak while the other is a mean, obsessive man who is the true freak in private. However, both characters are sad and pitiable by the time the last page turns. Overall the only thing I knew for sure after reading this was that London in the 1780's was a squallid, dangerous place to live.Mantel's writing style is excellent, and I certainly never got the impression that I was reading a modern novel. There are quite a few laughs, chills, and tearjerking moments, but in the end it just seems to be lacking a clear direction."},{"Title":"The Giant Obrien","review":"In short, O'brien, the novel, deals with a fascinating and unusual.

In the first two years listed, America was safely sitting on the sidelines, observing the kind of warlike behavior attributed to the dynastic state in this book in Europe, much as Elizabethan England enjoyed several centuries of isolation from the wars which were devastating Europe in the years in which its economic activities became industrial, though socially, as Veblen observed, \\"Conventions that are in some degree effete continue to cumber the ground.\\" (p. 30). By 1964, America was playing such a large role in the world that Germany might have been the kind of problem that America, from a unique position of political and military superiority, ought to have been able to resolve, and possibly did by acting as if the major problems in the world were somewhere else.Chapter I, Introductory -- Races and Peoples, compares the mixture of races which populated England and Germany to be quite similar, if not exactly the same. A note on page 23, in Chapter 2, The Old Order, compares such mixing with what occurred in Japan, \\"and possibly also the Aegean peoples of antiquity.\\" \\"By a curious coincidence, the period of Japanese prehistory and history seems to cover loosely the same general interval of time as that of the Baltic peoples; and as with the latter, so in the case of the Japanese, the cultural life-history of the people is a history of facile and ubiquitous borrowing done in the most workmanlike manner and executed with the most serviceable effect.\\"In the chapter on The Dynastic State, Veblen notes that printing was a handicraft which was well practiced in Germany, and included \\"the circulation of obnoxious literature that purveys excessively modern ideas\\" (note on p. 76), but that it appeared to be best \\"to engender that habit of reading as to make the assimilation of the new industrial order an easy matter, resulting in a marked advance in efficiency and physical comfort, and then to temper coercion with a well-conceived cajolery.\\" (note, p. 76).One of the pleasures of reading Veblen is encountering philosophical ideas in an utterly different context, as on page 109:. . . While the corresponding English movement, in so far as touches the point here in question, has tended strongly to an atheistic and unmoral scheme of opaque and impersonal matter of fact. This work of the human spirit as it has come into play under the German habituation is spoken of as \\"nobler,\\" \\"profounder,\\"--a point not to be disputed, since such discrimination is invidious and is an affair of taste and perspective.The final paragraph of the chapter on The Case of England is devoted to the \\"direct waste of time and substance involved in this ubiquitous addiction to sports.\\" (p. 148). I enjoy Veblen's offhandedly remarkable description of how \\"persons with a predilection for artistic and intellectual dissipations may be moved to deprecate addiction to dissipations of this crude and brutalizing nature,\\" (p. 148) but this book deserves far more serious readers than I am."},{"Title":"Light of the Night: The Last Eighteen Months in the Life of Th'r'se of Lisieux","review":"Jean-Francois Six has given Therese back to the world. As a Carmelite contemplative living at the end of the 19th century, Therese was in the midst of a cultural and spiritual revolution as Faith began to give way to Doubt and Cynical Skepticism. Her struggle was to remain faithful to her mystical devotion to Christ in the midst of a world eager to find new, and even more dubious, devotions. Her solution: if you can't beat them, join them; not by discarding faith, but by allowing the full force of doubt to fill and break her heart in order to understand and feel kinship with the doubting world around her, making her an even greater Saint than the revised, silly, &quot;canonized&quot; version given by her sister, Mother Agnes, and the Church. Her courage was to stare down the night in loving trust that there would be a dawn...somehow.

The general outcome at the end was predictable, but so what. King did what he does best, he told a great story. As for the gross stuff and the profanity, I think that is typical for King, and how I would expect these characters and creatures would act. IMO it is worth the read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"No one is going to pick up this book without some idea that the dream will surely be a nightmare. All the King elements are here, often grotesque, gross, gory and disturbing, but with an element of sweetness and inherent goodness (Duddits!). Occasionally felt swept away by all the raw emotion in this book, King takes the reader along a voyage that likely he never intended to make - and you know he isn't going to sugar coat it. With slights shades of Tommyknockers and shades of IT, a lot of mid-life angst, and a pedestrian accident - this is still very much an original. While I always enjoy King's books, this one seemed highly personal. And if aliens and the army aren't scary enough, the ultimate destination, and its vulnerability - was absolutely horrifying."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Mr. King leads you from the natural to the supernatural in his crafty, inimitable style. Before you know it, the hook is set, and you are experiencing the X-Files along with the Alien all in one maudlin, convoluted yarn. Most of the key characters are well developed and are either endearing or exquisitely despicable. At the end you feel as though you want more of these people and their adventures. The story rambles in places, drippy and sentimental, and even though I am still unclear as to some of the \\"reality\\" of the story, I don't want to go through the exhausting particulars again. The tale is seasoned with the usual abundance of explicit violence and gore - definitely not for the timid or squeamish! The epilogue gave me a warm fuzzy and closure, but it was a weak device. It seemed unnecessary, as I believe the story could have been concluded with the fate of the heroes revealed at the end. It is not one of my favorite works from Mr. King. Notable is the narrator, Jeffrey Demunn, who reads well and whose Yankee twang adds a lot to the experience."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The first King novel that I read was &quot;The Shining&quot; and from that point i decided that I would become an avid reader of Stephen King. So when &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; was released I did not hestitate in purchasing it.Overall, I felt this book was entertaining. Many times during the course of the reading, I found myself wanting to skip ahead a few pages to find out what happens next. King seems to overindulge the reader with long descriptions that cause the reader to lose sight of the novels story.Also, the action and the movement of the plot is inconsistent throughoput the book. We are introduced to the four friends and then introduced to the &quot;alien-like&quot; creature. At this point it seems as if the book was about to get increasingly interesting. However, I realized there was about 300 more pages of material to read.I would recommend this book if there is nothing else that you really want to read sitting on the end table."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Maybe I've read too many Stephen King novels over the years but the end of this book was just too predictable. I won't spoil it for the rest of you by giving it away but you'll probably figure it out about halfway. That wouldn't have bothered me so much if the narrative in between the beginning in the end had been better. There were some good parts but the book just didn't seem to flow like his other ones. If you've never read Stephen King before (and if not, what planet are you from?) do not start with this one"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The gore, the language and the extremely confusing story made this a true disappointment for me after this exciting wait. I could not wait to get it and then really had to convince myself to even finish. I did read it to the bitter end hoping for a string to be pulled to make it all worthwhile. Alas! No string. Just a disturbing story that did not make it worthy to recommend in my opinion."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am not a King fan but found this a damn good read. Fast paced and gripping, I coudn't put it down once started. If you don't buy it, at the very least put it on your local library list."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am an avid King reader and have read just about everything he has written. Like other readers who have reviewed this book I found myself unable to finish this one. A couple of the characters are interesting but they take a back seat to the characters that aren't and King's real strength, his ability to build suspense, is simply missing in this book altogether. You keep asking yourself, &quot;when will this chapter end so we can get to something interesting?&quot; Eventually, I gave up looking for something interesting and gave up the book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I wish Stephen King would realize that he does his best writing in novellas and short stories and lay off the over-long novels which only fill pages. And please....try writing a novel with no children in it. Look back over King's novels and you'll find he seldom gets away from this ploy. How about his giving us a nice 300 pager full of adults and maybe then he might be scary again. By the time I read the last chapter I was hoping all of the characters would die and Mr. Gray would win. Perhaps he's killed his leg demons now and can try writing something less soul cleansing and more mature."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I felt that this book was a very well written book. It is a book had a lot of twists and turns to it. Its suspense kept me wanting to find out more and finsh the book.

While the plot is not original, it is Stephen-king type original: It could be only the insane and quite humorous mind of Stephen King to think that the Alien-type creature would say hello to the world through our a&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;ses rather than our chests as in Alien. Ha ha ha! Congratulations to King for bringing anything that comes to his mind in a pot (several references to several horror and sc-fi movies) but still creating an overall original book that somehow entertains, frightens, makes me laugh and makes me transport to his own world once more after all these 20-some years. In another one's hands with no real talent(la la la Dean Koontz stand up please), this would be another boring, shabby, moral story that pro's for Christianity and pan-Americanism once more.King, you are the man!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Henry, Pete, Jonesy and Beaver are regular teenage kids.

Creating a very nice connection with the characters. A must read!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King is an amazing writer and few dispute that. Although the film adaptation of this novel was highly criticized, it is no less a highly suspenseful, frightening and endearing story (yes, endearing). Although many of the subplots seem repeated or at least some of the themes reemerge from previous stories, they are still with great value.Similar to \\"Stand By Me\\", in that, four boyhood friends bind by accident with a fifth (who has unique powers) in the early portion, it progresses into an \`all hell breaks loose' plot. Now the men, all adults, engage in an annual hunting ritual in the Maine woods, when an alien spacecraft crashes. Bring in the military! The consequences and unquestioned loyalty that emerges from these five men is dramatic and King presents it as absolutely normal, despite the unusual circumstances. King is good at bringing out the hero in his male characters. The plot is complex and the characters are real, so despite any time in the story when things seem like what they are, a wild twist emerges and King stings you again with a fantastic surprise. I won't even attempt to spoil you with details, but they are shocking.Friendship, loyalty, masculinity and humanity are the stars in this novel, despite the crazy military portions and the alien aspect. Of all of King's stories, I felt this to truly be one that pulls full circle with plot, characters and a well balanced conclusion. Mind you, it is suspenseful and gory as hell, but isn't that what Stephen King is all about?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"At the end of \\"Dreamcatcher\\", there's a note by Stephen King, saying he wrote this book not on a computer, but using a fountain pen, while he was recovering from his now famous accident - he was hit by a car while walking on his hometown in Maine. King was in contant physical discomfort and suffering pains in his hip. He wanted to call this novel \\"Cancer\\" and it was his wife that convinced him on the contrary.That is to say that King wrote \\"Dreamcatcher\\" while he was very angry, not only with the old man that run him over, but with life itself. And that shows in the beginning of the book. \\"Dreamcatcher\\" starts slowly, confused, purposelessly dark, and, first time with King's books - and I've read more than 20 of his books - with uninteresting characters. It seems SK was writing this one to get rid of his psychological pain - King himself showed us many times that this kind of pain is much worse than physical pain. One of the main characters, Jonesy, has suffered an accident very similar to King's and his hip has been broken as well. There's nothing wrong with writing things from personal experience, but in this case his writing style was shadowed by personal emotions. When the military people enter the scene, the book gets even more confusing and dark.But the second half of the book is the usual Stephen King, thank you very much. It's fast-paced, the characters get more real and interesting, and the story seems more solid. The four friends from the beginning are from Derry, and, to my delight there's a little connection with \\"IT\\", one of my favourite SK books. The ending is great. I felt, between the lines, that King was trying to apologyze to his constant readers for this unusual book, that he had to write this mostly for himself.Two different halves: the first, a tale like \\"body-snatchers\\", strange aliens coming to a barren snow-filled landscape in Maine; the second, a breath-stopping chase and the mind-battle between an alien and a human. The first half gets a 3-star, the second a 5-star rating.Grade 8.0/10"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I was reccomended by a friend to read &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;. I had always known about Stephen King but never read one of his books. I can gladly say I was not disappointed. I can say I loved, I can say I liked it, then why do I give it four stars? It is confusing and childish at the times when the men were boys. Otherwise it was a beautifully crafted book filled with heart and horror. An interesting technique in this book is that it is written in third person but switches points of view from section to section, giving scenes depth that is not found in other books. I liked it but i would not reccomend it for a first time King reader. Try &quot;The Shining&quot;, it is King at his finest with classic horror and genuine spookiness."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Knowing Stephen King, I thought I would find a wonderfully written novel with some supernaturality, but the book ended up being more gross than good. Well written, but not based on a very good story line. I would recommend choosing another King novel."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"THis had everything to be a great book about the good old alien theme. But King blew it.The friendship between the five characters is very touching, I really enjoyed it. But the book keep coming back and forth, the Kurtz character is so cliched, the flatulence stuff is atrocious, the ending is disappointing. And there's noc lear explanation to what will happen. And it takes so LONG to finally understand (more or less) how the aliens operate, how the fungus work and why there's that canibal worm.But King is such a master writer that even so I found myself reading it fast and anxious to reach the end."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As Stephen King gets older, his books get bigger, as seems to happen to most authors. Sometimes though, they fail to satisfy. This one did not.Coming off of his horrible accident where he was hit by a van, King included a lot of his pain and feelings of growing older in this book. It makes the book more personal, and more refreshing. There is the true Stephen King in the emotions of the characters.Being an alien invasion book, I enjoyed it too for it's unique spin on alien life, and how they might invade. I don't think this was overall as creepy as some of his other works have been, though this certainly had its moments.All that said, the book wasn't literary greatness, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It was a horror novel by King, and it was entertaining. I wasn't expecting anything but that.But I'm glad I read it. Well done."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Personally, I couldn't put this down. King's characterizing is awesome, and I read it so much that it snatched me from my life as Mr. Gray took Jonesy's! I really got to know these characters, and I felt like one of them every time I read. I chose picking this up over anything else, and spent countless hours reading it. My book was literally worn to shreds, and so much so that the cover fell off, along with the first 200 pages. It's that great."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"True, Stephen King had been hit by a van previous to this novel (you can see that some off his pain seeped in) and couldn't sit and concentrate for very long periods of time because of the pain, but this is still one of his worse novels. The story moves in a jerky way like a cats tail and seems to have very little of a point. The characters aren't fleshed out very well and sometimes you can't feel for them at all. The whole idea of aliens can be a bit stupid at times and the ending really makes the journey feel pointless and like you've wasted your time.Still, this book did hold my attention to the very end and it does deserve some credit."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"DREAMCATCHERAUTHOR: Stephen KingPUBLISHER: Simon &amp; SchusterREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: Stephen King writes another great novel about the macabre.Four boys come to the rescue of a Down's Syndrome boy.

The vast majority have provided me with hours of entertainment and sheer pleasure, with a few notable exceptions, ie; Tom Gordon, Gerald's Game. Unfortunately I have now added 'Dreamcatcher' to the DUD list. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book but became bored and then completely confused. Will someone please explain the ending to me? One minute Mr. Gray is controlling Jonsey's body and the next we are being told that he never existed? That it had something to do with Jonsey's accident and comatose state while in the hospital?? TOTALLY CONFUSED!I will continue to eagerly await any new novel by Stephen King and I will forever be a huge fan but I can't, in good conscience, recommend Dreamcatcher.I yearn for more books like 'The Talisman' which is and always has been my favourite."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This was the ABSOLUTE worst King book I have ever tried to read.

When King's next book comes out, I will wait a few weeks and check out the reviews on amazon."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Once again Stephen King delivered, with a book I could hardly put down. If it wasn't for my work, I probably wouldn't have. But even so I managed to get through the 600+ pages in less than a week. A very exciting story, with characters you get to care about, and characters that you loath. I must admit though that there were a few little areas where the story dragged, but on the whole it ranks up there with his best. I certainly cannot understand those reviewers who only gave it 1 or 2 stars. The final chase scene was very &quot;edge-of-yer-seat&quot; stuff. I sat up past midnight when I had to be up at 6, just to see how it ended. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars, is because there were other King novels I enjoyed more, such as &quot;The Stand&quot;, but I don't think that too many people will be disappointed with this story."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I could not take this book after 100 pages, this is not Stephen King as I know him.

Grade: D-"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This books starts well but ends with a fizzle. Stephen King obviously lost interest in the book. This book doesn't begin to compare with Hearts in Atlantis or Bag of Bones. If I didn't know better, I would think it was written by someone else. I wouldn't recommend this profane, grotesque, absurd story to anyone. If you have read or listened to the excerpts, you've heard the best parts of the book.

Yes, it's that bad."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I HAVE ALWAYS DISLIKED STEPHEN KING'S MOVIES BECAUSE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE JUST TOO GRUESOME.

I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK IN MY CAR TO FINISH LISTENING TO THIS BOOK. I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY WITH THE CAR RUNNING JUST TO CONTINUE LISTENING TO THIS NOVEL. IT IS EVOKES SO MANY EMOTIONS AND SOME OF THE PARTS ARE SO FUNNY!!! I WOULD NEVER BELEIVE THAT STEPHEN KING HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR FROM HIS MOVIES. HOLLYWOOD MUST HAVE ELIMINATED MOST OF THE HUMOUR AND WENT STRATIGHT FOR THE MACABRE."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Don't get me wrong. I love Steve King and have read everything he has published. Have been reading him since 1975. But I found this overly-long novel a poorly-rendered work filled with characters hashed-out and remasked from many of King's earlier works.You'll find many references, directly and indrectly, to King's past works ('IT', 'Tom Gordern', 'The Stand') to name just a few, while the plot reworks common King-y-ing themes of good-vs-evil. We have seen this book before: It's 'IT', it's 'The Stand', it's 'Tommy Knockers', it's 'Firestarter' among others. But while it's often fun to find half-vieled references to former plots and characters in King's books, in Dreamcatcher it's just too blatant to be fun.Finally, King so way overplays the sympathy angle with the Autistic Savant (it's Tom Cullen from 'The Stand', playing a version of 'Charlie' with the powers of Dead Zone's 'Johnny Smith') and the evil school-boys (remember them from 'Sometimes They Come Back') that I couldn't wait to end the agony of the read by skimming the last several hundred pages of this volumnious tome.Still, I'll forgive SK for a few bad apples like DreamCatcher, knowing that his next book will have to be better."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King's latest novel gets an E for effort. I reached the dreaded 50 page mark (the point where I say &quot;read on&quot; or &quot;give up&quot;) and didn't even notice it. The books starts out fast and continues to hammer away until the very end. I don't know about you, but I don't like a book that skates along at such a fast pace that after you finished you wonder what happened. The characters were pasted together with such haste that I rooted for them the way I would root for the United States water polo team: because I'm supposed to. I liked the fact that the aliens are really a second kind of alien hidding in the first alien's body (it was the only part of the book that made me stop and think). The basis of the story is about people that form a relationship at an early age and become bound by something that happens to them at that said early age (been there done that). King started out with a great idea and then rushed to get the thing finished. I can't forgive him because he is Stephen King. I am eagerly awaiting his next book &quot;From a Buick 8&quot; because he gave a little of the book away in &quot;On Writing&quot;. I have to say I wasn't really dying to buy &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; because I didn't really know anything about it (except for those stupid Time.com things on King's website)so I wasn't that disapointed. Is my readership in the balance if King trys to fool me with his next novel? No, even if the story is foggy and the characters sketchy, I still love the way this guy writes. If your a King fan you have to buy it (you might want to wait for the paper back though). If your not a King fan don't waste you time with this one. Unless you are one of the naysayers who don't like King and are just slobbering over yourself to find a stinker to pounce on so you can say &quot;See I told you he stinks&quot;."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Over the last year or so, I've read &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; and &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;. I saw a review - can't remember where - that said &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; was kind of &quot;It&quot; meets &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;, so I went back: read &quot;It&quot; again (still not a great book, too long, too messy, too much of a dip in the middle), read &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; for the first time (a complete mess but, in retrospect, sort of interesting, actually).As with every recent Stephen King, everything starts off well. The first maybe 100 pages rocks along at a cracking pace. As long as you don't quite know what to expect (even though, of course, you know exactly what to expect), everything is good. Everything is fine. Stephen King is very good at suggesting the outline of something unsettling in the dark. The problems begin when he takes out his torch and shines it directly into the space you were busy filling with horrible things. As soon as you know what is actually hiding there, the tension (admirably created by the opening of this book, and the opening of &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, and the opening of &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;) evaporates.The problem - the main problem - with Stephen King's novels (and &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; in particular) is that nothing is ever enough. You take a central premise - a stranger disturbs a hunting party up in the woods - and add UFOs, grey aliens, parasites that grow in your intestines and eat their way out, insane government men, telepathy, bacteria that travels on the air like pollen, Russian suicides and disabled psychics among other things (and I do mean amongst other things - I'm chipping the &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; iceberg here). Nothing is ever enough.The full story (centred, I suppose, albeit haphazardly, around the four men that make up the hunting party) skips back to when the adults were kids themselves (in much the same way that &quot;It&quot; does). Which means that - with all the skipping back and forth between characters and epochs - you have something resembling a trip to Tralfalmadore with Kilgore Trout (without Vonnegut's knack for keeping complexity simple).All of which (I was going to say) makes for an experience closer to Ed Wood or William Castle than (and here is my problem: who is genuinely scary? who figures at the other end of the scale? The only half scary book I've chanced across recently was Mark Danielewski's &quot;House of Leaves&quot; but you can't hold that up as a comparison. Or can you? The thing is, importantly, Danielewski takes risks and Stephen King does not . . . So maybe it's that. Ed Wood and William Castle on one side and risk on the other.)Years ago, Stephen King said (re - &quot;Pet Sematery&quot;) that he wrote about what frightened him. I don't think that is true any longer. I don't think Stephen King is scared of aliens from space or bacteria that produce parasites in your belly. Which makes &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; a sort of hollow unworthy experience, typical of every recent Stephen King novel you could care to mention."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I hate to say it but this book stank. Not that Mr. King's writing style is bad, I just suppose I want REAL EARTHBOUND SUPERNATURAL TERROR! Mr. King, leave the psycho and alien storylines alone please!

I found the referenced to his accident funny and a little creepy. I could not put the book down and read it in 3 days!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is much improved over the last several novels by Mr. King; It is exciting without being grotesque, entertaining without the inclusion of injuries and crimes against children, and certainly worth the time spent reading it and the money spent buying it; HOWEVER, Mr. King inserts a few of his own opinions regarding our last presidential election and these opinions detract from and diminish the book. Perhaps he is forgetting that half the voters in this country voted for each candidate, or perhaps he doesn't mind alienating half his readers. The fact is, Mr. King is an author, not a national leader or opinion maker or policy setter and if the public wants to know his political views, we'll ask. As for me, I've bought my last King novel."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I guess I'll be the first to pan this monstrosity. The first two hundred pages weren't bad, not scary, not thrilling, but not good either. Then the book started to fall apart for me and continued to bore me until, for the first time ever reading a Stephen King novel (and I have read them all and loved most) - I STOPPED reading and gave up. I didn't care about the characters (a very poor imitation of &quot;The Loser's Club&quot;), I didn't care where the story was going - where did it go anyway? Big disappointment for me as I am a big fan of King's. Not since INSOMNIA have I hated one of his books so much. I found it boring, wandering, illogical, and very UN-scary. The theme has all been done and been done better. King was way off this time. Maybe that Waterman pen he used sprang a leak."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Don't read this book even if the first 200 pages catches your attention.

Total waste of time."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King has done exactly what I wanted him to do . . . tell me a story. The subject matter was complex and done with a deft hand and the Down's syndrome was handled with courage and integrity.

I can't help but think if I were to wander through any of the locations he has written about, I would run into his &quot;characters&quot; in flesh and blood.

First is his best work - &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, and &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;. On the other side is his worst stuff - &quot;Firestarter&quot;, &quot;Cujo&quot;, and &quot;Gerald's Game&quot;. Most of the rest of his work falls into the third group - stories that are good but not great, or novels that King wrote on a day when he wasn't feeling quite up to snuff.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; falls into this middle category. The plot moves along in a straight line (more or less), and the four main characters (Henry, Jonesy, Pete, and the Beaver - YES, the Beaver) keep the story moving well enough. But the whole idea, physiology, and purpose of the aliens is extremely confusing. Aside from the fact that they wanted to wipe out humanity, I'm not sure I understood anything about them.King doesn't do science fiction/horror that often, but he can and has done better - witness &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;. Coming as this does on the heels of &quot;On Writing&quot;, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"5- The military men who are in charge of the cleansing operation against the Extraterrestrials reveal themselves as brutes, beasts, led by a crazy man who has decided that his objective is to kill all the ETs, all the human beings who have been infected or who have witnessed the operation, including women and children, then all the soldiers who have taken part in the operation, except maybe some of his elite tropps, when it is not only himself. Many references are done to other operations of the type : Haiti, Bosnia, Croatia, Irak, etc. This is a strong criticism of the US armed forces and of their objectives. How can such bodies of people have wandered away from any ethical values ? And even the only one who is going to be instrumental in the final epiphanic chase, does it only because of an old and deep feeling of guilt coming back from his childhood. He is not good , he is just trying to repair his old badness . This theme is of course common in Stephen King's books. It is the famous Shop. Or is the very starting point of The Stand (military experimentations on biological warfare) or in The Talisman (the nuclear research in Nevada). But here it is pushed to an extreme limit that is absolutely frightening. And is there any escape or redemption possible ?6- The book is strongly anti-republican by the clear and repeated criticism of a certain narrowly elected President. He is rejected as an opportunist who never tells the truth but only manuipulates the masses. This is particularly disquieting. How can supreme power in the US lay in the hands of a man who is shown as a puppet, a dangerous puppet. This has some antecedent in The Dead Zone, but the antidote is never to be found in the present book : the antidote of the press, the free press, like in The Dead Zone or in Firestarter, to quote two books. In fact the rare visions of radio people given at one particular time in the book is that of irresponsible people totally dominated by the ambition to please their audiences even if it creates a panic. That is quite different from the vision we had at the beginning of The Stand, of an anchorwoman who dies in her studio, killed by military forces, but who goes on, till the end, giving what she thinks is the truth. In this book those irresponsible radio-jockeys are not even reprimended by anyone. They are free to be irresponsible. At this level the book regresses on many other books.7- The influence of the cinema is extremely important in this book. It seems to be a rewriting, or a remake of many not films but genres of films : the science-fiction of the fifties and teh sixties with the systematic invading extraterrestrials, and the western films of Ennio Morricone or Clint Eastwood. Two characters are informed by such a deep knowledge of such films : one is one of our heroes, and the other is one military man who will end up very badly. These constant film references give to the book a very attractive value : we are introduced to a world of knowledge that enables those who know those films to get a new pleasure out of their knowledge and the book : the second level of reading that is thus introduced. This has commonly been used in Stephen King's books, though most of the time it was more references to pop music like in Christine for example. This strong emphasis on \`pop'-cinema is new. But at times, and this is totally willed and desired, the narrow limit between film-fiction and reality is erased and some characters are directly taken out of such films and behave like the characters of these films.To conclude, we have to say that Stephen King is entirely on one line : urban paranoia. He explained this concept in length in Danse Macabre. But here he puts it into action from beginning to end. This cuts the world into two halves : the good Americans and the bad ones (anything that is bad and cannot thus be American). And the aim of the good ones is to destroy the bad ones, and vice versa at times. But this is short of The Stand where the bad ones were destroyed thanks to a christian sacrifice of some good ones and thanks to the very destructive forces this sacrifice brought out among the bad ones. The destruction came from inside with the intercession of the christian martyrs. Here nothing of the type. Just plain conquest on the bad side, destruction on the bad side, and the answer to this destruction is also to destroy on the good side. But there is nothing Christian in this book. Bad versus Good and that is all, and to the finish. Of course Good succeeds. But why and how ? That is the book. You'll have to read it if you want to discover the answer to this final question.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Parid Universities II and IX."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"You know, if you look for something, you are going to find it. Obviously noone in here read The Plant, his ebook. King did not write this off of his accident and set all kinds of examples relating to it. This is the old king coming back for another round. If you liked green mile and his other low-gore, low-violence type books, then stick with those! Dont try to venture over into kings true dominating territory!! Sheesh!! King did an excellent job in this book, and I will read it again!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I hated it. Bad plot, poorly delivered, terrible book. SK has written some really good books, but this one was so bad I have not read another SK since. I do not believe would even be published if unknown author. Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Being a big fan of Stephen King, and having read nearly everything he's ever published, I picked up Dreamcatcher on the day it hit the bookstores. At almost 600 pages it looked to be good value for my money, but I'm warning every King fan who's contemplating buying this book: it's the worst one he's ever written. Take a heavy dose of Tommyknockers, add in a little It mixed with second-rate science fiction (that's trying to be a mix between Alien and Close Encounters of the Third Kind but fails miserably) and you have a very tired-feeling Stephen King novel. If you've read any of the above-mentioned books (or seen any of the films), don't buy this book. And if you haven't, don't do it anyway. Read The girl who loved Tom Gordon or Pet Sematary instead."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"No, but seriously, Stephen is the King of cheese-moving. He moves more cheese than a rat in a Winnebago, know what I'm saying?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I really like Mr. King. I have read nearly all his books, and devoured them all. But for some reason, this story just doesn't get off the ground. It has a great story idea, but no real direction and no real plot. I found myself dragging myself through the pages in hopes that it would get better. I have to say that I was extremely dissappointed in the story. Sorry horror fans, but this was a flop"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a very large fan of Stephen King. I enjoy all of his novels. I read this book and I got out of it what I wanted. However, there were a few parts that he could have elaborated on. Somehow, I just thought that he could have made the flashbacks a little more elaborate so that the reader could fully understand the details that are very important in this novel."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I originally rated this book a strong 2 but since Amazon's censors did not publish that review, I now have rethought my rating into a very weak 1.That's not to say that this would change if we were using the old fashioned alpha grading system, in which case I'd have to give this a resounding D-.We see in this novel King falling back on many tired and irritating stereotypes, the kind that Hollywood still likes to pander to the public as part of their empty dream factory -- namely, that all psychotic paramilitary types are Jesus freaks. This so old that it is laughable, if it didn't hurt so much that the publishers want so much dough for this lousy book.The story was trite and also did not go anywhere. Many hundred of pages were initially devoted to rambling stream of consciousness dreck, none of it making any sense, and most of it emphasizing trivial concepts and attachments. The characters were also too unbelievable, too goody-two-shoes. I sensed that perhaps Stephen King was trying to imitate Dean Koontz's style, and doing a banged up job of it too!This all combines to make this book the year's most immemorable performance by the late grand master of horror fiction. I'm glad I reviewed this from a borrowed library copy and did not go out to purchase this tome. Yuck!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is a real page-turner and hard to put down. Thank-you Stephen King for many hours of enjoyable reading!

He was in pain as a result of his near-fatal accident, and he even wrote the book in long hand. The result is a journey into King's heart of darkness, a claustrophobic trip in extremely close proximity with an intelligent alien virus. This is stripped-down King, relying on his natural story-telling skills and love of language. While not as polished as, say, BAG OF BONES, this novel is effective at what it attempts, and it is so crammed with raw horror that you get the feeling the whole thing is going to come apart at the seams and splatter you with...well, you get the picture. King guts it out, and the end product ain't pretty, but for King's fans, it's a trip to horror heaven--by way of cancerous hell. Even playing hurt, he turned out a winner, like the pro he is. Thank God we didn't lose him."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Okay, I have read almost all of Stephen Kings book and have enjoyed almost all of them. Books that deal with aliens and UFO's are not my favorite books to read. The only way I would read one those books is if Stephen King wrote it. This was a good book, it got me interested and it kept building the suspense so I was eagerly turning the pages to see what would happen next. Not his best book but it should be read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Nowadays Stephen King bashing seems to be in vogue, especially among fans of his earlier books (those written in the 70s and 80s). While I would go so far as to agree that SK circa 2002 is not the Golden Age SK of a fifteen or so years ago there is still more talent in one of his little fingers than a horde of your average horror writers. King still has that uncanny knack of transporting you from your humdrum environment into the world of his imagination. Obviously that is the job of all writers of fiction, especially in the SF/horror/fantasy genre, but how many of them can do it as effectively as King?One particular aspect of Dreamcatcher that I really like is the humor, the way jokes, satire and witticisms are woven into the story, the novel gave me a good laugh from time to time without becoming entirely farcical. There are also some thoughtful passages about the nature of friendship and what it means to be human. Those who are just looking for a good scare will also find gruesome scenes of the alien \\"weasels\\" making their spectacular exits from their human hosts, and an alien's ghastly methods death dealing. The battle for supremacy in the host body between Jonesy and the alien Mr. Gray is also tremendous entertainment.My only complaint is that the novel is something of a retread, King has done something similar before, in IT (friends against weird monster) and Tommyknockers (aliens). This is what prevents it form attaining \\"classic King\\" status it is too short on originality for that, but then it would be unreasonable to expect that every novel he writes is a classic. All I ever ask of him his sheer entertainment and II got my money worth in that department!.As far as this SK fan is concerned Dreamcatcher has enough merits of its own to justify its existence, and for Mr. King to keep writing more novels for as long as he is able."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I understand the author was not going through his best time when he wrote this book but I was very disapointed: the characters are not specially well developed (I hardly got to know any of them at all by the novel) and the aliens did not seem at all interesting, or scary, or fun even. Hope Black House brings back Mr. King as I formerly knew him."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King is my hero. At least four of his books occupy my top ten list of best books of all time and he deserves every bit of the success he's garnered. DREAMCATCHER is one of the fastest moving books he's ever done. It is a gruesome tale of aliens among us and the military's take-no-prisoners response to them. But it is also the story of a friendship between a group of men and a boy with Down's Syndrome and their unique psychic bond. King pulls out all the stops with this book and along with his usual depth of character it is one of the most action packed books he's ever done. An exciting, and harrowing blend of sci fi and horror. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I gave up on this book at page 124.It is coarse and the characters are not very interesting. The story seemed to be heading in the alien abduction direction, but I found I did not care enough about any of the characters to bother reading further to see what might happen. I have seen this book compared to &quot;The Stand,&quot; which was a very compelling read, and I cannot understand why unless a whole lot more happened beginning with page 125!If you have an interest in owning &quot;Dreamcatcher,&quot; I suggest you check a copy out at the library first to make sure it's something you want to read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As a huge fan of early Stephen King works, I had heard that this was so much like &quot;IT&quot; and &quot;The Stand&quot; and so I was excited about reading it. In my opinion it was totally vulgar and I don't think that all that vulgarity was necessary to create the story. I found the book to be confusing as well, towards the end. There were times when I had to stop reading it as I felt sick to my stomach....maybe that's a good thing??!! King is still in my opinion an extremly great writer but I thinkat times he tries too hard to be gross. All in all, I was disappointed...hopefully the next one will be better..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I wish the man would just tell the damn story. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book--bought it the first day it was available, made no week-end plans, announced that carry-out food only would be served for the following days while I plunged into the pleasure of a Stephen King. About halfway through the book I gave up--a major yawn and somewhat irritating to try to read. I imagine Hell to be a road trip with this book being on the tape deck."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As a fan of Stephen King for over 20 years, I bought this bookwith high expectations but have been heartily disappointed by it. Across between &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; and &quot;Invasion of theBodysnatchers,&quot; &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; chronicles the tiredworld of ET's attempting to take over the world. Two-dimensionalcharacters do not help the story. I knew and cared about every singlecharacter in &quot;The Stand&quot; but I kept getting the relativelyfew characters in &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; mixed up. Stephen King'sfascination with secret government operations is also gettingold.This book reads like a first draft and lacks the carefulcharacterizations and brilliant plots of books like &quot;TheTalisman,&quot; &quot;The Shining&quot;, and so many of King's earlyworks. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've been a fan of Stephen King since I was maybe eight or nine years old....He's produced work that I consider to be right up there with the best I've ever read: THE STAND, IT, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE SHINING. He's also done some stuff that I consider dreadfully bad: THE TOMMYKNOCKERS (One of my most-hated books ever....) and BAG OF BONES. I remember when IT was being written, and King was talking up the fact that he was done writing, and that after IT, he was headed into retirement. IT arrived, King took a break, and then he was back, in full force. But.....he seemed different. And there was a rumor that he did, indeed, retire....and that his Wife, Tabitha, was writing under his name now. And no matter how far-fetched that may seem, no matter how much I know it's JUST a rumor.....a part of me wonders. Because, in my opinion, King was a different beast after IT. His novels fell victim to a kind of bloat, getting larger and larger, but losing the crisp focus he always had, even in mammoth books like IT and THE STAND. The King is not dead, but he's never been as good as he was back in his glory days. And DREAMCATCHER is, sadly, not the comeback I've been waiting for. It's a novel sorely in need of an Editor, and there's none in sight.The story is fairly standard King: Lifelong friends (A group that's been inseparable since childhood), strange, evil menace (Aliens), psychotic authority figure (The military forces sent to clean up that botched Alien invasion), handicapped Christ figure (The Deus Ex Machina \\"Duddits\\", who is part underdeveloped character, part lazy plot device), and my favorite overused King device, the nasty teen-aged thug/bully who figures heavily in some traumatic childhood memory. It probably sounds like I hated DREAMCATCHER, which isn't exactly true.....It was certainly a chore to read at some points, true. A sharp Editor could have probably trimmed a good three-hundred pages off of this whopper (It weighs in at 621 pages!), and it takes FOREVER to get going, a problem that is compounded by the fact that there were NO characters that I liked in the least. The psychotic Kurtz is straight out of the Snidley Whiplash school of mustache-twirling, and didn't ring true for one second, the gang of four that we're supposed to love and fear for were a bunch of whiny, unsympathetic puppets going through their paces, and the Christly Duddits seemed to exist only as a plot device, there to explain the things King couldn't have passed off otherwise. There were bits here and there that I enjoyed, such as the brief wink King gives Pennywise The Clown, or the way he ties the book in with the events at the conclusion of IT, but otherwise, DREAMCATCHER, much like THE TOMMYKNOCKERS, just seemed to be a self-indulgent vanity project. I am, in King's words, a \\"Constant Reader\\", so I'll be back, hoping for better next time........."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"How does he do it? This was the second best King book I ever read (The Stand was my favorite). Buy it, cherish it, you will love it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher has some lovely moments: The touching and funny description of Beaver, the scene where the teen heros discuss why Derry seems to be so forgetful about it's dead and missing kids, the memorial to all of Pennywise's victims, and the death of poor McCarthy. Only King could take flatulence and belching and turn them in terror. But the lovely moments are too few and far between. I wanted to love this book but I didn't. For the first time in my life I actually had skip whole sections of a Stephen King novel. The character of Kurtz, and the soldiers in general never came alive. Kurtz is just a stock villain--the crazy military man straight out of central casting. Duddits is too much like a remix of the ... character form The Stand. I kept expecting him to start spelling m-o-o-n everytime he spoke. The S weasels are very scary but the gray aliens are too much like the Tommyknockers. It's a very mixed bag. I'd give it 2 and half stars if I could. If you love Stephen King buy the book. If you've never read King before please don't pick this book as your introduction. Go back and check out the Shinning, Carrie or Salem's Lot."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Has Stephen King lost his touch? This is a terrifying space-age novel written by Stephen King. I'm a big fan of King and this is the first of his works that I have read that have disappointed me. The first couple hundred pages are very tough to read. After that the story starts the suspenfullness that you would expect from a Stephen King novel. After about I was halfway through the book I was starting to lose my intrest in it. The story seemed to be rushed out and King did not let the characters develope. The whole novel was a great story but his thoughts seemed to be mixed up in a way that I don't expect them to be by King. I really enjoyed reading Tommyknockers and some of his earlier works. If you plan on reading a Stephen King novel for the first time I would recommend you try some of his earlier works."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I love Steven King! This novel, however, was a disappointment. I could not wait for it to arrive and begin reading it. It started off great and then for about two hundred or more pages it really dragged on and on. I was determined to finish the book to the end but it took me a very long time to get to that point. I found it confusing and boring for two thirds of it; gripping and exciting for one third of it. The plot had so much more potential but something was definitely missing. I was delighted to see that Mr. King chose a young man with special needs to be the hero, that in itself was a great thing. Thank you for that Mr. King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have to say that when we got the advance copy of Dreamcatcher in the bookstore where I work, I could hardly wait to read it. I was truly excited that King was finally returning to his roots and his fans with supernatural horror, always his strong point. The size of the book didn't daunt me--I thought it would be 700 pages of greatness! Color me WRONG. I tried to like the book. I kept reading long after I lost interest and emotional involvement. But in the end, I had to quit 200 pages short of the end. I don't know how this book ends, so I can't ruin it for you. But I have to warn you--I don't CARE how this book ends. If you're a die-hard King fan, wait till it comes out in paperback, then it might be worth your money. But for now, just wait. And don't get too excited over it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"All of Mr. King's work's are good; some are better than others.

The story is complex, the references to earlier works (IT, TOMMYKNOCKERS) are plentiful to the point that a casual reader will think he's missed something. Still I enjoyed it (as I enjoy them all), but I would not recommend this as a place to start if you're not already a diehard King fan."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King is back and better than ever with Dreamcatcher. Not only does he re-enter the world of horror like only he can do, he's also woven several mysteries into this incredible new novel. And, there's NOTHING like Mr. King's humor - subtle, but always, always there. I shuddered at the description of Jonsey's accident - obviously a throw back to the author's near brush with death, and all the little clues only avid King fans will recongise are strewn through. I can't begin to say how happy I am that he's back!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"A cast of diverse characters plus a potential Armageddon. Sound like The Stand?Get set to be disappointed. Dreamcatcher follows suit with today's popular adventure story formula: Flawed but brave hero(ine/s) up against evil must overcome physical and mental pain in order to save the entire human race. And maybe eat some bacon on the way.What I want in a book is a new idea, or flawless execution of a timeless idea. This book provides neither. Average suspense, average surprise, average conflict. And I feel that King tries to manipulate empathy from his readers by giving the protagonists mental and physical ailments.There is a wonderful layering of &quot;bad guys,&quot; each with their own malevolent agenda. It is impossible to rank one over the rest, for each villan ranges in motivation, insanity, depth, and intensity. The bad part is that the &quot;good guys&quot; are hard to rank too, so it reads somewhat impassively.But, I have been a die-hard Stephen King fan for 15 years, and I relate to his writing style and voice as if he were an erratic but well-meaning pen pal. Pick it up for some cheap thrills--it is a quick read, and there are a half-dozen glorious little images and asides."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"One of the most respected authors in literature today has crafted for us a cunning novel of Nightmares and Psycological terros through a tale of alien invasion.When Beav, Henry, Pete, and Jonesy, (friends since childhood, linked together in ways they are only beginning to understand) go into the woods on their annual hunting trip, they are unaware that they will soon be fighting for their lives, their minds, and thier planet.The first quarter of the book reads a little slow, but is needed to set up the strange link the freinds share and to connect us emotionally with the characters. At first galnce i was terrified that Mr. King had &quot;borrowed&quot; the basic plot from the movie &quot;Alien&quot; and had turned it into a book based on earth. However, after reading further the story evolves into a disturbing portrayle of the human psyche and its fight to survive - despite the odds.Kings use of a constant theme - dreams - helps to easily interconnect the different characters and their experiences, and to help make this one of the most original extraterrestrial stories thet i've come across.Though not as wonderfull as some of Kings earlier novels (see The Tommyknockers) it was still a pleasure to read... and grip."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a long time Stephen King reader but confess that I stopped reading for a while due to what I termed 'formulamatic' endings.

Dreamcatcher starts well (as do many of Stephen's books) and is quite interesting and gripping.

It was written by Stephen king and is one of his many science fiction books. The story takes place in current times and the setting spreads from suburban areas to deep in the woods. The author uses excellent descriptions which allow you to visualize the scene as if you were there. The interaction that the main characters have with the setting makes the book even easier to imagine by putting the readers in situation that they have personally been in. All of these factors make the book more enjoyable to read.The setting is not the only well developed factor of the story. Much time was also put into the development of all the stories characters. Each and every character could be looked at as a real person and if u saw them on the street you could walk up to them and have a conversation with them. Most of the characters are friendly and have you rooting for them in the end but a few just get under your skin and have you hoping that there future is not great. Overall the characters are well handled and are a contributing factor to the greatness of the book.The most important feature of the book is of course the plot. The plot of this book would have to be one of my favorites. It feature the adventures of childhood friendsAnd spans to one final endeavor that will prove what friendship really is. It features everything from hunting to special force to aliens and many other things.

(Cujo, the shining, pet semetary, it, misery, the secret window, and even more.)This book does a great job at getting you attached to the characters, even though half of the main ones get killed at around the middle of the book. I even got kind of attached to one of the bad guys, the alien named Mr.Gray.In this book four friends who annually go on their hunting trip up in Maine, go this year when they are all about 38 years old, and this time things start going very bad when a stranger wanders in, carrying an \\"implant\\" made by aliens. he ends up getting 2 of the main characters killed, including himself. But it was his \\"implant\\" that kills, him which is living. a great book with a great plot and great cast of characters."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I had pretty much given up on King when I read Dreamcatcher, and the first third (to about chapter 9) did not encourage me. The first third seems to be trying to become another IT, with multiple characters and viewpoints, all converging on their relationship to one special character. It was overcomplicated and unwieldy, and it seems King got fed up with it, and went postal on the story, resulting in the hideous gross-out that many of you may have heard of, which has a side-benefit of reducing the number of characters the story has to deal with.Fortunately, once he got this out of his system, the story settles down, and the next two thirds of the book read like one of his early novels. King, because of his accident, says he was forced to abandon his laptop computer and write the story longhand, on yellow, lined, legal pads, and he says that this forced him to pre-edit the story as he went along, leaving fewer mistakes that needed fixing. It really shows. The prose is smoother, the characters seem to be cared for, the situations seem more vivid and three-dimensional. Others have complained that it's merely a chase-story, but it's a well told and involving chase story. After years of apathetic, sloppily told stories from King, the most recent atrocities being BAG OF BONES and THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, I was really surprised to find myself enjoying a story of his again, \\"falling through the hole in the page\\" as King would put it. So, if you can read past the juvenile gross-out (you'll know it when you see it) and meet Mr. Gray and Kurtz, I think that you'll enjoy this book, even if you've found King's stuff since MISERY to be pretty consistently garbage."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The setup for \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is sooooooo perfect.

A real stinker. I couldn't STOP LAUGHING from this point on. And the FARTS OF DOOM are a recurring occurence throughout the story. I never knew King was so adept at toilet humor.Then I went back and read \\"The Shining\\" and it still scared the crap out of me. Oh Stephen, you've lost your touch."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King spins an amazing tale that involves four childhood friends- Henry, Pete, Beaver, and Jonsey, who came together to save a boy with down syndome named Duddits, from getting beat up by local bullies. Ever since that time in their lives, they have been connected by the uncanny psychic powers that they gained in return, which they all refer to as &quot;seeing the line&quot;. As the years pass, they are slowly split apart by their own problems, but always manage to come together once a year for their annual huting trip in the Maine woods. At first, the trip seemed like any other that they had taken for years. Unfortunately, things in their lives would change forver, when they are snowed in by an unexpected blizzard, and an injured man named Richard McCarthy stumbles into their camp rambling about lights in the sky and being scared out of his mind...Stephen King is not my favorite author, but I have read enough of his books to realize that some are better than others. Dreamcatcher is one of his best books, and I am very suprised at the amount of people that disliked this book. Dreamcatcher reads at an incredibly fast pace. The book is almost 900 pages long, and I read it in two days. I literally could not put it down. King combines a wonderful coming of age story, with a terrifying alien invasion. If I had to describe this book in one line, it would be &quot;IT&quot; meets &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;. The story unfolds brilliantly. The focus of the story keeps switching back and forth between the four friends' childhood with Duddits, and the current situation that they are in. This involves the alien invasion, and an insane Army Colonel named Abraham Kurtz whose only mission is to destroy the aliens, and take everyone down with him. King uses amazing character development and outstanding dialogue. As the story unfolds, you come to like to each character equally. But the reason the book really succeeds, is that the main characters are not immune from danger. You see the characters you have come to love actually going through pain, torment, and mental anguish. This provides for unbelieveable suspense, because no one is safe. Due to outstanding dialougue, the book can also be quite funny at times as well, which makes the story enjoyable overall.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is one of the best books that I have ever read. The characters, suspense, humor, and overall terror that this book brings will amaze you. This remains one of the only books that I wanted to start reading again immediately after I finished."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Knowing the again rising reputation and writing talent of Stephen King, I decided to take a shot at reading Dreamcatcher (did not see movie). The story promised a very gutsy plot. As I read on I became slightly bored with the story that didn't seem to be going anywhere. Then all of a sudden, about 1/2 way through the book, the plot weaves more suspense.Boyhood friends from Maine visit the cabin known as Hole in the Wall for one of their annual jaunts. All 4 boys have grown up with differing problems in their midlife crises. Enter a stranger McCarthy and one begins to get the idea of an alien invasion of his body. And then a woman in the middle of the road...another victim of alien invasion...and mental horrors produced by these alien beings who aren't very huge in size --- weasel-like creatures, but they can do a heck of a number in a human's body. Incorporated into this writing is King's own addictions and the first book he has written since his near-fatal accident.Although mid-average entertainment, this story does not challenge the reader to turn pages fast --- there have been better King writings. A character named &quot;Duddits&quot; with Down's Syndrome is the focus of a psychic connection between the four main players. This book is an average novel and a very confusing read with wimpy military involvement!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I think I have read just about every book by Stephen King and I will admit that sometimes his endings are lacking. But this book was ridiculous. I had no idea what the book was about. I mean I had an idea but it had one of the worst story line Ive ever seen. I just didnt see the point of the book. He should have cut it down and made a really short story of it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For this book to be so huge, i was pleasantly surprised when the first chapter got right into the story, and juicy horror. However, the exciting horror at first doesn't linger long.It starts off briefly describing our main characters, then gets right into the horror, and plot, but then a new (and unscary) story begins, then another....and finally the shocking conclusion.Although this might not be as scary, or as well written as some of King's work, it is very exciting read, and will provide you with days of juicy entertainment."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King is not the master of horror; he is the master of empathy.The thing I found most intriguing about what few King books I've read is that while they're frightening, the books take while to get to the trademarked cataclysmic doom.\\"Dreamcatcher\\" is no different.Four friends in high school, Jonesy, Pete, Henry, and Joe \\"The Beaver\\", displayed an amazing act of courage once. Seeing a kid with Down's Syndrome being harassed horribly, they came to his rescue and became his friend. This changed them in ways they were not fully aware of.Years later, the four boy are in their mid-thirties. They haven't completely fallen out of touch, making phone calls every now and then and always congregating in Maine for their annual hunting trip. On this year, something is very different and very wrong.While Henry and Pete are out getting supplies, the Beav and Jonesy do a little hunting. Jonesy nearly shoots a man on accident and tehn discovers that the man is disoriented and sickly. Concerned, he and the Beav take him in. Of course, it hits the fan not long after this.Without giving much away, people die. This is a Stephen King book, after all. The difference is, King makes you care about the characters first, making the deaths meaningful. It's not a terribly frightening book, but it is gripping. The 900 pages fly right by, only faltering at one or two points and even then only momentarily.People have said this rips off classic horror/sci-fi films like \\"Alien\\" and \\"The Thing\\" (which are, of course, rip-offs of sci-fi/horror films from the '50's), but forget to include \\"Outbreak\\" to the list. I don't feel that King stole in any way from them, but you do get similar feelings of revulsion and shock as you did from such films.\\"Dreamcatcher\\" is a thrilling book throughout, sometimes frightening, sometimes touching, occasionally hilarious (\\"BACON SANDWICH! WITH MAYO!\\"), and always disconcerting. For a good read, pick this up. If you're new to King, while this isn't a bad place to start, \\"The Stand\\" is a little closer to King's normal horror archetype.And remember -- Sit tight!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I bought this book almost a year ago and after getting a hundred or so pages into it, I just couldn't read it anymore, I thought it was pretty boring. Then a couple of months ago I decided to pick it back up. I started from the beginning and got way more out of it the second time, then I couldn't put it down. I have no idea how I thought it was boring. The story was always interesting. This book made me pay a little more attention while deer hunting. If you want a good, but long, read then pick up Dreamcatcher."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"After Hearts in Atlantis and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I was a little reluctant to plunk down another 28 bucks for a King book. I was pleasantly suprised by this book though. It was like the old Stephen King that I know and love! This book is a good one! Interesting, good story line, just enough thrills and gore to keep you reading and scarey enough to keep you from hanging your feet over the edge of the bed.I was afraid that he had lost his &quot;umph&quot; after the last 2 fiascos but take heart King fans! He's baaaaack!!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have never considered myself a Stephen King fan. Always thinking his writing had been degrading itself into antiquated and cliche stories. You read one King novel, you read them all. Well, after picking up Dreamcatcher the other day I have seen the error of my ways. It's the first book in nearly a year that's grabbed me and made me read it's pages. This is by far the most absorbing book I've read in a long while. Don't listen to the reviews you see in magazines like Entertainment Weekly. This book is incredible. Even if your only a psuedo King fan, this book will not let you stop reading it. Hit the &quot;Buy Now&quot; Button right after you read this.....you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book was recommended by a friend, haven't read it yet, but it was so cheap, how can I go wrong?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It feels like I just ran the Boston Marathon in my head. The 879 pages steered me away for a long time. I decided to read this saga because I purchased it for almost nothing. It's a decent original story about extraterrestrials attempting to subvert humanity and just plain being very naughty. The dialogue and slang of the characters can be confusing and hard to follow at times. There is an unnecessary amount of multilayered backstory which, tends to make the story just drag along. Once the \\"NeverEnding car chase Story\\" is over the conclusion provides lackluster answers to questions readers will have throughout the book.I can't understand why many of King's books are so long? There are potentially two separate stories here. Do his editors need to be paid more to stop giving two thumbs up on final rough drafts? In this day and age it's hard for people to commit so much of their time to one thing. King should write shorter books and if he has more to say write a sequel. I would only recommend this book to speed readers. The fact there is an epilogue proves only King really understood Duddits and Mr. Gray. The reader doesn't get it so Daddy has to try explaining it. An exhausting read and just like the movie I was left somewhat bewildered."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This had to be one of Stepehn Kings slowest, most boring, most complicated books and was by far the most torturous to read.The first part of the book intruduces 4 friends who were in HS together. It introduces them each seperately in their current lives showing how different they all are from each other and also intruducing the powers that one of them may or may not have. This section was definately slow going.The second section follows them on a hunting trip where Jones nearly shoots a mean because he thought he was a deer. He takes the man back to their cabin and helps him get better as he is disoriented, sick and missing several teeth. The other 3 are off in the woods and run into a woman who has the same condition as the man and who was part of his hunting parts. She later explains and is afraid of mysterious lights in the sky which is later shown to be an alien spacecraft. During this section we are introduced to a mentally challenged individual was was saved by the 4 when they were kids, and it is also hinted that he has psychic powers as well.Finally, both of the travellers give \\"birth\\" (i'm not even going to touch that one, read the book if you are curious) two a worm like alien creature that starts running arround killing and attacking people. Jones fights one of the worms and winds up becoming infected by the spores it releases, now making him able to communicate with them telepathically.The next section follows a military commander sent to quarentine the area, and to kill off all of the aliens who it has been revealed have been attacking and attempting to dominate earth since the 1940s. On the way back they find Jones and bring him to the quarentine area where the book turns into a boring muddy convoluted string of who is saying what telepathically to who. The rest of the book details manipulation by the aliens of several of the main characters as well as the human fighting back.This book was terrible was boring as hell and went absolutly nowhere fast. The end is typical alien movie ending, which can be spotted from a mile away. If you want to read this book read the wikipedia synopsis, that should be enough to get you through it, as the dragging slowness of this book is a nightmare itself to read.My opinion is eaither to skip this one, or to rent it from the Library."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Over the years I've seen a number of Stephen King movies and enjoyed quite a few of them, with Stand By Me and The Green Mile standing out as some of my personal favorites. However, I never sat down and read any of the books. The general rule is that books are always better than their movie counterparts, and this rule holds up in the case of Dreamcatcher.Dreamcatcher isn't going to go down in history as a classic by any means. Here's what it is though: a psychological thriller that puts the reader in an extraordinary situation full of pretty grotesque events. King manages to write with imagery that makes one smell the gas passed and itch along with the characters as the alien infection spreads. That same level of detail that King goes into though also tends to make some sections of the book drag on for longer than it should in my opinion. It's not War and Peace, but this is a thick novel, and the various details and flashbacks hurt the pacing of the story as far as I'm concerned.I won't get into detail about the story, but it is centered around four high school friends who find themselves caught up in the middle of an alien invasion while on a hunting trip in main. This isn't your standard little green men alien fare either; the aliens use telepathy and mind control, which raise some psychological issues throughout. Read it and you will see what I mean, I don't want to give anything away. Throw in the typical government figures and a special, gifted child and you have the makings of an interesting tale. The book isn't Stephen King's typical horror story; however, but it will leave you feeling uncomfortable throughout.The reason it only gets 3 stars from me is because it falls flat at various parts. Some of the characters are cliche, such as Kurtz, the man that heads the military operation. The four main characters don't really develop too much throughout the book, and although they were likable, you don't feel too attached to any of them. The story is pretty unbelievable at parts, and the ending left me scratching my head. Without giving anything away, the culmination during the final scenes made me flip back a few pages to see if I had missed something.For its shortcomings, I still did enjoy the book. It was entertaining enough to make me want to keep turning the pages to see what happened next. Recovering from a car accident while writing this, King's suffering really comes out in some of the characters. The book is laced with profanity that will surely turn some readers off, but on more than one occasion I almost laughed out loud at some of the dialogue (and I mean that in a good way, not that it was laughably bad). In the end, the book is surprisingly deep. Some parts will be tough to get through, but give it a shot, and I think you'll be rewarded and entertained, if not a little confused, when it is over."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"3.5 stars, round to 4Reading Dreamcatcher is like watching a whole season of X-Files all at once, except without Fox and Dana. And with some scenes thrown in that would be too gory for television; and all wrapped up in the psychological suspense that Stephen King does so well.The monsters and gore don't do much for me, but the psychological suspense and depth of characters make the book worth reading. I was especially intrigued that King chose a person with Down's Syndrome as one of the main characters, the one around which the entire story revolves. Perhaps the best passage of the book is a short one that is told from this character's point of view. It is fascinating how differently Duddit's mind works from the way he comes across to others - how much more \\"normal\\" he is inside his own mind. It shows a great deal of insight on King's part, and accords with current medical knowledge about Down's Syndrome.The high level of suspense keeps you reading and makes this easier and quicker to read than you might expect for a book of such length. It isn't really a mystery, in which a big surprise answer is revealed at the end. Instead, there is a constant turnover between revelations of pieces of the puzzle along with new questions that are always arising. This keeps the tension level consistently high pretty much throughout the entire book. It does drag a bit towards the end, though. The final chase scene goes on too long and in too much detail. The book's length could have been significantly shortened if the chase had been pared down to only those parts of it that added important information. However, fans of action and adventure might consider the chase the best part of the book.Dreamcatcher is highly atmospheric. The vivid depiction of the wild and bitterly cold Maine woods during a big blizzard, together with the culture of the hunters and fishermen who make up the small and mostly transient local population, is one of the strong points of the book. In fact, for me the spookiest part was towards the beginning, where the hunters become increasingly aware of their isolation and remote location as things begin to go wrong. The realism of this part made it much scarier to me than the later sections with the monsters.I also found it both interesting and moving that Stephen King wrote this book while recovering from critical injuries following a car accident that very nearly killed him. One story line in the novel closely resembles King's own experience. The autobiographical quality of that thread adds to the realism of the story and the way that King is able to almost make the reader feel the character's pain.The \\"voices\\" of the characters are authentic and consistent. Although some readers may find the crude language of some objectionable, there is no question that it is part of the authenticity of those characters.Although horror novels aren't really my thing, Stephen King's intelligence as well as his experience and competency as a writer are quite evident in Dreamcatcher. His books are the best in the genr&eacute;.(882 pages)Quotes from Dreamcatcher:\\"You can't make yourself be lucky.\\"\\". . . men . . .

Not worse than some of his others, but certainly not among my favorites from him. The first book he completed after his life-threatening / -altering accident, this tale combines the worst parts of \\"The Tommyknockers\\" with some of the comfy, reliable parts of \\"The Body\\" and \\"The Dead Zone.\\" About 4 childhood friends, one who suffers a car accident very similar to King's own, and a camping trip that turns into disaster, culminating in aliens, a retarded boy with \\"a gift\\" and other ridiculous, who-cares? climactic elements. Too long a book for the little bit that's actually interesting. A good editor could have probably shaped this into a shorter, tighter, more enjoyable read. Oh, well."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Another awesome gem from Stephen King! This tale centers on four best-friends, and their gifted Down's syndrome buddy, Duddits, as they share a childhood, then come together again as adults during a camping trip. That's when the saga begins. While they are in the cabin, a catastrophe begins, in which each man will take part. It seems as if their whole life together had prepared them for this event.Alien life settles on earth and struggles to survive. Government troops, and ultimately the five reunited men, struggle to prevent this. The aliens infect human beings, killing them. But how do they conquer an alien race that spreads like a virus and kills like one too?As in all of Mr. King's books, the character development is exemplary. Despite the fact that the plot gets to be very bizarre at times, his realistic characters compel us to believe the story and truly care what happens to them."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and despite absolutely loathing the movie, I decided to check this book out, and I was not disappointed. It's suspenseful and eerie and a good read. Funny thing is - I decided to try the movie again after finishing the book and I hated it even more. Bad movie, great book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm judging this book having read it once, waited a year, and then read it again, and this book did not survive the journey well.Every plot twist was predicted, every villain was a stereotype, everything, everything in this book could be seen in advance or simply mirrored some other book or story, and served only as a pale imitation of the sources it copied. The only good thing in this book were the aliens. Sorry, better luck next time."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"One thing I can say about Stephen King is that he's consistent. He's not going to surprise you with any new tricks or ever become a greater writer than he already is. King is going to write well no matter what happens. This is the case with Dreamcatcher, a novel which is not only derivative of other science fiction novels and movies, but also of Stephen King's other works, such as It and The Tommyknockers.Similar to It, a group of 4 friends who shared a turning point in their lives as kids reform as a group to combat a new evil. They have a telepathic link with each other and certain extrasensory powers, such as the ability to track down missing people and items. They call it \\"seeing the line\\". They have an annual hunting trip miles away from civilization in a cabin called The Hole in the Wall. It seems to be the only highlight in their miserable lives. This year is going to be different.A man stumbles out of the woods, and in a subversively comedic way which destroys the creepiness of the novel, cannot stop passing gas and burping. And man, do they smell. He can't remember much about how he ended up wandering out in the woods but later, in a combination of Alien and The Thing, we figure out what the real deal is. It turns out that the four men are the only thing standing between the world and an alien takeover.Everything in this book has been done before. I could list a ton of movies that Dreamcatcher borrows from :Alien, The Thing, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, War of the Worlds, etc. The lack of originality really bothered me in the sense that every Michael Crichton book does. This novel seems to be more like an excuse to make a movie than anything else. In this sense it reminds me of Rose Red. I mean, it's good, but King can do so much better.King is such a strong writer that he overcomes this and is able to entertain and scare you. I think he is one of the greatest contemporary writers when he talks about childhood. Like Dickens, King can sometimes make up for his poor plot by excelling at character.The beginning of the book is great as the characters are introduced and the scene at the cabin starts to unfold. As soon as the aliens are revealed and other characters start entering (such as a crazy general named Kurtz who has been sent by the government to eliminate the aliens), the book starts to sink into B-movie mode. It would have been much scarier just to concentrate on the four men isolated at the cabin by a blizzard.Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to put this book down, it's just that in the hands of a weaker writer, Dreamcatcher would've never worked. Nobody else could have gotten away with it except King. I agree with him though, in the sense that he says it's time to retire. His books are just retreading the same tired ground. For example, his new book is basically just Christine redone. Check out Salem's Lot and The Shining for a better read of this author."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"From alien abductions to telepathy to carnivorous intestinal parasites, Dreamcatcher is another fascinating voyage into the strange, and sometimes frightening, mind of Stephen King. Told mainly from the perspective of four lifelong friends-childhood residents of the ill-fated town of Derry-the story follows an attempted alien invasion and its aftermath.Henry, Pete, Jonesy, and Beaver, returning to Maine for their annual hunting trip, find themselves caught in a medical quarantine. Trapped at their cabin, Jonesy and the Beav encounter a lost hunter, sick and disoriented, and offer him shelter. Not too far away, Pete and Henry are nearly killed when they come across a second hunter comatose in the road.It is quickly discovered that the hunters are not sick; they are infected with an alien parasite, and a hungry one at that. This turn of events concerns even the aliens, who want to control humanity, not destroy it. But for some inexplicable reason, Earth's climate is inhospitable to them and its residents are highly resistant to their control. Jonesy is the first person they encounter immune to the destructive effects of their byrus. Possessed by an alien intelligence, trapped within his own mind, Jonesy is forced to aid the aliens in their assault on Earth.Henry leads the efforts to save Jonesy-and humanity-from destruction. Battling not only the aliens but a fanatical military commander, Henry must draw on the special bond the four friends share and on Duddits, the Down's-syndrome boy who had been their childhood friend and the cause of their finest hour.Though far from King's best work, Dreamcatcher holds the reader's interest. The story has all the King standards: bullies; people from (and drawn back to) that terrifyingly-tragic region of Maine; and children, reunited as adults and strengthened by their unity, forced to deal with unbelievable nightmares. It also contains a few delightful references to King's earlier works-some overt and some carefully hidden.Dreamcatcher, soon to be adapted into a feature length film (and likely ruined in the process) does have a few flaws. The excessive cursing and stream-of-consciousness writing, which I found so cutting-edge in my youth, is far less intriguing to me now. As usual, uncensored descriptions of violence and references to various abuses are plentiful, so plentiful it can make a reader doubt that any of us had happy childhoods. And as a whole, the story lacked King's usual power, leaving me satisfied, but not necessarily wanting more."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am an admirer of Stephen King's works. Both his fiction and non-fiction books. Infact his book \\"On Writing\\" was one of the best treatments I have read on that subject.In his novels , he normally combines interesting characters caught in a fascinating plot and delivers it with his unique narrative. Unfortunately this was not true of \\"Dreamcatcher\\".It is long, laborious and the characters lack the usual King flair for development. The four friends who are caught in a web of horrific circumstances in the woods of Northern Maine are well described in the beginning of the book, but their personalities don't evolve as the story moves ahead.The general theme of the book is fairly sound. Aliens are the \\"bad\\" guys and so are some of the people we entrust to remove them. Good wins over evil. The analogy of the \\"growth\\", the \\"byrus\\", to a cancer and the military to chemotherapy is clever. The play of the immune humans (assumedly the healthy cells) being attacked by the military as part of the treatment is also well conceived.He also brings in telepathy and mind control, but does not go nearly far enough in developing these themes. For example, how life could be more interesting and certainly more challenging if people could read others minds. I am sure that in a room full of people if each could read each others' mind, the mayhem that would ensue would be unbelievable. Half would be dead within an hour.In general I like the stories that Stephen King creates but, with \\"Dreamcatcher\\" the backtracking and dreamlike sequences disrupt the flow of the story and make it a struggle to keep up. Infact you would have to read the book in one sitting to maintain the flow. The paperback runs to almost 900 pages therefore a one-day read would be a tall order.I like mysteries and psychological thrillers. I also like most of Stephen King's works, many of which I have read more than once.Dreamcatcher incorporates some great ideas and undeveloped opportunities but I won't read it twice."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"At first glace, Stephen King's \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is an amalgam of \\"It\\" and \\"The Tommyknockers.\\" A group of friends who fought evil in childhood (It) must band together to ward off invading, mind-controlling aliens (Tommyknockers). Neither of those books are King's best work, and neither is Dreamcatcher - but it manages to one-up most of King's old works. It's amazing how much his style has matured here, and the reader can tell what King admits to in his afterward: Dreamcatcher was written on a slower pace, by hand, with an inkpen, in notebooks. No typewriter, no computer. Take that, John Grisham.The story follows four hunting buddies: Beaver, Pete, Jonesy, and Henry. When they were young, they prevented a Down's syndrome child from a beating at the hands of the local football star, and in doing so, they managed to form a bond that goes beyond normal human understanding and friendship. Now, they are in the woods and an alien ship a quarter of a mile wide has crashed. To make matters worse, another hunter shows up disoriented, farting and burping ethyl alcohol and suffering from a bad case of alien trichinosis. When his body erupts and a worm starts attacking the friends, things get bad. When a crazed government agent named Kurtz (a nice reference to \\"Heart of Darkness\\") shows up, things get worse.King has crafted a tale that, while not original, warrants more praise than It or Tommyknockers. The prose isn't on the same level as \\"Bag of Bones,\\" and the story isn't as sweeping as \\"The Stand,\\" but Dreamcatcher is a fine page-turner, and one fans of King will no doubt enjoy. His ability to create believable characters with realistic histories is where King truly shines, and he doesn't fail to please in Dreamcatcher. It seems he's become obsessed with telepathy and psychic powers lately, although he manages that topic far better in this book than he did in his recent miniseries, Rose Red.He doesn't pretend to be writing snotty literature, and that's what makes King's books so enjoyable - they aren't self-conscious. For alien invasion, pseudo-horror, psychological page-turners, you can do worse than Dreamcatcher.Grade: B"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is certainly not one of King's best. It has most of the elements that make a Stephen King book great but it is lacking something. Being over 600 pages long doesn't help the matter.The plot is where the major problem lies. I'm still trying to decide if this book was about a retarded boy with magical powers, space aliens, or four friends who could 'see the line'. King tries to tie everything in this book together with the 'dreamcatcher' and it just doesn't jive(for me anyway). The idea of the dreamcatcher isn't very clear and seems almost thrown in as an afterthought(or for a cool title).Dreamcatcher does contain entertaining reading and it will pull you in at certain points. King is a genius at shocking and making you laugh, even in this book. However, there are times when it feels like a chore to read. This isn't a horrible book, it's just extremely mediocre. It may be that I've become spoiled by all of Stephen King's wonderful novels. If this book was written by another author I may have given it another star but I must grade King by his own standards which are very high."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a big Stephen King fan. I love his ability to describe in such detail that you can picture every scene. This book was no different. I appreciate how he weaves his other books and ideas in some books. This one directly mentioned events from IT. He even mentioned Pennywise the clown. It was long and it really didn't add to the plot. I couldn't stop once I started, but I've enjoyed many of his other works much better. While it wasn't my favorite, it wasn't my LEAST favorite. If you are a Stephen King fan, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Being a very loyal Stephen King reader, as I started reading the book, I was very astonished that King published this book (you have the freedom to write, but this doesn't mean that you should publish it, right?) The story starts well, you think something good will come out of it, but even after a hundred pages -a lot of things happen but- nothing happens actually. After around 250 pages I could not go on reading any more, I pushed myself several times to move on, but it simply did not work at all, and then I realized that I actually don't care what is going to happen next, or what is going to happen in the end, and I don't care if they all die or survive, because I didn't have any feelings towards any one of the characters.Stephen King is the king of making people believe the unbelievable. But in this work he fails in putting \`unbelievable' things together to make a good story out of it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I was very excited to read the new King book, especially since this was supposed to be his big comeback to horror. However, with the exception of ONE scene in the book, NOTHING at all was terrifying. Not scary, not even a little creepy. King had 879 pages to work with and did nothing with them. Sure, the writing itself is good -- no one denies that. But he needed to get to the point a lot sooner. Master horror authors such as Bentley Little and Richard Laymon could have wrote this book much more effectively in less than half the space! He rambles on and on and on. Maybe the reason this book is so mediocre is that King's real-life car accident did permanent damage to his brain."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King's two primary strengths, those things that he does better than anyone, are showcased in this novel.His characterizations are exquisite. As usual, he bombards the reader with the characters when first introduced, staturating the pages with the flavor of the character while leaving plenty to plumb later as the story develops.In addition, King's voice rings through as clear as ever, like an old friend. I hated for the book to end because I wanted that voice to continue telling me about Duddits and the rest.Unfortunately, King's biggest weakness, in my opinion, is also a big part of this novel, namely his inability to bring his opus to a satisfactory conclusion. Of course, his endings never live up to the promise of the rest of the work but all in all, that's okay. Us King fans are used to it and the novel's charms make up for in spades."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This was a fun book. I will never look at Bacon the same way again.

Charming, witty, frightening, tender, page-turning suspense from the master. There are points in the novel where you cannot discern which mental state is real or a dream. Aliens, telepathy, and friendship are all present here. Hang on for the psychological ride of your life!!!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This books has some of the Maine elements but we are not all that wierd. There is darkness in rural Maine. But comapare these folks to Elise, the Maine heroine in Defenders of the Holy Grail. Elise surmounts her Maine situation, even her hunter husband. Well, King is a treasure, yes. This work is well done. King makes you afraid of the woods. To explore the other side of Maine, read Ken Agori's novel. Agori leaves you reflecting on the mysteries of the cross and true love. Both are excellent."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"4 boyhood friends meet each year to go hunting at Beav's cabin, Hole in the Wall. Each is having difficulties in their lives and look forward to the hunting trip. But this year, a man stumbles into their lives and the cabin, missing teeth and time and carrying a frightening parasite that not even he knows about.This is not King at his best, but as he wrote this book while recovering from his near-fatal car accident, it is wonderful that he has written again, period. The book is frightening and, at time, gross. There are flashes of King brilliance in this book, but a lot of the 700+ pages are taken up with sub-plots and routine stuff that could have been left out of the book. I rejoice that Mr. King is still around and still writing - and recommend this book only half-heartedly."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I don't know if you have noticed, but Stephen King's best works have been ones written outside of the horror arena. &quot;The Body&quot; and &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot; were not only his best writing, but they also translated into the best movies made from his work. &quot;Misery&quot; was also an excellent piece of writing, but the horror in it came from within &quot;normal&quot; human abnormalities. His best horror writing has involved, again, &quot;normal&quot; horror sources, such as vampires or haunted cars or teenagers with telekenetic powers. I have read all of his work except for the towers book, upon which I quickly bogged down. I read &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; while working graveyard in a convenience store and have two crosses scratched on the back of my St. Christopher medal as a consequence. The man has power. Unfortunately, none of this power shows up in &quot;The Dream Catcher.&quot; No power, no imagination, no fresh material. Just a changing around of the plot elements in &quot;The Tommyknockers,&quot; one of Mr. King's dreariest books. &quot;Hearts in Atlanta&quot; and &quot;The Girls Who Loved...&quot; were both entertaining and well written. This one was a waste of time, both for Mr. King and for the reader."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is one of the finest pieces of lit that has come out in years. It is the story of what it is like to be in pain, to live with pain and to create a story with pain. I admire Stephen for still going on with his work while in recovery from his nearly being run over by a van. Every single page I absorbed, having heard his voice on tape. I am in constant pain and I take meds, as did Stephen, Im sure. To have and live with a &quot;med-head&quot; is so wild sometimes. And this very unusual form of reality comes out perfectly in this book. Excellent work Mr. King. I am 51 and he is THE writer of my generation."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is a review from the hard copy...NOT an audio!!! I wouldn't use audio for Stephen's books...his writing is too intense for audio (normally!!!!!)and should be read in black and white!! I've been an avid fan of Stephen King's novels for over 25 years. I haven't read them all but have read most....including The Plant online. I was probably one of the first to order Dreamcatcher as I was just so anxious to actually get my hands on a hard cover by King....it had been too long. To say it wasn't his best is putting it nicely. To say he's always done better is, hopefully, saying that we'll see better from him down the road....or we'll see the Stephen King most of us love and admire. Dreamcatcher caught my 100% interest 1/3 of the way through. By 1/2 point, I was having a real tough time finding any enjoyment as his 'alien' creatures and mindnumbing (mine!!) attempts to try to figure out who was who (& why!!) became such big distractives....I couldn't finish!! First time in my life that I couldn't finish a Stephen King novel!! I missed the \\"I can't put this book down until I finish it\\" feeling.....I hope Stephen can bring that back."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This novel follows in the footsteps of other King greats like my personal favorite &quot;The Stand&quot; as well as &quot;IT&quot; and &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;. The story is amazing and keeps you turning the pages because you are just so anxious to see what happens next. It not only creates a brand new story but it also uses characters and images from the story &quot;IT&quot;, however it is not a sequel to that incredible book. It is a great novel in it's own way. If you love conspiracy, horror, and the unknown, you'll love this book. Just don't read it while sitting alone in the dark!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am an unabashed fan of Mr. King's novels and I look forward to each release. In Dreamcatcher, like all his stories, he hooks the reader in the first 100 words and never lets go. I had fun reading this book and I think that's the point. Get the book, go to the beach and have fun."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Has Stephen King lost his touch? This is a terrifying space-age novel written by Stephen King. I'm a big fan of King and this is the first of his works that I have read that have disappointed me. The first couple hundred pages are very tough to read. After that, the story starts the suspenfullness that you would expect from a Stephen King novel. After about I was halfway through the book I was starting to lose my intrest in it. The story seemed to be rushed out and King did not let the characters develope. The whole novel was a great story but his thoughts seemed to be mixed up in a way that I don't expect them to be by King. I really enjoyed reading Tommyknockers and some of his earlier works. If you plan on reading a Stephen King novel for the first time I would recommend you try some of his earlier works."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is certainly not one of King's best. It has most of the elements that make a Stephen King book great but it is lacking something. Being over 600 pages long doesn't help the matter.The plot is where the major problem lies. I'm still trying to decide if this book was about a retarded boy with magical powers, space aliens, or four friends who could \\"see the line\\". King tries to tie everything in this book together with the \\"dreamcatcher\\" and it just doesn't jive(for me anyway). The idea of the dreamcatcher isn't very clear and seems almost thrown in as an afterthought(or for a cool title).Dreamcatcher does contain entertaining reading and it will pull you in at certain points. King is a genius at shocking and making you laugh, even in this book. However, there are times when it feels like a chore to read.This isn't a horrible book, it's just extremely mediocre. It may be that I've become spoiled by all of Stephen King's wonderful novels. If this was book written by another author I may have given it another star but I must grade King by his own standards which are very high."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Like every other reviewer will tell you, Dreamcatcher is reminiscent of many other King novels. I'll offer that it also reminded me a bit of the movie 'BEING JOHN MALCOVICH.'Yet somehow Dreamcatcher maintains its orginality.The gross-out factor is used in Dreamcatcher, and I am cool with that as long as I don't have to see it on the big screen! Gross-outs include things like brains being splattered, and creatures growing in and extruding themselves from bowels.Blood & flatulence: Now thats entertainment.This book was one big guilty pleasure because I just couldn't put it down. I laughed out loud throughout, and cried a bit at the end.I wonder where the term \\"President Okeefenokee\\" came from if this book was completed 6 months before the 2000 Bush vs. Gore presidential election? Creepy on so many levels.As a King \\"Constant Reader\\" I just might have to say this is my new favorite story."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I read, TommyKnockers, Thinner, Talisman (my favorite), and others by Stephen King I dont remember right now. I was expecting alot from this book. This book was nothing compared to his previous work I read. I found it boring, and confusing, some parts were not detailed enough, and why did he have to go describe exactly what EVERYBODY is thinking? Some of the characters were typical,and predictable. Most of all, I hate books that seem like they could become cheesy &quot;made for tv&quot; movies."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"What a great read! I could not put this book down. I'm a 40-year old working mom, and I don't have time to read much anymore, but with this book, I found the time. I've been a Stephen King fan from the beginning. I read Carrie before Stephen became a household word, but I had to stop reading him after Salem's Lot because I just got too darn scared. I picked up Dreamcatcher after reading an intriguing review in the local paper, and what a delight to be back into Stephen's easy-to-read, everyman style. It was like reuniting with an old friend! I hate self-indulgent writers, and Stephen is the opposite; his characters are down-to-earth, real people with faults we can all relate to. A riveting guilty pleasure! I'm reading &quot;On Writing&quot; next."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"i started reading king's books by mistake actually. the first one i ever picked up was IT. clowns have always scared me and i saw the movie and i knew the book had to be good. no other book has scared the [heck] out of me more than It. i've read everyone of his books ranging from his fantasy to his horror and i recently picked up Dreamcatcher. i loved every word of it. if you want to see how King can take everyday life and turn it around and scare the hell out of a reader, then pick up this book and read it. you'll end up asking yourself how a man can take a normal man with a normal life and create horror at its' best..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I bought this book hoping that it would be similar to \\"It\\" or \\"The Tommyknockers.\\" Unfortunately, it was very disappointing. The story started out well enough, and the flashbacks to youth were very Stephen King-esqe. Even the 4 adults were somewhat likeable, even with their flaws. The middle of the book was muddled, confused, and meandering. I can't explain why, or I'll be giving away too much. With the weak middle, weak overall plot, and basic confusing premise, the climax of the book ended up being unsatisfing as well...Skip this one unless you are a die hard Stephen King fan. This book will not make you a fan!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I wouldn't say I've been dissapointed in King's post-Insomnia work, I've loved just about everything I've read from him (Which is about 75% of his works), Although I have noticed that he has toned down much of the twisted murderous gore of his previous novels and added alot more heart in his recent novels (Bag of Bones, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The Green Mile, Hearts In Atlantis...) I think Dreamcatcher is one of his best! Definitely the best of the post-Insomnia novels. His character development is in top-notch form! Duddits is a trip! Gotta love The Beav! Dreamcatcher is hands down the goriest king novel I've read!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Although Dreamcatcher's antigonist was alien, personified as &quot;mr.gray&quot;, i didn't see this as a sci-fi novel. What made Dreamcatcher such a good read was the development of the characters. The background and flashbacks kept me interested. I was also impressed with the way King explaned the human mind and the concept of memory. I usually stay away from science fiction, and I only read this because it was Stephen King, but I was pleasantly suprised. Anyone thinking of passing this one up should reconsider."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have been a huge Steven King fan for more than twenty years. I have read every novel he has ever written as well as his story collections and novella collections. I can say without hesitation that King is one of the finest writers I have ever read. His mechanical ability to put words on paper and bring characters and situations to life are second to none. Perhaps no writer has ever gotten inside the heads of his characters, male or female, better. Nevertheless, the quality of his work varies considerably. Where King occasionally veers off course is when he allows his plots to move out of control. The history of King's novels shows a tendency towards two types of books. These are the \\"epics\\" which have large expanisive plots and multiple characters and the \\"little novels\\" which tend to involve few or even a single character and a simple plot. On the whole, King's best work has been with the simple novels. An exception is The Stand which is his greatest book and a truly sprawling epic. His little novels such as \\"Pet Sematery\\", \\"Cujo\\" and \\"Misery\\" to just name a few are uniformly excellent. Other epics like \\"It\\" and \\"Insomnia\\" get lost in their bizarre ever expansive plots.\\"Dreamcatcher\\" falls somewhere in between. In this epic, King imagines a horrible predatory alien incursion in the woods of New England. Most often the aliens invade and take over the minds of their victims before slowly killing them. In a few horrible cases, they grow in the intestines of their victims into horrible monsters before bursting out, killing the victim and anyone else they can sink their teeth into. King chronicles the experience of four childhood friends (a common King motif) on a hunting trip who are caught up in this disaster. He also follows the top secret military people sent to the area to finish off the aliens. (and any people caught within the red zone) The book is a decent yarn as all of Kings books really are. The characters are straight out of the King stockroom: The [mentally challenged] man with \\"special insight\\"; the long haired ex hippy the depressed establishment guy, the evil G-man. I recommend the book because I recommend all of King's books. But it is not in my top ten."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is an engrossing book with excellent characters that you actually care about. It is extremely hard to put this thing down once you have started it; I read it in four nights. However, Dreamcatcher lacks something: originality. There is nothing in here that we haven't seen or read before, and the whole book is a whole bunch of ides and scenarios taken from other stories and welded together to form this. What sets Dreamcatcher apart from standard campy Sc-Fi is King's amazing ability to tell the same story better than anyone else. So, if you are interested in a good, hard to put down book, you should pick this up without hesitation. However, don't buy this looking for new ideas that will blow your mind."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The more I read public reviews, the more I realize how little business some people have in reading a book in the first place. Before I even begin my analysis, allow me to warn anybody who was around in the seventies and eighties and is perhaps expecting a rehash of Cujo or Firestarter--this isn't it. This book is not bare gore and tension, as many people continue to expect King's writing to be. If you want that, you won't get it here.That said, for anybody still considering the book, I'm really not sure what my recommendation would be. Honestly, when I look at the writing and the story, I can see very little originality in it. Just for fun, I tried to construct a list of all the things that were taken from previous books, and I couldn't come up with one instance that didn't show up somewhere else. If you're experienced with King, think of this as something of a combination of It and Tommyknockers, with Tom Cullen tagging along just to keep things interesting.Of course, I should also say that this book is done better than any of those which it borrows concepts from. While some might call it bloated (I hate to tell you, but if six hundred and change pages is bloat, somebody needs to cut Robert Jordan's hand off), it is considerably leaner than its closest companion in the King library, It, which helps an awful lot. Doubtless the fact that the manuscript was written in longhand helped in that regard. The characters and the situation turns out to be very similar to what you'd find in Tommyknockers, but unlike the fellows in that clanger, these ones are actually likeable at least some of the time. Though the elements may be borrowed, the overall product is far superior to any of Stephen's previous \\"horror\\" stories.All of the usual caveats come with this book, of course. The characters are fairly two dimensional (although I must admit that Henry is one of the better rounded characters I've encountered in a King novel), you'll encounter more brand names in a night of reading than you would watching television, and the story itself carries a lot of ornamentation that takes up space (mostly about the protagonists' pasts). It would also be wise to note that this book does, at several points, deal with situations that King chooses to analogize with the image of dynamite going off in a person's corn chute. You can imagine, then, that this story sits a little on the offensive side of the fence, which means that if you're expecting something like Hearts in Atlantis, you'd probably better keep looking. I also have some issues with the plotting of the story, since I believe that King plays a rather poor trick in his attempt to resolve the story that is more confusing than entertaining.For all of its shortcomings, I have to penalize this book at least a star, but I still recommend it to anybody who's got a few afternoons to spend and isn't offended by a little explosive anal imagery. While it is not his best book by a long shot, this is probably Stephen King's best horror novel, and certainly the one which best exploits his talents as an author."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"KING FANS get ready! If you haven't read this yet, do so now because the FULL MOVIE ADAPTION is hitting the screen soon! And if you're like me you know it's rule to read the book BEFORE watching the movie. Like King said of \\"the stand\\"...\\"I want someone to have their own interpretation of what Stu Redman would look like, and not automatically just think of Gary Sinise\\"..anyways on to the book!About the book: Starts out with a classic brat pack reunion of fellas (I can see Sheen, Sutherland, Estevez...) meeting up at a cabin for an annual hunting trip. This seems to start out slow as it builds the 4 hunting pals but quickly EXPLODES!!!--A lost hunter is taken in, he's acting strange, he's bleeding...--Thundering noises are heard...why is every animal in the woods, every deer, coon, bear, bird, squirrel..fleeing in the same direction? What lies in the opposite direction?--Oh yeah, mind controlling aliens! King is great here, reminds me somewhat of \\"The Dead Zone\\". The description of experiencing hauling fast through the snow in a new Dodge Ram...---Ahh, a memory and link they all share..who is Duddits? And why can't the aliens read his mind?---Oh great, Uncle Sam gets involved...reminds you of some scenes from \\"The Stand\\". Ruthless. Swift. Trying to control a helpless situation, which is already out of their control..business as usual!---The final plan, the aliens goal, uncle sams recourse, the hunters heroic struggle...and the friendships that bind all these men along with the dreamcatcher hanging in the old cabin, make this one of the greatest tales of the decade!This book will have you reading and rereading for years to come. King takes several simple plots and meshs them together into a superthrilling original tale! I only hope the movie is done like shawshank redemption..as close to word for word as they can, because then the movie to will be on my shelf for years to come. Buy it used paperback if you are scared...or wait the scared part comes after you turn the first page..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"DREAMCATCHER shows Stephen King writing what he writes best: atmospheric, visceral horror peopled by strongly developed characters.There are seven main characters who are developed here. Four men, close friends since childhood, who go to a remote hunting cabin; a mentally retarded man who has been, in many ways, at the center of their lives; Kurtz, a madman about to make a bad situation worse; and one of his underlings who realizes that he must change allegiances. In addition there are many minor characters who are well fleshed out.In some ways, this is a sequel to IT. Much of the flashback action takes place in Derry, Maine, and there are references to the way that children disappear in that town.I find it interesting that King wrote the first draft of DREAMCATCHER by hand, using a fountain pen. Hmmm. Maybe I should back off on my addiction to word processing.Thanks, Steve. Good to have you at the top of your form again."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have been a fan of King for years, reading anything and everything he writes. From the description of Dreamcatcher, I had decided that I was not going to read it; as another reviewer said, it sounded as though it had been done before (in both books and movies). But I purchased it anyway, and found that my initial instinct had been correct.I could not get involved with the any of the main characters, especially since only two of the boys are in a majority of the story and the Kurtz character is laughable and easily forgotten. The event that happened when the men were young is uninteresting and weak. The storytelling is not the best; I thought it was choppy and sometimes even confusing. I was just disappointed with the overall effort. I know King had the accident and wrote this one by hand, but he doesn't need to publish everything!Why King would choose to write about aliens (too similar to the movie Alien(s)) after writing Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, and On Writing is beyond me. I thought a new King was emerging and was excited for his future endeavors, but somewhere along the line King got an idea for aliens, and unfortunately decided to go with it. This book should have been written early in his career, not at this point in his career. He is too talented a writer to tell a story about aliens and telepathy.Overall, low rating is for poor storytelling, poor concept, and for King losing some of that writing maturity I had been waiting for."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Anyone you talk to will tell you that I am probably the biggest Stephen King fan they know; I love his writings!! HOWEVER, I was greatly disappointed in Dreamcatcher. I found it to be very dark and downright WEIRD (not to mention that the language was atrocious even for Stephen King!) much more reminiscent of Richard Bachman than the Stephen King we've come to know and love of recent years. It's my humble opinion that this book was SK's way of lashing out at all the pain he's suffered both mentally and physically since his accident. Want a good King novel??? Pass on Dreamcatcher and pick up THE TALISMAN --now THAT'S a story!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is not my favorite King work, but it holds its own nicely. I was reminded of his older novels, like Salem's Lot, when the fear overwhelmed and kept me from reading the next chapter. Wrapped into that emotion is some excellent modern-King, the King which shapes wonderfully complete and human characters, and deals with issues that few other novelists seem to understand. Sadly, the last 3rd of the novel just seems to fizzle away, and many of the deeper questions are just left unanswered, tensions left unresolved. The wonderful twists of earlier chapters just disappear, and the story becomes very linear and predictable.Like his early stuff, King has taken the old themes of alien invasion and made them his own, mixing all our standard movie cliches together in one big pot - mind control, alien experiments, government cover-ups, etc. You'll never quite know who to trust - the aliens are bad one minute, good the next, then, well, who knows? I never really knew, not about the aliens, or the government, for that matter. King had the great sense to leave much of his bigger world outside of the scope of his characters. He knows our expectations and uses them against the reader. Telepathy, clarvoyance, and the like was particularily exciting, and the author presents this with an amazing freshness and understanding of how our minds work - almost like a dream which floats from subject to subject, in control yet out of control at the same time. BrillantThe human story in this book is wonderful - childhood friends who have reached middle age and must all deal with the death of their dreams and hopes, and promise unforfilled. The 4 men of this story also share a collective and mysterious past which they must face together to survive the alien invasion. Yet, as much as this built and built, as I grew to hope for a saticifying and deep conclusion to these subjects, in the end I thought the characters felt predictable and underdeveloped. Too very very bad.Still, if you are a King fan, definitely read this book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"There have been good ones in the past. The Body. The Stand. Bag of Bones. This is not one of them. And that's okay, because prolific writers, like career rock stars, have to release some filler with the doozies.King seems to have been pretty miserable during his recovery period following the accident. We are here treated to his convalescent bitchery. If you enjoy lengthy descriptions of farts, of course, you've found your bible.Overall, however, the strongest thing coming out of the book is an overwhelmingly juvenile worldview. The \\"diabolical madman\\" character, a mishmash of Apt Pupil's Nazi general and Marlon Brando in \\"Apocalypse Now\\", isn't mad at all -- just good at what he does. The \\"innocent hunters\\" are portrayed as feebly-minded as the crowds in \\"Frankenstein\\" or any kill-the-beast literature -- easily swayed and hardly free-thinking. And the friendship of our four heroes and their Downs buddy is not believable in any sense -- nor does it have the depth to carry us through 600+ pages of anecdotal proof of their solidarity.I greatly respect King's talent. He can describe post-WWII America with an eye for detail that misses little and puts us right there with the characters. But when he tries to moralize or begins to ride the socially-conscious wagon, he loses his narrative thread and winds up sounding silly and empty. Usually, he balances these strains well enough to sweep us through a story and leave us with a quasi-believable sense that he has a healthily skeptical hope in the good of humanity. In Dreamcatcher, however, we don't get the descriptive power or the narrative oomph. We're left with ugly chaos and a kindergarten cutout view of the world."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"one thing you know when you pick up a stephen king novel is that you are most likely going to get a good story. as you do here. and with 600 pages you can figure king is going to give you plenty of lead-up time before it really gets going. but that isn't the case here. king immediately leaps into the story. the first part of the book moves at a blinding pace, one you usually don't see until the end. unfortunately he slows down during the middle section before finally speeding up again. locating the story in derry, king runs the risk of resurrecting pennywise, but don't fear, he doesn't (though the story does remind one of _It_ and _Tommyknocker_. i would have given it a higher rating except for two problems: 1) the ending is too neat. after investing 600 pages worth of reading time, king cops out in the end and makes everything end far too neatly. 2) i've noticed in king's later fiction he has a tendency of giving away the action before it happens. he mentions that something has happened or will happen, then in the next chapter he writes it happening. gives too much away. not his best work, but by no means his worst."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"When I first started reading Dreamcatcher, I found myself wanting to give up on it. It wasn&#65533;t because his writing was horrible or even because the story was dull, but it was because I was getting tired of all the overly described gas/burping problems that took place with the characters that were found in the woods. I understood after the first dozen times the problems that a couple of the characters were having in the gas and burping department but Stephen King described this stuff to death! I usually like reading books during my lunch break, but I learned to just put the book down when I wanted to eat. Nevertheless, I stuck with it and I really found myself immersed in this book&#65533;s storyline, especially the one involving Jonesy and Mr. Gray. I know that Henry and Duddits were key players in the book, but, Jonesy and Mr. Gray stole the show, as far as I was concerned. I loved the mind games that Jonesy and Mr. Gray were playing with each other throughout the book and these &quot;two&quot; made the book very fun-to-read. This was my first time reading one of Stephen King&#65533;s books and now that I have an idea what to expect, I am looking forward to trying some of his other books."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is, hands down, Stephen King's worst work since &quot;The Dark Half&quot;. Formerly a diehard fan, I have now vowed to never again spend my time with a new novel by Stephen King.Although shorter than some of his most recent work, this book rambles from page one, going on tangents that make no sense and have no apparent destination. The characters are bland, except for Duddits who can be best described as sickly sweet and who utters not one understandable word through the entire book. Every line of his dialouge (Ay ooo-eevviie-ooo ood urn ook) is immediately repeated (so as to be translated) by another character.The author seems to have gotten bored with his premise two thirds of the way through the book. What starts out as an alien presence overtaking the (questionable) hero's body is suddenly revealed to be some kind of time-warp mind trick which proves the hero to be in control of the alien, rather than vice-versa. And how do the good guys escape and save the world? Not by a clever turn of plot or inguenuity on their (or the author's) part, let me assure you. It seems as if the writer has befuddled himself nearly as much as he bufuddles the readers and the good guys triumph by a conference call of minds and (from what I could tell) imagine the alien to death. All orchastrated by the ever sweet Duddits, (gag) whose dying words are &quot;I ove oo, Eenney&quot; (I love you, Henry.) Perhaps that line would be better untranslated.I'm sorry Steve. It's been a long and wonderful relationship but you've changed. I have to leave you now, and keep myself company with memories of the good times--those published prior to 1992."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Let me say at the outset: I am a HUGE Stephen King fan, and I've read all the novels and short stories, as well as his rather wonderful books on writing.Unfortunately, Dreamcatcher is a bloated, vacuous, dreadful piece of self-indulgence that mostly goes to show that King has apparently gotten so famous that no one dares edit him or tell him that he's written a bad book.The pointless repetition in this door-stop of a novel is staggering beyond belief (and, ultimately, stultifying as well). King beats you over the head with his 7th-grade brand of peepee/caca humor (I presume it's supposed to be funny, if you think scores of pages with people reacting to fetid flatulence is funny) until you're ready to join forces with Tipper Gore. He gives his main characters an annoying set of catch-phrases (meant to be all down-homey Maine) that they say over and over and over and over and over like verbal tics until they sound like mental defectives. He needlessly involutes the plot, requiring the reader to go back and forth in time-which must have seemed like a nifty device at some point in the writing, but which is ultimately just a nightmare (and not the good kind) of padding and disorganization.Since I also love (or have loved) the 'potboilers' of Grisham, Crichton, et al., I note an increasing trend among these writers (case in point: Tom Clancy's tumid *Sum of All Fears*): to write obese and flabby novels (high-cholesterol plot, no unneeded fiber such as character development) that all but completely ignore the reader and keep winking ingratiatingly at the screenwriter over your shoulder. Personally, I'm a little sick of it.Thankfully, you don't have to give up good writing in order to enjoy action-oriented, heavily plotted suspense fiction-consider the truly wonderful series of carefully constructed books by Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston or Dan Brown's DaVinci Code....P>Meanwhile, I'm giving this book one star because that's the lowest rating you can give; in reality, it shouldn't even show up on the scale."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher seems to be 2 unrelated books (one good, one bad) bound in one volume. The first is about 5 childhood friends with a secret. The other is about a cartoonish military person who's somewhat less believable than Yosemite Sam. When dealing with the 5 friends, the writing is affecting and absorbing. When dealing with the military person, the writing is excruciatingly, embarassingly bad, consisting of nothing but cliches, endless pop culture references, and melodrama that would make a 6-year-old cringe.Most astoundingly, the last 250 PAGES (250!) are about an uneventful, slow-speed car chase that will put you to sleep (in fact, many of the characters in this chase ARE sleeping). You might as well skip straight to the epilogue, except that the latter offers no satisfying resolution to anything, and by this time in the book, all the good elements/ideas have long since played out. It seems that the author had a great premise but then went on to write the book without coming up with anything else.Fatally flawed as a novel but containing a few hundred pages (bunched toward the beginning) that make it worth reading/skimming."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm a huge King fan. I've read every single one of his novels, most of his short stories, and will continue to read everything the man writes. Dreamcatcher, however, was a rank dissapointment (no pun intended). It reminds me of King's of a the stretch in King's career when he wrote Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne. After such literary attempts as Bag of Bones and On Writing, this is a huge disapointment.I was wary as soon as I learned the premise. Aliens? Again? Didn't we already put up with The Tommyknockers, which, though not a bad book, not a stand-out either. But what King fan can decide not to read one of his books? I plunged into it despite my misgivings.I knew the book had problems early on when it wasn't clear who our main character was. Eventually, King whittles it down to two main characters, but the reader is never really able to empathize with either of them.Then we get the &quot;$&amp;^@ weasels.&quot; Far from being frightened, I couldn't stop laughing at these things. And from there on, ridiculous situations continued to snowball.Well, enough of trashing my favorite author. The book wasn't all that bad. Still better than 70% of the swill that gets published on the force and style of the narrative alone. King can still spin a tale, he can still write and bring the reader into the world of the story. The only problem is I don't think this was a good story. Maybe it just went on for too long, stretched for countless pages while very little time progressed in the book.So, to sum up, King fans will read and some will enjoy it more than other, but I think we can all agree this is far from King's best.P.S. to Mr. King: WE'RE DYING FOR MORE OF THE DARK TOWER!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"On the recommendation of a friend, I read this, my first Stephen King novel. For the first 100 or so pages, I was hooked. But the novel began to drag. What starts out as the gripping tale of four hunting buddies encountering strange happenings outside their cabin, devolves into a wandering, unfocused and bizarre piece of writing. By page 400, I had lost all interest in the book. But, since I dislike not finishing a novel, I struggled on. Unfortunately, by page 500 (3/4 of the way through it) the writing was so terrible, the plot so absurd, and the characters so cliche, I had to put the book down. Whatever originality or imagination King once possessed is gone. He now relies on co-opting characters from other genres. For example, he names a sadistic, unbalanced Army General \\"Kurtz\\" after the sadistic, unbalanced Army General in Apocalypse Now named \\"Kurtz.\\" King consistently refers to movie director James Cameron, as if the two are enjoying some inside joke, which detracts from the story. While I didn't anticipate great writing, I expected first rate story telling. The writing was high school level at best. I'd skip it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"\\"Dreamcatcer\\" is one of the most controversial books I've read so far. Therefore, I am going to separate my analysis to positive points and to negative points.Let's start with the good news: The story itself is gripping, thrilling and interesting; I actually forced myself to stop reading from time to time, under no circumstances is it boring.The similarities, mainly to \\"IT\\", you may look at it as a sequel, and that way accept the mirror images (I'll refer to this point later on more extensively).The different view King offers of the Down syndrome stricken persons: I have a feeling you're going to look differently at them after you've read the book, and that's a great achievement of the author.And, naturally, the bad news (there are quite a bit)...I have a distinct feeling King has started to recycle himself. It seems he has ran out of good new original ideas for a story; it's kind of sad, but while reading I couldn't help thinking that maybe he'd run out of aces in his sleeve. Not only does he borrow from himself, but he also borrows from others- external influences are apparent. Would you believe he'd been heavily influenced from Chris Carter of the X-Files?The structure and content of the plot resembles in many aspects to \\"IT\\", which is a bit annoying. King starts by introducing four characters - in their prime, but all going through hard time. Surprisingly, their problems are connected to a mutual past experience they had as a group of children. Yes, they had been best friends, done something extraordinary and today, suffer from the implications. The story gets started as they reunite, for a new mission of saving the world. Sounds familiar?I've read handful of his books, and seen him originating and innovating, creating masterful readings like \\"Bag of bones\\", \\"The stand\\" and \\"The green mile\\". The man has got what it takes, but kind of \`blew it' this time in some places. I know he had a rough time after the accident he endured, but this doesn't justify a decline in quality.The inside havoc continues to be revealed in the novel, as he uses extremely violent and foul language extensively throughout the book. Even for a King's book it's way too much. The swearing and cursing are so frequent it's irritating, and, clearly, King exaggerated. Again, you can ascribe it to his physical condition, not to mention his mental state back than, but it is hardly an excuse. The curses and obscenities are so intense that they bring the violence of the book to the level of \\"Needful things\\". To sum up this point, the story gets quite gruesome from time to time, so take this in your considerations when deciding whether to read it or not. If I'd known, I would have passed over this one.Characters - Due to the fact it is a shorter reading compared to \\"IT\\", for instance, there is not enough time to get to know the center characters. This is a major problem of the book, because it's one of the reasons I read Stephen King's books. He is very good in characterizing, describing and, telling stories about the life of his heroes, but here, he was negligent. Suffice to say, I won't miss any of the characters.All in all, the feeling you get while reading the novel is that the author vended a lot of anger, and maybe if you remember this you can accept the faults and fully enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Reading this, I remembered why I stopped reading Stephen King several years ago. It is not simply that he hasn't had an original idea in years - maybe decades - though that is a factor. Dreamcatcher is a recycling of bits from The Stand, It, Tommyknockers, and other novels, most of which were better - though Tommyknockers was pretty awful, come to think of it. Moreover, the characters are wooden, flat, cartoonish stereotypes. Kurtz, the villain of the piece (discounting the amorphous \\"Mr. Grey\\"), is so predictably fascist and megalomaniacal he is almost laughable. (I'm reminded of one of the most memorable lines from the old Dr. Who series: \\"You megalomaniacs are all alike.\\") Megalomaniacs are easy villains to write. You don't have to do very much in the way of character development.What is most troublesome is the fact that his novels have become mired in vulgarity. As a writer, King seems to have an adolescent's fascination with bodily functions. The aliens of Dreamcatcher inhabit the intestinal tract of their potential victims, and when they reproduce, it's in the most graphic and stomach-churning terms. Where some writers spend a lot of time writing about sex, King prefers to write about people vomiting similar types of unpleasantness. Vulgarity spills over into the dialogue. Nearly all his characters, again like adolescent boys trying to shock their parents, pepper their dialogue with the standard collection of \\"f\\", \\"s,\\" \\"c,\\" and \\"p\\" words.I have no truck with censorship. I am not arguing that vulgarity is never permissible, should never be used. But at some point vulgarity becomes a cliche, a substitute for thought, or for thinking about and carefully selecting words for their emotional effect. This is the problem with a lot of King's writing: it is so uniformly vulgar in style and content that it becomes tedious for any reader who looks for a little more from a novel than more of the same. And much of King's more recent material is \\"more of the same.\\" King has stopped writing novels and is writing \\"product.\\" His books are the equivalent of fast food double cheeseburgers. Go into any fast food chain across the country and you know exactly what you are getting. Pick up any Stephen King novel and you know exactly what you are getting. There are no surprises. I'm not saying that King doesn't have talent. No writer becomes as successful or continues to be as successful as he is without talent. But I sure wish he'd start writing books for grownups."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"There has been a lot of --- and I don't mean to be disrespectful to anyone here, but I don't know what else to call it --- a lot of blather about how Stephen King, with his last several works of fiction, has been trying to establish himself as a serious novelist, how he has lost his touch, that he should stick to what he knows, etc. I just finished reading the much-anticipated DREAMCATCHER. It should seal the coffin on all the nattering nabobs. It won't. But it should. King sticks to what he knows. He never lost his touch, but if we want to concede the (meaningless) point for argument's sake, he's got it back. And the rub about being a serious novelist...he always has been. DREAMCATCHER merely affirms it.Let us get one thing out of the box at the get go, here. If you gave your mom THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON and she liked it, don't give her DREAMCATCHER just because both books are by Stephen King and both take place in the woods. DREAMCATCHER is going to do for walks in the woods and hunting lodges what IT did for clowns, CARRIE did for proms, MISERY did for nurses, and &quot;The Raft&quot; did for farm ponds. No, DREAMCATCHER doesn't happen in yo' momma's woods. It occurs in some woods up in Maine where four men --- Beaver, Jonesy, Pete, and Henry, who have been friends since they were kids --- are enjoying their annual, and last, hunting trip together. When a disoriented man stumbles into their campground, however, troubles begin. He is bringing with him an alien spawn too horrible to contemplate. King, of course, contemplates it, describes it, and shoves it right in your face and makes you love it.I have been known to carry on at length about extraterrestrial visitations. My general attitude is that if a UFO should crash into the estates of Casa de Hartlaub, the pilot has about 30 seconds to demonstrate that it eats child molesters and pisses gasoline before I use a 12 gauge mop to sweep him into the landscape. And if it looks anything like Geraldo, he's only got 15 seconds. I have this attitude due to an extensive history of reading books like DREAMCATCHER. This is one nasty ET here, folks, and seven years of &quot;The X-Files&quot; won't prepare you for it. Your government, however, is prepared. Armed troops arrive, led by a no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners psychopath named Kurtz. Now let's make one thing clear here. If we get invaded, I want a psychopath between Them and Me. I don't want Phil Donahue, I don't want Quietly Effective, I want Armed and Dangerous. This is what you get with Kurtz.The woods, with Beaver and Company inside, are quarantined --- but not quite tightly enough. There is one hope, however. Some 30 years previously, four boys befriended and helped Duddits, a young man with Down's Syndrome who, it seems, helped them even more. And he, along with them, is now the only hope that the world has. There is one problem, though. Actually, there are two problems. One is The Alien. The other is Kurtz. And they both pose a terrible danger to Duddits and his friends --- not to mention the rest of the world.Is this King's best book? No. Top 10? Yes. Top 5? Maybe. I might have to get back to you on that. But forget about its ranking; it'll keep you up, oh yes, it'll keep you up for a whole passel of nights and it'll make you sweat and laugh and stare at the guy with the vacant look in his eye who just sat down next to you on the bus. It'll also restore your faith in Stephen King, if you lost it to begin with. And it will definitely keep you out of the woods.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"How many novels has Stephen King written by now? Twenty-five? Thirty? I lost count around the time he published DESPERATION and THE REGULATORS at the same time, but let's face it, it's a lot. After such a long time, it is only natural that an author's output might begin to feel a tad familiar to the reader. The stories may change, but the style is the same. And when the stories themselves start to feel similar, it is usually a sign that the author should consider retirement.But what a relief it is to find that King has not lost his edge. DREAMCATCHER may be somewhat recycled in theme and tone from his earlier works, but King has not lost the knack to tell a good story. And after his less terrifying publications BAG OF BONES, THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, it is comforting to discover that King has also not lost the knack to pen a truly gruesome scene, and go for full-bore horror.DREAMCATCHER follows a group of four childhood friends, Henry, Jonesy, Beav, and Pete, now adults enjoying their yearly hunting trip in Maine. In the past, they shared an unusual bond with a severely mentally challenged boy, whose friendship continues to affect their lives in unusual ways. When the men discover a lost hunter apparently suffering from a gastro-intestinal affliction, they are thrust into a plot involving government conspiracies, telepathy, and little gray men, all of which may be linked to their childhood experiences.There is a large feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in the proceedings, as King creates a story that would seem to be very much at home as an episode of television's X-FILES, or as a sequel to his previous alien saga, THE TOMMYKNOCKERS. But simply because a story lacks a certain originality does not ruin the fun to be had in the telling. King once again proves his innate ability to manufacture believable characters coping with incredible situations. His opening chapter, presenting the reader with one past event in each of the four men's lives, ranks among the best of King's writings, succinctly and deftly capturing the disparate natures of the four individuals. King's evocations of childhood (always a staple of his novels) are, as usual, stirring and well-drawn, and King does a fine job at weaving the past with the present, using the innocent boyhood events of the past as a counter-point to the far more gruesome happenings of the present. And as King slowly but surely reveals the curious bond the boys share, the actions of the present take on added significance.King's major failing in DREAMCATCHER is his choice of villain. The tyrannical military freak Kurtz is far too one-dimensional, a gung-ho G.I. Joe with very little background. When you compare him to the well-rounded antagonists of ROSE MADDER and SALEM'S LOT, Kurtz's superficiality is quite distressing. King fares far better with Mr. Gray, an entity who takes up residence within the mind of Jonesy. Mr. Gray, a presence with no personality besides that which it takes from Jonesy, enters into an intriguing battle of wits, as Gray tries to implement his plan, and Jonesy erects a warehouse within his mind to shield himself from Gray's invasion. King's presentation of the warring factions within one mind is almost as absorbing as the similar synthesis of two personalities within one body found in Clive Barker's EVERVILLE.As well, King makes a long-overdue comeback to the orchestrated gore of his earlier novels. His last few stories, while never less than entertaining, have given his fondness for horror a backseat to more 'mature' stories. King is a fine writer, but he works best when he goes back to his roots. DREAMCATCHER is not a classic; it has too many unexplained ambiguities and coincidences to establish it as such. But it is a fast-paced entertainment as only King can provide. Some may wish to discuss the deeper implications of his stories, but not I, not now. King has created another terrific nail-biter, and that's enough for me.POSTSCRIPT: In his afterward, King explains how he originally intended to title the book CANCER, but was convinced to change it. Having read the novel, I must respectfully disagree with his choice. CANCER is a far more foreboding and emotionally charged title, and creates an immediate apprehension in the reader that the title DREAMCATCHER is simply unable to match."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Pennywise lives.If you walk away from &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; - Stephen King's first novel after his 1999 hit-and-run accident - holding nothing else, hold on to that.Pennywise, of course, was the supernatural clown villain who stalked &quot;The Losers Club,&quot; a band of childhood misfits in what is arguably King's penultimate thriller, &quot;It.&quot; Pennywise was ultimately vanquished by the kids, their adult selves and (as &quot;It,&quot; which began so grandly, sputtered to an uneven finale) a mystical turtle.Right smack dab in the middle of &quot;Dreamcatcher,&quot; however, one of King's characters stumbles across the message with which this review begins: Pennywise lives. Whether or not it actually proves to be true, however, remains to be seen...It's a little moment, completely unrelated to the entire &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; story and one you might miss if you blink, or are not well versed in King lore. But it's enough to further fuel my theory that something big ultimately is going to go down in the Stephen King kingdom, tying together all of his major works, if not all his works. (This theory is given further support by the new book &quot;The Stephen King Universe,&quot; copyrighted May 2001.)The possible Pennywise revival might be the most exciting thing &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; has to offer, unfortunately. Oh, it starts out well enough (King's strengths are typically his beginnings; some endings still need work), with a quartet of boyhood friends reuniting for their annual hunting trip.A mysterious visitor named McCarthy, who smells really rank and unleashes a mixture of foul stenches and odors upon the cabin, interrupts the festivities. It's not very long before readers are caught up in a tale that greatly resembles something like &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers,&quot; leaving two men dead and two in a very precarious situation.Woven into this present-day tale is a story of the boys as children (opening the line for discussion of further parallels to &quot;It&quot;) and their remarkable friendship with a boy with Down syndrome named Duddits. The question is, how does Duddits' influence affect the present-day goings-on surrounding McCarthy?If this were all &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; were to include, it would be heralded as King's return to true horror after lackluster offerings like &quot;Insomnia,&quot; &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; and &quot;On Writing.&quot; The story is creepy enough, and contains some of the best elements of King's fiction, a throwback to &quot;It,&quot; &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;The Stand.&quot;But King decides to play like Tom Clancy and builds another story arc around the military officers tracking McCarthy, which drags on way too long and makes the book much heavier than it actually needs to be.When you get to page 431 and see the chapter entitled &quot;The Chase Begins,&quot; for instance, and realize there's still a long way to go, it's enough to make you want to cry.That, or shake the book up and down and scream, &quot;Send in the clown!&quot;"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Finally, Stephen King reverts back to the style (or topics) that made him one of my favorite authors. Recent books like Bag of Bones and Hearts in Atlantis to me came across as a forum for King's own maturation and reflections on the development of his life through childhood, adulthood and current events. Good, but not the stuff that kept me reading and re-reading earlier books like The Stand, It and The Tommyknockers. This book sounds more like the Stephen King I know and love (although you definitely see signs of the ordeal he conquered after the car accident) -- it has a great voice, quick pace, and utterly horrifying plot developments and scenes. I literally had to put the book down several times because I was so scared/horrified by the scene playing out. Plus, the characters are captivating, funny and completely human.

He's one of the most prolific writers of our time and the fact that he was able to turn out 620 pages after being almost killed by a car is pretty awesome. I really enjoyed the book. I've seen a change in the way that King is writing: a more mature, psychological aspect as opposed to the jump out and scare you tactics of some of his earlier novels.Yes, this book was rather reminiscent of an episode of the X-Files, but Dreamcatcher did catch me and hold me until the end. I figure if one has nightmares after reading a Stephen King book, or can't sleep, then it's a good book. There were several nights when this happened to me.

I decided to give \\"Dreamcatcher\\" a try, and was disappointed in it as well. It took a couple of hundred pages before I could keep the four main characters straight, and King's characterizations were always one of his strongest points - you got to know the main characters, and truly cared about what happened to them. I also found the symptoms of infection to the alien virus (extreme flatulence and giving \\"birth\\" to the monsters from the bowels) to be kind of juvenile. Surely King can be a bit more creative than that! Quite a few sections seemed like they could have been co-written by Chris Carter, as they were so close to \\"X-Files\\" episodes. After making it all the way to the end (572 pages in the edition I read), I found the conclusion very confusing and unsatisfying. I realize that King wrote \\"Dreamcatcher\\" as he was recovering from the terrible accident that thankfully didn't kill him, and I'm thrilled to see him back in action. Taking this novel on its own merit, however, it just isn't one of King's better books."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's been a long time since I've had &quot;scary&quot; dreams from reading Stephen King's books &amp; as I was nearing the end of the story, I dozed off &amp; was awakened a few hours later from a scary dream.

It was like a fruit salad (parts and pieces) of his other stories and lacked it's ability to stand on it's own. Sometimes less is better, and even though I love a long read, \\"Dreamcatcher\\" needed to be downsized and rehabed into something a little clearer and crisper.Why have all of Stephen's books gotten progressively more infected with profanity? I'm not a prude, but knowing a million ways to rhyme the f-word and other crude language really doesn't captivate me.

The first section was true King, but later King's muse dies. I truly wish he could have maintained the momentum as I felt deflated when I realized this book was going nowhere interesting.

Mr. Gray is a fascinating character, and the battle between he and Jonesy is really good stuff.I think that King has his work cut out for him in that the standard of his early work was so high, we're judging his new books against nearly impossible to reach standards. It's a compliment to the overall quality of its work, but it must be tough being your own hard act to follow."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is the absolute best.

It was excellent. Dreamcatcher is about life and it's meaning, about governmental conspiracy and constitutional betrayal, about friendship, and about the continuing battle with our foes from outer space.Stephen King has mastered his skill of character development. I related to some of his main characters, while others, I've actually met--even the psychopaths. Incredible.You would think the guy would have ran out of ideas by now, but his use of symbolism hasn't spoiled. Yes, DreamCatcher has much symbolism that makes the story complex and hard to understand off hand, which some might find distasteful, but it is genuine and profound nonetheless. The symbolism, in fact, is the basis of this thought provocative story.Readers who prefer original King might find the story a struggle, but you can still see him here and there. There are a lot of wonderfully made visual effects in this story, that are quite gory and painful. And the way some parts were written was far from anything John Irving. This book contains a ton of profanity, makes lewd remarks, and explains how boy children loose their innocence rather rapidly. This story would most certainly make upscale morality freaks cringe...unless their curious and want to explore a little.I hear a lot of people complain that this story is just a re-make of his book TommyKnockers. It is not. It's a continuation, almost, in the same way Insomnia is a subdivision to his Dark Tower series. All his books, in fact, are linked in one way or another, and that's more a attribute than it is a flaw, because it makes all his stories into a single entity, and that shows good character with a lot of game. Thank you."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's unfair to call Dreamcatcher a return to form for Stephen King. His last few books, particularly Bag of Bones and Hearts in Atlantis, have been pretty great. But Dreamcatcher plays to his particular strengths (a minimalist setting, near telephatic rapport with his characters) while downplaying his more annoying mannerisms (endless pop culture name dropping, literal deus ex machina). The end result is an incredibly disgusting, breathlessly exciting, and suprisingly moving combination of horror, sci-fi, action, and pathos that recalls his glory days of a decade or more ago.The shocks start early and never let up, King's imagination firing on overdrive to create two intriguing mysteries, the nature of his alien Grays and the powerful telepathic link between his heroes, that will be revealed in a single hellish night. One could argue that the book runs a little long, but we don't read King for concision -- here he provides the same exhilarating, cinematic experience with which he first made his name."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This novel of Stephen King was the first book by him I have read. Having tried to read a few others and turned off by them, I was hesitant to buy it, but not seeing anything else at the airport bookstore of particular interest and needing something to read on a flight, I picked it up. Almost instantly, you're drawn into the mindsets of four men who often look back into the childhood of their lives. It's a fascinating voyage through their past with some warped adventures going on in the present. I don't think the vivid imagery of the bathroom scene will ever leave my mind. Stephen King in this book excellently pulls you into the story and gives you detailed images of everything that is going on. I could almost feel the pain in my own knee that was felt by one of the characters scrambling to get some beer.The book is great. The story is captivating, and the imagery is detailed. Try this book NOW!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's understandable that you might not have gotten the information out of the audio tape but don't review a book from it. All the information that people said was lacking was told in the book. The weasels are bacteria that lives in the body till too big than break out (he compared their stages in the body to active yougurt bacteria cultures). The differences between the byrus and the weasels were also described in detail in the book. This was an awesome book to read and it &quot;read very quickly.&quot; I could not get through the entire Stand because it got predictable after the groups of good and bad people met up respectively. This book was MUCH BETTER because it wasn't as predictable (for me anyway). If you like books that aren't predictable like I do, you will love this book along with his other lesser known book Desperation. Don't pass this one up on a review based on an audio tape!!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This was a great read. Its remeniscent or even connected to some of his other works, like The Stand, IT, and the Tommyknockers, but is unique from the three. The plot was rich and the characters interesting; the only drawback I found was the ending which seemed a little too neat and clean. I think King ended it leaving too many questions, although maybe he has sequal in mind? I was curious about how public the whole alien thing ended up, what the government was planning to do after, and the maybe psychic connection with Jonesy's child left me wondering.I really liked the battle between Mr. Gray/the byrus and Jonsey in Jonseys mind. Wonderful overall and I would highly recommend reading this interesting book.I am also intersted if King has an IT sequal in mind; to those who have read the book you know what I mean (what was scralled on the standpipe plaque made me wonder!)"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It was definitely good for Stephen King to write this book while recovering from his catastrophic accident, and he has translated some of his pain and agony in the book, especially in the form of one of the main characters, Jonesy, who has also been hit by a car. True King fans will send their best wishes in this regard, but unfortunately, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is one of the weakest King books I have read (and I've read at least 22 of them). The problem here is a major shortage of ideas, believable characters, and suspense.First, this book is basically a rehash of several earlier King works. Once again we get to sit through the concept of childhood friends with a special, psychic bond that lasts into adulthood. King has already beaten this concept to death in &quot;It,&quot; &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; and who knows where else, and here he destroys this tired concept once and for all (I hope). This book also displays one of King's longtime weaknesses - telling big chunks of the story through flashbacks. The main plotline of aliens attempting to take over humanity, but being thwarted by their own weaknesses and the unexpected resilience of humans, was already used in &quot;Tommyknockers,&quot; and much better. The main characters here (except possibly Duddits) are very narrowly defined and stereotypical, and are hard to empathize with. Worst yet are the two useless bad guys, the military commander Kurtz (ridiculously insane and narrow-minded) and his assistant Freddy (completely devoid of independent thought). These two guys are completely impossible to believe, and their presence doesn't even make that much sense to the story line. It's as if King felt the need to add two bad guys just because he thought it was necessary, and their function in the story seems like little more than a weak afterthought.This book is also annoyingly slow-moving and devoid of suspense, especially with the tedious and never-ending chase scene that makes up a large portion of the book. King attempts to add suspense by moving the action along very slowly. That sometimes works (in the King classics), but here it's just tedious and misguided. You will also be distressed by this book's reliance on gross-out tactics, with belching, farting, and puking being major parts of the plot. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; would be a presentable novel by most other writers. But as part of King's fearsome overall career, it's mediocre at best."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I can read King's work all day long, he is a quick and enjoyable read, but this book had me thinking that it was written to fill a publisher's quota for 2001. The character's childhood friendships could have been developed more and I found the characters had no depth at all. I had to finish the book, but I felt like King forgot he already wrote &quot;IT&quot; and was trying to capture the same glory."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher, Stephen King's journey back to his horror roots, is the story of 4 childhood friends and alien invasion. Dreamcatcher is a trip back to King to what made him famous and well-loved. A novel of pure horror and adventure. This novel is not about psychological terror the many other new paths of horror that King has tried to write. This is novel of pure action and horror. A nice simple plot involving 4 childhood friends and aliens.In this novel, King once again proves that he is the master of modern American writing. No one can write American venacular better than Stephen King (a Mark Twain of our time). This book reads like a conversation with an old friend. Never do you stumble on complex words or phrases. Each word he chooses is the correct word for the implied meaning.However, that said, this book, although quite enjoyable, is 200 or 300 pages too long. The feelings of dread, ickiness, pure terror, and great friendship, are drowned in too may words. This novel would have been superb if only King could learn to write concisely. He needs to discover what is needed to say, not what he wants to say. Never in this book are wondering what characters are thinking at all times, he tells you. This book is worth reading, however, remember at times you are going to get bogged down by his incescent need to explain everything. King needs to harken back to his roots of HP Lovecraft and remember what did. Sometimes the scariest things that happen in writing is what is never written, just implied."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's true. This is not the best of King's work, and shouldn't be read by someone who's never undertaken Stephen King before, but if you're a fan of King, then it's worth the time to read. The flash back scenes are some of my favorite moments in the book, and I liked the characters. I think why a lot people don't really care for this particular book is because there's something in the pace of it that isn't usual for King's works. Which, is a turn off, especially if you're interested in a quick juicy read. What makes this book worth it, is the tone. There's something in the words, descriptions, situations, dialogue that shows a lot about the writer. He's there in the pages, and he's worth it. Anyway, it's a Stephen King book for goodness sakes, how can you go wrong?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King has a proven track record as one of the world's most popular fiction writers; unfortunately he is also one of the most self-indulgent. His books are gigantic sprawling blobs, rather like the rapacious alien fungus set to devour the world in Dreamcatcher. Sometimes he can't even contain himself within even a trilogy--the Dark Tower series advanced its plot not at all in his most recent (fourth) installment. In his continuing battles with the publishing world, his fans often come out the losers. It is they who ended up paying three times as much for the six installment version of The Green Mile than if King had originally released it as a traditional novel; and anyone who had faith in King and bought the internet version of The Plant simply got ripped off, as he never finished it.Dreamcatcher continues along this self-indulgent path. Although there's a good story under all the fatty layers of excessive prose, it is a story King's fans have read before--sort of Stand By Me meets The Tommyknockers. King's style is full of self-reference--I counted at least four completely irrelevant references to other King books. He loves to bury the reader in detail; at its best this technique brings the characters to life, but too often simply distracts from the storyline. Although no one could truthfully say that his books are predictable, King is so fond of foreshadowing that we know well in advance what is coming. He also uses a changing point of view that allows him to move the story around from the original four characters to a situation completely unknown to them about one-third of the way through the book--a lurch I found quite awkward. I wonder how different, how much more compact and perhaps more compelling the book might have been if it had been told only from the viewpoint of the four friends, without ever introducing the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish villain Kurtz. (Given that some of those original characters die early on, it might have been quite a challenge!)But King fans are all familiar with these foibles, and they seem to forgive him all. He knows how to reward his readers with little pats on the back for keeping up with him--the self-references are surely there for his die-hard fans as much as for himself, and asides like \\"Gray\\" and \\"Gary\\" being anagrams, or Kurtz as a pseudonym from Apocalypse Now and The Heart of Darkness make the astute reader feel just a little bit special.In his afterward, King talks about the book as a vehicle for his pain; it seems to me that there is quite a bit of anger there too, and even contempt. The presence of these emotions, though, gives the book some strength that puts it above much of his other writing. Still, I have to hope that his pain will burn away some of the excessive gigantism; I far prefer the leaner, more intimate King of works like Misery and Thinner."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The reunion of four old friends from Derry, Maine, is ruined when two of them are in a road accident caused by an oblivious woman pedestrian. The woman harbors an alien fungus, that mutates in the body into a dangerous life-form, something like a razor-toothed weasel. Before too long, the thing erupts from her body and goes on a killing spree. But that is only the beginning of troubles: the isolated cabin in the woods where the friends planned to reunite is surrounded by a military cordon, publicly denying local UFO activity while secretly rounding-up into camps all infected humans.This book contains some of King's best characters and writing, and is quite well-plotted. It has a major underlying flaw, which is the handling of the aliens. King isn't consistent, or terribly coherent, in explaining the extraterrestrial threat. He also employs a telepathic plot device that becomes terribly confusing to follow, though with a little effort the reader can overcome it. It is also - like virtually all of King's fiction - far longer than it really wants to be, suffering from a great deal of unnecessary padding, though it has less redundancy than many of the author's other works.In brief: a typically good King read, short on logic or coherence but very strong on character and plot."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"When Stephen King tackles Alien Invasion, you can be sure not to expect E.T., Close Encounters or Independence Day (even though all are referenced by characters), expect.... bowel movements. Sure, it sounds ridiculous just saying it, but in the context of the story and in the hands of King, it's quite terrifying.But aside from that, the story is about a special bond between four friends, strengthened by a fifth. We start out with our heros as adults, troubled in their own ways, joining together for their annual hunting trip. This is when weird things begin. Through all of this, we see flashbacks of their childhood that make you care more for our crew. You see their general &quot;goodness&quot; in these scenes. And you're scared about what may happen to them now.Enter the army, led by Abraham Kurtz. We'll just say he's not all there and he's a delight to read. As is his right hand man, Owen Underhill, who may or may not be on his boss's good side.Characters and storylines meet, revelations are uncovered and an alien takes over someone's body. This leads to some good cat and mouse moments in the person's mind. And through it all, King entertains us while keeping a sense of impending doom over the story as the pages fly by.So, yeah, I guess you could say I got a kick out of Dreamcatcher and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Typically, my time spent on a Stephen King novel goes something like this:Day 1: one hundred pages (man, is that the time, I should've known better than to start a King book so late.)Day 2: three hundred pages.Day 2 and a half: well past bedtime, finish the book.With Dreamcatcher, day one was the exact same, but at the end of day two, I was okay to move on into day three and then day four. It felt a little like going on an easter egg hunt, but having all those little plastic eggs filled with nothing but emptiness. Not to say that the book is bad, it just drags. The car chase at the end is nearly 150 pages long. There is a sense that King thinks he is kicking the action up a notch every fifty pages or so, but he isn't... a very distinct interest plateau was reached early on. Solutions might have been to cut a few hundred pages, as another reviewer suggested, or to time out some of the key moments a little better. Once more, a certain amount of repitition is good... a certain amount of repitition is good... a certain amount of repitition is good... but Dreamcatcher has too much.All that said, I must make the similar atonement as do other reviewers here: I am a Stephen King fan. I read all of his books, and always will. I grade him against himself. If someone came to me and asked, should I read this book, holding aloft Dreamcater, I would absolutely tell them yes. Also, the afterword that 'reveals' King's state during the writing of this novel is unneccesary. It was obvious to me that he was in great pain as he wrote. This book is filled with physical pain. Never have I read more about excrement in my entire life. It sounds funny, but if ever there was a novel about farting, this is it. It so lends itself to a smelly, stale, and painful hospital room that it is no surprise to me that it was written in one - - and by hand.Here's to long life and a terrific recovery by the great master!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While I may not be the biggest Stephan King fan there is, I'm certainly in the top half. I've read most all of his books and seen many of his films.I'd anticipated owning (and reading) DreamCatcher for some time but hadn't gotten around to buying it. Finally, in view of a lengthy trip in the Far East, I purchased the book for reading while on the plane.The novel starts off in typical King fashion with introductions to the primary players; Pete, Jonesy, Henry and Beaver. However, the initial sections seem a little diffuse and hard to follow. After the first few chapters; however, the pace picks up -- thankfully.Much of the book seems to reflect themes of other books or films - notably 'Tommyknockers', 'Alien', and 'It'. Most interesting of all the characters is Kurtz who is introduced later in the story and is a study of a deadly psychopath.All in all, the book is not bad (after all, it's a Stephan King work, right?), but it's not as good as I had expected. If you're a seasoned King reader, buy it because the author always has interesting twists to write about and will eventually submerge you in the tale. However, if this is to be your first encounter with SK, then try one of his better works first (I'd recommend either 'The Stand' or 'It'). It will keep from turning you off to an excellent writer and storyteller.** recommended with reservations **"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm not suprised that this book got some bad reviews. I know when I started reading it that it was definitely a little different from other King books. The main thing that suprised me was the amount of bodily function humor. The other reviewer that mentioned how it was similar to so many other of his books (Tommyknockers, It, The Stand), hit it right on the head, and that's what makes it so interesting. He combined some of the best parts of each to make a completely different story that keeps you going until you reach the end.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is brutal and gory and I can't imagine it if it becomes a movie, but I would love to see it anyway. My opinion is that if you like the other books I mentioned earlier, then I can't see why you wouldn't like this book. Make sure you have some time to read it, because you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"No, Dreamcatcher is not the best SK book ever written, by far. However, it is really quite entertaining just the same. In fact, if I had read this book by any other author, I would have given it four stars. I gave the book three because I know that SK is capable of better.Unlike some reveiwers, I did not find the beginning of the book tedious at all. In fact, I thought that is was the very best part of the book. I loved the development of the characters and their relationships. I was not at all offended by the foul language, I found it completely appropriate to the characters and their setting (four guys hanging out without their parents/wives/society, of course it's going to become foul, I would think it odd if it did not). For those who don't like the alien birth scenes from the Aliens movies, don't read this book.Similiar to other reviewers, I did have some problems with the ending of this book. While I didn't find the chase scene as unnecessary as some, I did think the inclusion of the Kurtz character and his fellows was. Kurtz was never really developed enough for me to care much about him one way or the other, so I did find his inclusion in the scene a bit tedious. What should have been a chase scene about good guys trying to stop a bad guy from doing something turned into good guys, chasing a bad guy, while being chase by other, but different, bad guys. It doesn't look good even in that simplified format, does it?I actually like the part of the book that included Jonesy trapped in him \\"mind warehouse/safehouse\\". I thought it cool to watch him and Mr. Gray play with each others minds. The parts where Mr.Gray learns about sensory input include gorging on bacon and loving it(something many of us can relate to), except when he tries to eat it raw.Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the ending when we find out that Mr.Gray is supposedly only a figment of Jonesey's imagination. It felt to me like a rushed in last minute idea for a plot twist that wasn't terribly well thought out. Nevermind that it wasn't terribly well written out, either. Not one of SK's finer moments.I also had similiar feeling about the end business of Duddits, a really great character, having been the one who killed Richie (a plot point that wasn't really annoying, but was completely unnecessary) and the boys having been \\"used\\". Again, felt like a last minute idea thrown in without thought.Overall, I say that this book is entertaining and worth a read. It is not one of SK's better books. There are a few places where the plot is unclear (I suspect even to itself) and some things didn't need to be at all. Still, it's a fun and entertaining book just the same. So, like I titled my review, SK is like chocolate, even when he's bad (for SK, who is held to a higher standard), he's still good (very entertaining read)."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First let me say that I have been an avid reader of Stephen King novels for many years, with classics like Christine and Salems Lot being old friends to be reread ever few years.I'm afraid the same can't be said about Dreamcatcher. If I was asked to summarise the style of the book, it would have to be as the literary equivilent of a B-grade slasher movie, with bad overacting and plenty of gore to try and keep the readers attention.Earlier SK books have a depth that totally entraps the reader. The multiple layers and inter-twined stories of Christine, the charactor development within The Dead Zone, even the inner turmoil of Gerald's Game.Dreamcatcher comes across to me as very shallow. The charactor development is minimal, the story line barely hangs together, and the bulk seems to be made of overly lurid descriptions of what blood and bodies look like. I understand you have a phrase in the USA describing this kind of offering... something about Phoning It In???I will still buy his next book in the hopes he develops a bit more pride in his work, but this was disappointing."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I chose the title of this review specifically to reflect how I felt about the book. It is the first of King's books I have read in a long while that I haven't really struggled to finish, although it took a little while to get going. As some reviewers have noted, it is a return to his more horror orientated roots and I am not ashamed to say hoorah for that, just because it's horror doesn't mean it's not good, or doesn't have an underlying meaning. I'm fed up with readers who get all snooty and literary and regard horror writing as inferior, go read something else if that's your problem. Stephen King is a horror writer, like it or not.There are echo's of some of Kings previous works for sure, but most of his books have some recognisable traits about them. At least, unlike Hearts in Atlantis, it had a beginning a middle and an end that were all related.If you enjoyed Tommyknockers and Christine more than Dolores Clairbone and Geralds game, you should enjoy this one, for me a return to form, but you can't please all the people..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Like most of Stephen King's work, DreamCatcher is a very original story that is hard to forget once you have finished. There are certain parts of the story that jump out and grab you. Stephen King has said in many ways,Dreamcatcher is a mean book. He's right...DreamCatcher goes for the jugular and doesnt hold back. Hands down, Dreamcatcher is flat out GROSS. This was one of those stories that made me feel sick and uncomfortable. Translation, Stephen King Delivers the Goods! Great bleak story from King Writimus Maximus. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This was the first book by Stephen King I have ever read.

I looved reading this book, and if you don't know which book to buy this is a good choice!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King's characters stick with you. His attention to detail and the real life human traits he gives his 'fictional' characters make it hard to believe they're not walking off the page. It's more than the horror and suspense, there's a special quality that he gives to a novel that forces it to linger.I'll admit that I never start a Stephen King novel unless I have hours of free time to read it, or can pull a late nighter, because I'm not going to put it down for long. Whenever he features a book dealing with aliens and the state of Maine, I have to chuckle.

I had seen the movie first so you can see where the slowness can be felt. Although seemingly slow, the book made far more sense than the movie did and that was a definite plus. When we get to what I would consider the final scenes of the movie, there were still 300 pages to go.Four men grew up together in the small town of Derry (home of IT). For a while there were five as they befriended a Downs syndrome boy who was being tortured by some older boys. But eventually they grew up and left him mostly behind. Now they are on an annual hunting trip and they are all thinking of him. But while they are hunting strange events occur involving lights in the sky and missing hunters.Soon it becomes apparent that all is not well with the world and aliens may be involved. The military moves in to contain the situation and the four use their own special talents to try and get through and fix the situation. Eventually it is discovered just what is going on and the roles they will play. The fate of the world may hang on their abilities.Long and sometimes slow, King wrote this by hand (with a fountain pen) while recuperating from his injuries. King admits he may have put a little of his pain in the book. Actually, he put a lot of it in and even included the accident itself. This is not a happy book where the heroes have it easy. Instead everyone has real hardships to deal with and to try and overcome. But in the end I was glad I read it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Two years ago I saw this book at a bookstore with \\"The International Bestseller\\" printed on its cover. I bought the book, hoping it'd draw me into another world like many other Stephen King books have. But after 5 pages, I put it down because it was boring.Last week, I took the book from the bookshelf and forced myself to read it. There are a few fascinating bits within, like how Jonesy, Pete, Beaver and Henry met Duddits, but the book has generally been tedious to read (and I'm only halfway through).The massive amount of jumping back and forth through time is confusing. Some parts of the book just seem like rambling and fluff.I'm a Stephen King fan, but this book is a little disappointing. I'd recommend The Shining, The Bachman Books and IT to first time King readers."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Exceptional audio reading by Jeffrey DeMunn! I wish I knew his e-mail address , or he had a web site, so I could express my compliments. Mr. DeMunn's reading makes my commuting a great pleasure.I'm listening to it over and over again. The narration is exceptional. The voice is extraordinarily pleasant and clear, and every character has a very distinguishable voice. This Audio CD could be used by ESL programs; just listen to it over and over again and your English will surely improve.The writing of Dreamcatcher is very good also, otherwise I wouldn't be able to listen to it over and over and over.."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book was probably the most creative King has ever written, with the most pyscological metaphors and interesting ideas. I would reccommend this book for its imagination, if nothing else.Good: The charachters are sufficeintly likable, and it is not really predictable, the writing is good, the ideas are great, finally the story is engaging and originalBad : Some of the scenes are unnessescary gross and graphic, not really that scary if thats what you are looking for, really long when it didnt have to beGood or Bad ? : Is it just me or does stephen king have an obsession with flatulence........ In Hearts of Atlantis, he devoted a chapter to farting, and in this book, half of it is people passing gas .....................Overall, this book is creative and compelling, but it has its flaws"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher was another one of the great works of the lengendary horror story writer Steven King. In this book we are introduced to many interesting characters named Pete, Douglas a.k.a \\"Duddits\\", Beaver, and Jonesy. Who have been best friends since childhood. These characters also share a special telepathic ability that enables them all to see into the future.The story begins when two friends decide to take a weekend vacation in the alaksan wilderness and stay in a large wooden cabin. Little did they know this wooden vastness is a quarantined spot for a mysterious disease that has taken a large toll on the population of humans and animals alike. Little do they know, that this disease is caused by mimicking aliens that attempt to take over/destroy earth.The main character Pete, changes to Duddits(a mentally challenged adult) by the end of the story. Another character is a head strong military Colonel Abraham Curtis that believes anyone and everyone that shows the slightest symtoms of anyone in a 15 mile radius of the quarantined area deserved to be killed and not even considered for treatment for medical professionals. Also, these unfortunate people could make contact with family members even by phone conservations. Instead they were trapped like pigs waiting to be slaughtered.I would say the theme of the book is to...'keep your friends but your enemies closer'. I would reccommend this book to be read by mature audiences.(12+)And also for people who love exciting,horror novels."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"What I liked most about this suspense thriller was the plot line and how the story unfolds as Stephen King dramatizes the twists of the movie. I love the character duddits in the book with his unknown backround that all makes sence at the end of the book. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone who loves outerworld happenings. The way the plot unfolds with the group of characters going out on a camping trip and suddenly the forest lifes starts trailing away from something that takes over thier friends body. Throughout the book Stephen King keeps with his writing style of present day to what happened to get to this point of the book. Its a great read, but very very long. The book does have elevated diction so I would challenge many to read it. Again great book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Hearing about the book Dreamcatcher from my friends, I assumed it was a great read and I look forward to reading it before ever opening it. After the first six chapters, the book was really boring me. If it weren't for the fact I had to write a book report on Dreamcatcher for my class, I would have quit reading it right away. A couple of parts were interesting, but the alien conflict was little to none. I guess you could say Stephen King caught the wrong dream to write about this time."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book took me three days to read. I watched the sun come up because i simply couldn't put it down. This book is a really good read. he character development is incredible and it is easy to become lost in the pages cheering. Some sections had me laughing out loud. I don't want to give away any of the book, but from a person who has read many if not all of Stephen King's works, I rate it with Bag of Bones, and the Stand."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Oh,joy!!! In DREAMCATCHER Stephen King has once more staged a literary coup!! All of the qualities that earned him the title of Premier Horror-Suspense novelist of our generation (in classics like The Shining and The Stand) have re-emerged, and come to maturity! This is a wild tale of wonderful psychological depth, awe-inspiring imagination, and visceral intensity. When The Stand came out, I read the entire book in one night and part of a day, and reading Dreamcatcher has renewed my faith that not all modern writers are destined to simply ebb and wane once their 'peak' has been achieved. Mr. King brings out all the stops, eloquently and with a new sensitivity and insight. The King has NOT left the building, folks!!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First let me say that this book gripped me like no other Steven King book for a long while - perhaps as long as ten years. That said, I sometimes felt as if I were reading an amalgam of Steve King's greatest hits.The book that this resembles most closely is IT. The author as much as acknowledges this, by putting some specific references to the IT events in this book. We have a group of middle aged friends, drawn back to their childhood home in Maine by unfinished business. We also have:- Evil invaders from outer space taking over people (Tommyknockers) - An idiot savant whose special gifts help conquer evil (M-O-O-N, that spells Tom Cullin in The Stand) - Low grade telepathy that comes and goes (many King books, back to the Dead Zone) - An evil Army man, more interested in covering up and settling scores than solving the problem (also reminds me of The Stand.)Anyway, you get the idea. A lot of familiar elements for the long time King fan. No problem there really, because otherwise the author seems close to the top of game. The thing I like best about Steven King is his well developed and all too human characters. When he's on a roll, King puts together characters as interesting as any created by anyone writing today. He definitely gets on a roll with this book. His action is also compelling and engaging, with a fitting climax.I disagree with those who found the book overlong. When the man is rolling, let him roll, and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I had a free weekend coming up and decided to pop for the hard cover price of Stephen Kings latest effort, Dreamcatcher. My advice to hardecore SK fans is to save your money and wait for the paperback.Plotline is such. We have childhood friends on a hunting trip who have a certain bond(remember IT)from their childhood experiences and space aliens who take over bodies (remember The Tommyknockers) with the storyline moving back and forth from the friends' childhod to the present and the so called threat to the world from the aliens.This book, unlike most of SK's previous efforts was not scary and even a bit tedious in places making it hard for me to keep my concentration much less interest.If you like to read about alien controlled bodies with a bad case of flatulence and something growing inside (Remember Aliens 1,2,&amp;3), then this book is for you.This book feels like an effort to fullfill a contract requirement. It is a mismash of two of SK's previous efforts i.e. IT and The Tommyknockers, which I enjoyed and the &quot;Alien&quot; movies with Sigourney Weaver"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The Dreamcatcher started out great! The pace was good, the content exciting and building and then BANG! Everything stopped dead and this book got boring, boring, boring. Plus, it made me feel bad. Usually King's books either excite, scare, or make you want to duck under the covers. This book just felt bad.The pace picked up some further on, but it really never got it's rhythm back. I usually can't put a Stephen King book down, this one took me a couple of weeks to finish. What a disappointment. Stephen....what were you thinking? It does have a certain feeling of the book &quot;IT&quot;, a little Langoliers and a few other of his books. I felt like I was reading Stephen King's version of the movie &quot;Aliens&quot;. I bought it because I buy all his books for my library. But, it wasn't one of his best."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm not a devotee of Stephen King. I don't pick up everything he writes. I generally approach things on a book by book basis. The allien attack plot of Dream Catcher grabbed my attention so I picked it up. I'm glad I did. Dream Catcher is over 600 pages. SO it's quite a long read but it's worth it. The alien scenes are handled with a very dreamy,ethereal, and bizare quality that worked. Also King puts a disturbing and creepy take on burp and fart jokes in the book. But for me the real strength of Dream Catcher is the characters and their realtionships. King as he is so good at doing details the child hood experiences of the four main characters and how they saved a retarded child from bullys and became his friend. The scenes involving Duddits are incredibly touching. Dream Catcher is one of the Better Stephen King books I have read. It's worth the time. And the last two hundred pages fly. Due to a long and exciting chase and a slam-bang climax."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"What a disappointment. I read Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and the ebook The Plant. When I heard the title I got excited; I love the concept of dreamcatcher. After feeling the improvement in his writing style I just couldn't wait to read Dreamcatcher. It had everything you could ask for in a nightmare: Aliens, Boggymen, Crazy Army Brass, Plague, Chases. Once I started I realized it had a problem, the writing was lengthy. King was drumming his narative painfully slow. It was driving me up the walls. All I can say: &quot;Stephen get rid of the fountain pen.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"There is something about diving into a King novel that is like nothing else! I have read everything Mr. King has ever written, and for the most part, I love his writing, his sense of humor, his characterization. I was a little disappointed when I started this novel, like everyone else, I was anticipating another &quot;It&quot;, or &quot;Stand&quot;, but as I got into it(200 pgs. or so), I found that I was coming to know the characters, and getting involved in their lives. I love the King-isms of all his books and I just enjoyed being with him again through another story. True fans of King will like this book for that reason only. Anyone who hasn't read King, should not start with this novel; this is for true King lovers only."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Mr. King has done it again. The Dreamcatcher is a spellbinding book. While I would agree that this book is not his BEST book ever (It, The Stand, and the Gunslinger Series are), it is till a solid piece of work. King has a real knack for creating characters for which the reader really cares. Read it, you will not be sorry. I genuinely enjoyed reading this book. My only regret is that I finished the book way too fast (5 days), and now have to wait till September 15, 2001 till his other book, The Black House comes out. Get The Dreamcatcher and you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Under the most liberal of interpretations, I would not qualify as a devotee of Stephen King. From time to time he has served as a nice change of pace for me. I found DREAMCATCHER to be a pretty good story and a fun book to read.It appeared to me King borrowed from a number of others, often paying tribute along the way, but the application of his personal spin deflected any concerns about &quot;I've heard this one before.&quot; Two things I personally found creative were the warehousing aspect of our memory storage and the character of 'Duddits Cavell', a sort of Down's syndrome-afflicted Navajo translator of the mind-meld set.I really cannot tell you if King is back, I never knew he left. All I can say is this is a book that will not disappoint anyone looking for a good old fashioned &quot;us vs. them&quot; scary story."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Finally, Stephen King reverts back to the style (or topics) that made him one of my favorite authors. Recent books like Bag of Bones and Hearts in Atlantis to me came across as a forum for King's own maturation and reflections on the development of his life through childhood, adulthood and current events. Good, but not the stuff that kept me reading and re-reading earlier books like The Stand, It and The Tommyknockers. This book sounds more like the Stephen King I know and love (although you definitely see signs of the ordeal he conquered after the car accident) -- it has a great voice, quick pace, and utterly horrifying plot developments and scenes. I literally had to put the book down several times because I was so scared/horrified by the scene playing out. Plus, the characters are captivating, funny and completely human. Overall, a great read to the very end. Definitely a book you will read late into the night, and then have dreams (or nightmares) about. King is the master and is back in full force!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"(SLIGHT SPOILERS)I'm a stephen king fan. I will gladly defend the body of his work to all the literary snobs who seem to foolishly believe that commercial success and mass appeal equal artistic compromise and marginal talent. I will go so far as to say that i believe that he will be remembered as one of, if not THE, greatest american writer of the 20th century; not because he writes scary books, but because he tells good stories. William Shakespeare wrote plays to pay the bills, and they happened to be popular. His work has survived while most of his contemporaries, despite being more \\"critically acclaimed,\\" have faded from history. I feel the same about the majority of Mr. King's work.But not all of it.I can't explain this book. I can't imagine what made the story seem worth telling to the author. I can't imagine what made it seem marketable to the publisher (well, yes I can: the byline). I think Mr. King has reached the unfortunate level of wild success where the people whose job it is to rein in and direct his talent feel either unwilling or unable to do so. Somewhere, somebody, sometime, should have read this book and said, \\"Steve, what's this ABOUT?\\" Not because it's hard to follow (quite the opposite). But it's nothing more than a collection of hackneyed, B-movie elements swizzled together, resulting in a confused and, frankly, boring albatross of a novel.The beginning is promising enough--I was willing to revisit the \\"childhood friends with an uncommon bond who face the bad guy as adults\\" idea from \\"IT,\\" because that worked the first time. It fails rather miserably on this go-round, however. The characters are wooden, and largely unbelievable: more \\"types\\" than real people. Their banter is contrived and unrealistic: phrases intended to be unique and engaging (\\"Same S**t, Different Day,\\" and \\"No Bounce, No Play\\") repeat themselves with irritating frequency and detract from rather than add to the humanity of the characters. Nobody talks like this, ever. And if they do, it makes me not like them, and I don't care when aliens pop out of their rectums.The antagonists are a mishmash of archetypes: a race of aliens, spreading like a virus, intent on inhabiting our planet (after making a few changes); the crazy, flag-waving, sadistic military man, intent on exterminating the threat, and covering up the fallout at any price (he has his own stash of silly stock phrases: \\"laddy-buck\\" pops up about every other line of dialogue).This book has the same flavor as the Tommyknockers--after a few hundred pages, the reader gets that sinking feeling that people stuck in elevators get: we should be getting somewhere by now, but it feels like we're right where we started; and unlike an elevator ride, the trip's supposed to be the best part.The story is just BAD. It's been said (about a thousand times) that this was Mr. King's cathartic attempt to exorcise some of the demons hanging around after his brush with death. If it's true that this book was necessary to get him back in the saddle, then it's worth every page of subpar narrative and ridiculous dialogue. But there's no reason to publish it, or to purchase it.I was a little worried after reading this one (and \\"Black House\\") that Mr. King's narrative genius had somehow been lost or amputated after his near-death experience. I'm pleased to say that no longer appears to be the case: \\"From a Buick 8\\" and the final three \\"Dark Tower\\" novels are beyond fantastic. For a guy who's published dozens of best-sellers, I'm more than willing to forgive the occasional creative hiccup."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King does it again! Dreamcatcher is now a best selling book and major motion picture. When four lifelong friends leave for their annual hunting trip, they expect the regular weekend at their cabin. But disaster strikes when a lost man shows up asking for help. Not long after, they are caught in the \\"Dreamcatcher\\" with old secrets coming back. Then one question remains... will the special retarded boy from their past be able to save the world?Unlike most other alien science fictions, this novel pictures what could actually happen if this were to actually happen. Take the government for examples, in most science fictions they are acting for the best of the people, which we all know isn't always true; this novel describes how corrupt the government can be and what it may cost the world. Moreover, the aliens in this novel weren't the common green, little dudes with ray guns, they were nothing more than an infection lead by grey beings who could dispose of their body once in order to enter the mind of another being; thus it gives the possibility that perhaps if there is life outside Earth, it doesn't have to be smart, just conquerors who instead of being smart themselves use the weaker species to do all the dirty work. It shows that the smartest way isn't always a full on attack but an unnoticed plague. So if aliens ever do invade us, you can put your money that it'll something similar to what the King writes.Stephen King has definitely reached the goal for the book; he has succeeded in penetrating the deepest weaknesses and fears of the reader. The books elements greatly aided in accomplishing the purpose; suspense, fright, and death all ended up with the same result, which was the goal of the King. Thus, it made this a great midnight reader for those who enjoy a good spook.However I must point out the differences between the movie and the book. Hands down, the book is much better; the movie is a simply not descriptive enough. If you dare see the movie and not read the book you will be missing out on more than half of the unseen truth. Unlike the movie, the novel has insights the inner struggles of the mind hostage Jonesy, which is the most frightening struggle in the plot. Moreover the book ties all loose ends, answering all questions you may have by the time you reach the end. In the words of Henry, \\"We Are a Species Living in the Dream Catcher\\""},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a big fan of Stephen King, and listen to his books on tape while driving to work. The Dreamcatcher was 16 cassettes, and took me a month to complete. What a waste of my time! The first half was great; Stephen King has a way of writing that makes me laugh out loud. His characters were real, and their thoughts and interactions were very humorous. The first half of the book flew by. Then came the second half......Slow moving and very complex. I think Mr. King tried to put too many different aspects into one book without considering some of the inconsistencies. For instance, did the weasel creatures hatch from eggs or develop inside a living host? I never quite understood the connection between the birus (forgive me if I spelled this incorrectly, but since I listened to this book on tape, I never saw the word actually written), the egg-laying &quot;space weasels&quot;, Mr. Gray, the Dreamcatcher, Duditz, and the telepathy. It was like Mr. King couldn't decide what to focus on, so he put EVERYTHING in. The last half of the book moved so incredibly slowly with so many different layers of plot that I became bored. I finished the book just because I hate to start a book and not finish it, but when all is said and done, I wish I had stopped reading when it first started getting tedious. Overall, The Dreamcatcher left a sour (and bored) taste in my mouth. My recommendation is that your time could be spent much more wisely than reading this book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have read every Stephen King book ever written and I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. Well, what a let down this was. Dreamcatcher was not a good book in my opinion. The start was great but after a while you get the feeling the author was just making it drag out to get the 600 words. This story could have been done in 300 words, it would have been better. All up I was seriously disappointed. The story line was totally unbelievable and way too far fetched. I didn't like it and would not recommend this book. It wasn't in the slightest bit scary. Disappointing!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"A pattern emerges when you begin to read reviews of King's work, and if the pattern bothers me, it must really annoy King himself. Of course it's a pattern that we in America apply to everything, not just to the master of horror. We use it to judge novelists, films, television, even our food. Is it the same? we ask. The same as everything else?Many writers, including some of my favorites (Robert B. Parker, Lawrence Block, John Sandford, among others) are content to establish a formula and stick with it, giving each of their books a comfortable sameness. King hasn't done this. Ever.If you go back about a dozen years or so, you'll see a very clear dividing line, a book called IT. That book changed King from a very good Horror writer into a very good WRITER, who happens to specialize in horror. Since then, each of his novels have represented an evolutionary leap forward in one manner or another.Dreamcatcher is no exception. A richly detailed look at friendships and how they change over the years and about the moments in life that can tie people together forever. When these friends refer to the one noble thing they've done in life, it's not with a back patting nod and an &quot;ain't we great&quot; smile. It's wistful and sad, that only once did they ever reach up out of themselves and do something noble. The events of the book give them one more chance to be noble.Dreamcatcher is a book about redemption, and it represents another fine step forward in the literary evolution of our finest writer."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"OK, let me start off by saying that I agree with many of the criticisms of this book. I kept thinking, this couldn't have been that hard to write, take a dash of 'It', a good helping of 'Tommynockers' and a seasoning of X-Files and you have 'Dreamcatcher' Not very original and plodding.On the other hand, King's character development and ability to bring his tales to life are still strong. It was a good read to while away my spare time on a recent European vacation.One point that I take exception with in many of the reviews is the seeming discounting of King by so many reviewers. One person comments that besides 'Dreamcatcher', 'It' is the only other book they have read or will read by King, another 'The Green Mile'. Need I remind the reviewers that this is the same writer that has brought us 'Carrie', 'Pet Semetary', 'The Stand', the Dark Tower series, amazing short story and novella collections and many other laudible tales. I agree that 'Dreamcatcher' is not one of his finest tales but we shouldn't discount King's past work and his high potential for the future.Also, for those readers who are disgruntled by many of the post-'Insomnia' books, I think we should all realize that King underwent a transformation in his writing with that book. In the past, he brought us his spin on all the classic horror tales and scared us senseless - 'The Shining', 'Salem's Lot'. Now he does focus much more on the human experience: life, love, childhood, hopes, dreams, fears. I personally don't see this as a letdown, I see it as his growth as a writer."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've read every Stephen King book. No lie, every damn one of them. And if you'd asked me a week ago which one I thought was the worst, I might not have been able to immediately choose; even the really bad ones, like The Tommyknockers and The Dark Half, gave me some amount of pleasure. Now, if you asked me, I'd immediately tell you: Dreamcatcher. It's the worst thing King has ever written.Some think King's gift is in creating horror: not so. King's real strength has always been in his creation of real, interesting, identifiable characters; it's only through placing such fully-fleshed characters in jeopardy that the horror works. The characters in Dreamcatcher are flimsy sketches at best, carbon copies of other, better King characters at worst. There's the Jokester (who, in one of King's dumbest inspirations ever, is named &quot;The Beaver&quot;), the Alcoholic, the Sucidal Depressive, and the One Who Got Hit By A Car. I never once cared about any of them; I hardly even cared enough to keep track of which one was which. I was rooting for them all to be killed off hundreds of pages before the conclusion of this bloated, tedious book.There are so many elements of other King novels rehashed in Dreamcatcher, King should sue himself for copyright infringement. You've got the aliens of Tommyknockers, the alcoholism of The Shining, the lone infected man who almost dies before infecting everyone else, straight out of The Stand, the premonitions of The Shining and The Dead Zone, the childhood flashback structure of It, the central evil figure who speaks in flippant colloquialisms, like The Stand to name just one, the out-of-control military man, the struggle against debilitating physical injury, the beatific &quot;special&quot; character, the battle for control of one's mind... King has re-used themes and elements often, but never have they felt so tired and hackneyed as in Dreamcatcher.The central conceit of the novel, Jonesy's creation of an office space in his mind, in which to hide from the alien presence, is exceedingly stupid and poorly executed. And the dropping of Omens of Great Import or Hints of Past Heroics at regular intervals, purely to give the reader an incentive to keep slogging forward, is insulting. There are so many, spaced so regularly, that they completely fail to work as foreshadowing; they are merely signposts of the withholding of information, an entirely different animal, base and wretched and unworthy of King.Dreamcatcher proves, above all else, that King desperately needs an editor who's not afraid to use his red pen liberally. King can still write successfully in ultra-long form, as he proved in Insomnia and Wizard &amp; Glass; it's just that he has become so much better as writing short works, like The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, The Green Mile's installments, and the Low Men in Yellow Coats segment of Hearts in Atlantis, that it's a shame he seems to feel compelled to stretch things that would BARELY work at short story length (Desperation, Dreamcatcher, Bag of Bones) to a hyper-extended six, seven, or eight hundred pages."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Like many of the reviewers here, I'm a diehard, longtime King reader. He's been my favorite author since I bought the HC of Cujo when it first hit the shelves, and last year marked my 20th year as an avid fan. I just think he's a great storyteller, and love his writing style, especially his characterization.The first book I actually had trouble finishing was Gerald's Game. After that, a few more came, and I was starting to worry King had finally burned himself out. Then the Green Mile restored my faith. Since then, there's fortunately been enough titles that I've really enjoyed interspersed with the ones I read once and put away with the rest of my collection, gathering dust. Unfortunately, of the latter titles happens to be Insomnia, and that's the King book Dreamcatcher reminded me of most strongly.I am sorry to say that Dreamcatcher falls into the &quot;never pick it up again&quot; category. I really didn't think it was going to. All the excerpts I read online were wonderful, and I was starting to get attached to some of the characters already and couldn't wait to read more about them. I was pretty sure this was going to be one of his better ones. I didn't have high expectations, but I did expect the rest of the novel to be in the same ballpark as the excerpts I read.At first everything was going great-I was getting into the plot, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, and hoping nothing bad happened to the characters I liked. There were a couple of points where I got a little confused, but no big deal. A couple of plot-lines that involved events in the character's past started, and I was interested to know what happened to the characters as kids. The narrative jumped around just a tiny bit, but I knew it would be explained later.Then I finished part 1 (about 150 pages in, I think). Part 2 started and it wasn't quite as enjoyable, but I gave it a chance. Fortunately other readers have commented that the narrative was confusing, so I don't feel so stupid, but I started having to page back and see if I'd missed something, or get the male characters straight. IT jumped around a lot too, and while I agree IT was uneven and bordering on sloppy in a few spots, it's one of my favorites. 3/4 of the way through, I wondered if he had to rush this book out because of a deadline, because it seemed like he was desperately slapping together the plotline as he went along. I know King has said with many novels that as he was writing, he didn't know what was going to happen next, and the book almost wrote itself. I have no problem with this when the prose is well-written and I'm drawn into the characters-some of the books he's said this about were among my favorites. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to work so well this time.There were scenes in the character's past that seemed to play a big factor on the events that were eluded to, but on a couple of him, he never went back and fleshed it out. I also wondered if he'd handed in a rough draft, and since this was his first fiction since his accident, his editors didn't want to discourage him so they kept their usual feedback to themselves and figured it was better to put out the book, flaws and all, quickly and not give any suggestions to improve the book. I also get the sneaking suspicion someone in charge said, &quot;what the hell, it's Stephen King and his first novel since his accident so it'll sell like crazy no matter what's between the covers&quot;. It just seemed to need polishing up, and I kept wondering if King just submitted the first draft the second after he finished it without even a re-read, and that's what was published.I'm running out of room, so I might as well sum up with what I liked about the book and what I didn't.What didn't work for me--the character of Duddits and his mother started out great, but I ended up feeling manipulated and feeling like Dean Koontz (who I also enjoy, but when I want to read Koontz I'll pick up one of his books) stepped in to write a section, and didn't try very hard.-there's a strong theme of childhood and memories of past, but the novel didn't flash back long enough for it to work, and it felt incomplete. Several times I found myself paging back, wondering if I missed something. Nope.- what seemed like recycled material from IT and Tommyknockers, which is fine if it works, but it didn't ring true to me-too much of the plot being all over the place, too many places at once kind of at random-the whole 'Mr. Gray' thing along with the character of Kurtz- just didn't hold my interest and bordered, I felt, on self-indulgent-now that I think of it, almost everything after the first &quot;act&quot;.What did:-characters I cared about (though not as much as usual with King)-the &quot;in-jokes&quot; about Derry that first time readers won't catch-the flashback scene to the first encounter with Duddits-the you-know-what weasels-almost all of Part One.So, if I had the put every King novel I read in order of my favorite to least favorite, this wouldn't be at the very bottom (Insomnia would be there along with Rose Madder and Gerald's Game and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon). But it would be in the bottom 10. I didn't rate this above 2 stars because I know King can do so much better.If you're a hardcore King fan like I am, obviously you'll pick it up like all his others if you haven't already. But I would advise not paying full cover price, and keeping your expectations low.. Unless for some reason you loved Insomnia, in which case you'll probably have more fun with this book than I did. I understand that there's bound to be some misfires with a writer as prolific as King, so I chalk Dreamcatcher up as one. Fortunately, I know there's gonna King books somewhere in the future that I love and become some of my favorites. This just isn't one of them. Oh well..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"after recent books mainly dealing with themes such as the human spirit and overcoming traumas from the past, king has returned to his horror roots with Dreamcatcher. king skillfully spins the tale of four childhood friends who are on their yearly hunting trip in a remote section of maine. an alien craft has crashed in the area bringing with it a deadly virus that the U.S. military frantically tries to destroy. trapped in the forest the four friends are subject to dangers that the aliens as well as the military pose. at times gruesome, funny, touching, and intelligent, Dreamcatcher is vintage king."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First off, let me admit that I'm a King fan. That doesn't stop me making a critical review of his books (as I have on some other occasions), it just means that I acknowledge his supreme ability to draw his readers into his story with effortless ease. I guess it should be difficult to find a positive side for a near-death experience like Stephen King suffered, but if he has one reason to thank the driver who hit him, \`Dreamcatcher' is it. It is obvious that he drew on his own experience as he wrote, and that gives this book an added dimension, way and above even SK's normal high standards.\`Dreamcatcher' is the story of four men who's teenage years leave behind ghosts that eventually come to rest while they are out hunting over twenty years later. In it, Stephen King reaches new heights of fiction writing, surpassing even the best of those books that have come before. We're sometimes unfairly critical of King, judging him by his own standards rather than the standard of writing as a whole. As a result, we give three or four stars to a novel that, from any other writer, would deserve ten. \`Dreamcatcher', even by Stephen King standards, is a masterly work that proves again that he is the master of modern commercial fiction.I hear, too, that his work isn't of high literary merit. Rubbish! High literary merit doesn't mean you can't use words that don't appear in a dictionary. High literary merit doesn't mean you can't unscramble the \`rules' of grammar for effect. High literary merit doesn't mean you have to choke your readers with superfluous adjectives and adverbs. High literary merit is writing that touches the reader; that stir emotions; that drag the reader onwards through the story. So far this year, I have read five works that have been acclaimed by the pundits as being of \`high literary merit'. Two of them I couldn't even finish and two of them were as indigestible as stale bread. Only one succeeded in grabbing my imagination. What does that say of \`high literary merit'? It says that our definitions vary!My version of high literary merit is something that makes me stay up reading till three o'clock in the morning; something that lingers on after the last page is turned; something that makes me say \`Wow'; something that digs my ribs and makes me envious of the talent that held the pen.\`Dreamcatcher' is one of the finest books I have EVER had the privilege to read. It is stimulating. It is intelligent. It is though-provoking. And it's a darn good read.IT IS POSITIVELY EXCELLENT !"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As the mother of a child with Down syndrome, I was at first concerned about how King would portray &quot;Duddits&quot;, but found I didn't have to worry. Even tho his terminology is not &quot;politically correct&quot;, he is anything but derogatory about the condition and his character.Overall I found this book a good read. Typical King all the way. A little wordy at times, and definitely gross in parts, but any true King fan knows to expect that!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I can't imagine who or why anyone would pick up a Stephen King novel and not expect quite a bit of gore. Also the man's tendency to include a lot of &quot;bathroom&quot; elements in his fiction is a recurring theme in his writing that has hardly been without precedent in his work, especially recently, and intestinal discomfort really does seem to be the kernel of this book. So it seems unfair to me to whine about it.I didn't feel that this is a novel that could be ranked with his best, but I do think it was a diverting story and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"4 boyhood friends meet each year to go hunting at Beav's cabin, Hole in the Wall. Each is having difficulties in their lives and look forward to the hunting trip. But this year, a man stumbles into their lives and the cabin, missing teeth and time and carrying a frightening parasite that not even he knows about.This is not King at his best, but as he wrote this book while recovering from his near-fatal car accident, it is wonderful that he has written again, period. The book is frightening and, at time, gross. There are flashes of King brilliance in this book, but a lot of the 700+ pages are taken up with sub-plots and routine stuff that could have been left out of the book. I rejoice that Mr. King is still around and still writing - and recommend this book only half-heartedly."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have read some of the novels of Stephen King, such as the Island of Treasure and so on. however, to my discontent, I am oblivious to the culture the author lived and created and enjoyed, partly because that I lived in a sociaty whose culture is totally different from his.But that only increase my curosity to it, so I choose to learn its language. at that time I thought that there would be nothing in my way once I could listen to them, read them, talk with them. the fact is that I could not understand them by now, partly because that I could not think the way as they do.and also, the distance between the two countris lengthens my access to my dream. I am that dreamcatcher on the way to my dream!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Not his best, not his worst. King's writing continues to evolve to better, more complex style, but this time, the story was flawed. I couldn't care less about Mr. Gray and the struggle for control just didn't work for me.By the time I finished, I'd been ready to be finished for 200 pages. Sigh...Stephen, if you're reading this: Scare me again, would you? I could always count on you for that...."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher throws in most of the elements familiar to King fans(some setting and themes from It, government paranoia first groomed in Firestarter, and characterizations well-oiled from all the previous King novels) and somehow gets the formula wrong this time. The first half shows some promise, despite the over use of gross out over suspense as a way to hook the reader, but then the whole novel deteriorates into a very long chase sequence with little surprise or heft. There are some very clever ideas about memory and childhood stuck in along the way and the time spent inside the mind of one of the characters is time well spent but these interesting bits are plugged into a story that should have been better. The novel does its best to create proverbial mountians out of molehills but never quite succeeds."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Sometimes it happens even to the #1 fan...It looks like king was trying to write a long episode of x files.And not quite comprehansive one.The story lose momentum as you past the first 60 pages.

There are only about 3 of his book I have not read. But this...First of all, I enjoy getting pulled into Dreamcatcher. Like most of his works, the first few scenes combined with his wonderfully earthy characters are vintage King magic.But after a couple of hundred pages I found myself getting a little bored. The plot became predictable and the action became stilted. I forced myself through the last two hundred or so pages to a so-so ending.But I give it three stars (well 2 1/2 anyway) because I still can't help but enjoy his writing style. Hey, it's Stephen King man! But I think he could've edited out about 150 to 250 pages and made this work a little more dynamic."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"If someone tells you that Stephen King can't write anymore, don't believe them! The Master is back and he's back in form. Be aware, though...the book feels like it was written by two people: in the first 75-100 pages or so, Mr. King is clearly still in pain from the accident, even writing in a character who suffers the same predicament. After the beginning, though, Mr. King's old form emerges, complete with shifting scenes, flashbacks and references to pop culture.It's a hell of a story."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While it's true that Mr. King's pain is evident throughout this book, at least he even admits to it! The theme... typical King that fans have come to expect... the language and attitude, well hey-- he was recovering from that bad accident, its only common sense to have it come forth into the novel.Dreamcatcher is the story of 4 boys tied somehow to a 5th, a great friend named Duddits, even after years of absence away from eachother they still have a connecting bond. One hunting season, on the yearly hunting trip to Hole in the Wall, Henry, Jonesy, Beaver, (oops, I forgot the other one's name :~) has their world turned upside down as something has come not of this world. At first, no one knows exactly what IT is... the signs point to feverish hysteria in one case, and then some awful disease instead... then come the flashlights. Lights in the sky start to appear, animals flock together to seemingly escape something, electronics go haywire... what in the world is happening?All of these things come together and explain just what is happening... and I won't tell. I will admit that the book does get slow for a few chapters... but at about chapter 10 or 11, get reaady to hold on to your coffee cups and keep them full. Page after page will start to turn, weariness will be fought as you struggle to stay awake to find out what happens. Enjoy, and Mr. King... one heck of a job in Dreamcatcher, thank you."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While this is not King's best novel by a long shot it is still a fast-paced and entertaining read that will keep you turning pages late into the night. After a couple of stinkers like \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" and \\"Storm of the Century\\" it is good to see King return to the long novel format we've all come to know and love. Yes, Dreamcatcher is \\"wordy\\" as ever, but King finally brings it back to the familiar apocalyptic territory that he explored in \\"The Tommyknockers\\", and \\"The Stand\\" with a tale of alien body snatching out in the snowy, remote woods of Maine. While most of this story has been done before (either in his own novels, or in films like \\"Alien\\" or \\"The Thing\\") King still manages to grow and cultivate his influences rather than merely ripping them off. The story happens in multiple layers, ranging from the present nightmare situation of his characters, to childhood flashbacks, and even an entire world inside the head of his possessed character Jonsey. First time King readers will be put off by these abstract settings, but longtime fans will recall classics like \\"Insomnia\\" and \\"The Talisman.\\" Other elements like the telepathic relationship between the four characters, and the growing alien threat are equally frightnening. Overall, Dreamcatcher proves that King is still the master when it comes to creepy tales, and it makes for a great winter read!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This Book is my Favorite Stephen King! After Reading it I was afraid to use the restroom The book scared me! I highly recommend this book. Dont read it alone :)-josh-"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Just a few quick words. I knew that Stephen king, after his accident, would have and interesting tale to tell, and my suspicions were correct. The last SK novel I read was Bag of Bones, which I wasn't too happy with, but Dreamcatcher is a whole new ball game. This book had everything in it except the kitchen sink, we have: monsters, evil government members, parapsychology, flashbacks, action sequences, space creatures, space ships, as usual bad language, Blood and guts, very human characters and some funky space fungus.This story, starts off well, their is a lot to tell about each member of the group of 5 lead members, as usual SK is able to describe each person down to what color socks they wear. This is good, but can be much at times. I did think Dreamcatcher was very involved, and had many twists and turns in it's story line. SK definitely gives you your money's worth with so much material. Many people think that this novel has to many repeats of his past novels, like Tommyknockers, Lonesome death of Jody Veral from Creepshow, Children having powers since there youth like IT. Well despite it all I don't care what other people think I liked this novel and thought it was a nice surprise. The only 2 things wrong with Dreamcatcher were the parts were the alien was inside Joey's mind and were Joey had created a warehouse in his thoughts...ummm...kind of silly. And 2nd was the length of the novel, at almost 900 pages,it could have been shortened by about 2 hundred pages. I also see that there is a holocaust element involved with this book and that was the scariest part of all. I look forward to the movie."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For some reason I get to read all King's books at night, and so, it is always a lot scarier. Don't let the title mistake you, this book had kept me on my toes, and gave me goosebumps. However, King can do a lot better. The charecters in this book are really shallow and not really interesting, unlike the deep and complex charecters that King can build with his master hands. The plot is pretty good. The idea of using articles about UFOs in the begining was cool, and fits to the time of the writing of the book, when the UFOmania spread around the world. However, the plot is sometimes silly, and the horror is \\"Freddie Kruger\\" style. King is focusing in groosom, blood and disgusting things, rather than his usual psychological terror, like the one in \\"Pet Sematary\\" for example. On the other hand, we must remember that King was passing an uneasy time when he wrote this book, and I guess it has effected him. It is a nice book, but he can do better."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"A group of four lifelong friends head out every November to a cabin in the woods of Maine to hunt and catch up on each other's lives. They share a strong bond that was originally strengthened by a noble cause they had faced as children. Now as grown men they gather for another year of laughs. But something crashes into the woods, interrupting their trip. Before long they are surrounded by dangers both human and inhuman. And if any of them are to get out alive they need to reach a fifth childhood friend to ride the dreamcatcher and destroy the mounting tension that threatens not only them but also the human race.The first full length novel written by King since almost losing his life when he was struck by a van. When King went down to the injuries sustained in his accident many people were worried that he might never write again. It took time but as he has always done once again he proved his critics wrong. One would think that the experience would change King when reading DREAMCATCHER. The novel measures up to the style and substance that he has consistently whittled into a distinct voice. At the same time there is a feeling of indifference in DREAMCATCHER. It is a great body in and of itself but the blood in this body doesn't seem to flow. Because of this the reader is left with a feeling of emptiness. As if they have missed something in the story. A decent read but not recommended for those attempting to acquire a taste for Stephen King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've read some of the other reviews and I guess that it's a good thing that I haven't read IT, The Tommyknockers and some of the other stories that Dreamcatcher supposedly took liberties with. I've only read The Girl that Loved Tom Gordon, Carrie and Bag of Bones. Dreamcatcher stands right with those as a winner in my opinion. The characters each had their own three-dimensional qualities and the bad guys (Kurtz and Mr. Gray) held their own without being stereotypical. I'm ready to read more of this master's masterpieces, but thanks to the other reviews of Dreamcatcher I will probably steer clear of the above mentioned books."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The first 200 pages of Stephen King's Dreamcatcher are without a doubt the best part of the book. Action and suspense fill the story, and the characters interest you as we come to learn who they are, and what is bothering them. Then the aliens land, and the stranger, McCarthy stumbles upon Jonesy, and we have the rest of the novel. This consists of 400 pages of waiting, traveling, and flashbacks that are needed for the story, but unliked all the same. The theory of the novel is nothing new, but King again tries his best to tell us a good story. At 620 pages, Dreamcatcher is far too long, and this is coming from someone who's read IT and The Stand and as enjoyed both thoroughly. Not terrible, but not great either."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King shows us once again that horror is not necesarily something lurking out there stalking us. Real horror comes from our own minds and hearts. Although the novel contains UFOs and aliens, the most creepy things are among the characters way long before any unusual event ever happened.Four kids grown up to adulthood, true friendship catalyzed by a fifth retarded kid; a hunting gathering at the woods; munching parasites; lights in the sky; all this mixes to come up with a page-turner book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is an alien invasion thriller. King, being a good writer, adds in other elements, and (of course) makes reference to happenings in other books--there is graffiti saying \\"Pennywise Lives\\" at one point in the book for the \\"It\\" fans.Dreamcatcher tells the story of four friends who, as pre-teens/early teens, saved a Down's Syndrome kid, Duddits, from an attack by bullies. The friends remained in touch over the years, but lost touch with Duddits as they grew up. All four are now suffering from various adult maladies such as depression, loneliness, and alcoholism.The four go hunting together and get caught by a blizzard and by invading aliens. They are also trapped in by psychotic army/government agents hunting the aliens and quarantining the area. The friends' are thrust into the role of protecting themselves, others in the quarantine, fighting off the aliens and saving the rest of the world. All of this makes for great pageturning, as you could only expect from King.The book combines horror themes from several of King's earlier works in an enjoyable manner. The alien takeover of human bodies is very similar to the story King told in The Tommyknockers. The actions of the government are much like the government's actions in Firestarter or The Stand. The flashbacks between what the four friends did as kids and what they did today is similar to any number of King books, but perhaps closest to It in that they saved other children, with the exception that, unlike in almost all of King's other books, the kids were children in the late 70s rather than the 50s. Finally, much of the action involves people alone with their thoughts, with a monster, or at most with one companion. Thus, King is able to indulge in a lot of stream of consciousness, interior monologue writing. King is always a master of writing about people dealing with their own interior demons while trying to fend off outside monsters like in The Shining. He does it well here too.My most major quibble is that King's characters always ring truest when they are average Americans, writers, or, of course, psychotics, the people King writes about best. His character development is not as good when his main characters are a psychiatrist and a history professor, as is the case hereAll that said, I think that King's masterpiece of supernatural horror/thriller writing was \\"It\\" (unless you count the re-editing of \\"The Stand\\" as a new book). King clearly has moved on to other genres in his full-length novels, concentrating on fantasy in his Dark Tower series, human melodramas in books like Dolores Claiborne, The Green Mile, etc.I believe that both he and his loyal readers feel nostalgic for his supernatural horror books, and this book was, hopefully, fun for him to write and fun for us to read for nostalgia. For new readers or readers who have read King books from other genres only, I would suggest reading some of his horror classics such as The Shining, Carrie, The Stand, It, etc. before reading this book. If you like all of those, you will like this one as well."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King just messed up here--the book does have good points (the mental battle between Jonesy and Mr. Gray is probably one of the better bits he's ever done, adn why it got 2.5 stars) but on the whole, the books is flatter than a can of soda that's been open for a month.Normall, his characters seem to be derived from stock characters but then fleshed out and made better, more real--here they're not. Kurtz is just a one dimensional killer. He's easily forgotten,and really almost comid and for a writer who makes his villians (and over all character writing) his strength, that's fatal. With the exeption of Jonesy, the four hunting buddies never really get to grow on you , and neither does Duddits. With the main characters in a thousand page book that takes a screwup of magnificint proportion.The subplot involving Duddits (semi-retarded, and a sufferer of Downs) just feels....well, too sugary to me. I liked The Stand, and IT, and the Dark Tower series...so length isn't a problem for me, when the books is well written. But, here, the length is. There is some decent writing, but on the whole, it's a cut or two down from his normal prose, several more from his normal character and plot development, and the effect is just terrible.The only King book that's worse is Eye of The Dragon. Go read something else, and skip this one."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Mr. King gets back to the basic King Style of writing with Dreamcatcher.

What I got was a book that took me back to the days of It, The Stand, and Needful Things.Mr. King tells us in the Afterword that he wrote this novel longhand rather than using a word processor. I think it made a difference. His love for the art of writing shows on each page. The rhythm and flow of the words are unforced and natural.Dreamcatcher is bravura storytelling. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is a book that has finally arrived. Like a breath held too long released in a long awaited exhale. The subject that was eye candy was the exploration of telepathy. Stephen King brushed telepathy in \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\"; really nicked it in \\"The Green Mile\\"; and took telepathy out and played with it in \\"Insomnia\\". Now, telepathy's potential was examined in this captivating tale that makes you feel that you are everywhere in the story at once. The overuse of the F-key was somewhat distracting but I did find it interesting, the use of writing tenses, past and present. The main story was written in past tense while the back story, in the beginning, was written in present tense which really set it apart. Way to go Stephen."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"i can honestly say this is the best book i have ever read.i am only 15 and have read many books for school and on the side but this is the longest (879 pages) and most detailed book i've ever read. i did not get bored with this book once. i became attached to all the characters in the book and was upset when one of them would die. all the characters have different quirks about them that make you like them. Henry is a great character for his thoughts and views on things. Jonesy is great because of his feelings when he is being controlled by Mr.Gray. Beaver,because of his likable persona and sense of humor. Pete,with his cocky attitude and strange view on life. Owen,who is trying to figure out what's going on with the world around him. And of course Duddits,who is a very likable and fun character. after i finished the first part i was worried that the book wouldn't hold my interest. boy was i wrong. everything from Jonesy's struggle with Mr.Gray to Henry and Owen trying escape Kurtz,the insane military leader. in fact one of the most intense parts is the last chapter.while i was reading this i couldn't put it down. in closing this is a great book that everyone should give a try. this was the first stephen king book i read and i plan on reading much more of his. in fact i just started thinner last night and am already loving it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Finally finished that is.

This book could have been written in about 300 pages rather than the close to 1000. I just had to finish, but it was a struggle. I do not feel the need to write a review of the book since there are so many and from people that can write much better than me. This is one that you may want to skip."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is not the best King book I've ever read, but its a good read that holds your attention, with good charcter development.

Boring."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I had thought my only criticisms of King were that his prose is a little flat, though he creates one hell of a fun read. I've found even some of his sloppier sprawling work such as It and Tommyknockers to be compulsively enjoyable page turners. I've been a fan since I was in high school nearly fifteen years ago, sometimes turning away for more highbrow writers like Robertson Davies, but always returning for the sheer joy and fun I find in King's work. Not this time. The Dreamcatcher was bloated, the plot plodded like a disjointed thorazine hangover, the characters were not memorable and not even particularly likeable. Worst of all it was just plain boring. I found I didn't care about any of the people in the book, and this is the first time I've felt that way about ANY Stephen King book. My distaste for this book certainly isn't me &quot;out growing&quot; Stephen King as a friend suggested. I just read the six installments of King's &quot;The Plant&quot; that he had posted on his website recently, and it is everything the Dreamcatcher is not: Fresh, energetic, original, funny, creepy, stylish, and filled with characters that have burned themselves into my memory. Wait for the paperback. In the meantime, download &quot;The Plant,&quot; and pray Dreamcatcher isn't an omen for the &quot;Talisman's&quot; sequel this fall, which I'm anticipating very, very much."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"SInce &quot;IT&quot; King has been very hit or miss. And this one is a miss. His worst book alongside &quot;Insomnia&quot;. This one reminds me of &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; too. A 300 page story inflated to 600+ pages. There was some great writing but it lost me at about the 200 page mark. The stuff with the weasel-like parasites was great but once Kurtz showed up I became bored."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Having waited quite awhile since King's last release, I was elated when Dreamcatcher hit the bookstores. I read numerous reviews that praise it as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;a gripping title.&quot; However compelling, the reviewers neglected to mention the vulgarity, bathroom humor, and cliched subplots that pepper the book's contents. Not only is the dialog extremely redundant, but the books references to the past experiences of the main characters are limited to a few short anecdotes which seem to be repeated every other page. Even the main plot of the book is relatively obscure, and throughout most of the book there is no sense of urgency that King is apparently trying to express. After reading this six hundred page book, I realize it could have been written with a third of those pages. When you do put this exciting thriller down, I hope it's in the trash."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I started this book like I start all Stephen King's books, excited. I have only read one of Stephen King's book that I was dissapointed in and it wasn't this one. I read a lot of reviews claiming that SK has lost it. Lost what? I read this seeing the same O'King and I swept up as I was in all those other Kings. You people need to get over the fact that he can't write golden books all the time like he use to, and just except what he does now.SK comes back strong with an amazing gripping novel that is based on more than just horror. This book is based on the psycological struggle of a man that has been possesed but yet still has his own little place in his mind that keeps him from harm. Then there is Duddits. He is what you call the &quot;pimp&quot; of the novel. He is a retarted boy that has a special power. Being a child in an adult body, he has lots of humor that comes with him. Like his Scooby Dooby Doo lunchbox. ... Then you got Henry the smart intulect who is the contact with the military men. I would love to tell you what this all means and how all this ties together to make a &quot;great novel&quot;, but that would spoil the surprise before you read it. So please give it a chance."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It's too long, much too long, for the story. The characters are thinly drawn, the portrayal of Duddits is hopelessly sentimental, Kurtz is a stereotype and a cliche, the biology of the aliens makes little sense, nor does the connection between the four friends and Duddits (we never quite know just what Duddits has been doing, if anything) and it all has a hangdog, been-there-done-that feel. ..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am not finished the book at this time.

I was absolutely engaged to the story right up until the jump to Kurtz, at that point, I would say the story stalled out.

The *%#% weasels could only come from SK's imagination!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I loved what King did with the 4 boys' character study &amp; duddits.

I felt like he should had written a better book. I watch his movies and stuff, but I can't read any books if his. This book started out with four close friends going back in their past to survive. I got confuse after that whole part. I wouldn't have read this book until someone special picked it out for the whole class.That's my personal reaction after I read it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I love a good horror book &amp; this was not it. This was a total waste of time. I had to force myself to finish it only so I would know what people are talking about. A book has to be really bad for me not to finish it.

This novel starts out with a great idea and then becomes an un-readable jumble."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King fell into the trap that many &quot;genre&quot; writers can't escape---he wanted to prove that he could write other novels besides &quot;horror.&quot; Well, with &quot;Dreamcatcher,&quot; Mr. King returns to his horror roots and weaves a very suspenseful and creepy novel. Granted, it's not as good as &quot;It,&quot; &quot;Salem's Lot,&quot; or &quot;The Dead Zone,&quot; but &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; delivers.King is very good with developing characters that you care about, and in this novel, he creates some of his best: Duddies, the Down Syndrome child, and the human dreamcatcher; Jonesy, Henry, Beav, and Pete,four friends who really did stick together through thick and then; Roberta Cavell, Duddies' touching and sincere mother; and Owen, the Army &quot;traitor&quot; who aids Henry in his quest to rid the earth of this dreadful new alien species.King borrows liberally from many horror books/movies: &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers,&quot; &quot;Aliens,&quot; &quot;The Cobra Event,&quot; and others, but in using them he pays homage to and expands their influence. The chief villain, Kurtz, is loathsome and despicable, and gets his just desserts.There are several scenes of out and out horror; touching human confrontations, and a satisfying, if somewhat ambiguous, denouement. At times, King tends to pad a little, but overall, King demonstrates why he is the &quot;King&quot; of horror."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Just curious, but, am I the only person who was offended by the repeated advertising in this book? There are at least five references to specific products such as a semi-popular bottled water, Napa or some such thing.Why do we need to be subjected to advertising while reading a Stephen King novel? Is he so financially strapped that he has to do that crap?I'm disappointed not only in how King took a storyline that is more than a cliche, wrote a bad book, but also had the gall to make us read ads throughout it as well.It is sad to see King use the same formula that he has used a number of times before, big threat to human existence, some gifted person or persons who may or may not be able to overcome the threat, one of whom is extra special, then, lo and behold, the world is saved. Does he use the same outline for these stories now?What do YOU think?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am an avid fan. I have read each and every book that King has written. This book was a TOTAL disappointment! I was so excited when I noticed his book in the bookstore. I purchased it immediately. Well, I can't get past the first 100 pages."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I was drawn inescapably into the tale that King told. The four life-long friends, Beave, Jonesy, Henry and Peter as well as their adopted pal \\"Duddits\\". The story is so multi-faceted it was a reader's amusement park.I was especially impressed by Mr. King's exploration of the mind itself and our own perception of who/what we as beings really are.The villains, Mr. Gray and Kurtz were particularly odious.The pacing of the story was high-speed and Stephen masterfully employed his cliff-hanger technique from chapter to chapter building my expectations to a frenzy then always satisfying them.Anyone who dares dismiss Stephen King's \\"Dreamcatcher\\" as mainstream fare has obviously not read it. This is a book that will gain him legions more fans.(...)"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"If you go out in the woods, today, you are in for a big surprise. And in the &quot;Dreamcatcher,&quot; you find more than bears. After you discover the first horror, you find the trails leading back out of the woods and into the past. Duddit, the special child with ESP, speaks his own language, reminiscent of baby talk. His friends keep him from danger in the beginning of their bonding and later, Duddit steers the remaining members of the group into safety, using his ESP and getting the name of official &quot;Dreamcatcher.&quot; I enjoyed the poignancy and care that Duddit brings to the plot.On the other side, Kurtz manages to strike pure terror into the tale with his mindless killing and power struggle to dominate his troops. He personifies power gone out control and you keep wishing him to meet his doom before anymore violence occurs.But the main conflict the byrus, an alien virus, keeps spreading like a cancer and infecting almost everyone that gets in contact with it. Mr. Gray has a mission for the byrus and you discover how he attempts it and what occurs. With his passionate craving for bacon, Mr. Gray adapts some human qualities.One of the most graphic descriptions comes when the alien critter emerges into the world. It seemed like a gestation that develops in the cruelest and vile manner. And the pain incurred could be likened to labor of the utmost degree. You will go from the heart of blackness and gore and come out of the &quot;Dreamcatcher,&quot; thinking could this happen. Or does it happen when men suffer mentally and physically from external and internal pains?"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am only 1/4 done with this book right now and enjoying the ride. HOWEVER, I am getting tired of the same old plot tricks. How many times do we have to be relied upon to drop back and forth from childhood to adulthood, Mr. King? And also, Mr. King, you are getting sloppy with your story telling. One single point of contention: how can a bathroom door which two grown men &quot;rushed forward together...,almost four hundred pounds behind two dropped shoulders. It gave way with absurd ease...&quot; How can such a ruined door then be used to keep an enemy within? A man can hold a such a door shut by clutching the doorknob tightly? C'mon. Be real. Or be unreal. Just be constant."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm a huge Stephen King fan (not in girth), have read all of his and Bachman's books and reread the two previous Derry books just to get myself in the mood for this one. I have to say that I was mostly dissappointed. Most people complain that King's books are too wordy, but the true fans know what its like to be knocked flat by the climax and ending of any of his classics. Dreamcatcher did not knock me flat, and sorta made me wish that RF would show up and put the characters out of their misery. Mostly the story dragged on, and failed to make a connection between the reader and the characters. The ending, too, was a *shudder* weak dialogue. Of course, the style of writing was great and I'll give him credit for a few original and shocking scenes (and the allusion to Will Dearborn hehe), but I mostly got the idea that he was venting the experiences of his accident. Anyways, I'm looking forward to a return of the storytelling that we all know and love."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I have read almost all of Mr. King's novels and liked most of them, but this one seems a little splattered. The premise, aliens in New England, seems interesting enough, but somewhere along the way, I kept losing interest, skipping ahead pages and not really caring what happened to most of the characters. I don't think this one is up the standard I associate with Steven King novels."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I consider myself a big King fan however this I will erase from my memory. I did find some parts of the book interested like the relationship of the friends, how they cared for Dudits and how they had all been friends for years. I loved the story until the guy with bad farts came along. I am not into aliens and do not find story lines along that nature very exciting but I thought King would pull it off. To me, it was just like any other Alien story... a bit more creative and gross but not anything I wanted to read. I didn't even finish the book because it was getting too ridiculous."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King at his most shameless. Very entertaining."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"IT WAS SAID IF YOU LIKE BAG OF BONES YOU WOULD LOVE DREAMCATCHER. WELL, I DO NOT AGREE. I READ BAG OF BONES IN A MATTER OF DAYS, IT HAS BEEN A MONTH AND I STILL CANNOT GET INTO DREAMCATCHER. IT IS VERY SLOW AND DOES NOT SEEM TO PICK UP ANYWHERE. NOT AMONG THE BEST KING BOOKS I HAVE READ."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King. Most of his books are terrific but &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; joins his other two bombs, &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; and &quot;The Talisman&quot;. The first part of the book is well written but it later deteriorates into gibberish. I had a hard time telling who was in who's mind or who was doing what to which when. As someone once said &quot;In every fat book there's a thin book trying to get out&quot;. King claims to have written this whole book with a fountain pen. I hope he has gotten over his writer's cramp by now so he can start on a better book up to his usual higher standard. Think thin (or is it &quot;Thinner&quot;."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First I have to admit to not having read a Stephen King book in a long while. It was the promise and eventual failure of the Dark Tower series that burned me out. However my interest was piqued by the professional reviews that proclaimed the old Stehpen King (Pet Semetary, Cujo, The Stand, Misery, etc.) was back. I truly loved reading those horror novels and was looking for more of the same with Dreamcatcher.The first 200 pages did seem vintage King, however afterwards it became a &quot;B&quot;-grade science fiction movie.I like King best when he merely touches the boundaries of the true horror central to his work. Revealing bits and pieces over the course of the novel and leaving we the reader to guess as to what is out there in the woods or under the bed. This is what keeps me awake at night in mindnumbing suspense. For me the revelation came much too quickly and therefore the adreline producing suspense was abandoned early on.Let me know when vintage King is truly back.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Since I'd never read a Stephen King book before, and motivated by how much I liked the movie, &quot;Misery,&quot; I bought Dreamcatcher. I was really captivated by the interplay of the friends, including Duddits. The characters rang true, and the concept of &quot;seeing the line&quot; is eerily familiar to me.As the story moved on, into murkier waters (or snows?) of terror and suffering, I hung in there. When the plot reached the point of the grand conspiracy, everything began to sound like the people who call up Art Bell's late-night radio program.I had gotten halfway through the book when I was interrupted by business matters, and when I picked it up again, I suddenly realized that I didn't care anymore. I didn't care to know who was inside whose brain, I didn't want to see another innocent person's blood turning to ice on a winter field, and the whole complicated plot had spun way higher off the ground of reality than I wanted to fly.I have great admiration for Mr. King's imagination and writing ability, and certainly a piece this long and complex should fairly be called a masterpiece. I think. I never finished it.I'm not sure I will try him again."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I loved this book. I know that everyone else seems to be bored by the plot and not connect with the characters, but I disagree. I do wish that more of the main characters would have made it to the finish, but that's part of what I love about King. He's willing to let go of some of the good people to make the book interesting. I felt the same way about parts of The Stand, esp the scene where the house blows up all the characters I loved.This book is classic King. It has all the right components, aliens, fungus, bizarre situations, a psycho military enemy, and intelligent thought whether you wound up loving the story at the end or being disappointed - my guess is you couldn't put it down to see what would happen next. I connected with the characters. You might think that some of them are a little snobby at first, but I always think he paints a picture of reality. This book works with Murphy's Law, and isn't that a little more realistic than everything always going your way. I really thought it was good and I've read almost all of his books, so if you're reading this review, know that not everyone hated this book. I even enjoyed how King's accident played a part and I'm glad that his characters don't have to be shiny movie stars to be interesting."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Teenaged horror fans are going to like this book. Middle-aged horror fans are going to LOVE this book. There's much more to this than the usual cross-references to other Derry-centered stories. This book is akin to &quot;The Shining&quot;--the monsters aren't just out there, they're inside us. The older we get, the more aware we become of the nasty microscopic critters dwelling in our guts and souls just waiting for the chance to take over!My only complaint is the title. I believe &quot;Cancer&quot; really fit this one. (My apologies to Mrs. King) We live our lives with the virus--excuse me, &quot;byrus,&quot; of mortality. Together with the contaminating influences of our friends and families and communities, that middle-aged obsession with death just grows and grows. When you hit your 45th birthday you realize those momentous childhood events really WERE more significant than the money you've made or the houses you've bought.Kudos to King for once again showing us that small town folk get a bad reputation for being narrow-minded. Mental illnesses and differences are tolerated in places like Derry, but not at all in New York City--the supposedly more liberal, hip big city. Many of us have forgotten the unique world perspective of the village idiot and the fact that such a perspective can have mythological ramifications for ordinary humans.All in all, exciting, frightening, thrilling and reflective. If you're under 30, tuck this one away to read again when you hit 40 or have a close encounter of the deadly kind."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Yeah, baby, the master is back in top, scary, breathtaking form. Derry, a town I'm glad I don't live in, is also back as the site where all these strange and terrible things occur. Four men who are telepathically linked take part in strange and horrifying doings. Suffice it to say that there are zombies, body snatchers and space aliens and that as crazy as that sounds it all makes sense. The horror meister never lets up for a moment. My pillow was damp with the sweat that can only come from a good Stephen King novel. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I don't know about you, but the review ahead of me sounded like a pretty stale version of what ever is in the book. Anyway, got an advanced copy of this sucker and just finished it, and it KICKS A**. After page 70 this book turns into the movie Aliens(I use this lightly), it's a great read, I mean you got aliens, the military, parasites that grow in the body, action and lots and lots of snow. I'll spare you the details of the story, but I will tell you that the book-flap tells you jack about the book. Check this out and let me know what you think -- i grade S.K. on a curve because I love the guy so much and he has influenced me big time, so I give it for stars (which I am comparing to the Stand a 5 star book---Kings best single book if you get rid of the Gunslinger series, which also rocks.) Also my only quipps with the book was the flashbacks (don't know why, guess I got addicted to the action) and well...well the Flashbacks, guess thats all. But seriously check this sucker out, can't afford it? GO TO THE LIBRARY!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"He has done it again. Any King fan will love this read. It is a \\"keep you turning the pages\\" kind of book. I would recommend this book to everyone! If you aren't a Stephen King fan before you read this book, you will be when you are finished."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book came out after King's accident and he wrote it by hand, which goes to show his dedication since the book is over 800 pages. I really did enjoy this book, it's pretty fast paced, especially in the begining. Maybe towards the middle it slows a little, but not enough to take away from the books merit. The story is about 4 friends who grew up together (they're from King's uber creepy town Derry) and once helped an autistic boy from bullies back in their childhood. This event forever changed their lives and from on they had psychic abilities. When the 4 are on their annual hunting trip all hell breaks loose when aliens arrive and they have to deal with both them and the government trying to stop them. Very creepy and descriptive, one of the better sci-fi books I've read, especially about the \\"byrus\\" an organic alien material that gets on everything and continues to grow. This book is a little better than King's earlier attempt at a UFO/alien story (Tommyknockers) and is much faster. I would highly suggest you read this, even if you're not a King fan but more of a sci-fi fan, you won't be disapointed."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The characters of this novel are so real and likeable that I felt emotional pain when they get hurt or die.

I normally do not read novels dealing with Science Fiction, but it did sound a little interesting. After reading the first chapter I completely lost interest in it.

I've read about 10 King books and this rates in the top third for sure. I think one of my favorite things about this book is how unique it is for King.For example, part of the plot occurrs in the &quot;Dreamworld&quot; - aliens come from outer space, etc. Loved the X-filesesque vibe too.It's complex though, and as you can see below, the unintelligent have had a rough time with this book. But stick with it. It's really a great one. It has a very riveting and satisfying final 100 pages too.Well worth your time!(p.s.

In my first review I mentioned the parasites that dwell in the victims colon and come out their you-know-what. Being the classy guy I am, I didn't refer to them in the way they are mentioned in the book. Instead I carefully put a dash in there. This time I'll put four dashes in there when I mention the ---- weisels. My question is, why, right above me, did the people who approve these reviews allow a reviewer to write the word without any dashes at all, but the last paragraph of my review, where I mentioned the ---- weisels with only one dash got edited out? I don't understand. Disguising the swear word is apparently worse than just typing it out. But why... In conclusion, this is a good book, if somewhat familiar. King fans will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"If you enjoyed IT (which I did) and you like the X-files (which I used to in the early seasons), you'll enjoy this book.

Definitely for King fans though not for children under 13. Duddits and Mr. Gray are waiting for you."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Once again Mr. King has seemed to brave new ground in the Dream Catcher. Unlike his previous works that seemed to come out of one place, Dream Catcher seems to be several short story's, novel upstarts, and in general, a woven together tale. At least that's impression I got. Also, I got the feeling that he might have return to work to soon after his accident, because the tragedy seemed to color the work in some places.Dream Catcher is not a bad book, it's worth a read, but I don't think it's a great book, like The Stand, The black Tower series or Desperation and the alike. What it also is not like is Gerald's Game or Insomnia, two of which I wish he had never written.That's a Backwater man's opinion anyway, in the backwater, and you know how we can be."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This review I am writing because I liked the book and well it was very suspensefull. In Dreamcatcher the reader encounters many conflicts along the way. One of my favorite conflicts is the Man vs. Time conflict. The man vs. Time conflict exists everywhere in this novel especially at the end where Jonsey has to beat Mr. Gray or else the dog would have been able to fit into the pipe. Now what would have happened if Jonsey had not got the best of Mr.Gray in the End that is suspense my friends not Horor or Mystery or Romance (Thank God for if it was I would never be able to raed again). If you have rated this book a 5 star book and would like to read other suspense/sci-fi novels by Stephen King try Tommyknockers, The Dark Half, and Bag of Bones all by Stephen King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Don't know WHAT the Amazon.com reviewer read but this is a book to lament, not for fans to rejoice over! King (as we all know) is a fantastic writer but somehow when he tries to delve into science fiction/invaders from outer space he simply falls flat on his face. Tommyknockers was my least favorite novel of his - but now this one is a tight contentder for that designation. The first half of the book just drug on terribly between jumping between characters and flashbacks -- I really kept losing interest and having to walk away and at times forcing myself to go back to it hoping it would pick up. From reading all the advance reviews I think everyone knows about the &quot;implants&quot; but it takes almost 300 pages before the aliens even make their first appearance! For me, the second half involivng the military pursuit of the alien inhabited character was the best part. That was when some of the old King suspense shone through (although you never had ANY doubt about what the end result was going to be -- unfortunately predictable in that area) Finally, don't pick up this book, as others seem to have, thinking it is some sort of sequel to &quot;IT&quot; or even the clown. Except for a VERY fleeting reference to child disapparences in Derry during one of the flashbacks you won't find any more talk of that story. Final thought....PLEASE don't let there be a sequel to THIS book as was alluded to in the end of the story. If so, it would be the very first King book that I would decide not to spend money on."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I enjoyed reading this book 30 days ago. Last night however I watched the movie Fallen starring Denzel Washington and noticed many peculiar similarities between the book, recently published, and the movie, released in 1998. Just some of these are an entity or spirit 'jumping' and possesing one human to another. Also both feature main characters named Jonesy. Both feature a Rolling Stones song as the main theme song. Both have key plot elements involving a remote woods cabin. Lesser likenesses include characters in both which have degress of mental retardation and both main characters use or consider suicide. Pure coincedence or something more? Read the book, then see the movie, in that order and decide for yourself. Peace Out"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I SELDOM READ REVIEWS OF MR.

Maybe Mr. King should go more for quality instead of quantity."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Too bad it's over 600. This book becomes the most monotonous of Stephen King's career. I have read all of his novels, and this is one of his worst. The only thing that saves it from being THEE worst (that honor still belongs to the overrated Christine) is the first 200 pages, which are gory, over-the-top fun. The rest of the book comes off as both trite and pretentious, at the same time. The characters are developed fairly well in the first 200 pages, and then go no where. The character of Kurtz is the ultimate cliche, and having him sucking up a large part of the last 200 pages was a BIG mistake. The extended chase at the end is tedious, not at all frightening, and turns a novel that started out excellent into an absolute disaster."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I was very disappointed in the latest novel from MR. King. I found it way to long and convoluted. I wonder if he is being paid by the word. I also have this same problem with Tom Clancy's more recent works.

The dreamcatcher for me was just a bad dream."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Don't get me wrong, because I really enjoy Mr. King's books, but &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; did not grab me.

I own most of his stuff and have been working on reading everything of his for years now. But this one just doesn't cut it for me. It's boring and hard to follow compared with his other stuff. If you've never read King before and are trying to pick a book of his to start out with, avoid this one. He has plenty of others that will blow your mind."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever read.

This was the longest I have have waited for a product from amazon. I contacted customer service and I did not receive a reply. However I did get the item."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is an awesome book! When I first read it, i was a little confused, but when I read it again, it was two times better than it was the first time. Stephen King wrote this book when you was recuperating from a fatal accident. The title of the book was supposed to be called, \\"Cancer,\\" but his wife said that title could bring bad luck. So, instead, he called it \\"Dreamcatcher.\\"When the four friends, Pete, Beaver, Henry, and Jonesy, all go out on their traditional hunting trip in Maine, they run into some trouble. Little did they know, that their shared past would aide them in their advendures."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I liked this book! I read this months prior to the release of the movie and I'm glad that I did. This one kind of played with my emotions, it began to lose me at times and then slowly pulled me back."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I needed a thick book for school, something that could get me an A in the reading department. So I brought this without reading the reviews or even what it was about (it didn't matter, it was already a movie when I brought it). Within the first week I had read 100 pages into it (a record for me) and really enjoyed it. And although the middle of the book kind of got boring at times I still stuck with it. The characters were realistic, the plot was more of action than horror (I'm not complaining though) and overall the story was really good. And that's what I thought of the book before reading all the reviews about 'how King's lost it' or 'Don't Believe The Hype'. There is, however, one flaw in the book: The Length. The hardcover is roughly 600 pages, and the paperback is roughly 900. Now usually I don't care about the length of books as long as there are good, but this length caused the boring parts I mentioned before. Other than that I recommend this to any reader, I do however not recommend the Epilogue, I found it confusing and pretty pointless."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book was excellent, as soon a you open the book you're plunged into this riveting story. The story line goes: Four childhood friends reunite every year for a deer hunting trip. A stranger stumbles into their camp and something inside him eats it way out. Soon the creature begins spreading a virus that they call Byrus, or Ripley. Near by an alien force is taking over Jonsey, one of the four friends and uses his body to spread the Byrus. A downs syndrome child named Duddits is a childhood friend of the four boys. He helps them when they are on the run to get Mr. Gray before he contaminates New England with the Byrus.This was an extraordinary work of art that had me on the edge on my seat the whole way through, from start to finish, through all 870 pages. The story had quite a lot of gore in it in my opinion, but that didn't take away from that. I vastly recommend this book to any one who is just getting into Stephen King, or any other fan."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is one of his better books. It's not that scary, but has great action. It takes place in the common setting of his book, Maine.The psychological aspect of this book is great.

I'd recommend this book for any Stephen King fan."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Man this book should almost be considered a wepaon with it's size. The detail that King puts into the scenery left me feeling as if I was there in the cold with them. A frightfully good story that should translate well onto the screen."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Definately one of the best books I've read in awhile. Even though the book is long the story grips you and you can't put the book down. Can't wait for the movie to come out."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Like many of the reviewers I am a big Stephen King fan. His horror stories always had likeable characters who made you care about their survival. Yes, Henry, Pete, and Jonesy were appealing although you hardly got to know them before they were killed off or taken over by the alien in one way or another. Beav was mostly a collection of bad language that seemed excessive -- yes, we get it - he swears a lot but he's really a sweet guy. Duddits was interesting although not particularly so until the end. His mom was nice but she was very peripheral.All the bouncing back and forth between Kurtz (what a cliche) and the military crowd and the four protagonists and their flashbacks got so irritating I was ready to throw the book against the wall a third of the way through. But I slogged on.I understood early on that Kurtz was your sterotypical over the top military psychopath that we've seen in a dozen movies. The allusion to Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; was just too cute. His manic diatribes got exceedingly tiresome. We get that he is one crazy dude -- no need for overkill. His story was not particularly interesting since he was such a one dimensional character nor did it move along the central plot line of alien invasion.Towards the end I got interested in the book but in general it seemed to be mostly a collection of disgusting and/or painful incidents tied together with a confusing and tiresome mishmash of flashbacks, telepathic visions, and two and a half story lines.I sincerely regret that Mr. King had to suffer through the aftermath of a terrible and senseless hit and run accident. I hope &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; was a catharsis for him during a painful time. It won't be a book I will likely reread and I won't recommend it to King fans."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Several of Stephen King's novels and stories have been filmed. Arguably, the best are Director Frank Darabont's versions of the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (The Shawshank Redemption) and the serial novel The Green Mile. Darabont's genius is that he compresses King's wordy literary style into polished scripts that give just enough detail to carry the story. Stephen King is a master of the story, whether working in his traditional horror genre or moving into more subtle fields. As King himself has admitted (&quot;I have this disease, literary elephantiasis&quot;) his work suffers from overwriting. Nowhere is this more evident than in Dreamcatcher. The story line is simple and elegant: Four childhood friends (remember IT) are telepathically linked through their friendship with a mentally challenged young man. The four are trapped when an alien spacecraft crashes in the Maine woods (remember The Tommyknockers). Though some are killed, the power of their love for this young man with Down's Syndrome saves the human race. Strong character development would have moved the story in such a way that we care for the people we meet. Instead, King's predilection for overdescription bogs us down. A sled ride turns into a plod through ever-deepening drifts of detail. Even more annoying is King's tendency to get the details wrong. In an early scene a man wearing a face mask is seen to smile. Oops! The first time I noticed this was in reading Christine. King described a 1958 Plymouth four-door sedan as a &quot;sport coupe.&quot; The sports coupes of that era all had two doors and no window pillars. Perhaps even King's editors get lost in his verbosity.Dreamcatcher could have been as elegant an exploration of the persistence of evil as Christine, a much shorter novel. The story is there, even the theology is there, but we become weary of trying to find them amidst the heap of detail. King has a wonderful imagination, perhaps the most vibrant of any writer in history, and that's the problem. We readers have imaginations, too, and King leaves nothing for us to imagine. A less prolific, and underrated, contemporary is John Irving. In the afterword to his gorgeous The Fourth Hand, Irving says that all novels begin with a question: &quot;What would happen if.....?&quot; I hope that in King's next work he offers us readers less weight to carry about and more space to imagine. I slogged through this one, but I'd advise you to pass on it. Instead, go to the library, a used bookstore, or this website and find a copy of King's 1978 novel Christine. If King had followed the example of J.D. Salinger and written nothing else, his reputation would have been assured. At least in Frank Darabont, King has found his director. John Carpenter wrecked Christine on the screen. But no matter. Curl up with it this fall. Savor it slowly through the winter. Then ponder the persistence of evil, evil which uses not exotic spacecraft but the most ordinary of objects, like,say, cars or airliners,and the most ordinary of people,like, say, Arab immigrants or teenage boys."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I guess there comes a point in every writer's life where the major themes that run through his or her work have been touched upon. To some readers who didn't particularly care for a lot of those themes to begin with - as John Irving argued in his book 'A Widow for One Year' - these later works seem mere flaccid retreads, weak reflections of superior books (when the themes were new, hot, and/or unique). Some writers reach this point early - the before mentioned John Irving seems a good example, as do Peter Straub and Clive Barker - others reach it later.Stephen King has reached this point.Now this may not be a bad thing. King, in recent years, has shown a tremendous emotional growth as a 'literary' writer while remaining true to his pulp fiction roots, but more and more the tunes sound the same. Sometimes the mix works (as in Bag of Bones and the short novels Low Men in Yellow Coats and Hearts in Atlantis) sometimes not (The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon). Dreamcatcher, King's first novel since being struck by a van and almost killed, is in the 'works' category.Some readers may groan that the material is yet another reworking of an oft told tale (Desperation being an excellent example, the two books are practically doppelgangers) and whine about elements reused from It (childhood friends doing battle with monsters), The Tommyknockers (mind and body absorbing space aliens), and the short story Weeds [aka The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill episode in the movie Creepshow]. But it is these very same elements that make Dreamcatcher a King story. Take some of those elements, make them into labyrinthian literary references and it could be a Straub story, or make them into a breech into some kind of strange fantasy world and it could be a Barker tale. The story is universal (pun intended) - King was just lucky enough to uncover it first.While in Junior High School four friends do a good thing, perhaps it is even a great thing, and are changed in ways they cannot comprehend. One in particular, who, as an adult, is nearly killed in a traffic accident, has been changed even further. This is good, because something very nasty has crashed deep within the woods of northern Maine and, during their annual hunting trip, these friends must confront and defeat this horrific alien lifeform before its flesh eating seed can be planted and given a chance to grow.The novel is long (not uncommon for a King tale), but, considering the scope of the danger, not unjustified and the story is tight. Personally I do not see where any cuts to shorten it could have been made. It is also very gruesome. The flesh eating byrus and the bowel infesting byrum are both shudder inducing. Believe when I tell you that you will not be able to break wind and NOT think about this book.Whether the story works for you or not depends entirely on how deeply attached you are to themes King plays when weaving a story. Recommended."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I haven't read a decent Stephen King book since BAG OF BONES! At first, I thought Stephen King lost it - because THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, ON WRITING, and the other books were stupid - I was worried that Stephen King had lost his touch. But since this book came out, I'm happy that he's doing just fine. Way to go, King!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is classic King at his finest- spooky and other-worldly, hearkening back to IT and The Dead Zone, while keeping a level of the new-found spirituality that his more recent works like Insomnia have been full of. King wrote this one in longhand from his hospital bed shortly after being hit by a car, and though his physical ailments may not mar the quality of writing, the mental scars are readily apparent. When we follow a character out into a busy street without looking, we know exactly what is to come, and when we experience the crash, the cracking of bones and the hard pavement not just once but again and again, we get the feeling King isn't looking for sympathy, just drawing on hard-earned experience for that extra level of realism.The core of this story is an examination of the heart of darkness, the deus ex machina, the dark side inside of us all, disguised as an X-Files episode. But while the sudden appearance of those trusty sci-fi cliches, the big eyed, slender bodied aliens, or as King calls them the &quot;gray boys&quot;, may at first be off-putting, one gets the feeling that King is far too good for that sort of thing, and there must be something deeper going on here. Indeed, even if there wasn't, these time-tested archetypes getting a new Stephen King twist might be enough to satisfy some readers. But when the truth is revealed (as Mulder would say) about their true nature in a short but regrettably mundane epilogue, the idea is satisfying, thought provoking, and upsetting all at the same timeAlso like classic King, there is a generous dose of good old monster movie gore here- it does not feel gratuitous, per se, but it is certainly graphic. Add in the profanities that flow freely and frequently from the characters' mouths, and this is not a book for kids. King fans will find a lot to like here, but those new to the genre may the complex narrative a bit tiring and may be better off trying one of King's \`classic' stories to get their feet wet. Its not always easy to tell what is happening here: what is a dream, and what is a memory, or in fact if those distinctions even matter as we jump from timeline to timeline and plot device to plot device. But that is exactly what the author wants: to explore the way people dream, think and remember, and when the dream is perhaps more real that the reality."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The publisher's synopsis of Dreamcatcher on the inside of the dust cover doesn't really tell you much about the book. Who or what is Duddits? What's going on with this McCarthy feller? It also doesn't sound like your average Stephen King novel. However, as we all know, you're pretty much guaranteed to enjoy anything King writes, so with anticipation, we start the book.The basic plot is that a group of men, friends since junior school, are out hunting in the woods of Northern Maine. One of the group, Jonesy, is recovering from a car accident that left him with a broken hip, so he stays in a treehouse at camp, where he almost shoots a man stumbling into their cabin (he mistakes him for a deer). Seeing that the man has been wandering in the woods for days, Jonesy takes pity on him, invites him into &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;, feeds him and offers him his bed. Big mistake. The man is missing his canine teeth, muttering about lights in the sky and obviously has something very amiss inside him.Thus begins &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, and it's a very promising start to the book. We immediately begin to wonder where McCarthy has been, and what happened to him.However, the book goes slightly downhill from here. The action jumps to the other half of the quartet, Henry &amp; Pete, on their way back from the store. They narrowly avoid running over a woman sitting in the middle of the road (in the midst of a blizzard, no less), and so begins their own particular part of the nightmare.However, where the story really begins to veer off course is with the introduction of the military, led by the starkly insane Kurtz. The book culminates in a chase scene that brings the characters from Maine to Boston, and lasts roughly a hundred pages too long. There were times when I was tempted to put the book down and read something else instead.However, all this aside, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is still a very enjoyable book. There are simply a few too many sub-plots, as well as veiled references to incidents in the friends' past. It's not a book you will read in two days flat without putting it down, but as something to read on a Sunday afternoon, it more than cuts the mustard."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book had the ability to be something truely amazing. With well rounded charactors and an enticing plot...and S**t weasels?!?! The story took a huge dive and pluged in to the territory of a horrid B-movie plot line. It had the feel of a split personality one side the chance to be a intelegent classic... and the other a freakish dead weight draging the story down in to the neither world of a bad read. I wish I had stopped reading before the downward plunge of plot so that i could still appricate the charators with out shuddering."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I bought this book with great enthusiasm. The New York Times book review was great. But,in contrast, I found the novel to be confusing, boring and retro. Retro... It reminded me of the segment King was in in the first Tales from the Crypt movie. Remember King playing a red neck whose farm is hit by a space ship and then he drinks the water and turns into a giant topiary? As some of the other reviewers have stated, I also had to page back to try to find references to what I now was reading. This novel is a regurgatation for King. I await another Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile,The Stand. Mr. King, I love ya. But not this one."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I gave this book 3 stars in deference to the fact that Mr. King wrote it while recovering from being hit by a van, an accident that almost killed him. The book is unavoidably colored by that accident and the subsequent recovery period.I wanted to like this book. I really did. I was especially looking forward to a return to some of the supernatural/super-unnatural themes that I enjoyed so much from his earlier works. Don't get me wrong; I have been immensely pleased with his most recent work. Bag of Bones, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and - most especially - Hearts in Atlantis really shine and are indicative of his continued growth as a writer. (I personally believe the title story from Hearts in Atlantis is one of the great pieces of short fiction produced in the last 100 years.) Perhaps my expectations were too high, I don't know. For whatever the reason, I was immensely disappointed.As simple as possible, the plot breaks down like this: A super-intelligent fungus from outer space (shades of Lovecraft's Mi-Go here) bent on world assimilation crashes a ship into northern Maine and sets about trying to take over every human being it comes across. Unfortunately for the fungi, this world seems to be too cold and bizarre for it to conquer easily (one wonders why they didn't just crash in Rwanda or Texas). The US military steps in to contain the &quot;infection.&quot; The fungus finds a group of friends with peculiar mental talents that make at least one of them, Jonesy, an ideal host. Then there is a long chase sequence wherein the military and one of the aforementioned group of men, Henry, attempt to catch the infected Jonesy before he can infect Boston.Them's the brass tacks, although there is quite a bit of annoying detail left out. The group of friends have mental abilities that stem from their friendship with a man named Duddits, who is stuck in the perpetual childhood of Down's Syndrome (and is the Deus Ex Machina of this book). A man named Kurtz, who is both a lunatic and a more-than-passing nod to the character from Heart of Darkness, runs the military operation. The fungus (which ends up being personified in the character of &quot;Mr. Gray&quot;) has all kind of problems with Earth not the least of which being us humans and our &quot;difficult emotions.&quot; Of course, Mr. Gray is mightily tempted by the &quot;sins of the flesh&quot; which Jonesy and his oh-so-human body and emotions present.These themes have been visited before, and they're not given much in the way of unique treatment here. Even the main protagonists seem like thinly veiled versions of the main characters from IT. The more interesting characters (and, perhaps, the more difficult to write) of Beaver and Pete are removed early on, leaving us with the vaguely suicidal, intellectual snob Henry and the college professor Jonesy - whose only defining characteristic seems to be that his body is all messed up from a recent car accident. (In fact, you could make a case for Jonesy's injured body being the real hero of the book.)The book seems disjointed at first, almost scattered, but about halfway through settles down into a smoother storytelling style. Of course you probably won't give much of a damn at that point as all the interesting elements have either been removed or degenerated into stuff you've seen a million times before, quite often from King himself.There ARE bright spots. King still writes well, and fills the pages with that particular colloquial style he has which makes you feel as if you're being told a spooky story by your uncle while at camp. It isn't exactly a chore to read, just not quite up to what King is capable of.Bottom line: if you're a King fan you will probably find something to enjoy, even though you know it's not his best. If you're not a King fan, perhaps you should wait for the next one or read one of his more recent offerings. Either way, I'm hoping that the next one is better."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"My only hope is that Steven King occasionally reads some of these reviews because if he did, he would notice a growing number of us who have become increasingly unhapphy with his work.My theory is that the author has an adversion to any form of editing. The result a 350 page novel that is bloated to almost 900 pages. Fortunately for the author, there are still a large number of die-hard fans who will always buy and praise anything he writes. I'm convinced that Steve King could publish the white pages of a large city phone book and not only his loyal fans buy it, they would also give it their customary 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"If you're a fan of King, as I am, this won't disappoint. Very typical King style; building suspense, lots of detail and development of characters and the scenery, flashbacks for perspective (or other, sometimes seemingly non-sensical reasons), and characters with quirks that can make them both endearing and loathsome at the same time.I found the nitty gritty details of the plot to be confusing, but I think that's always the way with a King book. He reveals a lot, but generally not quite enough to really GIVE you the answer as to what just happened. That's part of writing true horror (not jump-out-of-your-seat horror, per se, but true to form horrifying storytelling), not always knowing all the who, what, where, why, and how.All in all, King is a fantastic storyteller, and this book is another example of his well-honed craft.People say that if you can sing well, you can sing anything and make it sound great. Well, I think the same goes for great storytelling. Even though there are some borrowed themes as others have pointed out (borrowed from other sources as well as from his own works), if you are a great storyteller, you will amp it up and make it your own. That's what King does here and I think it works extremely well. I never felt like I was reading a \\"remake\\" and never even got that funny \\"have I read this before?\\" feeling. The overall themes (alien invasion, body snatching, battling evil to save the world, etc.) are common, but the way King weaves his tale, you never really feel like they are."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Any die hard S.King fan will enjoy this book, the suspence and horror is all there waiting to be read. No SSDD here."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For a alien type of novel by Stephen king it is very good , lenghtly on certain sections but overall it held your attention because you really wanted to know what happens and if anyone at all survive especially in Kings Novel with ending that is all way a SURPRISE."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher tells the tale of five men, friends since they were boys, who find themselves at the center of an alien incursion onto Earth. Over the course of the book, they contend with the menacing alien life forms that emerge from the deep North woods of Maine, an over-zealous military reaction, and the traumatic events that forged the solid bonds that have kept the men friends since junior high.A few thoughts:As always, King writes honest, real-feeling people. Most interesting this time around is Duddits, the boy around whom the other four boys rallied when they were in junior high. Duddits has Down Syndrome, but also a strong interpersonal connection that manifests in strange and exciting ways. King does a good job, for my money, of crafting authentic relationships between Duddits and the other boys/men.There are hardly any women in this book. The two who get more than a passing sentence have one or two chapters at most, and even then they don't really get filled out as characters. It's the biggest failing in the book, to my mind.As with many of King's books, this one takes place in Derry, where the characters seem to overlap with people and events from other books, such as It, Tommyknockers, and \\"The Body.\\" This book reminds me a lot of It, too, for its oscillation between childhood and adult stories, and the power of friendships forged in junior high.Like The Regulators, this book includes a significant portion in which a character is secluded inside his own mind, cut off from the outer world but still existing in there. Because this character had also suffered a brutal injury from being hit by a car, one can't help but imagine King was exorcising some of his own demons in writing those pieces.One particularly amusing part of the story comes from the alien, an almost non-sentient intelligence that just happens to take control of a man, learning to enjoy the world of the flesh. Not surprisingly, he likes bacon. (The non-sentient alien intelligence reminds me of the creepy ship in Peter Watt's Blindsight.Dreamcatcher entertains, even as it runs too long. It took me a while to get into, but as usual with King, once the real menace starts, it was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is not for everyone. But It surely is amazing. I've seen the movie as well and the book is far better. For starters, the book is able to paint a better picture for the reader, then the movie did on back stories. My only problem is how hollywood changed the story half way through. So that is one big reason why people should read this book. Another is that it has the same dedication to the way Mr. King plays on words as he did with some of his earlier work. All in all, for myself, it's a 4 out of 5 star review. The reason it doesn't have 5 stars? Not as gripping as some of his other books."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For me, this book probably ranks right about in the middle between King's best and worst books. It's entertaining, and you can get into the characters, but I guess the book is more of a \\"downer\\" than most of his. I won't say and spoil it for anybody.As far as the audiobook goes, the reader takes a little getting used to. He reads in kind of this matter-of-fact \\"Mr Rogers Neighborhood\\" kind of voice, which at first seems really odd given the subject matter. Eventually you get used to it though, and it's not so bad."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is a THICK read, and there is a LOT of stuff, so this is in no way a 'light' read, but if you're a Stephen King fan or have already read at least several of his books, this should be enjoyable for you. It would take too much to go into the plot and the spotlight reviews for this product do a good job of explaining, so I won't go into that. If you have seen the movie, don't judge this book by that - the book is WAY better."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher had one of the goriest scenes in the world of liturature. The thought of an alien biting its way out of someone's rectum is just sickening, and strangely appealing.I really enjoyed the book but like with so many novels of this size, the ending almost always lacks from the rest of the book. Ive seen this happen many times, even to the best of authors: Dean Koontz, John Saul, James Patterson.After a drawn out ending that could have been 150 pages less than what it was, my interest level drudged down a bit, but I still enjoyed the book very much. Otherwise it would have been five stars."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I got this book because it was cheap, being sold on Amazon as a bargain discount book. I enjoyed the story, and it got emotional for what happens at the end. Sad, but I guess that's the point. The character development and action and horror scenes are awesome. Another winner from King!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"In Dreamcatcher, four men, friends since childhood, are out hunting in the woods of Maine. A lone hunter stumbles upon their cabin sputtering nonsense about mysterious \\"lights in the sky\\" while being plagued with the worst case of gas ever imaginable. It's Stephen King so you know what's coming.The first third of the book is great. King hooks us right in and then beats a frantic pace: a snowmobile barreling through the woods with the reader being dragged gleefully through the snow. We can't help but stay up late turning those pages to find out what happens next. He seems merciful when he idles down the pace for the middle third so that we can catch our breath and brush off some of that snow.But it dawns on me that some of this landscape seems familiar. We're given backstory on the protagonists, a group of men who've been friends since childhood, albeit a bit more distant (It). We get the long-winded side trip flashback, a King staple, where the boys confronted an evil back then (though it was a different evil) and now, as adults, face an evil alien threat in the woods (Tommyknockers). And then there's the psychotic government agent who becomes obsessed with one of the protagonists (Firestarter) and starts to hunt him down. Stephen King is one of the most prolific writers of our age. So, it shouldn't come as a surprise that he began re-using some elements of past stories. But I was willing to let all this slide if the book ended well.The final chase consumes the last third of the book, but it drags. And when the crisis is resolved, it felt anti-climactic. Although King doesn't use the old \\"it was all a dream\\" cliche, the ending, for me at least, was just as insulting. I had to re-read it a couple times just to make sure I was reading it right. Maybe this was some kind of catharsis for King. He wrote this story while recovering from an accident where he was struck by a minivan (which is paralleled by one of the characters here). I haven't read any other of his post-accident works and after reading this I'm not sure when I will."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For the two days in took me to read this book, Stephen King's amazing tale, and intricate characters, invaded my consciousness. I couldn't put this book down, and when I did the novel invaded my unconsciousness as well. The book is fabulously written, right down to the littlest details. This book will sweep you away into a current world of terror and to a past world of love, friendship, and a happier existence for the characters. If anything, this book will give you a laugh or two, and a literative view of the mind. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I enjoyed this book enough to be satisfied.

First, while this is a plot to remember, in the middle of the book, it all gets confusing when King describes Jonesy's mind games with Mr. Gray. I had to at least read Chapter 11 and 12 three or four times to know what the heck was going on! The story starts off great, then it tumbles, and gets a push at the end when everything explains itself(especially with Duddits's ability). The ending of the main story is overall good, but the epilogue is one of the worst writing I've seen from King.Overall this is not King's best, although being King, that's not necessarily a bad thing."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I guess my review is somewhat biased just because I'm a huge Stephen King fan. But does that really matter anymore? There are too many of us out there, and practically everybody who picks up a Stephen King novel is a die-hard fan.I awaited the release of 'Dreamcatcher' for several months, and got the last copy at the store the day it was released..lucky me. Immediately I began reading it, only to find myself confused. The first 200 pages or so are incredibly hard to get through. I stopped around Easter because I received 'The Shining' as a present, and read that in under two days. Deciding to get back to 'Dreamcatcher', I hit the slowness again.Once I got passed the first third of the book, however, I became incredibly interested. Maybe it was because I found myself caring much more about Henry, Owen and Jonesy. There really was no main bad guy...Mr. Gray, I guess, but Kurtz, too, and I found myself turning the pages faster than ever as the chase began. That, in my opinion, was the best part of the book.Overall, 'Dreamcatcher' was a little long, and the first 200 pages could've been trimmed to be a little more interesting. Duddits's role in the book wasn't as shocking as I hoped it would be, but I've come to realize that Stephen King novels have never had the most shocking endings...they normally come to a decent close, but I have yet to say, &quot;Wow, I didn't expect that.&quot; This book deserves no more than 3 stars, no less either. If you're a fan and have read past works by King, go ahead and read this one...but if you're just starting off, and you want to get to know some of his better books, start with 'The Shining', 'Salem's Lot' or 'The Green Mile'...thanx for reading my review."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I am a definite die-hard King fan, and I was extremely excited when I received a new book from him through the mail (it's awesome being a member of his book club). I guess it is just because I have so much trust in him that I thoroughly enjoyed this one...I was amazed when I read all the negative reviews. How could anyone not care for the characters??? King is a master of character development--that has always been his strength. His magic is still there, and better than ever. I love how he focuses our attention, hopes, and dreams on those characters who are not always mainstream popular. Also,many disparaging remarks have been made about &quot;Insomnia&quot;--I truly loved that book, i am continually amazed at the ideas he comes up with, and hope that he writes many many more books such as these. But I must say....the Dark Tower Series RULES!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I would like to start off saying to those who have read other works of King, that besides IT and The Stand, these are the most colorful, animated characters yet described in any of his novels. Why people are contradicting it's uniqueness is quite obvious. Readers do not want something as far fetched as this book is...but is far fetched bad? It's a book! Read, and don't believe! enjoy! It is not only the story and character's in this novel that amaze me, but that Stephen King wrote this book longhand. By pen! six-hundred pages writing manually! Awesome. So besides the excellent storyline, the scary setting (Derry, Maine of course) and beautifal characters, there are many other reasons to read this book, relate, and enjoy it. I'll take my leave. I shan't tell you any of the goings-on in this magnificent book, that would ruin it for you!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"While Dreamcatcher itself is not confusing, I am nevertheless bewildered by what Mr.King may have been trying to achieve here.On the one hand this is the story of Jonesy, Pete, Duddits, Beaver and Henry. Five boys, now men, who were brought together after a degrading incident in which Duddits, who suffers from Down Syndrome, is ridiculed by a group of bullies. Regardless of whether or not you are a fan of horror stories, you can't help but get intrigued by these characters enough that you feel compelled to read on, just to see how their lives turn out.On the other hand is the story of: aliens who look humanoid, but are actually spore carriers which are intent on taking over the world, or not. A bunch of crazed military personnel who don't think twice about committing genocide on their own fellow citizens. A one-dimensional psychopath who is entrusted to obliterate an entire forest's animal and human population, but who is intent on revenge. And the internal fight by one of the main characters who by the end of the tale may have only been suffering from a delusional case of split personality disorder!If this had been written as two distinct novellas I would have devoured the first story, and fed the second on to one of the space weasels.

The first few chapters, I thought, OK here we go...but about 1/3 of the way through the book, I became disenchanted. This book reminded me of the Tommyknockers, the one book of his that I was not to thrilled with either...I was very interested in the characters at first, but suddenly they are all mostly dead...this book flip flopped back and forth with little explanation. Unlike IT, which also flip flopped back and forth, but that was very easy to read. I felt this novel was NOT easy to read, and found myself skimming over too much, just because I did not care...which is very unlike me when I read a SK novel. Hopefully, the next one will be better !!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King, Dreamcatcher (Scribner's, 2001)I should have known better than to start a new Stephen King book at 11PM on a weeknight. Two and a half days later, exhausted, I put it down.Dreamcatcher (whose working title was &quot;Cancer;&quot; according to King's afterword, his wife wouldn't let him release it with that title) is not, despite what you may have heard, a sequel to It (though traces of that book show up now and again). It's the story of five friends, both as they came of age and as they came together again to battle a nasty creature. Yeah, it does kind of sound like It, doesn't it? In fact, resonances of earlier King works can be found throughout this novel, not just through the calling to mind of old characters-- a long-ingrained King trick-- but through the book's style and plot.In my usual mechanism of giving writers I like the benefit of the doubt, I think King's going through a transitional phase, and this was the book where he worked it out. It's still a relatively good book; after all, King was on a real tear before the accident, having just released two novels (Tom Gordon and Bag of Bones) and a short story (&quot;Blind Willie&quot;) thank rank among the best writing he's ever produced, and it stands to reason that some of the afterglow would carry over into the post-accident work. But if he continues on in this tradition, there should be a humdinger coming next, or perhaps two books down the road.I say this because, though King's writing is still of the fast-and-easy-to-read genre (whatever else it may be, a King book is eminently readable), he seems to be getting more expansive. Two hundred pages into this six-hundred-plus page monster and King was still gearing up to let fly. It read fast, granted, but the steam was still building. Unfortunately, it never really blew its top, and it ended up riging a bit hollow because of that. That's why I think King's in the midst of a style shift, not the surface style of witty on-the-mark cultural references and the ability to fully draw a minor character in two sentences flat, but down in the heart of things. There was a shifting that started a few books back, not as glitzy as the shift between Barker's _The Damnation Game_ and _Weaveworld_, but a shift nonetheless, and it's now starting to affect the writing. Soon, it'll pull an Alien-style chest-burster, and something new will arise.So I end up categorizing this book with Firestarter, Gerald's Game, and a few others-- a kind of workshop that found its way to the publisher. Of that particular category of Kingisms, though, this is by far the best to date, and I feel that it may presage the finest work King's ever done; history will tell, eventually. ***"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Yes SK is back and he is doing clasic King horror. I read a review that said not to start this book if you never read SK, but i would reccomend it to the new timers especialy the teenagers just getting into SK. This book starts a little slow but once you are past that you can not put it down. Well at least i could not, he does a great job of keeping you on the egde of your couch,bed or where ever you like to read. i enjoyed it till the end even though i still have my doubt about is the characters still have certain abilities. I am in the middle of another book right know but as soon as i finish i plan on reading it again."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"DREAMCATCHER isn't a Saturday matinee. It doesn't grab you by the throat from page one and throttle you into meek submission, pushing your Instant Gratification buttons and propelling you to the end without permitting you time to grab a sandwich or attend to matters of personal hygiene. It isn't a comic book. It isn't a sitcom. Expect to invest some time into this bad boy, because like most of his best work, it's oh-so-meaty. Lord help us, we might even have to (gasp!) think a little.The book starts gently, so for those looking for an immediate splash of gore, don't let yourselves be disappointed. When it comes, the horror (and it does come, rest assured) is as visceral and wet and as personal as anything we've seen from him in the last ten years. The King sense of isolation (alienation?) is alive and well here, and there's plenty to go around. I'm not going to outline the plot; that's already been done ad nauseum by previous reviewers, but I will note that the book contains two of the most unsettling scenes he's ever published (God only knows what he's got in his desk drawers, so &quot;published&quot; seems a better fit than &quot;written&quot;), and he doesn't shed a single drop of blood in either one.I haven't liked everything he's done, but DREAMCATCHER soars. Sometimes, just sometimes, you'll discover a writer or a painter or a muscian working in your lifetime who transcends the monotony of his contemporaries and produces art of such mastery that he or she defines what it means to be human. Bach did this. Beethoven. Picasso. Michaelangelo. Dickens. Einstein. And in a hundred years, when nearly everyone who lives today is worm food or dust in a jar, people will realize that hey, yeah, Stephen King did it too.Do yourself a favor and pick up a few of his books, including DREAMCATCHER. With 2-day delivery available, you won't even have to wait a hundred years to enjoy them."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King has certainly seemed to regain some of his form since his dreary efforts of the mid-nineties (see &quot;Insomnia&quot;, &quot;Rose Madder&quot;). &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; continues the trend. Although I agree with much of the printed criticsm, to the effect that this is not a scary novel, it is certainly a compelling page turner.&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; has some interesting insights into male friendship, and the psychological horror he subjects his heros to is chilling. Jonesy's internal struggle with Mr. Gray is riveting, and Henry's battle with his own internal demons is handled with great skill.I could not believe how quick King was to kill off main characters in this book. I think that it is important in both the horror and the fantasy genres for an author to have no qualms about killing protagonists. It strips security from the reader, and usually evokes a strong emotional response. Isn't that what good genre writing is supposed to do?The final 2/3 of the novel make up one of the better extended chase scenes I have read in a long time. King often has trouble ending his books, but the climax to &quot;Dreamcacher&quot; was quite engaging.King does seem to recycle some of his earlier material in this effort (I am pretty sure I have met both Duddits and Mr. Kurtz under different names in earlier fiction), and he gets a little muddy in his explanations of what the dreamcatcher actually is, but on the whole, this is an exciting and tense read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First, I'm a hardcore Stephen King fan. The man is a great writer on many levels, especially his hurmor and sense of irony. But, this one doesn't make it. I think King is trying too hard to work through his emotions since he was hit by a van, and I understand that. However, in so doing he's created a story that is so jumbled it's hard to follow. And what's worse, it's hard to care about any of the characters. The story is all over the place, and one of the characters even has a near fatal run-in with a car. Plus, the four main characters, men who were friends since childhood, are too much like the kids in &quot;Stand By Me.&quot; I hope Mr. King can come to grips with his ordeal, and I wish him well."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is less accessable than many of Mr. King's works. Many of the reviewers have given up on reading it partway through. This is a mistake, as you begin to see the events which have unfolded in a very different light by the end of the book. While at its surface level the plot doesn't unfold as brilliantly in Mr. King's masterpieces, in its undercurrents it is more terrifying and poignant. After finishing it I decided I would never read it again, but I have found myself going back to reread the seminal sequences - this book is worth the exercise to read deeply, think, and feel what he is saying.The characters of Duddits, Jonesy, and Henry are so rich that the fact the others are more shallow, or similar to characters in other King books didn't bother me at all.Those reviewers who thought that childhood equals innocence and purity, or that the Duddits character is pure light, are missing a very important undercurrent. This book affected me deeply, partly because I have a son who is autistic and otherworldly, and it was impossible not to see him in the Duddits character, about whom there is more than there seems.This is not a give-'em-what they want book, (one can tell by the number of unfavorable reviews), but it is a worthwhile, if emotionally exhausting journey."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Having read practically all of Stephen King's book, I'm a huge fan. His books almost never fail to get me turning the pages at a feverish pace (The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was a notable and thankfully short exception). And although I loved The Green Mile and Bag of Bones, it is only after having finished The Dreamcatcher that I realize how much I crave this kind of book. The Dreamcatcher is old-fashioned King; a kind of combination of The Tommyknockers (didn't care much for that one) and It (absolutely loved it). I don't know why so many reviewers keep comparing The Dreamcatcher to The Stand, because it's nothing like it! The story is about four boyhood friends that meet every year to hunt in the woods. But this year things go horribly wrong and before you know it, you're in the middle of some wonderful SF-horror. Particularly the way Jonesy survives in his own mind by creating his own little room and the way he interacts with the outside world is absolute mind-blowing (especially considering the revelation at the end of the book...). The story is less of a psychological novel than some of the reviewers want you to believe, but a very satisfying read for any horror/King fan. Some of the scenes are truly gruesome and reminded me of some scenes in Misery (my personal favorite). So, thumbs up for Steve, buy this one and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Because \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is the novel Stephen King wrote (in longhand) while recuperating from his near-fatal accident, it easily lends itself to all sorts of psychological interpretations.

Twenty-five years later, the four friends take their usual November hunting trip at Hole-in-the-Wall, not knowing what they have stepped into. A hunter, McCarthy, stumbles into their camp unleashing something that they have no idea what it is. I won't go into details, but the rest of the story is very interesting throughout.The best part of Dreamcatcher is most definitely the main characters. Stephen King has always been able to create well-developed characters, and he does not dissappoint here. As a reader, I found myself deeply interested in the characters. The frienships among Henry, Jonesy, Pete, and Beaver are fully believable. The story is that much more enjoyable because I was emotionally involved with the characters. The actual storyline is different from what I expected, but it was still good. Be forewarned, this is a huge book, 879 pages, but it is worth it.

However, after reading the book, I do not want to see the movie at all. There are a lot of cheap thrills in the book...the play on bodily functions, while funny, is dull after awhile. Duddit's cancer and Down's Syndrome seem somewhat overly dramatic, like the book is trying too hard. Plus, by page 200, I cannot help but feel stupid for reading the book. Nothing in the book is fresh or imaginative. The emotions that are supposed to be stirred up are unconvincing and uninspiring. Although the plot is interesting enough for me to want to find out what happens at the end, I feel like I wasted a lot of time reading all 600+ pages of it when I finished it.

Pardon me for dissenting, but when every other novel (and sometimes several in a row) are of as poor quality as \\"Dreamcatcher\\" maybe it's time to take a laxative and kick off the shoes for awhile.This book is cookie cutter King at his worst. Not only does he bite heavily from other writers and filmmakers, constantly quoting other superior works that deal with similar themes and plot elements, but he's guilty also of ripping off his own material. We have shipwrecked aliens that use mind manipulation techniques to control humans (Tommyknockers), recurring flashbacks to life altering events in the characters' childhood (It), an intellectual infant who turns out to hold the key to everything (too many books to count)... the list goes on. Unfortunately so does the book. I suppose it's King's matter-of-fact storytelling that makes some fans feel every word that spills out of his typewriter is priceless, but it's rather obvious to the more objective reader that very little he's churned out in the past 10-15 years (at least) couldn't use some judicious editing. Most of the back story in \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is mildly diverting but not at all necessary. Not to mention it smacks of that old \\"Moby Dick\\" ploy of heightening the suspense by tossing in chapters unrelated to the current narrative at key moments. Problem is, Melville employed this technique with expertise and finesse, rarely overstaying his welcome, whereas you get the impression with \\"Dreamcatcher\\" that King just doesn't have much of a plot to work with and is padding out the opening segments with excess exposition in a vain attempt to achieve some sort of balance with the later parts of the book. This \\"balancing\\" means the novel takes over 300 pages to really get going.I hate to even expand too much farther on my thoughts here, since most people reading this review will probably be diehard Stephen King fans and the ensuing carpal tunnel syndrome will be all for naught, but when that \\"4 out of 162 people found this review helpful\\" eventually appears above the byline I want to make sure I've earned the right to protest (after all, rating a review is not supposed to be whether you agree with the writer's assessment, but rather how well they've elucidated their opinion and given someone who hasn't read the book an idea of what they might expect).So what else do we have here? First of all, as others have already mentioned, King's penchant for namechecking pop culture icons and including snatches of classic rock tunes in his work used to be cute and quirky, but after thirty years of publishing it's now only indicative of his inability to get up off his laurels and try something fresh.Furthermore, though King has long been known for his realistic portrayals of children (particularly teenagers), he also has a tendency to take advantage of their youthful uncertainty to make them do things that would seem plausible to an adult. In \\"Dreamcatcher\\", the pivotal event in the lead characters' life comes when, as 8th graders, they come across some high school bullies tormenting a mentally disabled kid and intervene. That in and of itself is not all that unbelievable, but the fact that they befriend this kid (Duddits for those keeping score) for life seems like an act of charity unbefitting these capricious youths. I say this because, frankly, Duddits as written is not all that endearing a character. I'm sure his enthusiasm and baby talk were meant to be cute, but instead he comes off as a complete caricature that is bordering on offensive in and of itself. The bottom line is he's portrayed as a challenged individual that would be more likely to be tolerated for his inadequacies than embraced as a joy to be around. Furthermore, I'm getting a little sick of these \\"innocence as salvation\\" motifs in King's work, but if it had to continue here he could have at least fleshed out the whole telepathy aspect a bit more, maybe explore the possibility that Duddits' mental deficiency is tied in with his telepathic abilities, etc. And speaking of fleshing out character arcs, one character's drinking problem is mentioned repeatedly but only serves to force him into making one dumb decision that helps to drive the plot forward (deus ex machina, anyone?). Another character's accident the previous year is introduced as a psychically tramautic event but only gives King an excuse to introduce the element of intrusive thoughts before the aliens swoop in and give them something of their own to think about.I could go on but I'm held to 1000 words and I've gotta be getting close. Hopefully I've managed to convey the depth of inadequacies in this book without beating anyone over the head, but the various levels of failings in \\"Dreamcatcher\\" do warrant more than a brief \\"thumbs up/down\\" synopsis, especially in light of King's reputation and prior body of work. I'm sure he'll bounce back (and forth), but in the meantime he might consider the idea that not everything he sits down to write needs to see the light of day. There's another book entitled \\"The Lost Writings of Stephen King\\" that I was perusing recently, and I noticed that the lion's share of unpublished fiction was either written in his younger, pre-published days or in those first 5-10 years of semi-stardom, when his work was judged strictly by it's quality and not just because it had King's name on the cover."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Like quite a few other Stephen King books, (e.g. \\"Christine\\", \\"Needful Things\\", \\"The Tommyknockers\\", \\"Desperation\\" and even \\"Misery\\"), the story starts off with life going on as normal. We go from there to an uneasy feeling that not everything's as it should be. Then things start to get slightly skewed with the protagonists feeling just a little nervous. They don't know exactly what's wrong, but something's not right. Finally, all hell breaks loose and you are left with no doubt that you have just passed into Stephen King's realm, and through all the unreality, you still get the faint glimmer that this impossible situation just could be possible. We're faced with aliens in the woods, a possible threat to humanity and average guys who, on the surface, aren't really equipped for the fight.You will probably want to read this book if: - You're a Stephen King fan who really enjoyed The Tommyknockers. - You want to read a new explanation for all of those supposed UFO sightings over the years. -You enjoy epic, save-the-world stories that, let's face it, could never happen - could they?You probably won't want to read this book if: - You didn't enjoy The Tommyknockers. - You like the action at a sustained fast-pace. The book does tend to lose momentum mid-way through. - You have a thing about profanity.Although the story is rather formulaic, this formula is the reason I read Stephen King books."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"For my money, Hearts in Atlantis is King's best work, narrowing out Pet Semetary, the Dark Tower series and the first half of It by a little bit. Dreamcatcher isn't quite as good as those, but it's still a good read (above all else, King is one of the best storytellers alive).Things I liked: * The kids in his story are utterly believeable - he certainly hasn't lost touch with his childhood.* As always, his references to other stories are clever in-jokes (and having this story set partially in Derry, I'd have been disappointed if there weren't any at all)* The interior battle between Mr. Gray and Jonesy was VERY well written - another thing King can capture quite believably is the not-quite-reality of dreams.* (very minor spoiler alert) The evolution of Mr. Gray from an alien 'intelligence' into something with human emotions/desires (bacon!) was nicely and subtly done.* One thing I have always liked about King's work (and my wife doesn't) are his little sidepaths he takes his story down. The little ancedotes that let us get into his characters heads are essential, I think, to character development (my wife thinks they distract from the plot).* Duddits was a fantastic character - even though he's essentially the same guy as the Wolf in Talisman, and Tom &quot;M-O-O-N spells moon&quot; Cullen from the Stand, it's a character I really like. Sort of like an old friend popping up unexpectedly :-).Things I didnt like (and they're minor): * It reminded me a little of Tommyknockers, which I didn't enjoy at all. That has nothing to do with this book, actually, but I still don't forgive him for that one.* Same thing with the last 200 pages of It, which was an absolutely fantastic story until he dragged in all that Spider and Turtle crap.* His military people are very basic goons - even Kurtz isn't particularly well-drawn. The most significant insight we're given into his personality is that he never dreams and is thus 'unsane'. That's a wonderfully evocative way of describing the character, but I would've liked more of that. I suppose that King wanted to keep him sort of unknowable (we're frightened by what we don't understand, which is why Dr. Lecter was so scary in Silence of the Lambs, and so ridiculous in Hannibal when Thomas Harris gave him a back story). However, for Kurtz, it just didn't gel for me - I just got the impression he was a cranky military asshole, not some sort of insane, random monster.* Same thing with the hunters and other victims/refugees in the paddock of Blue Area - very poor sketched out (although, admittedly, they really didn't need much character depth). Still, it would've been nice to get a little back story on a handful of them - maybe follow them through to get a little perspective (I don't think it would've distracted from the story too much).* The only military character who got a little depth was Owen, and that's mostly because conflicted characters *have* to be given depth, or they make no sense. That said, I actually ended up liking him, but I would've liked to know more about him (in addition to the platter-breaking ancedote).In the end, like almost all of King's books, I highly recommend it, flaws and all - it's an entertaining read, and will make you think a little bit :-)"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"First let me say I love Stephen King. I'm pretty sure I've read everything he has written. I've seen most movies he's been involved with. But I have to tell you....Coming from Stephen King, this book is a huge let down. I am definitely more of a fan of the \\"old\\" King.I admit I haven't absolutely loved alot of his more recent works. But to be brutally honest: this book [stinks].The plot is classic King. In a nutshell, four childhood friends are hunting in Northern Maine. Aliens land. Shadowy government organizations get involved. Our four heroes do battle with the aliens and the government and save the world and themselves. If this turns you off, you should forget reading anything by Stephen King. Pick up an Alice Walker novel instead.\\"Dreamcatcher\\" throws alot of characters at you. Despite the fact that it goes on for 600+ pages, there is precious little character development. I found myself caring very little about any of them. King also uses alot of pyschological imagery that is hard to follow. In my opinion, most of it is unnecessary. He also uses alot of symbolism relating to dreamcatchers, which frankly, seems like a stretch. It's almost like he added it as an afterthought to the final draft. After reading his notes at the end of the novel, I'm convinced that's exactly what he did.If you've never read anything by Stephen King, don't start with \\"Dreamcatcher\\". \\"The Stand\\" and \\"It\\" are infintely superior novels. \\"The Tommyknockers\\" is a more lucid tale featuring aliens. \\"Christine\\" and \\"Cujo\\" are very good shorter novels. In his more recent books, \\"Bag of Bones\\" and \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" are almost as good.If you're a Stephen King die-hard, you're going to read \\"Dreamcatcher\\" no matter what I tell you. Remember what I said about the library!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"In my opinion, horror works best when it takes ordinary people, in ordinary situations, and introduces unexplainable events. It dosen't work when the unexplainable is just too laughable...or in this case nauseating, to get frightened about. I have read nearly all of King's works, and lately he seems to be severely running out of ideas, thus the need to reintroduce some of his old ones (i.e. the aliens in the Tommyknockers who affected people by having them lose their teeth).The book started out just fine by introducing us to the four characters who came together on a fateful day that they saved another student from harm. But just as quickly, the aliens arrive and our characters start to die! King then introduces new, much less interesting characters, and the book begins to spiral down into a kind of psychological morass of who's really in who's head.........BORING!All of King's bad habits are here, the impossably flawed main character who sits helplessly doing nothing for most of the book, the long charactor digressions, mostly while in the middle of conversations, many of which go on for pages, the childlike fascination with bodily functions. I remember reading where King once said that if he couldn't horrify his readers, then he'd go for the gross-out. Well I didn't lose any sleep reading this mush, but it did leave me feeling sick when I finished....and that's not a good thing."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm glad to have &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; on my bookshelf. If for no other reason than because I was almost sure, two years ago, that there wouldn't ever be such a thing as a new Stephen King novel. I remember seeing Stephen King and his wife Tabitha interviewed on tv the fall after his near-fatal accident, and his spirits were so low, it really didn't look like he would ever be writing again. The gloomy feel of that interview, coupled with the Bartelby-&quot;I prefer not to&quot; theme running through the end of &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; made me worry that that might be his last full length novel.Which made me sad, because I've been one of King's Constant Readers since my twelfth birthday, when I finished &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;. I've been with him through the good years and the bad. The occasional rambling blahs and the cherished moments of pure transcendent bliss, like at the end of &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; from &quot;Heart in Atlantis,&quot; where I simultaneously cried my eyes out and felt a surging thankfulness for being alive and being in the world, and having that book in my hands at that moment. A perfect moment.For that moment, and many moments like it over the years, I consider Stephen King a good friend. I didn't like the idea of not hearing the voice of my friend ever again.Especially when his last book, the collection &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; contained some of the best writing he'd ever done. It left me starving for more great Stephen King. Any Stephen King, really.So I'm extremely happy to still be hearing his voice, to be reading his words. It makes the world a better place to be in.But I'll have to say that &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; isn't nearly as good as the brilliant &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; It's not bad--I'd rank it somewhere around the middle of his works. In my opinion, it's much better than &quot;Insomnia&quot; and most of the post-&quot;It&quot; pre-&quot;Green Mile&quot; stuff. There are some great characters here, some moving moments, and some places where I really felt a bit of that old familiar surge of wonder.However, at 700+ pages, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is much longer than it needs to be, and it's bogged down with some clunky sub-plots and some routine-ish characters. I will say, though, that despite its excess length, there is some enjoyable momentum as the story reaches its climax.There are some great flashes of light here, as well. Enough to catch you off guard, and make you glad you came out to play. But they're just not sustained enough or consistent enough to engage you the way that King's best books do--&quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; &quot;It,&quot; &quot;The Shining,&quot; and &quot;The Stand,&quot; to name a few."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher may be one of the most well written novels Stephen King has ever published. From a literary standpoint, it cannot be easily topped as a modern telling of horrors both internal and external. I've been reading him for years and can think of no other novel so perfect and stylish syntactically. He mentions that he wrote the first draft longhand and maybe that's the difference. Whatever the reason, Dreamcatcher stands as a shining example of his adept knowledge of prose.Most people compare all Stephen King books to one of two of his previous works. They either set the plumb line at The Stand or It. There are a few fringe non-conformists who choose The Shining or Salem's Lot or (in my case) Christine. For many, his books are either better or worse than those two. I try not to do that; though, as I admitted parenthetically, no one is perfect. For those who do, I'll say that this book is no better than any I've mentioned.That's not to say it's bad. It isn't. It's fantastic - sort of an R or NC-17 rated (depending on the MPAA's stand on flatulence) X-Files. The premise is intriguing and well thought out - though there are a few wholes in the \\"why didn't they just do this\\" category. The thematic threads and persistent patterns weave brilliantly through the novel to create a beautiful, if not slightly bloated tome that any author could be proud of. Can Stephen King? I think so. Considering he wrote the lion's share of it after his accident, he ought to be damn proud. It's a fantastic story and I'm glad he told it. It's not a story that had to be told and I don't know how important it is to the benefit of man, but it made me happy to read it. And isn't happiness - from the instant-gratifying smoker to the planning financier - what it's all about?I'm not going to give any plot away, but I will say this book needs to be finished once it's begun. I don't know if I've ever read a more subtle twist ending than when I read the final pages of Dreamcatcher. Sort of like sailing to England and washing ashore on Mars. Truly left field, I promise.Is it King's best work? No. I prefer to think that his best work is yet to come."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"After hearing so much about King's first post-accident novel, I was anxious to pick up Dreamcatcher. After all, the book jacket said: &quot;Not since The Stand has King crafted a story of such astonishing range--and never before has he contended with the heart of darkness so frankly.&quot; Sounds good, doesn't it?Well, don't believe everything you read. The Stand is considered by many to be a classic work of fiction--arguably well-respected and long-remembered. Unfortunately, Dreamcatcher isn't going to be one of those books that &quot;stick&quot; the way The Stand did. It's a mediocre novel--at least for Stephen King--and a forgettable one.King's strength lies in his characters. He doesn't disappoint when he introduces us to four long-time friends: Henry, Jonesy, Beaver and Peter. It doesn't take King long to make us care about these guys, and to show us that, although their lives seem fairly mundane, they're far from ordinary.Despite some likeable characters, Dreamcatcher seems a bit manipulative. The character of Duddits, a boy-man with Down's syndrome, feels like a tool to hook us into adoring the four men (the book's main characters) who were kind to him as Junior High-aged kids.All the X-Files imagery didn't work for me, either. Perhaps it's that we're overloaded with media images of little gray men with big, onyx-colored eyes, or maybe it's just because news of UFO's and foo lights in the sky seems, well, old hat. Either way, Dreamcatcher had a sort of been-there done-that feel.I expect a good Stephen King book to hold me captive so that I just can't put it down. I want to be kept awake reading past 3 a.m. (I believe I read in an interview somewhere that this is a goal of King's--to keep his readers up nights, not because they're frightened, but because they just can't put his book down.) I read Dreamcatcher a chapter or two at a time, and then put it back on the bedside table. I may have kept nibbling at the bait, but I was never truly hooked."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Let us start with the end, shall we? Stephen King writes in his author's note that he is grateful to have been able to write this novel at all. Given that he almost died, that would be an absolute truth. We, as faithful readers, are also glad he was able to write this novel. The fact that it is one of his worst works yet should be a moot point.Dreamcatcher is not a good book. It is not completely terrible, but there are so many things wrong with it that it might as well be. It took me almost two weeks to finish it; I can safely say that in the 16 years I have been reading King faithfully, it has never taken me less than a few days to devour one of his works, even when I was under ten years old. Dreamcatcher is ultimately a long, tedious read, one that becomes boring, repetitive, and derivative almost at once.The story itself starts out promising; four men, childhood friends, join for their annual hunting trip in the woods. Things immediately go crazy with the arrival of a lost man, sick and gassy, and from thereforth the story explodes. Alien landings, intestine-invading creatures, telepathy, military commanders, down-syndrome, murder, car (or Humvee) chases, and ravenous cravings for bacon abound. The story is a mish-mash of several ideas that never quite add up.King's strongest point has always been his characters, but with all the &quot;action&quot; going on here, we never quite get enough of that. We touch down on several different people, back-pedal a bit to witness a few scenes from several pasts, but not enough to satisfy what we need. To center around a group of men who have a meaningful bond since childhood, King does not focus enough on this point to make us care for the story. It is easy to start to like Jonesy, Henry, Beaver, Pete and Duddits, and want more of them, but King simply doesn't give it up.Dreamcatchers is one of King's weakest works. Many compare it to Tommyknockers, and I agree. If you didn't like that one much, don't expect to get more from this latest work. One can only hope that his next novel is better. It can't really get much worse."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Despite some of the negative reviews that I've read about this book, I decided to read it anyway. Stephen King books are always adventurous and thrilling, and I didn't want to miss out on this one. It hit the bullseye, and allowed me to breath a sigh of relief...King still knows how to write one heck of a book!This lenghty novel (879 pages) was a rollar coaster ride of ups and downs, thrills and spills (on the gory side), and emotions of &quot;the 3rd kind&quot; mixed all together. The base of this story is 4 childhood friends who are on their annual hunting trip, when an unusual stranger stumbles into camp. The strange man has far fetched explanations and gives off a horrible stench. Soon after, the 4 friends are each thrown into a whirlwind of events that leaves each one of them feeling isolated and scared. The worst fears from outer space have come true, and the whole world's safety could depend on these 4 somewhat unstable people. A brave deed from the past may be the only chance of survival.If I could give it 4 1/2 stars, I would. The only reason that I didn't give it a full 5 stars was that it could have been shortened just a bit. Forget all the talk about &quot;too much gore&quot;. It's practically needed to get the full effect! Go out and read this book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book kept me on the edge of my seat. A great read, Anyone with half a mind will be intrigued as the story goes on with Beaver, Pete, Henry, Jonesy, And Douglas (Duddits). If anyone has read any stephen king and liked it than this will be a great addition to your collection."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I read this entire book during a recent bout with the flu. I've always enjoyed Stephen King's books though there have been a few I haven't liked as much in the past but all of his books are entertaining. This book is one of those I couldn't put down and couldn't stop reading until the last page. Its a very involving story about four friends who go on a hunting trip only to find more than they bargained for when a stranger stumbled into camp. Its a sci fi book that has a lot of heart and feeling. Its sad, its funny and it never disappointed me.This is a book that a reader of simple stories might find too involving. It jumps around from character to character and it also jumps back in time. The characters are all very well-drawn and real. The four friends are people you really care about when you read this and you feel sad when a character is killed. I don't want to spoil the plot too much so I will just say that I found King's aliens to be a very good interpretation. A little different than the usual fare.The interweaving of the past and the present was very well done. The last hundred pages is very suspenseful, leading you to the conclusion and a shocking revelation. All in all, it was a brilliant piece of work. I think it was one of his best."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Avoid unless desperate for a Kingfix. This novel blows a gasket in the final &quot;act.&quot; Up until that point, I was hooked, especially after two hundred odd pages of a gripping chase sequence. But the long heralded return of the Duddits character, while moving, is also a major let down. King is one hell of a yarn spinner and sustains interest throughout, but tale's end is an abrupt fizzle, downgrading this into a routine X-FILES pastiche. DREAMCATCHER does not continue King's winning streak begun with BAG OF BONES and then THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. No worries, he's sure to get back into the groove in the future."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I found this novel to be consistent with most of King's work since 1992. I'm not sure what it is, but he seems to always start out extremely strong with excellent plot and character development only to fizzle out by the end of the book with a sub-par ending. This holds true for such books as Rose Madder, Insomnia, and Desperation. In Dreamcathcer, I was 300 pages in and still hooked, anxiously trying to determine where this story was taking me and the fate of the masterly-developed characters. By the end of the novel, the chase was on and I had lost interest and was desperately trying just to finish the book. Personally, I find King's best work to be those in which he doesn't stray to far from the norm."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I was hooked from page one. As always with Stephen King, the characters are rich, the dialogue witty and on target. What I enjoyed most of all however is the involved storyline that sweeps you along to a climax that delivers. While I dared to read this at night, I did not dare read this book while alone.With this book you'll laugh out loud, you may cry and you'll most definitely experience ye olde chills up and down the spine. Your scalp will prickle, your pulse quicken and I guarantee that for a while at least, you'll look suspiciously at anyone who farts, noisily and or noxiously. Three cheers for the human race and the Dream-Catcher that binds us all!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King's diabolically imaginative writing is in full swing as usual. A melange of ideas threaded into an up-all-night novel. The story includes U.F.O.s, aliens, telepathy, and a very unusual bond between four friends and a gifted &quot;boy.&quot; The way in which he weaves the plot together is 100% King.Unfortunately, this is not one of his best works. This is due to the shoddy way in which he portrays a military operation and the hardware involved. Technically speaking, the descriptions of the helicopters (inside and out) and the way in which the crews interract was far from the mark. Due to the fact that I am a military helicopter pilot, this aspect was downright frustrating and annoying in some cases! He would have done better to suspend reality rather than to tear it to shreads. Although he is in desperate need of a technical advisor on this one, highly recommended for fans or otherwise."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The good news is that Stephen King still can write, even after suffering from being hit by a van. The bad news is that this, his first novel after the accident is only a mild entertainment.The main problem with this story is that it revisits a lot of the ideas he has explored in other stories. The idea of alien visitation and people slowly falling apart (both physically and mentally) is reminiscent of The Tommyknockers. There are psychic powers that hearken back to The Shining. There is plague like The Stand. There is a back-and-forth storyline between adulthood and childhood as in It. And I could go on.I suppose when you've written as much as King has, you will revisit old ideas, but it is uncommon to revisit so many. Not that this story doesn't have a degree of originality or a lack of suspense, it's just at times, I felt been-there-done-that.There are other flaws in this story too, in particular one villain (Kurtz) who is more insane than evil and in some implausible fashion is in a position of leadership. It is a testament to King's abilities, however, that even in this essentially weak effort, he still puts forth a book that isn't really bad but is just so-so."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The master has done it again. I am really glad that Stephen King has found his roots again. He is always at his best when the setting is the wilderness of Maine and when he describes and follows characters with social, mental or physical defects. We find all of these in this novel. The alcoholic, the mentally retarded victim of stupid bullies, the suicidal intellectual, and the teacher who has had a close encounter with death and who is still suffering psychologically. They are accompanied by an inhuman sociopath who personifies the old American trauma of anonymous administrative powers gone wild, which seek to destroy the liberty and life of the individual. Together with aliens that want to conquer this world after several attempts this mixture of characters guarantees a plot of utmost suspense, unexpected turns and a constant compulsion to read on and on.King is also at his best when he writes about friends, about what ties them together and when they as ordinary and often weak people become heroes. This motif of his has fascinated us in \\"It\\" and \\"The Body\\" and others. Here we find a new variation of the theme.Although the novel is very long I read it in record time and was disappointed when I came to the end. Not that there would be need for a sequel, but my fascination was still switched on after the last lines.Who cares that there are some minor faults (fault is too strong a word, actually)? King is often a bit too talkative, which makes some passages just a wee lengthy. The solution of the alien plot is a bit too vague and even for the aficionado not exactly plausible. But as I said, who cares? The master has deserved his five stars. Absolutely!"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"King's not known for tight, disciplined writing, and this novel is an example of him at his most careless. I have to agree with the reader who said he could benefit from a merciless editor. The story is remarkably thin for an over 800 page novel. It's the length of a civil war epic, yet the tale is a simple one and involves a small cast of characters.It starts out strongly enough, with a series of vignettes introducing us to the main characters. We learn about their pasts, and there are ominous hints about what the future holds for them. This being a King novel, the reader can guess that it's not good. After that we travel to the Maine wilderness, where the friends gather for their annual hunting trip. Things take a bad turn when they run into two strangers who are not what they seem.King does a good job here with a convincing depiction of male comradery. He also manages to find some grissly new twists on some old science fiction themes. After a while he begins to repeat himself however, and the story really begins to bog down. There are some plot developements that are just ridiculous, like the killer shrubbery in The Shining. One is a looooooooong psychic battle that takes place in a wharehouse that is supposed to represent one characters mind. It's ridiculous, and undercuts whatever suspense King has going at that point.It's something of a shame since much of this book is effective. Somewhere in this bad 800 page novel is a fairly decent 400 page science fiction thriller, I bet. Perhaps King should spend a little more time editing and refining his work before he moves on to the next thing."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I love Stephen King. I have read most of his work and I was really looking forward to adding this one to the list. Sadly this book is probably one of the worst ones ive read. I have actually been a fan of King's newer novels, but this is the first one were I am able to see the deterioration of his work. There was not a single point in this novel that I cared about any character. The plot not only has huge wholes but delivers a surprise ending that not only makes no real sense, but is contradicted many times in the novel itself. Dont waste your money on this book in hardcover. If you must read it wait for it to come out in paper back."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I'm a big fan; I've read everything of his that has been published, including his essays. The only book he has ever written that I did not like was &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; I eagerly awaited &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; and grabbed it the moment I saw it. I was extra-excited becaise it is his first book since his terrible accident and I was happy for him that he was writing again.At first, I could not put this book down. Part One was fabulous, with disgusting aliens, fascinating character development, and creative, suspenseful scenarios. But as I began to read Part Two, annoying flaws in the text began to manifest and the narrative began to seem heavy-handed. I became confused by the many Jonesy's and mind-trips. I stopped caring about the characters and felt that each had been given a stock &quot;Oprah show&quot; flaw by King (alcoholism, suicidal ideation, etc.). The hit-by-a-car guy seemed like he was whining too much. The wacky military guy (Kurtz) seemed too much like the wacky military guy in &quot;The Long Walk&quot;. Characters started dying too quickly. There were no major female characters being given spots in the narrative yet (except for a previous chapter with Duddit's Mom)! And what was up with the aliens? Two kinds? I liked the snake-things but the grays were just not fully developed as unique to King's imagination. I know King has a much better imagination than that! Finally, I think the title of the book is cliche. It has the word &quot;dream&quot; in it, an overused word in book titles. Was the dreamcatcher supposed to represent the characters broken dreams? If so, please!!!I don't think I can finish this book. This will be the first King novel I have not finished. I feel bad because I really like Stephen King and I want to be a loyal fan, but this book is not to my liking. I am disappointed. He can do SO MUCH better! I have faith that his next book will be great."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This book is Excellent. My first thought: The Stand. Welcome back to Derry. You've been here before if you follow King. King is the greatest novelest of his time-nobody supplants you into a book as well. He is more than just a horror author and has proved that in novels such as The Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis, and I would argue, Wizard and Glass (a beautifully romantic piece.) However, he puts down horror in Dreamcatcher, his time-tested strut. Meet the SSDD guys, Henry, The Beav, Pete, and Jonesy (friends from grade school, now middle-age). They go to a cabin known as &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; once a year for hunting. This trip however holds some extra-err-terrestrial surprises. Once you meet McArthy you will understand. If you were of the many that damned King's last few publications (I am not among that number) then this novel will ressurect King in your mind as this flatlining, show-stopping, heart-palpitating novel scares you into wet pants. Dreamcatcher has the feel of old King (think suspense levels of Christine and The Shining) with the character situating of Desperation, with underpinnings of a cynic yet religious King who relies heavily on mysticism and human nature to win battles. You know it's King, you KNOW it's good, stop wasting time with reviews and get on it! Sweet Dreams."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Like many other people who have written their reviews, I too am a huge Stephen King fan. I have read 95% of his books (including the first 6 installments of the Plant - which is excellent) - and therefore I have a lot of experience to draw on to say that this book is truly a disappointment.The premise of this book was exciting...four childhood friends gathering together in a hunting lodge to bond and remember their childhood days and the mysterious connection that they had with &quot;Duddits&quot;- a child hood friend with down syndrome. However, when your started throwing in &quot;sh*t weasels&quot;, aliens, bacon, fungus, and a random car accident, and most random of all a Russian woman attempting to contaminate the water of an entire town...it becomes tiresome. Because I had just read &quot;It&quot; (again) right before this I was truly expecting something of that caliber, but I was disappointed.What has always made Stephen King an excellent novelist was not only his ability to tell a riveting, story...but was his ability to mix the horrors of fiction with the wit of everyday life. Moreover, the skill with which he develops charcters and makes them three dimentional has always been the hallmark of his writing...yet he fails miserably here. With the concentration on the action of the army, and the aliens, King neglects to develop his characters as he usually does. We receive such token character development of Jonesy and Henry that I am shocked and disappointed to realize that they are the main characters 200 pages into the book. They seem very empty and token.Moreover, with all the flashbacks, all the pieces do not fit together. Its as if he had many different ideas swirling around, but they didn't connect into one all emcompassing story. King was treading on the surface of several stories, but not delving into the depths to tie them all together. The best way to describe it, is that it is a superficial read.Finally, King's conclusion does not follow with his other works. Instead of ending that lays all the characters to rest, this story just kind of got tired, gave up, and died.I will end this review saying that I am still a huge Stephen King fan, and despite some of his more recent disappointments (Dreamcatcher, Bag of Bones, and Hearts of Atlantis)...I will continue to purchase the next book that comes out, with the hope that the well has not run dry...yet."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"My cat, buttercup is an orange tabby cat, and she's very cute. She's very cuddly, and she's very friendly. If you like cute, cuddly friendly things, then this is not a book or you. Stephen King returns full force in this, his first full length novel after Brian White nearly killed him in 1999. I thouht this was a very good book that kept me interested till the end, though , of course, to be fair, all Stephen King does that. This one though, especially did. In the beginning, he leaves you wondering, what IS SSDD? What hapened with Josie Rinkenhauser? What did they save Duddits from? Then, after those initial mysteries are resolved, new ones come up. Where is Mr Gray (unfortunately not Bob Gray AKA Pennywise the Dancing Clown (like I hoped he would be (Though if you liked IT, this is a book for you (There was a reference to Penywise that blew my mind)))) going after the Standpipe? What happened with the Russian Lady? Who did the boys kill? All these mysteries are woven throughout this book in true Stephen King style, and they are all relevant to the tale. The ending was great, without a hint of Deus Ex Machina (in true SK style) and all of his trademark humor is there. To sum up the story, Four guys go hunting, and get attacked by aliens from outer space; but that's like saying IT is about a killer clown. There's so much more there, that you can look past the absurdly simple premise. This is a great book that I recommend to everyone."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Stephen King's, Dreamcatcher, is one of the most horrifying books I have read. The unending sense of fear kept the book open. The state of which King wrote this hellish tale kept a constant \\"escape\\" from all reality. Never really knowing what could happen next, displayed a non-stop agony in which the the story took place. Though the \\"clarity\\" was not near it best, the \\"details\\" used to describe each event very \\"artistic.\\" Never before have I read a novel so horrifying. Dreamcatcher, is a book that you want to put down, but never can. The rate at which each and every event takes place, leaves the reader wanting more. At the rate the gang faces each challenge is unbelievable. And the fact in the end it all points to where their stories all start is a genius piece of work. King's brilliance in which he wrote this novel, can, and does show the agonizing pain that he was going through in his life at the time. A novel in which the reader can sense the pain of the author truly shows that this book is one of a kind. This is a MUST READ TO BELIEVE novel."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I listened to the audio form of this book. On that note, the reader did a great job. His voices weren't nasal as so many other readers seem to read them. The reading wasn't overly dramatic or theatrical, but still a sense of urgency was conveyed when necessary.I have read many of King's books, but not all. A few of them are among my favorite stories (like The Shining, the Langoliers and The Stand as well as the Tower series), and I absolutely love them, reading them over and over. I have not liked all of them, but not disliked any of them. This one was in the \\"like\\" collumn.I have read some of the other reviews posted here, and both agree and disagree with many of them.This is a horror novel. It is meant to both terrify and horrify. It is gorey in places. The language is crude, but not always crude. The profanity is not indiscriminate. It is character and situation specific. Also, not all the characters are proper, well mannered, upstanding citizens. Not everyone goes in angelic and not everyone comes out okay and unharmed. These are all things I found to contribute to the story in its intended horror genre, and found to be realistic within the unreality. The characters, with their language and their flaws, were believable. They behaved just as a group of old, male friends would in the woods on vacation doing some hunting. I know men who behave just like this. And the bad guy, was unique and as scary as Annie in Misery, because I also found they bore chracteristics I see in people I know. Its makes the bad guys very human in their monstrocities, instead of stereotype demons. It painted a picture of everyday people in a common place doing a common activity, so when the aliens come and everything goes to hell, as a reader it was so read and vivid for me. I love King's writing ability, that he can create an environment and characters that are so real, and then plunge them into such fantastic happenings.Now, this story did seem to have commonalities with some of his previous books. I thought there were simularities with Tommyknockers and It and even the Shining. However, where some readers seem to think this is a disappointing let down, I found it familiar like an extended journey into those aspects. Also, while there are some simulatiries, such as aliens and mind control and teeth falling out, I at no point felt it was the same story. Not at all. In fact, I disliked Tommyknockers. I thought the characters were unrealistic, the plot predictable and the story boring in Tommyknockers. In DreamCatcher, I thought the opposite, the characters were vivid and real, and I sympathized with each of them, the plot face paced and the story interesting.But, I did take one star off for the menadering length. It could have been shorter, and I did start to loose patience. I really like long, meandering stories. Tad Williams and George R.R. Martin are some of my favorite authors, and if you've read any of their books, you know they are every long and wordy. So, when I started to loose patience with the length of this book, that went on and on, with long, slogging delves into memory, I knew other readers would be dismayed. I only found it midly irritating towards the end. I started to fast forward through the flashbacks and the memories of Duddits. I figured out what the connection and importance of Duddits was, I figured it out quickly in the begining, so honsetly, I found the subsequent memory dumps distracting, unnecessary and annoying. They were easy to fast forward though.One of the things I like most about King is some of the simple descriptions he gives that just encapsulate everything so neatly. There were some that stuck in my mind. I am paraphrasing here from memory, but, for example:\\"When someone is crazy, one might say he was not playing with a full deck. Well, he was playing with more than a full deck. He had a few extra aces and a few extra duces, and every knew that duces were wild.\\"\\"It was amazing that women could love the best of us, let alone the rest of us.\\"Great characters, good writing, good story."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is the first and probably last Stephen King book I'm aware of having read. I could not put it down and now I understand why he's so successful. The guy just knows how to tell a good story. I read his book in one night and I do not like horror. I don't watch horror movies, I get freaked out really easily by monsters, especially the looming kind- I sometimes susepct they're standing behind me when I'm in the shower and scream for my boyfriend to come in, and my boyfriend laughs at me because he can tell by how quavery my voice is when I say his name how sure I am he's not been body-snatched. After I read this book I wikipedia-ed the plots of all his other books because I didn't think I could withstand the emotional strain of actually reading his stuff but I was still seized with curiosity to see what he wrote. Cheating, I know.King is a master because he introduces all these characters right off the bat, gets us to like them, built up this kind of ominous but super interesting mystery of what had happened in their pasts, and then mercilessly kills off a bunch of your favorite characters and blankets the others in a pervading sense of doom. But the others are still alive so you keep reading with the fearful hope that they, along with the rest of the human race, are spared. I suspect this book is not King's best work because he does do some other shenanigans that I'm amazed he's ballsy enough to try to pull over us. For example he brings in the military halfway through the book and a slew of new characters for us to learn about who for whatever reason are never as endearing as the first ones he killed off. Then he mixes together not only supernatural psychic powers but also aliens. You have to admire his boldness- he introduces not 1 but 2 suspension-of-disbelief things, makes them both central to the story, and then throws in a bunch of violence with guns and stuff, and expects us to buy it. And we do. All hail the King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Not super original - aliens taking over the planet, blah, blah. But add a group of great characters and it becomes a worthy piece of fiction. Good job, Mr. King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I keep thinking I should dislike this novel, but the problem is that I like it. There are parts of the novel that I find annoying, but King writes so well that I found myself pulled along the dreamcatcher until I reached the end of the path.Four guys are out hunting in the wilderness of Maine. One of the guys, Gary Jones, \\"Jonesy,\\" is up in a tree stand when a lost-looking guy appears out of nowhere. Other than a propensity for extended flatulence, a strange-looking patch on his cheek, and a memory that seems vastly defective, the guy appears normal. Being a nice guy, and given that Jonesy nearly shot the man, thinking he was a deer, Jonesy takes the man, Richard McCarthy, back to their cabin, which they call Hole in the Wall. Unfortunately for Jonesy, Pete Moore, Henry Devlin, and Joe \\"Beaver\\" Clarendon, the man is sick in ways that no one could have guessed.We soon learn that an alien spaceship has crash landed, and the results are bizarre, sometimes nearly funny. However, funny only goes so far, and it turns out that encounters with the aliens can have some seriously nasty side effects.Our story focuses on the four friends as they encounter animals quietly running away from something as well as people running to something, and the military men trying unsuccessfully in one place. As often happens in Stephen King stories, not everyone survives to reach the end of the story, but whatever happens makes you want those friends remaining to triumph over that which has caused them pain and suffering.We also meet a military man, Kurtz, who is the stereotype of every sadistic, cunning and utterly ruthless military man ever depicted in a book or the movies. While Kurtz was sent to decisively take care of the problem in Maine, Kurtz also appears to take some measure of enjoyment in what he does. It also appears that Kurtz sometimes may deliberately place people in harm's way for purposes all his own.My biggest problem with this book was the depiction of the military. Apparently Stephen King has taken a few things he has read about the military and expanded them into something unrealistic. People like Kurtz would not be in the Army (which the book seems to imply he is, by equipment if not by style). Kurtz would not be receiving orders from Cheyenne Mountain, which is an Air Force facility. He most likely would be receiving orders from either the Pentagon (most likely), or Langley (less likely, but still plausible).The other, smaller problem with this book is that there is a lot of carry over from previous King books. I kept wondering whether King was going to tie in \\"It\\" somehow because so many of the references in this book seemed similar to \\"It.\\" King even mentions Pennywise the Clown. However, other than a few references (like to Jerusalem's Lot), and some vague similarity in characters, this book is mostly unrelated to other King books.As long as you can get past King's portrayal of the military, if you are familiar with the military and the nearly familiar but not storylines from his previous books, you are left with a darn good story. I was enthralled for the last couple of hundred pages and could barely wait to finish the book. Though I was sad at the end, I have to say that this book has a good ending.King's quality has been bumpy, in my mind, in recent years. However, this book is a good read. This book makes effective use of things that go bump in the night. I was also pleased that King did a coherent job of plotting his aliens' biology. I think that King fans will find this book a good one, and even most casual fans of horror and aliens will find this book interesting.If you are wondering about the dreamcatcher, I must to tell you that you will have to read the book to learn about that. It would take too long to explain the relevance of the dreamcatcher, which you will find out in the end when you read the book. See the line, and enter the dreamcatcher."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I thought the book DreamCatcher by Stephen King was an extremely interesting and well written novel. Despite the length it is certainly a book that many people should consider reading. The details and descriptions are awesome. It is certainly worth the time and once again it proves what a great writer Stephen King is."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is a story of five men who have grown up together, pete, henrey, beav, jonsey and duddits.

Along with him comes military quarrantine, ANG, and undescribable forces inside their heads. These forces allow telepathy and other powers. Will the three remining men be able to stop the infection of the northeasts main water source? Read this book and find out for yourself and then tell your friends."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is defintely a book that is worth reading rather than watching the movie. Stephen King as always weaves his words so well that the images your imagination conjures up will far exceed anything that can be done on-screen. Another page turner by Stephen King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Although this may not be Stephen King's best work to date the Dreamcatcher is certainly an embodiment of fine storytelling from a master storyteller.It is a riviting and at times fast paced story of four childhood friends; Jonsey, Henry, Beave and Pete who re-unite for their traditional hunting trip in the woods of Northern Maine.King uses flashbacks into the past to introduced Dudits, a forever man-child with extraordinary powers of the psyche to see \\"Beyond the Line\\". He is the victim of childhood bullies when the four first meet him as children. They become his heros and conversly, he becomes theirs.While at the hunting lodge they come face to face with men and women who are not at all what they appear to be.They encounter bowel born, blood thirsty creatures and experience extremly high tuned paranormal events which ultimatly determines their individual destinies.A master of complex and convoluted story telling, King doesn't fail us here. Each of the four has to find a way to survive this very surreal situation.In the mean time aliens are landing throughout the snowpacked woods. The military has been ordered to go in and take care of \\"the problem\\" while one of the worst snow storms to hit the North East is falling from the sky like machine gun pellets. Much like the ones in the hands of the wrong solders.The forces being brought into handle \\"the problem\\" are darker and more devious then what they have encountered so far. We are given a wide angle view of the darkness and evil that can lurk within the human soul.King weaves the story like a complicated braid from past to present and back again as he takes the reader on this very convoluted and, throughout most of the book, exciting, horrifying and heartrendering journey.It's an enveloping and endearing story with an even tempo. There are times when a good editor would have taken control and cast out some of the long and confusing dialogue throughout the book. It can be a page turner yet there are places where skipping pages is a real temptation just to get to a place where it doesn't take your head and squeeze it so hard. That should be reserved for text books. Not for readers of fiction.Yet how much of this is truly fiction?The ability to \\"see beyond the line\\", to be able to see and hear anothers' thoughts is what ultimatly brings everyone closer to what they may perceive as a \\"Creator\\" or Universal Mind with the ensuing forces of good and evil.King has again brought into play his recurring theme of good and evil in the Dreamcatcher.The four's love of Dudits and ultimate dedication along with the need of his guidaence and help, is clear and a very compelling part of the story. Dudits is a truly loveable character and touches the hearts of the readers. At least this reader!It is only through Dudits ability to see \\"beyond\\", to see inside the minds and hearts of others is there any hope for survival and hence healing.I highly recommend this book for dedicated and \\"Constant\\" readers. For newbee's it's a great book and an engulfing story but another book, like the Stand might be a better introduction into the mind and possible motives of Stephen King."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher was a good book but there were a few things i didnt like aboutit.I didnt like how Stephen King sometimes wrote like he was talking to himself.Sometimes i got so mixed up with it especially when he kept switching between past and present and what was happening at the Hole in the Wall and Duddits....Onthe upside it was a good book with lifelike characters and a really scary plot. It was one of Stephen Kings better books."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"DREAMCATCHER was my first Stephen King novel. Probably not a good choice for an introduction to this immensely prolific and gifted novelist. I loved and hated this book. I loved that I was compelled by the creative story line to race to the end of 800+ pages to find out what happens. However, I hated that I found the story difficult to follow at times because of the Jonesy/Mr. Gray combined entity. I loved the fact that the plot was a tale of the relationship between five very close friends. However, I hated that these relationships weren't more deeply developed and shared. I loved that this book actually evoked very real visceral reactions in me. However, I hated feeling nauseous during some of the descriptions of the byrum and the human response to the alien mind control. I would dread that I was going to feel nauseous, but I had to pick up the book again. Talk about mind control. This is a book that you hate to love and love to hate. Mr. King is every bit the powerful writer that he is noted to be. Read it, but beware! - Robert John Estko, the author of EVIL, BE GONE."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This novel starts out slow, and at first is written in present tense making it difficult to read and follow. However, after the first chapter it really picks up and becomes an entaining story that kept me reading to the very end.I have never read much Stephen King because I really don't care for his writing style, so I can only compare this with the few other novels of his that I've read. To me this one is up there with &quot;The Stand&quot;. Not as all encompassing, this is a tighter story centering on five friends and how they become intertwined with each other and an alien encounter.The only dissapointment was the ending. Its not a bad ending, but as I approached it I was hoping for something a bit more grand. Minor quibble, and doesn't distract from a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"As usual, King creates suspension, invokes a believable dark world, and populates it with characters that seem very much alive. The dialogue and humour in this book is typically Kingish, and two of the characters are so well done that half a year after finishing this book they are still in my memory in great detail - like I met them yesterday.The plot, though, isn't his best. It's rather original but that doesn't necessarily mean good. If you're into psychology, it will be easy for you to read this book and study King's inner conflicts - because clearly, that's what he's really writing about. Earlier, that has led to such enormous books as &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; and &quot;It&quot;. Although &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is a good book compared to other horror stories, I must say that if you haven't read King's books this should not be your first choice. Because the conflicts here are more mature, more complicated, and thus it's harder for the reader to really get hooked into the story. I ended up thinking &quot;I wonder what King was feeling when he wrote this?&quot; a number of times, and that was in spite of the fast pace and the catching characters.Why anyone would try to make a movie out of this book is beyond me. The book relies very heavily on flashbacks, a technique that King manages to use nicely but that it's really hard to use in a movie.There are some really good moments in this book, it is scary, cruel, and often gory, but it's still not one of King's best. Not at all."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Dreamcatcher is a very interesting and horrifying book. This is another story by Stephen King where he takes an ordinary event and makes it into a horror story. It is about four friends who are in Maine for their annual hunting trip. Suddenly, a stranger comes into their camp, lost and delirious. Then, the four friends are trapped with a creature from another world, and the only thing that can save them is their friendship. My favorite part was when the four boys save Duddits (a retarded kid) from bullies."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"The truth about this book is that it's among Stephen King's most formulaic. The mind-controlling, body-destroying aliens are reminiscent of the Tommyknockers (and contain elements of the children of Village of the Damned and the aliens of the Alien series), the childhood bond theme (complete with juvenile delinquent bully) was done in the magnum opus It. And speaking of bullies, insane military man Kurtz's pursuit of the heroes is just a bit too reminiscent of the aforementioned It-delinquent.But formulaic for King isn't that terrible a thing, if you're an addict like me. It's like slipping into a pair of well-worn jeans. There's comfort in revisiting familiar places (Derry, Maine) and familiar names (the Losers club makes an indirect appearance), even familiar plots.If you've never read Stephen King, you can give this one a shot. It's a good starting place to build up to It or The Tommyknockers. If you're a die-hard fan, this'll be a nice retreat, after less horror-infused novels like Tom Gordon.On the other hand, if you're a casual reader, this book might leave you cold, feeling like King's not up to his innovative best.But to us, the Constant Readers, we know better..."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've read nearly every King book written, and when I read this one, it was as if he cut and pasted old books together to build this story. There's aliens, like Tommyknockers; there's childhood friends who reunite as adults, like IT, et al; there's a child with disabilities who has an extraordinary mind, like Desperation; even the ending is eerily reminiscent of the ending to Needful Things. The list just goes on and on. If you like Stephen King and you don't mind that the utter lack of originality, go for it. But be warned: I bought it in hardcover and was left unsatisfied. If you need a King &quot;fix,&quot; I recommend one of his books from the 1970s - Firestarter, The Shining, Christine... they were original, interesting and eerie stories."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I've been reading S.K. since 1980: I'm pretty well acquainted with his writing. Sooo. . .This book is really, really bad. The story is SO absurd (WHERE the creatures came from had to be the lowest and most perverse idea S.K. had ever had); I hated every character (wanted them ALL to die after the first few chapters)and the story itself was plodding (it took the characters about a thousand pages to travel from Point A to Point B).This was a book written just to get something new on the shelves.I was very disappointed. I can see the book on my shelf with the bookmark about fifty pages from the end; can't bring myself to finish it.I'm warning everyone away from this one."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I never thought I would say this, but this makes 'The Tommyknockers' look like a really excellent book... this is not up to par with King's recent offerings such as 'Bag of Bones' and 'Hearts in Atlantis.' King goes for the the gross-out in this book, and leaves the reader cringing with graphic images of various bodily functions. I am a big King fan, but I cannot in good conscience reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I love King books. I do. I was even given the complete uncut version of The Stand as a Valentines Day gift. But this book was (and there's no nice way to say this) utter crap. It didn't even seem like a King book. Maybe some parts did but the writing style was very odd. I do NOT recommend it, not even for die-hard King fans like myself."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Like so many others who reviewed this book, I have read almost everything that Stephen King has written. Lately,however, I find his books hard to finish. Yet, I stay with them and ususally find that it was worth hanging in there. Most recently, I expereinced this with &quot;Bag of Bones.&quot; So, I ran out to get this book the day of release...which was March 20, and I just finished it last night...August 29. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is boring, plodding and just plain ridiculous. It is even difficult to feel anything for the characters because so many details get in the way. From a psychological point of view, the connection of the five main characters comes through, but it does not come easy to the reader...you have to plow through too much to get to the connection...almost like everything in this book is covered with the &quot;byrus&quot; that takes up so much space here. Personally, I think books like, &quot;Misery,&quot; &quot;Gerald's Game&quot; and &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; and even &quot;Dolores Claiborn&quot; have so much more focus and depth psychologically. From this reader's perspective, this was the least appealing Stephen King book to date."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Let me begin by saying this book is scary. King is obviously exorcising a lot of demons here, not he least of which is the way he has struggled through rehab following his accident. Characters in the book have their bodies rebel against them in a dozen horrible ways. If you've read enough of King's work, you know what a complex, wierd, and wonderful relationship exists between a writer's life and his work. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; could be fodder for a million term papers if one were to analyze it in this way. You, however, may prefer not to.Once you get passed all that, what remains is great, strange, scary and heartbreaking story. I have to say the first quarter is extremely powerful, scary stuff. Not that the rest isn't good (there is a chapter about a certain character becoming a &quot;movie star&quot; that may be one of the best things King's ever written) but once the many mysteries are revealed, they just can't live up to our huge expectations.It's nice to see him return to the theme of friendship again and for once I feel like a Stephen King book could be longer(!). The ending felt abrupt and cut off. I feel like we could have spent more time with these characters...perhaps we will."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"This is the first Stephen King title I've read in a few years. While I've always enjoyed his writing, I think I became &quot;stuffed.&quot; It was like eating &quot;grandma's&quot; cooking...it's really quite good, but when she insists you take a third helping, you just don't have an appetite left!That being said, enough time had passed that I was hungry for King again, and was looking forward to a dish of the master's work. My food analogy is important; as a word of warning: DO NOT EAT while reading this book!It takes an awful lot to gross me out. Typically, I find myself amused when writers provide detailed descriptions of someone's intestinal distress. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; just about crossed that line. (And for many others, I'm sure it's WAY over!) I won't admit to screaming &quot;GROSS!!! GROSS!!!! GROSS!!!!!&quot; out loud, but I sure wondered how this was going to be received at the MegaPlex when it is (certainly and eventually) adapted to the silver screen.The gross-factor does tone down a bit before the novel is half over, and I did enjoy it overall. I just didn't enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed some of his previous work."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"Shades of the Tommyknockers, vampires, the incubus/succubus approach. His reference to &quot;The Horror!&quot; is well taken. References to his other works, tastefully given as in a private joke add to the richness. Well written. Seems to be about madmen dealing with alternative madness. Not as good as most of King's work, but pretty good. King's treatment of children is as good as ever (outstanding, hardly anyone better!). However, the military people (National Guard/Reserve, central to the plot) evidently assigned to run the show (Where are the Active Duty folks?) seem to be mostly portrayed as goons and madmen, which does little to aid the plot. Tom Clancy, he ain't."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"It took me a long time to finish this book...not just because of its paperweight size either. But because it was simply hard to get through. It was such a poorly characterized novel that I had to put the book down many times and just sigh at the amateurishness of it. This surprised me greatly since many of Mr. King's previous works were excellently done (It for example). But Dreamcatcher was poorly developed and insulting in many ways.Most notably we never really get inside the characters heads (except for Jonesy and Mr. Gray). But we never understand motivation or come to care about any of these people. When they die (which many do), I just had to say, &quot;yeah, he died. So what?&quot;I also think that Mr. King is running out of original ideas. He seems to be stealing his own works from the past and trying (in vain) to reinvent them. I saw a Twilight Zone mini-movie years ago in which Mr. King himself starred. He played a back-country hick who had a large meteor land in his backyard. When he touched it, he got this red-orange fungus on him that grew and grew and eventually took over his entire body before he killed himself. Sounds way too familiar to be mere coincidence. Also, if you've ever read or watched 'The Stand' you'll remember the lovable but retarded man that everyone likes (&quot;M-O-O-N that spells moon.&quot;) and Mr. King seems to have tried to reinvent that character in Dreamcatcher as well in the form of another retarded but gifted man/boy named Duddits.But of all the problems that I had with this book, my largest concern was the use of insulting biogtry. Although the comments that Mr. King used came from the mouths of characters, since these characters were so poorly developed it didn't seem natural and only sounded prejudicial. Although I must admit that he left no culuture, ethnic group, or religion out in the telling. He equally insults the Irish along with the African Americans and all the way up and down the social ladder. Disconcerting.The story: Surrounds the lives of four friends who develop psychic abilities of varying degrees once they come into contact with Duddits, a mentally retarded boy whom they save from some bullies during their high-school years. Jump to the future and aliens have sent a blight to earth to take over and wipe out humanity. Jonesy, one of the four boys now grown into a man, is their Typhoid Mary, but he is also able to fight against the encroaching mind of Mr. Gray, a being who has taken over his body. This irks Mr. Gray but he continues on his task to try and infect as many humans as he can. The scenes jump back and forth between the Jonesy/Mr. Gray character, to the Military trying to cover up the exposure, to Duddits and the rest of Jonesy's friends (who mostly die in unattractive yet boring ways). Thanks to Duddit's powers, Jonesy is able to drive Mr. Gray from his body and help stop the infectious route toward humanity.So why two stars? Easy. The book is plotted well, almost too well, and there are some interesting sections with comical quotes. But mostly this book is simply insulting and completely unappealing. Boring. That's my take."},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","review":"I just couldn't wait to get my hands on this novel. I bought it on its release date and started in on it immediately, and I thought it did begin with a lot of promise. But, within 200 pages, I could really tell that King wasn't up to his usual self, especially compared to his last full-length effort, Bag of Bones. In comparison, BoB was an absolute masterpiece. This is the first time I've read a King novel where the main characters came across as flat and lifeless--usually, if anything, he spends too much time developing them with back story, but that was definitely not the case in Dreamcatcher.The story moved along fairly well, I guess, but the final couple hundred pages were nothing but a long drawn-out chase scene. Heck, even compared to his early novel The Running Man, this one falls flat on its face. I honestly can't think of a novel of his that I've enjoyed any less; even The Regulators, which was developed from a screenplay, put Dreamcatcher to shame. That's not to say that Dreamcatcher is all bad--at his very worst, King towers over the pretentious drool spewed forth by the likes of Poppy Brite and John Shirley, but still, I feel let down.I can't remember the last time I read a King novel and wanted to get the darn thing over with, but this time I found myself trudging through the last hundred or so pages just looking forward to putting the book aside so I could read something I actually enjoyed."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],P={key:0},C={key:1};function q(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",D,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",C,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",P,"See more"))],8,E)):p("",!0)])}const x=d(M,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-ff42a1d6"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/2.md","filePath":"library/2.md"}'),H={name:"library/2.md"},j=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{B as __pageData,j as default};
