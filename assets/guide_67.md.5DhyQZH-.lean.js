This book has a variety of stories, so you won't get bored reading one whole book. Some of my favorite stories in the book are &quot;The Gift of the Peace Pipe&quot;, and &quot;Maiden's Isle&quot;. My very favorite is &quot;Punished Woman's Lake&quot;. It's my favorite story because the legend is about a married couple who is broken apart by the chief who wants to take a wife. So to protect her, at night, the real husband took her on his horse and they ran away together. But the chief realized that the wife was missing and sent out warriors to find her. When they found her, the chief killed the real husband and tied the wife to a tree until she said she said she would live with him. The chief had a bad heart and didn't wait for her answer and killed her. Because he murdered two innocent people, a lightning bolt hit him and he was also killed. No one knew where it came from. But from that day forever the Indians had a good heart learning that being bad never pays. I would change three things in this book: longer stories so people will be entertained longer, more scary stories so you could have more excitement, and more books written by this tribe.

Although one feels that he is never more than a heartbeat away from the action, he does not intrude upon it. It is the People's story; he is just the teller. As for the story he tells, it is not a pretty one.In the book, he evokes a scene in a coastal town of the Arctic, in which a supply ship is making a stopover. Excitement runs through the townspeople as the ship's crew and passengers are brought to shore. It is a very bright moment in an otherwise dull, monotonous routine. One of the passengers detaches himself from the crowds leaving the vessel and makes his way through the town to an encampment on its edge. Tents are struck there and as he approaches, it happens that one of the occupants is outside and sees him approaching. It is an Eskimo dressed in rags and wearing an unmistakable air of dejection. Suddenly the visitor recognizes the man and hails him, but is not answered.The visitor is Mowat and the Eskimo is Ohoto, a member of the Ihalmiut, one of the People. The two have not set eyes on each other for more than ten years. From that last meeting, looking backwards, Farley Mowat reconstructs the life of this little-known inland tribe as they prepare, unknowingly, to meet their doom. The story has grandeur as well as the appalling odour of decay. It has the sensitivity to show us that the fragility of the Ihalmiut may well turn out to be our own. It is also a finely written work, which had me yearning for some of the places described within and it may affect you that way too. At any rate, this second and perhaps final book about the People is so plainly filled with human understanding that one has to be very indifferent indeed, to take nothing from it."},{"Title":"Desperate People","review":"This book is the continuation of the story of the Caribou-Eskimo (Ihalmiut), of whom Mowat first wrote about in his first book, People of the Dear. The latter was an account of his experiences among these people while doing research for the government in 1947 and 1948. The Desperate People relates the plight of the Ihalmiut over the course of the next ten years. During this time, the Ihalmiut suffer considerably, the victims of exploitation, prejudice, governmental bungling, ignorance, and willful mistreatment. It is a chronicle of the decline of a once independent, self-sufficient people into a wretched, servile and dependent lot. The book left me feeling angered and ashamed. It is a book that should be read by all Canadians."},{"Title":"Desperate People","review":"About: They were rich, the caribou were abundant. Their dogs were many and strong.

Worth the price of the book is Feder's speech &quot;Does Judaism Have a Mission to Humanity?&quot; It most certainly does, he argues, and it isn't to bring the message of messianic secularism. The Jews are supposed to serve as a moral example to the rest of the world by observing the specifically Jewish mitzvot and by teaching the laws of the Noahide Covenant to non-Jews.&quot;This, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; he concludes, &quot;is the essence of the Jewish mission: to persuade humanity that someone indeed is watching us, one to whom we all are ultimately accountable. On the success or failure of this mission the fate of the world hinges.&quot;Amen. And all of Feder's writings turn on this mission in one way or another, both in this volume and in his later _Who's Afraid of the Religious Right?_ (and in his regular column, which interested readers will find on the website of the Jewish World Review). Handily smashing the idols of the modern, secularist left, Feder takes no prisoners in his reclamation of the moral high ground for the Judeo-Christian tradition which provides the foundation of United States society and culture -- or did, before that culture was debased and it became necessary to speak, as Feder's title does, of &quot;pagan America.&quot;There is a lot at stake here, and Feder knows it. He writes with both passion and wit in expounding a wide range of conservative positions, but at the center is his view of the Jewish mission as outlined above -- a mission he is undoubtedly doing his bit to fulfill. A strong voice in the &quot;culture war,&quot; he ranks with Rabbi Daniel Lapin and Dennis Prager in clarity, moral vision, and plain good sense.I don't always agree with him on every single point, but I can't recommend him more highly -- especially to those who have been duped into believing that Judaism is somehow synonymous with left-liberalism. It isn't."},{"Title":"A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America","review":"It is nothing short of amazing that Don Feder's brain can fit inside his head. His intelligence seems to be comparable to the average think tank. What's more impressive is his ability to employ apropos sarcasm to accentuate his position. And he does it all in a way that makes his column a consistently enjoyable read.This work constitutes a hodgepodge of his efforts with a few speeches thrown in for good measure. As usual, he does not eschew taboo topics. There is a certain irony to his persuasive essay \\"Returning Christ to Christmas;\\" in which an orthodox Jew articulates the authentic argument that most Christians are sadly now reluctant to make.Page after page demonstrates Mr. Feder's ability to be sublimely succinct. While nearly any passage could be sited as an inducement to purchase this compilation, a few random examples will suffice. Discussing humanism, he postulates the controversial truth, \\"without God, morality is impossible; right and wrong become matters of personal preferences.&quot; Similarly, on relativism and the widely spoken falsehood that one person's values are as valid as another's, Feder asks, \\"what makes the Judeo-Christian ethic superior to modern paganism? What makes the volunteer at a drug rehab center better than a schoolyard pusher?...What makes the morality of those who hid Jews during the Holocaust superior to those who killed them?\\" And to show his astute use of sarcasm regarding obscene rap performers 2 Live Crew, he puts forth \\"the rap group is to music what toilet-stall graffiti is to literature.\\" These selections are indicative of the wit and wisdom that permeates Don Feder's oeuvre, and this work is typical of his canny reasoning and literary prowess.Although it was initially published in 1993, the anthology has not become dated. Most of the topics he discusses are timeless; the articles' urgency is as relevant today or in certain cases far more so."},{"Title":"A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America","review":"You can't help but love the guy. Witty, to the point, and on target, 99% - you can't ask for more than that. In my opinion, he sometimes makes things more complicated than what they are by adding lots of extraneous facts and figures, but then again, others may appreciate it, and find that interesting. At any rate, round off the the total score and you get 4 stars.SO WHAT about his kid's problems? (with reference to another reviewer). Even the best teachers and philosophers and great thinkers have had occasional family problems. Take Einstein, for instance. He disrespected his wife terribly, and didn't know how to maintain a positive relationship with her. But if he were to write a book today, I would not criticize his book by pointing to his private life. That would be wrong. Also, if people really knew Einstein's politics, many would not consider him so smart. However, there's a difference between being \\"smart\\" and being \\"intelligent\\". The man was intelligent, no question about it.As another example, if it were a requirement that religious preachers be perfect, then none could teach. Even the most hypocritical preacher in the business, can still preach the truth, and benefit those who take that truth seriously. IT MATTERS LESS IF HE IS \\"HYPOCRITICAL\\" IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE, BUT MORE THAT HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH.Hypocrisy matters mainly when a person is running for office, or holds a judicial seat, and they try to impose laws than would likely not affect themselves or their loved ones. It also matters when you investigate their voting record, and you find that it doesn't match the so-called position that they claim to have.All in all, I highly recommend this author's book, and his others, as well. Not only is his perspective unique and interesting, the information he imparts is vital knowledge that needs and deserves to be heard across the board. I like reading his writings so much that I've signed up for his newsletter, and I occasionally go to his website for addition news and comments. It is well worth the read."},{"Title":"A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America","review":"Don Feder, a syndicated columnist and editorial writer for the Boston Herald published a collection of his columns, all published during the past decade, entitled A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America (Layfayette, LA: Huntington House Publishers, c. 1993), which reveals some of the ethical values treasured in traditional Judaism.Unlike those \\"liberal\\" Jews who often push high the barrier between church and state, he declares he could comfortably live in a \\"Christian America\\"--if only \\"Christian\\" rather than pagan morality prevailed! To explain the book's title, Feder says: \\"By Pagan America I mean that this is no longer a Judeo-Christian nation, animated by the ethical vision of the Bible, with its special emphasis on honesty, hard work, caring, and self-discipline. Instead we are evolving into the type of Canaanite culture (unrestrained hedonism, ritual prostitution, child sacrifice and the civic virtue of Sodom), which my ancestors encountered at the dawn of moral history\\" (p. 10).He writes with the deeply held conviction that \\"Ideas have consequences.\\" When the cultural \\"elite\\" espouses \\"toxic notions\\" the masses soon follow (p. 12). Then the nation decays. Most of the \\"toxins,\\" like the first snort of cocaine, appear attractive at first glance. Thus \\"Churches, schools, government, and media all have done a fine job of cultivating immorality in the name of compassion\\" (p. 101). What's really needed is some tough Old Testament Law! To those who insist we must ride with the tides of the times and be tolerant of fashionable trends, that we be sensitive and tolerant lest we be labeled old-fashioned, Feder replies, reviewing a Steven Spielberg film which was packed with profanity: \\"Be a fogy; this is something you should care deeply about. Corruption begins with ideas, conveyed by words\\" (p. 172). Wise up! It's wrong to debase language with profanity! If it's old-fashioned to call filth \\"filth,\\" then be old-fashioned!That ancient Jewish moral code, for all its stringency and self-discipline, holds the key to the good life. Indeed, it contains \\"a life-transforming doctrine: that there is but one God--the Eternal, the Creator of life, ruler of the universe, and author of human destiny--and that our Maker and Master has two basic demands of us: righteousness and holiness\\" (p. 191). In defense of that displaced Judeo-Christian ethic, Feder hammers away in his columns, defending the traditional family, religion, chastity, public decency, attacking pornography, Planned Parenthood, radical feminism, homosexuality, abortion, euthanasia. When dealing with right-to-life issues, especially abortion, he joins conservative Roman Catholics and Evangelicals.Indeed, he writes, \\"Feticide--the wanton destruction of 1.5 million unborn children a year in this country--could well be considered the modern equivalent of pagan sacrifice, a burnt offering to the voracious gods of modernity: rational autonomy, gender sameness, sexual liberation. Overturning these idols is a task worthy of a modern Elijah\\" (p. 201).To deal with all the moral chaos we face, Feder urges us to get back to the Bible! \\"The roots of our drug problem, teen alcoholism, the crisis of illegitimacy, of a million abortions annually, criminality in our inner cities, and family dissolution lie in our abandonment of the doctrines decreed at Sinai\\" (p. 107). So, it follows: \\"Our society can yet be saved, if we but have the wisdom and courage to accept these sacred truths\\" (p. 107).Writers of Feder's resolve rarely, it seems, gain a hearing in mainstream media. So this book helps him reach a broader public. He writes well, cites valuable data, and lets us know religious \\"conservatives\\" inhabit all religious communities in this land."},{"Title":"A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America","review":"\\"Can an eleven-year old tell the difference?\\" To quote Feder himself there. Oh, think of the children.First thing I did when I received the book was read the back. Includes endorsements from Pat Robertson and Oliver L. North. The guy who recently got in some trouble for calling for the assassination of Hugo Chavez, a democratically elected president of a sovereign nation endorses this book. And Oliver North, that other guy who secretly and illegally sold arms to Iran in order to make money to overthrow Daniel Ortega's democratically elected government in Nicaragua.So, this book is endorsed by high-level criminal masterminds and wannabes. But, those are just endorsements the publisher added, not the actual book. I'll still give it a chance.Don Feder opposes the pagans of America. Pagans are essentially defined here to mean all those who aren't Judeo-Christian. Particularly those who are moral-relativists and those with poor work-ethic. These two traits go hand in hand for the pagans apparently.One of Feder's most interesting examples of a pagan is Frank Zappa. Zappa has actually talked about striving to act like a true pagan, so Feder seems to be onto something. Just, apparently, the wrong thing. Zappa was that guy who wrote a lot of really complex and interesting music. Well he didn't just write a lot, he wrote a tremendous amount. Being an employee for Zappa was compared to being in basic training for the Marines. And Zappa was most demanding to himself. So work ethic's apparently not missing in this pagan. And then also every step of the way in Zappa's highly prolific life his resolute ethics was left in his wake. He espoused free-association for all and commonly railed against the situational ethics he saw around him. This is probably why Zappa's music was listened to behind the Iron Curtain. Listened to surrepetitiously by people who saw hope and beauty in Zappa's music when they were under the oppressive control of the Soviets. Lithuania even has a publically-installed bust of him in Vilnius commemorating the joy he brought people of the country. But, as Feder says, he named his daughter Moon Unit, so he doesn't have any credibility. I guess because Moon Unit is a weird name and people who do weird, anti-social things like that just gotta be no good, socially-destructive pagans. Like the Rolling Stones.According to Feder the Rolling Stones made this song called Murder by Numbers which advocates the killing of family members. Oh, but Feder is wrong twice in one sentence. But this is no suprise at this point of the book(about three quarters through). The Police wrote that song. And is doesn't advocate killing family members. It actually expresses the evil of some politicians and how they kill people. But talking about murder and telling stories of murder must be advocating murder I guess is what Feder is saying. Maybe because eleven-year-olds can't tell the difference? Perhaps someone should tell whoever wrote the Old Testament this. Seems to be a lot of murder and sodomy in that thing. Eleven-year-olds might start sodomizing and murdering because of it. The author should probably convert to an Abrahamic religion...but not Islam, maybe just Judaism or Christianity, and then repent for such disregard of the social fabric of America.The most interesting bit of information Feder supplies is a poll. A \\"1989\\" poll where something over 60% of people responded that they believe life starts at conception and another something over 60% of those still believe it would be alright to kill that unborn life at the advice of a doctor. But alas, no more information on where this startling poll came from. Does anyone know?There's a lot more of the same. Bizarre characterizations of people, statements of facts I've never heard with no references to check and statements of facts I know to be wrong. The only thing that seriously sticks with me from this book though is him mentioning Frank Zappa.Why can't Feder make something which critiques immorality without being cynical, like Zappa's satires? Zappa questioned moral relativism and the evils and stupidity in society while remaining hopeful and positive. Feder looks at the world and can do nothing but speak cynically and disrepectfully because he's apparently blind to all of the good things that are out there.Two stars for trying to help the world, but only two because Feder should help himself before he tries to help others. Kind of like when the oxygen masks come down when the airplane depressurizes. You put your mask on first, then your kid's. Feder should try to see the good that is right there in front of him before demanding everyone look for it in Judeo-Christianity and nowhere else."},{"Title":"A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America","review":"As Marxism/Liberalism dominates all platforms of religious, political and social areas of todays \\"civilized\\" society Mr. Feder's writings place light onto the fraud and misguided direction of social,political and legal morality. This book is a fabulous disection of today's \\"freedoms/right\\" as propigated by those on the G0dless, immoral and anti-moral absolute activist Left. Might I suggest a few books also explaining this trend and the reasons behind them: \\"The Perestroika Deception\\" - A. Golitsyn, \\"Naked Communist\\" - Skousen, \\"Decline of the West\\" - Spengler and \\"None Dare Call It Education\\" - Stormer. A good education behind the fascist leftward shift today and the guiding forces of it. I'd also suggest reading \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" - Marx. The outcome is to enlighten those to the end goals on the misguided and propagated Liberal/left. \\"The Professors\\" and \\"UnHoly Alliance\\" - D.

Feder simply makes no attempt at following the most elementary use of logic. His conclusions are pure dogma. For example, he (rightfully) criticizes Nazism and Communism for causing much horror throughout their respective history. However, when discussing Christianity, Feder argues that it cannot be judged because of all the bloodshed and wars it has caused because human beings distorted a good idea. In other words, it is ok to use empirical evidence to criticize ideologies I don't like, but not those I like. In other passages, Feder suggests that conservatives are a tiny persecuted minority. Which is all fine and well if it wasn't for the fact that they control the presidency, the House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court. The whole book is littered with similar examples of glaring contradictions. A classic case of \\"my mind is made up. don't confuse me with facts.\\""},{"Title":"A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America","review":"Don Feder was so busy focusing on other people's families when he wrote this book that his own son got expelled from the entire state public school system as a danger to his fellow classmates.

Of course, traditional History is important, but consider the untold stories that would be missed, like the Indian Chronicles, if all we concentrated on were eurocentric views of a non-euro world. Diego, a character as much modern as historical, finds himself caught between two worlds, the one of his Taino heritage, and the one of the new European world that came with Columbus. What is rather interesting about this book comes from the personalization of the disease, the evil, the corruptness, and the filth that came with civilization, referring to Europe's conquest of the &quot;uncivilized&quot; world. In our modern age, we may look at the past in a nostalgic yearning, but perhaps we should look back farther, as Diego said of his people, where the attitude of humanity was to see the seeds in rotten fruit, not just rotten fruit, or a view more nature oriented than gold oriented, or in our day and age, stocks and bonds oriented. In the Indian Chronicles, we see man's last effort, or one of them, at resistence towards mass assimilation and dehumanation through the eyes of Indian guerillas fighting a lost cause against the growing number of Castillas or incoming Spaniards, different kinds of animals, the type that would have slaves carry back-breaking quanitities of water to a sugar cane field and ignore the irrigation ditches that the natives, &quot;uncivilized&quot; natives, had built long ago, beating the slave for collapsing, while the answer is at his feet.

I'm also getting a clearer sense of Christopher Columbus and the mentality of their world at the time. Frankly, we really haven't changed in this regard since that time. Many may think we have but the negative aspects introduced by the European culture still lives on in a healthy way. No, I don't believe we've moved an inch from that way of thinking.

Right away, they are able to start doing calculus on the manifold.To gain solid insight into even the most basic properties of smooth manifolds, one can be forced to generalize and consider purely topological manifolds, the country cousins of the smooth analogues. In one of the most celebrated examples of this, M.H. Freedman established the 4-dimensional Poincare Conjecture by starting with a smooth homotopy 4-sphere and deducing that it was, in fact a topological 4-sphere. (Freedman's technique works if the input to his theory is merely a topological homotopy 4-sphere).So from time-to-time, we need to work with topological manifolds, and now the question is how do we work them? Daverman's book provides a excellent suite of techniques, known as 'Decomposition Theory' to address this question. The book represents the only comprehensive, consolidated text treatment of the state-of-the-art of the theory known to this reviewer.The text begins with the classical theory developed by R.H. Bing and develops Bing's shrinkability criterion. There is a nice exposition of Bing's famous proof that the sum of two solid Alexander horned 2-spheres is the 3-sphere. (This work really put the then back-water decomposition theory into the mainstream of topology.)The next theme is the study of cellular and cell-like decompositions in context of AR's/ANR's. This is technical, but crucial material.The real highlight of the text is a complete treatment of Edwards' Disjoint Disks Theorem for manifolds of dimension 6 and up. Edwards originally claimed the theorem for dimensions 5 and up and gave an outline of his proof at an address to the Internationl Congress of Mathematics. However no formal proof was ever written up by Edwards. Daverman's treatment is a genuine service to the field. The standard application of Edwards' theorem to the solution of the Double Suspension problem is given as a nice application, by-passing the extremely technical machinery originally developed by Cannon to solve the problem.Note that this text represents a first (and probably only) edition of the book. There are several errors in this first printing, so the reader should be careful going through the material to check statements of theorems, formulas, assumptions, etc."},{"Title":"Hockey in Broome County (NY) (Images of Sports)","review":"This book is perfect.

Nightcrawler's real name is Kurt Wagner, NOT Kurt Loder - Kurt Loder was an MTV news correspondent! How did the editors miss this stuff? In addition, some lists are downright preachy (\\"Never pierce anything\\") while others are totally pointless (\\"The 17 top Weird Al Songs\\").

Unfortunately, if you actually want some advice and to learn to write better, this is not the book to pick.Mainly, it's quite a lot of quotes from famous and semi-famous authors on writing. All very well and good in moderation, but a whole bleeding book on this is just a tad bit much. Not the sort of thing one wants to read all the way through-- and after a while, it's not the thing you want to read at all.One of the things is, it attempts to cover too many subjects. It covers, I think, play-writing, screenwriting, poems, short stories, and novels. This just was madly over-ambitious, as there are entire books on each subject. Thus, the advice is vauge, unspecific, repetitive, and nothing new or enlightening at all.The 'author', who really did little actual writing for thing book-- he admits this in a sluggish introduction-- often contradicts himself and, in an effort to include the most quotes in the book never includes his own opinion. How can one write a book on writing and manage to do this? The other writing books I've come across are mostly lumps of opinion, and this book felt weak for the lack of it. Like it was trying to be inoffensive.Don't bother spending the money on this, I would say.

It portrays how, in just three generations, a proud and free people can be transformed into abject but loyal slaves.The story starts in Africa where Tamboura is drugged by his brother and given to a slave trader. He is transported to the coast where he is sold to a slave ship captain and transported to Cuba.Like the first book in the Falconhurst series, Mandingo, Tamboura is used by his new owner as a sire to breed new slaves. Only Tamboura and his owner's mistress decide on a breeding campaign all their own. When the cuckolded \\"master\\" finds out, he has Tamboura killed and his mistress flees to New Orleans with Tamboura's child in her womb.She calls Tamboura's son Drum and raises him as her slave rather than her child. He becomes a fighting slave who is famous for beating all competitors.His son Drumstick is sold by his white grandmother when he is 17 to Hammond Maxwell of Falconhurst Plantation. This is the same Alabama plantation where the first novel of the series is set. So the last third of Drum takes us back to the characters of the novel Mandingo.Onstott has a great talent for bringing this period and this subject to life. He writes about interracial male and female relationships and slavery while remaining true to both races and sexes."},{"Title":"Drum","review":"This is not the first edition.

Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"Colegate is not a well-known author, not even in Great Britain, which is a shame because she's a first-rate novelist. The scene here is the late fall of 1913, the last pheasant season before the Great War, the true end of the old century and the beginning of the new. The setting is the Oxfordshire estate of Sir Randolph Nettleby, a thoroughly conservative but thoughtful and decent member of the landed gentry, and a famous host, as well. His guests include several ill-matched aristocratic couples, married only for reasons of finance and social standing (which opens the way to discreet affairs), and the author does a wonderful job of portraying them all in multiple dimensions -- especially Olivia and Lionel, both particularly sympathetic characters. There are also the house servants, and the beaters from the village who come out to assist in putting the pheasants overhead for the shooters -- especially the teetotaling poacher, Tom Harker, whose sudden death is the climax of the book. And there's even a wandering socialist opposed to blood sports for seriocomic relief -- though his last observation of the shooters is far from laughable. The effects of agricultural depression on the rural poor, the importance of private morality, the difference between \\"sport\\" and \\"competition,\\" all are examined, satirized, and explained. At the end, she provides a \\"what happened to them\\" chapter, noting who died in the War, who survived, who had to leave town. Though I wish she had told us what happens to Ellen, the maid, and John, the footman, and to Sir Reuben, and to Tommy, who was already an army officer. Besides being interesting in its own right, this warmly written book would also be a good counterweight to _Gosford Park_."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"I first became aware of this novel while watching the added features from the DVD. This author, Isabel Colegate, participated in an interview concerning her reactions to the film (1984 starring James Mason, Edward Fox and John Gielgud) in which she seemed to be very satisfied that the film had captured the essence and feeling of her novel. I had enjoyed the film so much it made me seek out the book and purchase it when I found it on Amazon.The plot of the story has been fully discussed in other reviews and editorial comments. I knew I had enjoyed the film version but it was as nothing compared to the written word. Isabel Colgate is a new author for me but she has a wonderfully flowing and lyrical style of writing which kept me rivited to the story for its entirety. Another reviewer states that they did not believe the book took place in an atmosphere where the participants in the house party were aware that their lives were about to change. I strongly disagree with that statement. Yes, the sense of foreboding was felt more strongly by some characters than others, mostly among the male characters. But it is very plain throughout Sir Randolph Nettleby's thoughts and writings in his Game Book that he feels that change is coming, it is just over the horizon, and it is not going to be a change advantageous to himself nor the English rural way of life.All of the characters are vividly and fully drawn in this gem of a novel. Even the most insignificant, little Flo Page who is sent to give a message to Tom Harker, is wonderfully alive in her role of sitting on the doorstep in the cold and dark, waiting for him to come home, until her lantern has used up almost all its fuel. No character was too insignificant for this author to use as an example of how different the layers of this society were. Cicely, grand-daughter to Sir Randolph, was constantly being chided by her mother for being too familiar with her maid, Ellen, and too interested in how her romance was progressing with John, a footman. Minnie Nettleby invited Charles Farquhar for the weekend, not because he was good at shooting, but because it was understood that Aline Hartlip was having an affair with him. It could even be said that the entire horrible incident which occurred was the fault of Gilbert Hartlip's wife. If she had not felt the need to practically goad him into unsportsman like behavior, it would have been just another shooting party like so many others.Now for the uncomfortable part. I, personally, tend to humanize animals and other living creatures. My dogs are always called my babies and are treated like people. The hummingbirds, cardinals and gold finches are all given names (even though I can't tell them apart - logic doesn't matter here). You can see my point. I must say that this book does have an element in it which may cause discomfort to some readers. It is about excess in all walks of life during this time period. That excess extended to the killing of birds of all kinds for sport. After all, it is called The Shooting Party. I have to admit that I was uncomfortable thinking about the hundreds and hundreds of birds killed simply to provide sport and recreation for a group of men. I knew this was what it would be about when I began to read, but nothing prepared me for the feeling of wholesale slaughter and the total disregard for the lives of other living creatures which I found here. Granted the birds were used for food, but the ultimate reason for the party was to kill, to exhibit a proficiency in shooting and in helping your master shoot faster. This book is simply a portrait of what was a common occurance at these house parties, these things really happened. A film version can only go so far. This was way beyond what was portrayed in the movie and I began to have a real problem with reading about it.Even saying these things, I still highly recommend this book. The snapshot of all these lives coming into such sharp focus with the pulling of the trigger one time too many was stark, vivid, and it made me uncomfortable. But it was a wonderfully told story."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"It is October 1913. A handful of sportsmen, including two of the best shots in the land, have gathered at Nettleby Park in Oxfordshire for the big shooting party of the season. They will bag hundreds of pheasants, as well as the odd woodcocks and hares, all flushed from the woods by an army of beaters under the command of the head gamekeeper. Joining the men for meals and drinks, as well as for some of the shooting drives, are their wives. And for each aristocrat there seemingly are three or four servants.This world of English country society is being battered by all sorts of forces, including \\"industrial workers, screaming suffragettes, Irish terrorists, scandals on the Stock Exchange, universal suffrage.\\" Sir Randolph Nettleby, host of the hunting party, worries that an era is coming to an end, similar to the decline of feudalism. \\"If the hierarchy to which he belonged were to be swept away by absolute democracy what could his son * * * expect to inherit?\\"As the group ends its lunch in the field of lobster vol-au-vents, chicken mayonnaise with boiled potatoes, and champagne or lemonade, and as the beaters move off to begin the afternoon's drives with the hunters and their gun-loaders following, one of the ladies, Olivia Lilburn, observes that \\"it's like an army, * * * we have bivouacked and are moving off now to the front line.\\" She wonders to herself, \\"Are we really all so beautiful and brave, * * * or do we just think we are?\\"We readers know, of course, that those questions prefigure the Great War, which will break out in less than a year and over the next few years will shatter the world of the landed gentry.Not everyone is as reflective as Sir Nettleby or Lady Lilburn. Most of the shooting party are preoccupied by such things as pursuing a discrete affair, identifying appropriate matches for their children, shooting the most pheasants over the course of the two-day hunt, dodging their creditors, and observing the proprieties attendant to being a gentleman or a lady. Meanwhile the servants and retainers have other concerns, and a few of them harbor rather bitter resentments.Just as the world of the landed gentry of 1913 ended in death in the Great War, so too does the Nettleby Park shooting party of October 1913 end in death. That fact is announced on the first page of the novel, and the suspense over whose death it will be propels the novel. But THE SHOOTING PARTY is much, much more than a mystery. It is an extraordinarily keen and sensitive portrayal of a society on the brink of its rapid demise. And I cannot praise Isabel Colegate's prose highly enough; it is superb in its precision and poise.I have not seen the 1985 movie that was made of the book, starring among others James Mason and John Gielgud. I understand the movie was much truer to the novel than usually is the case. But even if you have seen the movie, I urge you to read the novel, because it is first-rate literature. [Addendum: I have now seen the movie: while it is good, the novel is far better.]This was my introduction to Isabel Colegate. I will make a point of seeking out other novels by her. She was born in 1931, making her yet another of the remarkable generation of accomplished British women writers born between 1913 and 1933. Others are Anita Brookner, Penelope Fitgerald, Penelope Lively, Iris Murdoch, Barbara Pym, Muriel Spark, and Elizabeth Taylor. And then there also is Doris Lessing, who, having been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, is the most famous of the bunch - though, in my experience, the least enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"This is an excellent portrait of the English nobility at the moment before the world changed, before the start of World War One. The characters will be familiar if you've read other books of the National Trust sort - the jovial yet worried host, his practical wife, a variety of couples who married for status and look to others for fun or love. What makes this book different is a sense that something is about to happen. It permeates the whole text. Given that the whole action revolves around a shooting party, the consequences could be serious.The whole action of the book is like a cone. It narrows down to the moment where the shooting party goes wrong, then broadens out to trace, briefly, what happened to the characters once they left and the real shooting party began.Very well written and definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"i would like to thank reviewer mary whipple for pointing me in the direction of this fantastic book. it's a great old-fashion novel, full of complex and interesting characters, that paints a vivid picture of pre-world war I english society in a thoroughly entertaining story. isabel colegate's writing is dazzling to boot. upon finishing this book, i got on my computer and bought everything else that i could find by this author. if her other novels are even close to this good, that will have been money well spent."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"Isabel Colgate has given us both a graceful and wonderfully written book about a way of English life (1913) that was on the verge of disappearing due to the coming of World War I. From a modern perspective, if a person wanted to know how England became the way it is presently, one must go back to that time between the Boer War and WWI and then take in the monumental changes caused by the First World War. What Isabel Colgate has accomplished so admirably in this modest sized book is to give us an insight into the social thinking and values that existed in the book's 1913 setting -- a shooting party at a country estate. A first-rate piece of writing and insight by an award winning author. Highly recommended.(Also, this book was turned into a solid screenplay in 1983 and a first rate motion picture was produced of the same title. It had a stellar British cast and was, sadly, actor James Mason's last film.

I felt the characters were well drawn and very realistic, although there was a touch too much &quot;nobel love&quot; between Olivia and Lionel."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"The people in this book come in three layers. We are mostly concerned about the top layer, including Sir Randolph Nettleby and his 1'000 acre estate, Lord Lilburn and his wife Olivia, Sir Ruben Hergesheimer, Count Tibor Rakassyi of Hungary, and so many, many more. They set the tone.The lowest layer are the beaters for the shoot. They are farmers from the village. They are anonymous, and nobody talks to them. They are just the background noise. The exception is Tom Harker, occasional poacher.In between those two layers are those who bow to the top and kick those below. For instance Glass, the head game keeper, and his son Dan. Or the maid Ellen.And also somewhere in between is Cornelius Cardew. part preacher, compleat vegetarian, and convinced socialist. He seems too lightweight for an oracle, so his contribution to this novel is not quite clear.But to come to the book: Mrs. Colegate has assembled a very large cast that fits into the Edwardian age. She gives us detailed biographies of each cast member and thus makes clear that they are not all the same. Mainly, some of the wives have their own private amusement with men not their husbands. Olivia holds hands with Lionel Stephens, while Arline Hartlip flirts with Charles Farquhar. Cicely, granddaughter of Minnie Nettleby, reaches for Count Rakassyi, but is still too young to do damage. Her brother Osbert meanders through the story with his pet duck. As we go along, the characters take on their own, distinct personality. Lionel Stephens rates the shoot as a competition. That is decidedly uncivilized, and Gilbert Hartlip hates him for it. The picture of this society fills in as we read along.It has been said that the book describes the end of an era. I cannot find much indication of that. Also, everybody knew in October of 1913 that a major war was imminent, but this is not reflected. I believe it is too easy to use our knowledge of today to read something into that day before the Great War. Let us be honest and admit that the landed gentry is still with us, that they still have their shoots, and that their influence can still be felt. The more things change, the more they stay the same - as Voltaire said.Nevertheless, it is an elegant and worthwhile book.."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"What did the English upper class do for fun before the \\"Great War\\"? They shot anything that moved, gossiped and had affairs. It is unbelievable how many birds they shot in just one day, even though they raised the pheasants for this purpose and also shot any ducks that got in their way. Shooting parties were called a sport which hardly seems to apply when they had men to load the guns and drive the game their way. It was not considered sporting to keep score and when two men did the consequences were fatal. The ladies occasionaly joined in by watching, but mostly they shared an elegant luncheon and gossip and talked of their love life. All this changed after the war."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"A friend wanted this book for Christmas, and I wasn't sure I would be able to locate it in time.

At a shooting party at the estate of Sir Randolph Nettleby, rooms are allocated so that lovers rooms are discreetly close, and the rituals of what is the thing to do and what one wears for the occasion, are rigidly adhered to. The book is really a social commentary on the morals and mores of the English upper classes at that particular time in history, just a few short months before the beginning of WW1, and just prior to the events which will change their way of life forever. A counterpoint to the rustic idyll of a shooting party is an eccentric animal rights protestor who gate crashes the shoot and a local poacher who ends up being the unwitting victim of the macho exhibitionism of one of the shooters. It's a fascinating glimpse into the privileged world of the aristocracy before their world changed completely."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"Isabel Colegate's The Shooting Party is one of those books where the sheer beauty of the prose sweeps the reader away to a different time and place, into a snapshot perfectly captured of an era and a way of life on the eve of its passing. The summation found inside the dust jacket flap lays things out perfectly:\\"It is the autumn of 1913. Sir Randolph Nettleby has assembled a brilliant array of guests at his estate in Oxfordshire for the biggest shoot of the season. An army of game-keepers, beaters, and servants has rehearsed the intricate rituals of the hunt and of the house. The gentlemen are falling into the prescribed mode of fellowship and good-humored sporting rivalry; the ladies are reviewing the latest gossip as they follow their husbands' and suitors' progress in the shooting. The weekend party would seem a perfect enactment and affirmation of the pleasures and privileges of Edwardian country life.--Yet Isabel Colegate makes clear -- in this stunningly beautiful, ironic, and deeply intelligent novel -- that all is not what it seems: almost every aspect of the moral and social codes of the group is being flouted and violated. Competition beyond the bounds of sportsmanship, passion that bursts the confines of genteel flirtation, revulsion at the slaughter of the animals, anger at the class distinctions that oppress the lower orders -- these harsher, more difficult truths are about to rise up and engulf the assured social peace that is to last for only a brief while longer....\\"I first became aware of the book because of the 1982 film that was made from it. For those familiar with the film, it does, for the most part, follow the book remarkably faithfully with the single exception of the scene where the guests dress up in costume for an evening's frivolity, which was apparently created from whole cloth as it does not appear in the book at all. But whether or not you're familiar with the film version, the book remains a truly worthwhile read, again because of the truly breathtaking elegance and richness of detail of Colegate's prose, as can be seen in this intimacy-inducing description of Sir Randolph's study:\\"It was a smallish room, high-ceilinged and panelled half way up the walls with dark oak. The patterned wallpaper was dark too, but not much of it was to be seen because of the number of pictures hanging on it and the massive oak superstructure above the fireplace which incorporated two mantel-shelves with small supporting pillars at their sides. The shelves were crowded with a variety of objects and ornaments, and above them the carved and fluted wood allowed for an inset oval picture lit on each side by hinged candelabra. This picture, like most of those on the walls, was -- only just discernibly for the pictures too were dark -- a landscape with figures. This one, unlike the others which though age and tobacco-smoking owners had obscured them were by such painters as Zucharelli and George Morland, was the work of an amateur. Sir Randolph's great-aunt, an artist of considerable skill, had copied it in oils in the spring of 1864, when she and her husband had spent three months in Venice. It showed a man on a horse looking down into a sort of quarry where a woman was sitting, draped in a cloak. The horse held one leg up in front of it as if about to paw the ground, wanting to be off, and the man seemed to hesitate, and behind them to the right was a group of buildings on a hill, very solid, a large farm perhaps, and on the other wise a vast and various distance stretched towards a pale sky, becoming a deep shadowy blue as it approached the horizon. It was a picture which once looked at -- for the dark varnish Great Aunt Hannah had applied had darkened even more with the years and not everyone did look - seemed to draw he spectator by some kind of infinite and mysterious significance. Sir Randolph had never troubled to find out what it was supposed to represent or who had painted the original. He liked it as he liked certain pieces of music and would have hated to have had it moved, cleaned or elucidated.\\"Colegate is particularly adept at using her chosen setting and characters as a representative microcosm of the greater society of which they're a part, showing the beliefs, customs and attitudes of the different social layers that made up English manorial life in the late Edwardian era. Her prose style is subtly evocative, showing through a character's musings and exchanges an awareness on the part of some that things were changing, while others remained blissfully and willfully oblivious:\\"He [Sir Randolph] did feel, if not yet a dodo, at least at tne end of something; he did feel, looking around the room in which the watery light filtering through the beech leaves and reflecting the river gave everything a soft luminosity becoming to the unpainted faces of the women and the muted colour of their clothes and the blue and white of the china on the dark shelves behind them, that beyond the river and the trees, beyond the boundaries of his own estate, there was a whole clamorous violent disorderly process going on which was to bring about the end of an idea, an idea started by people whose combination of poetry and political acumen, curiosity and love of pastoral life, made them seem, he'd always thought, though Florentine, rather English. He believed - of course he believed - that Renaissance man had been best embodied in the eighteenth-century English gentleman, and it was this figure, standing in his library, a book in one hand, the other resting lightly on a piece of classical sculpture, gazing out over a landscape harmoniously ordered by himself and under his guidance his tenants, in the consciousness that from time to time he would be called upon to play a part in the government of his country or its defence, and that in due course his eldest son would take his place and stand at his library window and deal with his tenants and show his visitors the improvements -- it was this figure which in Sir Randolph's mind accorded so ill with striking industrial workers, screaming suffragettes, Irish terrorists, scandals on the Stock Exchange, universal suffrage. If the hierarchy to which he belonged were to be swept away by absolute democracy what could his son the diplomat expect to inherit? Or his granson Marcus, the schoolboy? His imagination ran suddenly far ahead, past bankruptcy, past expropriation, past the roused rabble and the barbarian horde, to the outposts and lonely places of the world, the faint torch of truth, the wide white light of the island of Iona.--'Now why are you smiling?' asked Aline.--'Because I was telling Olivia a few minutes ago my gloomy prognostications about the future, and the extraordinary thing is that sometimes when my thoughts about the future become very gloomy indeed, I find myself feeling more and more lighthearted about it. Do you find that at all?'--'I never have gloomy thoughts about the future. I can't afford to at my age, it would give me wrinkles.'--'I suppose I have always rather fancied the idea of having to take to the hills.'--'What hills? There aren't any round here.'--'We're not all that far from the Chilterns. But I suppose I mean that metaphorically. Taking to the hills when barbarian hordes overrun us, that's what I meant. I think I should enjoy it.'--'Minne would simply hate it. I really think taking to the hills is not at all a suitable thing for Minnie to do. She and I will just have to stay behind and try to make friends with the barbarians.'\\"Highly recommended for anyone who loves the beauty of the written word in the hands of a truly masterful writer. And to anyone interested in an intimate portrayal of English country life at the end of the Edwardian era and of the shooting party as a social function of the time."},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"There are some times that can be mistaken for no other times. And later we look back on those times through the mist and embue them with a magic which seems to have disappeared from our lives.That last summer, that one perfect evening before the dawn of the war to end all wars was such a time. After the war, after the trenches, after it was all over, things were changed forever. The war swept away a generation of youth. And it swept away the life of the leisurely aristocracy. The world got busier, and louder. But for one perfect moment...The Shooting Party gathers together representatives from every generation and every class onto a large country estate for a shooting party which takes place on the eve of that great war. We see the hints of war and because we are looking back, we understand how fragile this time is and how soon it will end. The slaughter of the hunt resonates with the slaughter shortly to take place. And when one character (in the words of his wife) \\"overreaches\\" himself, the card house begins to tumble and we know that that time and place is gone forever"},{"Title":"The Shooting Party","review":"I had heard about this book in the early 1980's and I was happy to find it in a second hand book shop (Charlie Byrnes in Galway, the best on the planet!) earlier this year.The book is in the Gosforth Park territory, a weekend in a English great House during the Edwardian period, and purposely aims to be a microcosm of English society on the brink of the Great War.The occasion is in weekend of shooting organised by Sir Randolph Nettleby and the story slowly unwinds, however with a certain tension as the author tells us at the outset that there will be an error of judgement which will result in a death. A significant amount of characters of all classes are gradually introduced, representing the various strands of English society at the time. The book is quite descriptive about the countryside, the heaviness of the clothes and the sheer logistics of organising the shooting of the various birds. I found the description of the shooting and the mounds of dead birds quite revolting, and its clear the author, without directly saying so, see this as a symbol of the barbarism which lurked under the genteel surface.The tension was maintained through the various narratives, as the reader keeps wondering who will die and how. For most of the story I was convinced it was going to be a small boy, Nettleby's grandson, who had a pet duck which had wondered off.I have two basic disappointments with the book, the most glaring was the characterisation - it seemed that each individual had to represent a type , the proprietor who valued tradition and frowned on competition among his guests, the loyal woodsman, the village boy who would come good through education, the poacher, the do-gooder who preaches animal rights, the adulterous ladies, the foreigner and the nouveau riche Jew. While each is brought to life, I felt the author started with the stereotype and tried to characterise it, in particular the foreigner - a Hungarian nobleman - has no redeeming features. The other disappointment was with the prose style - its quite densely descriptive, I found I had to read and re-read sections, to be sure I hadn't missed something."},{"Title":"Calvin y Hobbes EN TODAS PARTES HAY TESOROS (Spanish Edition)","review":"I love Calvin and Hobbes and this is AWSOME.

GREAT BOOK."},{"Title":"The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy: An Inspector Wilkins Mystery (Inspector Wilkins Mysteries)","review":"Hmm. Now, let me see. Was it the Earl of Burford in his collection-room with a candlestick? Or maybe it was Mrs. Peabody in her boudoir with one of her husband's weapons. Naw. More likely it was -- just who was it, anyway? I know! It was the Baroness out in the carpark with her trusty spanner.For certain, there are laughs on every page--nearly every line, in fact, of this delectable, delicious parody of the classic 1930s-type English Country House Mysteries. Mr. Anderson has done his homework wonderfully well; the settings are absolutely spot-on, the characters a delightful m&eacute;lange, and the plotting is, quite simply, to die for! And of course, someone does just that.The twelfth Earl of Burford, current resident of Alderley, a medium-sized stately home, is Britain's foremost collector of firearms--all sizes, all kinds. For several years, he has been corresponding with Hiram Peabody, who is America's foremost collector. When the Peabodys decide to stop off in Britain for a look around, well, naturally, they would go visit the Earl and his Countess.The earl has a daughter, Lady Geraldine and a younger brother, Richard Saunders, who has been making his way steadily upward in the diplomatic service. Into this family enclave comes Jane Clifton, a schoolfriend of Gerry's, Giles Deveraux, a retired Navy man, now writer who has been commissioned to do a book on stately homes, and a brace of diplomats from an unnamed Duchy on the continent. Richard and a gentleman from the HO are to negotiate a support treaty with the representatives of the small country.Of course, Peabody has a secretary, and the care of Alderby is in the capable hands of Merryweather, the butler. And then, when her car has a sudden accident, the Baroness de la Roche is added to the mix, creating merry mayhem for all concerned. Well, maybe not merry for everyone. But for you, as reader, most assuredly. You can't go wrong with this slightly loopy and very loving modern-day look back at a treasured convention of the past. Clues, indeed. They're all over the place, just waiting for the 'not-at-all-sanguine' little gray (or whatever colored) cells of Inspector Wilkins to winnow them down to those precious few that will really solve the marvelous puzzle, even to the bloodstained egg cosy of the title! Simply amazing, and totally awesome!"},{"Title":"The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy: An Inspector Wilkins Mystery (Inspector Wilkins Mysteries)","review":"The Affair of the Blood-Stained Egg Cosy is one of many mysteries whose plot centers around a house party. However, Affair is unusually creative, funny, and clever. Affair was written in 1975, and takes place in the 1930s, but its humor and wit is timeless. Walter Satterthwait's Escapade would seem to owe a debt to Affair, as there are several similar elements and plot points. However, Affair succeeds in all the areas in which Escapade failed. James Anderson's plot is complex but never feels ridiculously contrived, and does not base plot points around ignorant, mistaken assumptions about ballistics, as Satterthwait does. Anderson also does a much better job with his characterizations, and is better able to make key characters charming rather than unintentionally obnoxious. AFFAIR is a really delightful book. Now if only the sequel would be back in print!"},{"Title":"The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy: An Inspector Wilkins Mystery (Inspector Wilkins Mysteries)","review":"Takes place in England during the 1930s.This mystery is about a weekend country house party with murder and mayhem. There's espionage, a jewel thief, secret agents, blackmail, and guests who are not who you think they are. Inspector Wilkins rivals Poirot and James Anderson rivals Agatha Christie.I found myself relaxing after the first chapter, knowing I was settling down to a good British mystery. I tried to deduce who the murderer was, but couldn't. And never did figure out the bloodstained cozy until it was revealed in the story line. When the Inspector finally revealed the murderer I was stunned.... This is how a mystery should be written!Excellent read. I am looking forward to reading his second title &quot;The Affair of the Mutilated Mink.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy: An Inspector Wilkins Mystery (Inspector Wilkins Mysteries)","review":"This book is far and away the best reading possible. I am an avid reader of the classic, country house murder mystery from Britain's golden age of mystery writing, and James Anderson just nails it here. Masterfully. He somehow combines complex plotting, excellent writing, and humor so that the story is both a suspenceful whodonit as well as an entertainment tour de force. You simply must buy this book.To be more specific:1) The setting: Alderly, the ancestral pile of the Earl of Burford. And an alarm system that makes entry or exit from Adderly impossible at night.2) The time: 1930s.3) The cast of characters: an eccentric peer, his stately wife, their spirited daughter, an \\"Honourable\\" on hard times, a beautiful but mysterious woman who fascinates, obscure dimplomats and foreign office men, a secretary of questionable skill, rich Americans carrying diamonds, an author of dubious intent, and Merryweather - the omniscent, ever-present, yet dignified butler.4) The clue: a blood-stained egg cosy.5) The plot: epsionage, jewel theft, murder, impersonation, a secret passageway, in fact everything but the kitchen sink. It's right on par with Agatha Chirstie's \\"The Secret of Chimney's.\\"How could this go wrong? It doesn't. It goes very right. And you will NOT figure out who the murderer is. Save some shipping and order this book with Anderson's other masterpiece \\"The Affair of the Mutilated Mink.\\""},{"Title":"The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy: An Inspector Wilkins Mystery (Inspector Wilkins Mysteries)","review":"I'm not a big fan of the thrillers that populate most of the shelves in the mystery sections of bookstores, but I do really like classic whodunnits, parlour mysteries, Poirot-type stuff. And The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cozy fits the bill and then some. It's packed with almost a checklist of the stanadard tropes of the genre, but rather than feeling hackneyed, they come together to push things over the top, with an occasional sly wink at the conventions. Once I started, I could hardly put it down.I believe another review referred to this book as a parody. In a way that's correct in that it's quite funny at times and a bit light hearted and over the top, but do not get the impression that it doesn't take its mysteries, their investigation, and eventual solution seriously. In no way is Bloodstained Egg Cozy ridiculing the genre. Most of the humor comes naturally from the delightfully witty and clever characters.After finishing, I immediately ordered both follow-up books: The Affair of the Mutilated Mink and The Affair of the 39 Cufflinks which return us to Alderly and Wilkins, Gerry, Lord Burford, et al. They are both slightly less over the top, but still just as funny and enjoyable. All three are excellent and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy: An Inspector Wilkins Mystery (Inspector Wilkins Mysteries)","review":"Here is a convenient little mystery similar to some that you probably have already read, but most enjoyable. It fits nicely in the genre commonly known as the English Country House style of mystery.I think that I have already said enough about this delightful story, but that will not stop me from rambling on. There is a get-together at the country house of a pompous Earl and his level-headed wife. The attendees to this soir&eacute;e are totally incompatible socially. The Earl's brother is with the Foreign Office and he was looking for a remote place for some diplomatic negotiations which need to be carried on in strict confidence. He asked his brother if his home could be used. That brought on diplomats, interested security people, foreign ministers from the country of interest and some shady characters who would like to disrupt these talks (we do not know who these shady characters are until we get into the final chapters of the book). The daughter of the Earl asks an old friend to spend the weekend at that same house and the Earl himself invites some folks in. It seems that the Earl has an amazing firearm collection and he wants to show it off to some excruciatingly wealthy Texans (are there any other kind?) known for their own collection. The wife of the Texas couple has a fantastic diamond necklace which she insist upon wearing during the weekend.You now have the setup for the weekend and can make some guesses by now. In the end, it is found that the house is now populated with thieves, espionage agents, jewel thieves, blackmailers, murderers and other characters who make perfect denizens of a mystery book. By the end of the book, nobody seems to be who we thought they were with their identities changing (sometimes more than once). The house has, of course, a library, drawing room, dressing rooms separate in each suite, a music room and naturally a secret passage.During the course of the evening (actually early morning) of the crimes (yes that is a plural) the house is dark and nobody seems to be sleeping but moving surreptitiously down the corridors, stairways, breakfast room, picture gallery and the arms collection room.I will stop here and say only one single thing more. The police investigator who shows up is somewhat of a cross between Hercule Poirot and Columbo.Oh, yes! I almost forgot, there is that bloodstained egg cosy, but I have already said too much, you will have to discover that yourself."},{"Title":"The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy: An Inspector Wilkins Mystery (Inspector Wilkins Mysteries)","review":"I'm not usually a big fan of mysteries, but thanks to this book, I'm a new convert to the genre!

The author talks about labels being swallowed up by other labels, the 'plastic cowboys' of the 1990s and how many new acts fail (versus becoming successful artists)in the little big town that is Nashville. I found it very interesting because I am a marketing major and there are a lot of facts and figures about what it actually costs to make and promote a record.The author talked with Jill King when she was doing sets for basically no money at Tootsie's and dreaming of a record deal. Now she has released &quot;Jillbilly&quot; - it would be interesting to have an epilogue with her. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a behind-the-scenes look at the music industry, but not so much if you want a tourist guide to Nashville."},{"Title":"Waking Up In Nashville","review":"No question the author, Stephen Foehr, knows his stuff about Nashville. He obviously spent a lot of time interviewing well-known (and not so well-known) country artists, as well as people behind the scenes - producers, writers, etc. The weakness in the book, from my perspective, is that it is too wordy. There are too many details and too much repetition. I found myself skipping ahead to more interesting parts of the book.If you are interested in reading a very detailed \\"fact-book\\" about the state of the country music industry in Nashville, then this is your book.

I should say it was good. Though the story is the same, this is the Javanese version of the same story of Rama and Sita, and obviously is a bit different in places, from the scriptures available in India, where the original mythological legend is based on.Weitzman has a knack for making it seem friendly and appealing to children and in this book he uses his own artistic projection, while keeping the basic form of the art intact. The figurines in the book resemble the puppets used in ancient Javanese version of the art of puppetry, marked by their long-limbed figurines. David makes these shadow forms glitter, with his usage of gold color.Worth reading for kids interested in legendary mythologies."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This book is an excellent expose of the author's research on the effect of our thoughts and emotions on the water we drink or imbibe. It seems that words like love and gratitude are more conducive to formation of hexagonal crystals by water when frozen. Words spoken with anger have a different effect; crystals are either deformed or not found at all. Music seems to have a marked effect on this crystal formation also, classical music yields beautiful, delicate crystalline formations in contrast to heavy metal. Places also have a strong effect on the crystals, the crystals formed in a sample of water near Macchu Pichu, Stonehenge, Mount Fuji for example are exquisite in their detail.The author also speculates on the use of this method to predict earthquakes and natural calamities. He posits that the method is foolproof.There are, a few stipulations in this book that would seem far-fetched to a scientific clientele. Nevertheless, the import of the photographs, if repeatable is revolutionary and must be followed up with the utmost seriousness.This book should be required reading for all school going children. Just this little step would go a long way towards eliminating all our problems with juvenile delinquents.

Whenever someone is being mocked in such a way for presenting insightful information that can have great relevance if true, it is always a sign something's up. We have history as a guide to those great minds, such as the man who dreamed of the molecule DNA and was able to make a discovery in such a way, and of countless other insights that are based on seemingly unscientific methods of discovery. This book presents a theory based on experiments that sprang from intuitive insights Mr. Emoto had about water. Though these experiments are not highly sophisticated we should keep an open mind to possibilities and continue our quest to learn about the true nature of water and our relation to it, and how we might utilize it better.Just take a moment to think of those who mocked Einstein for his theories and of the extravagant outlandish theories proposed in String Theory such as worm holes, etc. That's hard science based on math, yet it impresses many scientific minds that would find Emoto's theory laughable. Worm holes into other universes to escape this one that's dying? That's hard quantum science of this day and age and those scientific minds who attack Emoto here seem to be oblivious to how ridiculous and far out much of their science has become in the 21st Century. Oh no! Our universe will expand forever, so let's figure out a way to escape in a wormhole to parallel universe! That's today's science for you -- way, way out in left field.Perhaps it insults a scientifically sophisticated mind to consider this simple discovery of water as a possibility to some breakthrough in understanding higher consciousness as it relates to human interaction with the universe. Sometimes science can get too carried away with itself. The ancients knew so much more than our civilization does today, that we still don't understand how they built the Pyramids without our technology."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Like most Original Thinkers, Dr Emoto stirs the Passions of detractors and Students alike; it's hard to be in the middle-of-the-road on this subject! Especially when it's such a wide-ranging road.Dr Emoto talks about vibrational patterns that enhance or intensify negative or Positive States. I seriously doubt any Human alive can say that they have not been influenced by the Energies of another Human. Be it Positive or Negative. Those energetic patterns influenced them to such a degree as to change their Emotional State in that moment. Did they actually see the change coming? did it lessen the inpact because they couldn't see it with physical eyes?Try something similar with 3 tuning forks of different pitch or tone and a wash tub of water. Strike one of the tuning forks, and place it on the rim of the tub, and soon you will see the waters representation of the sound you hear.

The author's thesis is: water exposed to \\"positive\\" experiences makes beautiful, regular crystals, whereas water exposed to \\"negative\\" experiences, does not make crystals or it makes incomplete crystals\\". This concept reflects what homeopathic medicine is based upon. I don't have anything against it. However the author shows only ONE picture for each and every condition.He shows pictures of water crystals which were formed in the presence of the word \\"thank you\\" in different languages. Undeniably the crystals exposed to \\"thank you\\", \\"danke\\" and \\"merci\\" ARE regular. Undeniably, the crystals exposed to \\"grazie\\" and \\"thank you in Chinese\\" are IRREGULAR. Just go see for yourself. Does it mean that Chinese and Italian are intrinsically rude languages? Tap water from most cities makes poor crystals, supposedly because of the chlorine. Water from a Yellowstone pool has poor crystals, too (not a surprise because Yellowstone water is extremely rich in mineral contaminants). Nonetheless the author attaches a positive meaning to it. The water crystal from Lake Maggiore in Norther Italy is beautiful. Well, I tell ya, Lake Maggiore is NOT a clean water and you can believe me because it's exactly were I come from. The water from the Fontana di Trevi in Rome makes round crystals thus resembling the coins that people throw in the fountain. To me it is indistinguishable from the round water crystal made under the influence of the word \\"satan\\" I mean, come on!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The fun begins right on their front page with a quote from Masaru Emoto:\\"We must pay respect to water, and feel love and gratitude, and receive vibrations with a positive attitude.

Water that was imprinted by \\"love,\\" \\"gratitude,\\" and \\"appreciation,\\" responded by the development of complex crystals -- essentially \\"snowflake\\" crystals obtained by evaporation and cooling -- and an excellent effect was produced by combining the words \\"love\\" and \\"gratitude,\\" as any fool can plainly see in the illustration. But water that was mistreated by negative intentions became disordered and lost its magnificent patterning. In fact, it often took on grotesque forms of resonance, he says.Then he really got into the swing of pseudoscience, simplifying matters by just writing words -- in any language, of course -- on pieces of paper and taping them to a clear glass container to see if anything happened. Positive words like \\"love\\" and \\"thank you\\" produced beautiful and delicate crystalline patterns, we're told. He tried \\"You Make Me Sick. I Will Kill You\\" and he observed distorted, frightening, muddied patterns. We show here the pattern produced by this last phrase. He even experimented with names like \\"Gandhi,\\" \\"Mother Teresa,\\" and \\"Hitler,\\" and the same kind of results occurred. Wow, again!And, not to our surprise, Dr. Emoto discovered that the water crystals dutifully form up in response to different ethnic versions of the languages impressed upon them. Here's the expression \\"thank you\\" in both Japanese and English. You can see the distinct variations, can't you?Well, if that didn't convince you that Dr. Emoto might not have both oars in the water, try this, a quotation from him in answer to his thoughts on what the crystals are: \\"I came to the realization that these crystals are spirits.\\" Okay. Where's the door....?Let's spend a moment to wonder about how such a view can be brought about. Dr. Emoto might very well believe that he's doing science. But he's not. He does no double-blind procedures, for one thing, which dooms these amateur efforts, right from the beginning. If he were to be blind to which words were being used to influence the water crystals, his search through the results looking for confirmation, would be inconclusive. I'll risk the JREF million-dollar prize on that statement. If Dr. Emoto wants to win the prize, let him agree to perform his tests in a double-blind fashion, and I predict he'll get fuzzy results that prove nothing.On the flipside some more: Do you due diiligence on the credentials, even at the Ph.D. level of other more woo-woo writers on this field of energy and intuitive healing .... before you listen to their counsel. Many of them have Ph.D.'s from unaccredited places ... which means they didn't go through the same kind of rigor. Many popular New Agey type writers along with Doreen Virtue, Sonia Choquette, Carolyn Myss, John Gray, Barbara De Angelis, etc .... who are examples of Ph.D.s whose source were unaccredited universities, some who have now been shut down by government authorities as degree mills. Please keep this in mind when venturing out to learn from an inuitive healer ..."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"I'm not a big fan of dismissing someone's work and I really wanted to find something valid in Emoto's \\"research\\" but his lack of respect for the scientific method has tainted his work.

Scientific discoveries need to be clearly outlined with their method so the results can be tested and reproduced. He has been suspiciously vague.Emoto paints a pleasant picture but there is no substance.

I am fascinated and amazed by the magical beauty of water. But I also recognize that there are many scientific principles that govern the behavior of water. That science does not detract from the beauty and mystery of water for me. I do not need to throw science out the window to appreciate that beauty but apparently many others do. I once watched a 2 hour slide show and talk by Mr. Emoto, hoping to ask questions. He refused to take any questions afterwards, even though I had plenty. Where are the side by side comparisons of the ice structure of the same water that did not have the word or picture influences? Until similar photos are created with a control group and with the involvement of neutral 3rd party scientists, I can not believe any of the claims.

And *this* is what the water crystals are trying to tell us.\\" p. 146I began this review with the above quote, because in the speculation of whether Emoto's work is legitimate or a hoax, this message often gets lost.Masaru Emoto is a science hobbyist in Japan, who photographs ice crystals under a microscope using a technique described in the book's prologue. (His doctorate degree is from a 2-year alternative medicine correspondence course in India.) He says that when he exposes the pre-frozen water to positive energy such as classical music or the words \\"love and gratitude,\\" the crystals are beautiful and well-formed. On the other hand, crystals exposed to negative energy such as heavy metal music or the words \\"you fool\\" are ugly and malformed. Forty percent of the book is devoted to photography of crystals exposed to various music (including Elvis' Heartbreak Hotel and Austrian yodeling), energies (including the words \\"You make me sick!\\") and crystals from various polluted and non-polluted bodies of water around the world.The one-star reviews claim this is not science, end of story. Having read every word of this book, I conclude this: Emoto's claims, whether legitimate or false are too important to be ignored. If they are true, then here is tangible evidence that our thoughts and the words of others can change our body chemistry, given that our bodies are approximately 70% water. This would make sense in light of other research on the effects of prayer and on the mind/body connection. If his claims are false, than hundreds of thousands of people have bought books showing beautiful crystal photography and have held the vibration of \\"love and gratitude\\" in their hearts. Emoto has a degree in international relations, so it's possible he's embarked on a creative way to reach world peace one reader at a time. The way to judge whether this is a hoax is to attempt to replicate Emoto's research. In this book, Emoto himself invites people to replicate his work. This invitation, as well as the rest of Emoto's book strike me as sincere. While it's premature to say whether this is a hoax, faulty science, or legitimate, I think it is a good idea to hold the vibration of love and gratitude and listen to soothing music.This book also discusses related experiments, such as British scientist Rupert Sheldrake's work on morphic fields and telepathy, experiments of hundreds of individuals standing around lakes attempting to improve the water quality through chanting and prayer, and experiments where dozens of Japanese families exposed grains of rice to positive or negative energy or simply ignored the rice. Whether a water crystal, an entire lake or a grain of rice, positive energy was found to have a positive impact. It makes sense, after all, positive energy positively impacts other humans and family pets. Yet it's thought-provoking that positive energy can positively impact plants and seemingly inanimate substances.I'm giving this book 5 stars. The experiments are original, the text thought-provoking, and the photographs (most of them) beautiful. And whether the scientific claims are true, false, or something in between, holding the vibration of love and gratitude in one's mind and heart is an excellent idea.P.S. #1 Although the crystal exposed to the Austrian yodeling is much prettier than the fractured crystal that had the misfortune of listening to Heartbreak Hotel, this reviewer would rather risk listening to Elvis. :-)P.S. #2 Check out the crystal on p. 34 that was shown a photo of a crop circle--it's really cool. :-)"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Can water tell us something about ourselves? Given the human body is seventy (70) percent water; is it possible that how water is affected by the environment is in direct relation to how we are affected? In his book, The Hidden Messages in Water, Masaru Emoto explores the crystalline structure of frozen water that has been exposed to various environmental factors while pondering this possibility. Emoto has taken thousands of beautiful photographs under microscopes from water sources all over the world. He believes that the varying types of crystals, or lack of, hold a message about our own health and more. He shares many of his best photos throughout the book as an important visual aid in making his case.According to Emoto, the most beautiful and complex crystals are the healthiest, while water that does not form crystals, or imperfect crystals, is lacking in health and vitality. Emoto found that tap water could not form crystals. Because of this, the water may not contain the vitality that is most beneficial for humans to drink. However, he also believes that when this same tap water is exposed to the intention of love and gratitude this problem is corrected because beautiful crystals are then capable of forming. The same is true for water that naturally forms beautiful crystals. If it is exposed to negative thoughts, it will no longer form beautiful crystals. The crystals become deformed, or they do not form at all. This being the case, is it possible that our intentions towards people affects their health? Emoto believes this is the case.While the idea that intention can affect water crystals and human health is an appealing concept, the book is highly subjective. What constitutes a beautiful and vital crystal? While Emoto assumes the most intricate and detailed crystals are best, how do we know this to be true? Is it possible that the simple hexagonal crystals of undisturbed glacial water will in fact be better? Is it possible that the type of crystal formed is inconsequential? We have only the human imagination to interpret this, an unscientific tool.Emoto does not thoroughly explain the scientific method he uses while doing his experiments. While he does provide some information that seems to solidify his work, there are many unanswered questions. Are the experiments double blind? When looking at crystals, does the observer know where the crystal came from and what it was exposed to? If so, this opens the door for suggestion when looking at the crystal structures by allowing the imagination to correlate to the source. There are even more questions. How many crystal samples are observed in each situation, and of them, what percentage of crystals are similar enough to constitute a valid conclusion? In addition, since every crystal formed is unique, what constitutes statistically similar crystals? Without many of these questions being answered, the results cannot be scientifically valid.Even though the experiments lack the kind of integrity that science demands, that does not mean Emoto's ideas are not valid. Though unproven, it is still a wonderful idea to ponder. What if water holds more information and demands more respect than we give it? Given water is so precious to life, should we not respect, cherish and preserve it to the best of our ability? Since it would appear that water has memory, is it possible that we are water's expression of consciousness?If we consider the theory of Panpsychism as discussed in Christine de Quincey's books Radical Nature and Radical Knowing, Emoto's theory begins to blossom into the logical and grand thinking of an interconnected and conscious universe. If the theory of Panpsychism is valid, and everything has consciousness, then the idea that water retains consciousness, memory and the possible key to life naturally corresponds. Perhaps continuing to study the basic molecule of water is of great importance. While we are fascinated with space and complex chemistry, we do not fully understand the most vital and simple composition of H2O. Are we missing the secret of life by ignoring the simple truth that vastly lies around and within us?Without water, there would be no life. Take Emoto's theory to heart and treat water with the love and gratitude it deserves. No harm can come by sending thoughts and prayers of loving kindness to it, or even better, to the entire universe. We are only beginning to comprehend the possible interconnectedness of the cosmos. Put aside the ego, the superiority complex of humanity and humble yourself because only good can from the hidden messages in water."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The Hidden Messages in Water is a cutting edge book in New Age thinking. From his own research and experiences with water, Masaru Emoto draws his theory that water is directly affected by human consciousness.Emoto used high speed photography of frozen water samples to do his research. The pictures show that water forms the most beautiful crystals when exposed to goodness. Be it in a form of positive thoughts, uplifting feelings and emotions, or kind words. At the _expression of gratitude and love, the water formed the most gorgeous crystals.The author's research demonstrates how water reacts to human thoughts, emotions, feelings, and spoken words: if they are positive, the water forms beautiful crystals; and if they are negative, the water is not able to form such crystals but only forms distorted ones or none at all.Photographs, images, music, and words written on paper appear to affect the water too. The water exposed to high tech devices such as computers, cell phones, television screens, and microwaves, doesn't form crystals either.Emoto's research shows also that despite the pollution or damage done to water, it could recover if exposed to prayers, meditation, or likewise.The underlying assumption that Emoto argues in this book is that we humans are mostly a water body and so is the universe around us. If our consciousness can affect water so deeply, that means that our consciousness is able to cause health or sickness to our own bodies and to the universe around us as well.That is a quiet powerful find, because as humans if there is one thing we own it is our consciousness; and if our consciousness is that powerfully connected to our world we are that much more powerful. It also puts the responsibility of our own lives and that of our natural surroundings right on our laps.I loved this book, and it was an eye opener for me and it raised my awareness to how devastating and harmful to me and to my world my thoughts, feelings, emotions, and spoken words can be; if they are negative. It also made me more aware of what I expose myself to, such as movies, music, pictures, news, friends, etc.., and thus more selective."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This book is inspirational and provides one piece of the puzzle of the mystery of life.

There are thousands of more complex spiritual books available, but if you are limited in time, I recommend this book to give your life more meaning.A concept presented by Emoto with which I disagree is that our soul is contained in water. I just finished a book with a much more compelling concept of the soul called \\"This Side of the Gate\\" by John P. Johnston. I read it along with Murakami's and Emoto's books. Johnston's book is by far the most intriguing and thought-provoking. Just what is the soul? Without going \\"Ken Wilbur\\" on us, Johnston presents insights into the soul, karma, and reincarnation which complements the other two books. I recommend reading all three books concurrently."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"it is stranger than we can imagine...\\" so suggested America's last Renaissance man, Issac Asimov.Masaru Emoto clearly subscribes to this proposition, and while no doubt incurring the wrath of many who kneel at the alters of those twin deities, Rationalism and Scientific method, he has authored a book and expoused theories which place him in pretty heady company: Arrhenius who was given many trips to the woodshed for suggesting that atoms were composed charged particles when it was heresy to suggest that atoms were anything but indivisible; Hans Alfven, the father of galaxy-scale plasma dynamics, who was derided for decades for suggesting what is now a given concerning solar physics: the idea that plasma physics is of equal or greater importance than gravity;Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar who was fairly driven out of England by his colleague Eddinton in 1930 for positing the exisence of black holes--a notion which ultimately brought other scientists a Nobel prize.The, too, there was C.J. Doppler, infamous in 1842 for identifying the effect now named after him; William Harvey who postulated the ludicrous notion that blood circulated through the human body; Galileo, Karl Gauss (the father of Non-Euclidian Geometry), Lister who advanced the concept of sterilization, and Marshall who believed stomach ulcers were not caused by acid but by h. Pylori bacteria.We could conclude this far-from-all inclusive list with my personal favorite among demonized scientific trailblazers,Ignaz Semmelweis, who eventually died in an asylum for expousing the ridiculous notion that the simple act of handwashing by examining physicians and nurses could stop puerperal fever, a virulent disease that killed large numbers of new mothers.Well, I'm sure you get the point.Now, we have water that thinks, or, at least, water that reflects in its structure thought patterns--a substance that florishes to Bach and Handel but that languishes if subjected to Metallica.This notion, not surprisingly, violates some of our most fundamental, common-sense beliefs concerning nature. However, it would seem not such a vast leap of faith to assume that water could be affected in some way by human thought just as red blood cells were found by Braud, Davis, and Wood in 1988 to undergo a decreased rate of hemolysis when 32 volunteers visualized protection of the cells. (This result was far greater than would be expected by chance, p&lt;.00002--two in one hundred thousand.)Emoto has given the reader who can apply William James' \\"willful suspension of disbelief\\" a facinating and uplifting read. His thought-provoking photographs seemingly possess the power to elicit either disdain or a sense of astonishment and empowerment, depending on one's core beliefs.As a final note, there are two mistakes we can make with respect to extrordinary claims: we can believe everything we hear or we can believe nothing. The middle path of the aformentioned \\"willful suspension of disbelief\\" would often seem the most intellectually honest position.Finally, there are many gems to be mined from this little book that at the very least can become the impetus to reflect on the timbre of our thoughts and the effects they may have on our own wellbeing and that of the universe beyond our own skin.I would remind those who toss down the book disdainfully that discovery is not the sole provence of the scientist brandishing the talisman of the double-blind experiment. \\"The heart hath reasons that reason knoweth not\\".Masuro Emoto may be at the threshold of a better understanding of human consciousness as it weaves its tapestry with the natural world--or he may simply be an overzealous spiritual pilgrim using water as his own personal Rorschacht test.Time, perhaps, will tell but give this guy credit for original thinking."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This book teaches the vital importance of WORDS, the power they have, through measurable experimentation.

Through his research, he shows the relationship between the form of water's crystalline structure and the environment.Dr. Emoto explains how he began taking pictures of water from a variety of places in Tokyo and finding the structures to be deformed, but when he took pictures of natural water, beautiful structures appeared. As he explains in the book, there is not only a relationship between the environment and the structure of the crystal but also between words spoken into the water.For example, when the word Wisdom, in English or Japanese, is spoken over the water it produces a well structured and beautiful form. Conversely, when someone spoke You Fool into the water, it was deformed completely unable to form a structure.He has wonderful graphics throughout this book showing the results from a variety of experiments, including exposing water to microwaves, computers, television, and a variety of music.When you consider that our bodies when we are born are 90% water, and when we are adults are 70% water, Dr. Emoto's work shows us that we can be directly influenced by our thoughts, spoken words, what we listen to and watch at a very core level.

I find it interesting that Dr. Emoto's name links to the world emotions as if this works was his destiny. What amazes me is that who would have thought to even start the work? Why would anyone think that our conscious intent would affect water? I've heard that through quantum physics that our intent changes the outcome of an experiment (the wave only collapses into something when observed).Dr. Emoto shows how gratitude can make water crystallize into beautiful patterns. Is this why we have been taught to say thank you (saying grace) for our food? We teach our kids to say thank you automatically. Does this change the one who says it as well as the one to whom it's being said? Another interesting fact is that experiments in psychology show us that keeping a 'gratitude journal' is something that make a person happier.There's no arguing that our bodies are 70% water, a direct reflection of the Earth which is also 70% water. As we all worry about oil to drive our cars, shouldn't we be more conscious of our water? Does our collective consciousnesses affect the water that surrounds us? Could these changes in weather be in direct response to our thoughts and feelings? I know that I'm starting to sound like a fundamentalist preacher, saying anything that happens is our fault, but Dr. Emoto's work does show a correlation to our thoughts and how water is structured.This books is filled with gorgeous pictures of water crystals that been exposed to certain words. Love and gratitude cause a beautiful and complex crystal to form, while words such as 'you fool' cause the water to look like ugly, shapeless blobs. Something to think about when we are talking to others, and probably thinking too, which is a heady thought. If the angry, negative things we say affect water, and we are 70% water, I have to assume that we are also affecting ourselves.

The first model of the universe produced by \\"modern science\\" was almost entirely incorrect (it did discover that we were in fact on earth in space). There is a subtlety to existance that science can only theorize about, in quantum physics for instance or gravity for that matter. We have laws of science based on theories, and if aristotleian science isn't a supreme reason to be more humble in our belief that we even have the right idea, much less the right instruments to measure the full spectrum of results, then we will sooner or later start another war for another god.My point is this: If one ignores the profound effect that intention has on absoultly everything, then they will, more than anyother, have a direct effect on the experiement (Hisenberg -uncertainty principle). Many will seek to replicate this experiement (like banging a drum is an experiemnt to see if it makes sound) but if their intention is that of science- crude, metallic and insecure (proof?), they will find it difficult to replicate these findings.Water is life, and life is the foundation for experience.

I started studying every thing that had to do with water and the more I learned the more I got excited and intrigued by this mysterious element. Yes mysterious!! The earth is 75% water our body is 75% water in fact life wouldn't exist without water and yet no one really knows where it comes from and it is only in the last few decades that scientist are trying to decode this phenomenal element. Do you know that there are different types of water? Do you know that your mood can change the structure of water?Do you know that most of the waters you drink can be harmful to your health and yet water is the most important thing for your health?? Water is so common in most part of the world that we don't think twice about it, we take it for granted, but not for long. In the last two years I read countless books and scientific documents on water but it wasn't until I read the book \\" The Hidden Messages in Water\\" by Masaru Emoto that truly initiated an irrevocable passion for this fragile yet powerful life giving element. Dr. Emoto is a pioneer in water research and his discoveries are absolutely remarkable, almost science fiction, like the idea of going to the Moon 100 years ago. Dr. Emoto's discoveries and theory combines science and spirituality in an enlighten way concluding that \\"Water is the bridge to the Divine\\". Read his book and you'll understand why.

A great book teaching us the power of water. Spectacular photography!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Can the solution to the world's problems be as simple as realizing that water has the ability to copy, memorize and transmit information? And, because humans are 70% water, this knowledge translates to the elevation of human consciousness?According to Japanese researcher Masaru Emoto, the answer is a resounding yes. Emoto's pioneering research on the effects of thought, words, and music on water has come to the forefront since his photo of waters crystals have been featured in the popular indie movie What The Bleep Do We Know. Many of these photos, as well as the foundations of his research, are featured in Emoto's fascinating book The Hidden Messages In Water.According to the healing principle of homeopathy, like cures like. So to cure lead poisoning, a minute amount of lead would be included in water to \\"cancel out\\" this poisoning. The interesting thing, however, is that despite all traces of lead being removed from the water--entirely undetected by physical means--healing would still occur. Emoto realized that water \\"memorizes\\" substances and essentially copies the information. This realization changed his life.Emoto began to wonder: Is it possible to find physical evidence of the ability of water to memorize information? Might there be some way of seeing it with the physical eye? In The Hidden Messages in Water, Emoto enthusiasm is palpable as he shares his discovery of how to freeze water crystals and photograph them. Since no two snow crystals are alike, he concluded, then perhaps he could capture the \\"memory\\" of water on film.The results astounded him, and are now astounding the world. Emoto exposed water to music like Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony and Mozart's 40th Symphony and the results were well-formed crystals that were delicate, beautiful, elegant, and distinct in characteristic. In contrast, when he exposed water to violent heavy metal music, this resulted in fragmented and deformed crystals.But the experimentation didn't stop with water. Emoto thought about what would happen if phrases were written on pieces of paper and then wrapped around bottles of water with the words facing in--words such as \\"Thank you\\" and \\"Fool\\". It didn't seem logical for water to \\"read\\" the writing, understand the meaning, and change its form accordingly. Yet, he already knew from his experimentation with music that strange things could happen.The results of the experiment, as well as the implication, were staggering. Water exposed to \\"Thank you\\" formed beautiful hexagonal crystals, but water exposed to the word \\"Fool\\" produced fragmented, malformed crystals. Further experimentation showed that water exposed to positive expressions like \\"Let's do it!\\" created attractive, well-formed crystals, but water exposed to negative expressions like \\"Do it!\\" barely formed any crystals at all.The lesson from these experiments is that words have power; positive words affect the word accordingly, as does the vibration of negative words and their power to destroy. Because humans are 70% water, how much more do words affect us as humans...as well as the planet which is mostly water?There are 32 color pages in The Hidden Messages in Water, featuring dozens of photographs of water crystals subjected to different songs, words, and stimuli. For example, Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel showed a crystal divided into two parts, almost as if mimicking the song. Appliances that emit electromagnetic frequency, like computers, microwaves, and television, produced incomplete crystals. However, when the same water was subjected to the words love and gratitude, complete crystals were formed--as if those words \\"healed\\" the water.Through his research, Emoto has found that the phrase love and gratitude produces the most beautiful crystal. While \\"love\\" and \\"gratitude\\" form beautiful crystals separately, the word gratitude seems to be doubly powerful. Water is H2O, and Emoto surmises that it's gratitude that's been missing in the human equation. He goes so far to say: \\"Love and gratitude\\" are the words that must serve as the guide for the world....We msut begin by learning what it means to have enough...If you open your eyes, you will see that the world is full of so much that deserves your gratitude.\\"Perhaps the most compelling story in this book, at least for me, was when a family experimented with rice. They put rice in three jars, and every day for a month, they said \\"Thank you\\" to the first jar, \\"You fool\\" to the second jar, and completely ignored the third jar. After a month, the rice that was told \\"Thank you\\" started to ferment, with a mellow smell like that of malt. The second jar that was exposed to the words \\"You fool\\" rotted and turned black. Interestingly, though, the jar that was ignored rotted before the rice that was exposed to \\"You fool\\". According to Emoto:\\"It seems that being ridiculed is actually not as damaging as being ignored. To give your positive or negative attention to something is a way of giving energy. The most damaging form of behavior is withholding your attention.\\"Emoto's wonderment and excitement is so evident in this book. I was captivated by his first-hand stories such as the one where 350 people gathered around a clouded lake in Japan to pray for world peace--and how the clouded water began to clear up in front of their eyes. I was also intrigued as Emoto discussed the research of other scientists such as Dr. Sheldrake, who has done pioneering studies on morphic fields and morphic resonance and how this theory explains synchronicity, group consciousness (collective memory), archetypal patterns, and even the similarities among the features of family members.I highly recommend The Hidden Messages In Water. Emoto's compelling research speaks a crystal-clear message that has long been taught by sages and mystics: our thoughts and words are powerful, one person can change the world, and love and gratitude is the cure for a polluted consciousness."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This illustration of photographic water crystals taken under different conditions explores and proposes meaning to the shape of the crystals themselves. The hypothesis suggests that water is a medium of communication and that this is closely aligned to human health and well-being by the fact that humans are at least 70% liquid creatures. The publisher's corporate mission is to \\"inspire to integrity\\" and the material in this book does this while trying to integrate common sense and even some astrophysics. I consider it a worthwhile read from a personal philosophical exploration of our human species. It is a fanciful and energized continuation of Charlie Ryrie's \\"The Healing Energies of Water\\" ( 1999)."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This is a must for every library. It enlightens in a clear and scientific way to the power of thought."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"I decided to read this book after seeing some of Dr. Emoto's water crystal photographs at Jack Canfield's Breakthrough to Success Seminar in August. The library put me on an indefinite hold for his book, but I was able to sign up for a learning annex lecture by Dr. Emoto earlier this month on October 6 in New York. Then, last week the book became available at the library.If you are looking for a thorough scientific explanation of what Dr. Emoto found and his methodology, this is the wrong book for you.If you want to understand his process for understanding how water crystals may be affected by thought, prayer, music and writing, the book is excellent. In fact, the book explains his work much better than the public lecture did. And the book is a lot cheaper than the lecture was.I was glad to have attended the lecture, however. It gave me a sense of Dr. Emoto who seems to be a genuinely humble and open seeker after truth.As he pointed out in the lecture, his work has raised more questions than answers. But he does give us some theories that will intrigue you. Perhaps the most interesting and important one is that humans can uniquely create earthly harmony by their vibrations.If you are not familiar with his work, he developed a way to take photographs of frozen water that resemble snowflake photographs. While snowflakes vary in the same storm due to local conditions, water crystals seem to vary due to other factors. Pollution and other forms of human interaction appear to play a role.Dr. Emoto shows that human interaction can also create disharmony.The photographs are quite eloquent by themselves. If you looked at them merely for artistic purposes, you would enjoy this book.Many of his observations are based on spiritual beliefs such as in reincarnation so you can take those parts as you will. But they are not essential to enjoying the book.I found that I have changed several things in my life since the lecture. I bathe myself in as much beautiful and elegant classical music as possible. I used to do that and am enjoying my return to this practice. I also take time to retune my thoughts to make them more harmonious. I find that my creativity has been aided by this, and my latest book writing work has gone much better as a result.For skeptics, Dr. Emoto claims that others have repeated his results. I don't know about that, but I'm sure you could check it out if you are interested.I appreciated his reference to Rupert Sheldrake's work on morphic resonance. I had thought of the parallels when I listened to the lecture. If you are not familiar with Sheldrake, he believes that thoughts affect the physical form of the world and the minds of others. He points to experiments where people learn faster after more people have learned something . . . even if they have no physical or written contact with one another.With The Hidden Messages in Water, I felt like another piece of the puzzle about what thought is and isn't fell into place.Dr. Emoto has also started a project to share 650 million copies of this work with young people so that they can sooner learn to live in harmony.I think this book will provide many interesting epiphanies for you. Check it out!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"I can't help but comment on the negative comments here. It's stunning, actually, in light of the basic example Emoto presents here: The energy (that's behind the words) produces certain effects. It's that simple.Start your day by \\"bathing\\" (pun unintended) your physical body with loving thoughts, (As Eckhart Tolle says in the POWER OF NOW) and you may have pretty affirming, life-enhancing day! It's that simple: the idea here is to wake up to the sensitivity of vibrations. Not taking Emoto's examples too literally! We can apply this wisdom to so many aspects of our lives: emotions have consequences!

I've read his website (http://www.masaru-emoto.net) and all of the people who support this work. I have not been able to find one bit of real science in any of it. Please don't waste your money on this book as it is all nonsense. I have nothing against mystical ideas, they are just not science. The issue I have with this guy is not that he claims that a glass of water can make pretty crystals when you say \\"I love you\\" to it. It's the conclusions that are drawn about the human body. If you rely souly on good thoughts, your cancer is not going to go away, no matter how much water is in the human body. This is not science, a proper experiment was not done to produce the results that Emoto got. I challenge any one of you to reproduce the results that Emoto produced. He claims that a polluted glass of water with the word \\"love\\" written on it will clean itself up, and a second glass of the same water with \\"hate\\" written on it will get dirtier. What language can water read? Or is it the mystical \\"vibrations\\" that you send to the glass of water that do the cleaning? What happens if you write \\"love\\" but think \\"hate\\"?

He photographed crystals formed in frozen water that had been exposed to either positive or negative vibrations via words or images. The photos are remarkable. His conclusion is that love and gratitude can transform you and the world. This conclusion results from his findings that molecules of water exposed to those words and thoughts produced very vibrant and beautifully formed symmetrical patterns. In contrast, molecules exposed to negative forces produced incomplete images with dull colors.Since the human being is mostly water, Emoto claims that his research suggests that we create our world and how we feel by the language we use to label ourselves and our experiences. His bottom line is to treat yourself and others well by expressing love and gratitude. The science is somewhat questionable, but the message is important."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Being a diehard skeptic, I disagree profoundly with the theory that water molecules are conscious and can respond intelligently to words, images, and music. I believe Mr. Emoto is seeing what he wants to see in a lot of the crystals. However, I give the book four stars for the beauty of the publication. If you like New Age stuff, then you'll enjoy this little volume. If you grew up with secular K-12 public schooling in the '70's and '80's and have a closed mind like me, you might mock it as pseudoscience. But you still have to admire how it is presented."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Other reviews that criticize the fact that Dr. Emoto does not use the peer review process fail to appreciate the fact that this is observation, not experimentation. All good academics know that observation is something that is easily duplicated (or not) under an individual microscope. To present a paper on observation is folly -- it would never get published. Therefore, these criticisms are pointless. Get yourself a microscope and see if what he observed is what YOU observe.The beauty of this book is its timeliness. But are we, as a species, ready to think about what this means -- provided it is duplicated under the skeptics' microscopes? Dr. Emoto's observations are graciously shared with those who openly embrace the lessons that he observes. Perhaps they should have come centuries sooner, but they are here now for those who are ready and want to learn a little more about the real meaning of the old cliche \\"water is life\\"."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Why do you suppose Dr. Emoto doesn't try to publish his findings in a peer reviewed science journal?

I first heard about it after watching the movie \\"What the Bleep Do We Know?\\" and I bought this book shortly after. I thought that it was simply going to be a selection of the photographs of water crystals, but it turned out to be something of a religion/philosophy book. The text of the book deals with many philosophical issues, all from the standpoint of water. It's an interesting and thought-provoking approach; if a little preachy at times. While Dr. Emoto doesn't attempt to create any universal scientific theories, he does propose a series of simple questions and answers along with the expression of hope for more research and a greater awareness of water's importance to us, the world, and indeed the universe. Some of the concepts involved could use a little more depth and research, and there are some leaps of logic that may be difficult for some people to jump but overall there is a lot of value here as a springboard for further consideration. A lot has been said about these pictures of water crystals -which really need to be seen to be believed- so I'll just mention that their purpose here is to act as a sort of evidence for the ideas in the text, and not much is said about each picture individually (the captions are very basic and don't reveal much on their own.) This is a good book for anyone who is looking for a new angle on some basic philosophical concepts, and it is certainly a conversation starter if you let your friends read it.

He fails to explain how many photos he took of each kind of water he photographed for instance-- there are just too many gaping holes. But hey, what the bleep do I know? When it comes down too it, I think this sort of physics, philospohy/spiritual theory of everything-- kind of stuff is just as undocumentable and faith based as any other sort of religious ideology.

For so many decades we have been working on the ideas of how our internal cognitive psychology affects our choices, lives, chemicals, reactions.. and the list goes on. Now, health fields have been saying for decades that we are what we eat & all that we consume does the same. Get on board: holistics, natural medicine, religion, meditation, pharmaceuticals, nutrition, etc. Are we ALL wrong in these endeavors? In our search to make life better & in every thing we discover, academia has been saying: prove it using every method of science available.. then we'll talk. Well, we'll all be dead before everything we are learning is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. I'm not waiting that long.I found this whole idea very, very provocative and it fits with everything all other fields are trying to \\"prove\\" for all of you also. The fact is, this scares people because it just COULD be true and if it is, every one of us needs to change. This is the most powerfully convincing reason (maybe not research)to move us to evaluate & beautify our lives that will benefit everyone else around us when we do change. Just looking at a H20's crystals after a projection of hate/insult reminds me of what we might find in a contaminated junkyard. Isn't that what we have been doing to our world also- turning it into a junkyard? The same crystal w/ a loving projection? Amazingly gorgeous! Isn't that how we FEEL when we look at a lovely sight or are sincerely complimented? This suggests first hand that the damage we do just with words/ thoughts alone (to ourselves & others)is so much further reaching than hurt feelings. Isn't that what psychologists teach clientele as well as students? We ARE water people! A whole lot of water & space.The implications of this theory and what's at stake for our own bodies, lives, Earth, future and souls is just astounding with limitless potential for both good & bad. I'm not sitting around and whining \\"prove it\\" and hence, not benefiting from it while waiting. This concept in practice alone can do nothing but good- even if its false! Well, that is, if you are not using it for destruction. Look to the idea. Then, you will start to think better, eat better, act better. That will only be the beginning of an amazing domino/ ripple effect that will drastically improve all lives. If you want to improve anything in your life, SEE \\"why\\" & SEE what you will get out it & you won't have to drag yourself along the process. You'll go willingly :)CLOSING: So my fellow methodologists, sit, demand your proof, deny it all until you are satisfied.

The potential of his research has enormous possibilities and surfaces at a time when quantum physics has similar messages about the effects of thought and emotional vibrations on healing, matter and experiences. The impact of energy on the environment, our bodies and experiences are just beginning to be understood. The book documents the results of experiments done on water but is not a \\"how to\\" manual on how to conduct the experiments yourself. I have observed some efforts to debunk the book based on dubious attempts to duplicate the frozen water crystal experiments and noted some inaccurate information in other reviews. First of all, Masaru Emoto did not claim to follow the traditional scientific approach in academia - in his own words... \\"Academically, my study is not based on the natural sciences, but on the cultural sciences.\\" - is from his interview on the DVD - Water Crystals in Motion, Messages from Water, - (also available on Amazon.com). A few important facts about the experiments are: the first Japanese experimenters took 60 days to photograph their first frozen water crystals, the experimenters in Japan froze 50 water specimens at minus 25 degrees CENTIGRADE for 3 hours before attempting to view water crystals. (Note: Minus 25 degrees Centigrade, converts to minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit.) The experimenters viewed the crystals under a microscope inside the lab which was kept at minus 5 degrees Centigrade. On the DVD, it is clearly stated that, of the 50 specimens taken only a few of them will form the beautiful crystals seen in the photographs in the book.

Word-of-mouth propelled it into a global best seller with over 400,000 copies sold. In \\"Hidden Messages,\\" Emoto presents his revolutionary discovery that molecules of water are affected by our thoughts, words, and feelings and what we can learn from this to accomplish our mission in life making the world a better place for all.\\"Hidden Messages\\" begins with the question, \\"are you happy?\\" Do you have a sense of peace in your heart, a feeling of security about your future, and a feeling of anticipation when you get up in the morning. Most people are not...we are living in age of chaos; we find ourselves worn out and fatigued; and at work, we face problems and misunderstandings. The sources of our problems seem numerous and overwhelming.Emoto suggests that when your heart is open to possibilities, you will start to notice the small things that can lead to enormous discoveries as with his discovery of what water can teach us. \\"What you really know is possible in your heart is possible. We make it possible by our will. What we imagine in our minds becomes our world. That is what water teaches us. Water teaches in a very clear way how we must live our lives.\\"The author moves on to share his revolutionary research in which he describes atomic vibrations and then ice crystals that have been exposed to various media (music, words written, and words spoken) and the effect the each had on the formation of ice crystals. Water faithfully mirrors all the vibrations created in the world, and changes these vibrations into a form that can be seen with the human eye.The results of his research can be seen in photographs he has taken. Ice crystals formed in the presence of classical music were well formed with distinct characteristics. Those formed in the presence of violent heavy metal music were fragmented and malformed. Other examples were exposed to the words \\"thank-you\\" (beautiful hexagonal), \\"fool\\" (fragmented and malformed), and \\"let's do it (attractive well formed). Interestingly, the most beautiful and delicate crystal was formed by being exposed to the words \\"love and gratitude.\\"His conclusion - the vibration of good words has a positive effect on our world whereas the vibration from negative words has the power to destroy.

She showed the beautiful patterns of water crystals when you play nice music as apposed to a heavy metal song where the water crystals could not form and the result was a chaous formation.She tought that as a group and part of the universe, we could make a difference. If we were positive in collection we could make a beautiful water crystal. We are made of 90% water. The water that we drink needs to be pure.The book was exciting to read. A concept that I have never heard of. Ways to make the water we drink safe. An important reason that we should walk in love toward each other. Being possitive and talking positively."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"First, read this book. Second, what What the Bleep. The Hidden Messages in Water is discussed in there powerfully.The message is simply this, Dr. Emoto did experiments with water crystals and froze them after the water was exposed to words and emotions.Crystals that were exposed to words and emotions like anger and hate were globs.Crystals exposed to words and emotions like love and peace formed into beautiful crystals.As you will hear in What the Bleep; if our thoughts and emotions can do this to water; what are our thoughts and emotions doing to us?

The message is: water remains pure when it is moving. Keep your emotions moving, changing, flowing. Vibrations of good words have a positive effect and bad has the power to destroy.

This book was sitting on the shelf and was knocked into my hands so I starting turning it over, trying to see if it was worth my time. Just looking at the pictures and reading the captions is mesmerizing. But once I starting reading the text, I found myself totally engrossed and I nearly missed my out bound flight.Yes, the theories Dr. Emoto presents may be challenging to grasp if you come from an engineering mindset but with a little flexibility and open-mindedness you will be able to follow the ideas that water is affected by both positive and negative energies because energy moves in wavelengths. Thus wavelengths affect water and leave an impression when solidified by freezing. Carrying those thoughts to a grander scale, since we are comprised of water to a significant extent then we must also be affected by the same energies in the same or similar ways.It's fairly simple equation but it has had me seriously considering how I interact with people and what I allow to enter into my area of influence."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This book is extremely accessible to anyone open to new ideas.

He too delivered the profound secrets of water, within a dreaming construct, and there within explained the extraordinary effect that consciousness has upon water, this widely misunderstood element, that flows within our veins and gives to us the possibility of life upon this planet.We all need confirmation that intent indeed traverses the living construct in ways that are beyond comprehension.In understanding the principle of water I believe we will begin to understand the very malleability that we all possess as human beings.\`The Hidden Messages in Water' delivers you more than you expect.

It also teaches that an unconscious gesture can be as deep or as shallow as the intention put forth by the beholder."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"If you want to say something is scientific, you have to let people look at what you're doing. You have to let them try for themselves. And if they show that what you're doing doesn't work, you need to be honest about it and admit it yourself.

Upon the invention of writing circa 5,000 years ago, prayer words were carved into clay drinking water cups. As well, in Southern Europe and Northern Africa, prayers were written on papyrus, and then dissolved in water before drinking. These ancient practices are a carry-over of ancient peoples praying over and into water before drinking.As author of \\"The Holy Order of Water,\\" I have enjoyed the way Dr. Emoto's research on water crystals serves to corroborate the belief systems and water practices of ancient people. I feel our future depends on how well we \\"listen\\" to the messages water is communicating to us via Emoto's efforts."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Dr. Emoto's elegant work should be front-page news. This is one of the most important works ever published on the mind-matter connection. The evidence is compelling, the images beautiful and the information is elegantly presented. This is not a technical treatise on the mechanics of how the images were captured or particularly on the rigors of the research, although some information is provided. Nor is the book designed as an instructional manual for scientists. However, there is enough information in the book to satisfy the reasonably well-educated person that those values were applied in the research.The lay person will find the book compelling evidence of the value we derive from many of our long practiced traditions such as blessing our food before eating. It also shows us that negative thoughts and words hurt us. This book will definitely appeal to Dr. Larry Dorsey, Dr. Elizabeth Targ and other power of prayer researchers. I believe this is another one of those Celestine Prophecy Books - a book for our time - it will strike a strong cord in the hearts and minds of caring people all over the world.Everyone would benefit from reading this book.

Wonderful crystal patterns show up, in different grades of beauty, using the full scale, from extremely ugly (contaminated water) to extremely beautiful (water treated by a monk). I don't believe in God. I don't believe in any religion, but I am a realist : if a monk through his meditative forces can transform water in such a way, then I can only observe and acknowledge.

However, upon closer inspection, the article was described in this journal as a &quot;Photoessay&quot; and did not even come close to meeting the criteria for a true scientific study.

These large, glossy photos look something like snowflakes, where no two images are identical -- yet certain patterns become immediately apparent.Japanese researcher Masaru Emoto describes in this book how his original quest to depict the natural beauty of water led him to discover that clean, pure water from natural unpolluted sources looks much more brilliant in color and more symmetrical in shape than chemically treated or polluted water. This assertion is made abundantly clear when one views the various images in this book and sees for oneself how chemically treated water crystals appear dark and misshapen while clean water appears bright and jewel- like. Emoto could have stopped his research there and still had an amazing book, but he continued his ground-breaking research to experiment with treating water with a variety of phrases, music, and prayer -- showing how our words, thoughts, and feelings have a visceral effect on water.This extraordinary book is a must for anyone who wishes to see for themselves what effect pollution and stressful thoughts and feelings are having on Earth's water -- and how we can change these effects with meditation, prayer, healing words, and music.

I tried all kinds of things; medicines, creams, soaps. My acne would dissapear for a little bit and then come back with a vengeance. I was about ready to give up. But one day I was sitting there and I was just looking at a glass of water I had poured. The morning sunlight that was streaming in through the kitchen windows hit the glass of water just right and it really caught my attention; it was absolutely beautiful. I held up that glass of water to the sun and said from a place of love, \\"This is beauty water. This water cleanses, purifies, and beautifies my skin...\\" And then I drank the water. The water actually tasted better...it was so weird...This was about six months before I got into learning about affirmations and visualizations and all that other metaphysical \\"mumbo jumbo\\" that people are so quick to put down but so slow in investigating the \\"matter\\" or should I say, \\"the Spirit\\" for themselves. But every time I got a glass of water, I held it up and said the statement, \\"This is beauty water. This water cleanses, purifies and beautifies my skin...\\" Would you believe in less than a week my skin completely cleared up and whenever I did breakout, it was usually small and disappeared within a few days.Dr. Emoto's book really hit home with me. Without me even knowing what I was doing, I was actually changing the structure of the water I was drinking. I was literally changing the composition of the water with my words! Now you can scoff all you want, but something happened that I cannot explain. Like I said earlier, nothing worked. Even my dermatologist asked me what I was doing. I told him and he looked like he wanted to wet his pants. Could you imagine if every patient of his did what I did? He would quickly go out of business.Now that I am more consciously aware of certain universal laws and principles for instance, \\"thoughts are things\\" and \\"what we focus on we attract\\" I not only bless the water that I drink, but the food that I eat.

However, if a photo is shown of an ice crystal that purportedly got its shape from a prayer or a phrase or a song, a rational thinking person wants to know, \\"Out of a billion crystals that may have formed at that instant, how representative (or *subjectively selective*) is that photo that is being shown of the entire population of the crystals in the mix?\\" Careful statistical evaluations would be necessary to establish any solid basis for Emoto's theses. Yet no hard data such as this exists in this book. I am open to these ideas, even want to believe in them, but, where's the beef?After viewing the photos and Emoto's captions describing them, it would be hard for an objective person --regardless of their level of open-mindedness and optimism-- to not see that his interpretations are extemely subjective and dubious. Although I was trying to hang with him, he really lost me at the point where he showed a photo of a crystal from water that had been shown a picture of a crop circle and told us the crystal looked like a UFO. (To be fair, I was fascinated by the four crystal photos of Vivaldi's Four Seasons - they seemed to fit the seasons very well.)There's 'good' new age, and there's 'bad' new age; it was very disappointing that this book drifted into the latter. I am still open to the idea that H2O may have interesting messages; Emoto just fundamentally fails to deliver. It received two stars because it is a nicely published book, and it did stimulate me to fantisize that, applying REAL scientific research, these ideas may lead to something interesting ... someday."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Introduction: In an Advanced Placement Psychology class at Durango High School our group attempted to replicate Dr. Masaru Emoto's water experiments. In his studies, Dr. Emoto showed a correlation between thoughts or messages and the formation of water crystals.Original Methods: In his experiment Dr. Emoto used about fifty different water sources varying from glacial water in Japanese mountains to filtered water from a faucet. Dr. Emoto attached different messages to each water sample and even had a Buddhist monk bless some of them. Some of the messages were: \\"Love and Gratitude,\\" \\"Thank you,\\" and \\"You make me sick.\\" He included a variety of positive and negative thoughts. He then froze the water samples on Petri dishes in a freezer at -4 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 hours. His stated results showed a strong correlation between the message and the formation of the water crystals. Water samples with optimistic messages on them created \\"nice-looking\\" crystals and the ones with pessimistic messages created \\"ugly\\" crystals.Critique: Dr. Emoto's experiment appears to have overlooked certain variables, and some of his conclusions may be based on assumptions that are not necessarily true. For example, Dr. Emoto failed to realize that there are hundreds of crystals in one drop of water, and through \\"experimenter bias\\" he may have subconsciously noticed certain crystals while disregarding others because of the suggestion of a certain message. In other words, he could have looked through thousands of crystals to find a beautiful one if he knew the message was a positive one, and -- consciously or unconsciously -- he could have looked for an ugly crystal if he knew the message was a negative one. Dr. Emoto does not state if the experiment was a double blind study, in which he was unaware of which messages were attached to which water sample, a measure that would eliminate this kind of experimenter bias. Because of this, we do not know if Emoto only photographed the \\"pretty\\" crystals because of the positive messages or was unconsciously drawn to \\"scary\\" crystals when he looked at samples with negative messages. His experiment is also open to diverse interpretations. He implies that certain crystal structures may reflect the thought that was attached to them, but he fails to recognize that there may be other relevant interpretations for analyzing the crystal formations. Because of the unnoticed variables in the experiment, our high-school A.P. Psychology group decided to try to remake Dr. Emoto's experiment.Our Methods: Replicating Dr. Emoto's experiment proved to be a little more challenging than we originally thought it would be. Dr. Emoto got most of his water samples from the mountains of Japan; we had to settle with water from the Animas River, and other various water samples. This may have created a discrepancy in our conclusions, but both experiments tested the effect of thought on water, so the water type should have had no bearing on our results. We also used a control group for each type of water: A sample that had no message attached. We had five different types of water: Dasani, tap water, river water, filtered tap water, and tap water from a different location. Each type of water was labeled with a color, and for each type we attached 5 different messages to 5 different microscope slides containing the water sample, as well as having one \\"control\\" slide with no message. So all together we made 30 slides. The messages we used were \\"I despise you,\\" \\"You make me sick,\\" \\"Thank you,\\" \\"Love and Gratitude,\\" and \\"You are beautiful.\\" We taped the messages, as well as a piece of colored paper that corresponded to the water type, onto the bottom of each slide. We were unaware of which message was on which slide in each water group. Although we took special precautions and were careful about experimenter bias, our experiment was not as wide-scale as Dr. Emoto's. We didn't have nearly as many samples as Dr. Emoto did. Another difficulty we faced was the temperature of the freezer and the time that we left the water in the freezer. Our freezer ranged from -2 to -10 degrees Fahrenheit, while Emoto's was at -4 degrees. This created different freezing times for the water samples. We had to wait until a thin layer of crystals was just beginning to form on the surface of the water before we could analyze them underneath our microscope, but at the same time, we could not let the water freeze completely or else we could not observe any crystals. We also used glass slides instead of Petri dishes, another source of possible discrepancy.Conclusion: We did not find sufficient evidence to refute or accept Emoto's hypothesis that thought influences water crystal formation. We noticed one interesting similarity between two separate groups of water samples: Similar crystals formed on the same message, \\"I despise you.\\" But, for the most part, the crystal formations in each water sample resembled each other, regardless of the messages attached to them. We concluded that in order to make a significant finding, further research would have to be done. So, for now, we will have to live with our curiosity and continue to wonder if our thoughts have the power to influence water and ultimately ourselves.Amanda White,Robbie Else,Scott Wilson,Damian Nash (teacher).AP Psychology ClassDurango High SchoolMay 25, 2004Note: Science-minded readers will appreciate the study done by Kristopher Setchfield at http://www.is-masaru-emoto-for-real.com/"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"As much as there are pages with words in this book, there are just as many pages with photographs from water crystals from all over the world - from natural springs, from tap water, and then the images that were taken when different music was played, or when different positive and negative words and statements (samples were taking from many different languages) were written on a piece of paper.Some sample words and statements were \\"love\\" and \\"you fool\\". The crystal which formed when the word \\"love\\" was written in Japanese looked so beautiful and well defined, that it almost made me begin to learn Japanese (soon, I will). But the havoc that the statement \\"you fool\\" created - I think that all who happen to use these words frequently either when referring to themselves or others, should take a closer look to get a picture as to what it does to their bodies.It has been known to those who are involved in metaphysical studies that the vibration of love heals the body and that vibrations of fear, hate, lies cause the cells of the body to fall apart. The pictures in this book demonstrate what the vibrations of different ideas, thoughts, emotions, statements and music do to water.This is an enlightening book which is intended to demonstrate the effect that music and words we use have on our bodies, given the fact that our bodies are mainly composed out of water.The current edition of the book is an expanded version of the original book which contained only pictures and was reprinted due to its great demand.The author did make few statements, though, which I do not consider entirely correct - one of them being that \\"ALL is made out of water\\" - I believe that, at least in view of both quantum physics and metaphysics, it would be more correct to state that - ALL is made out of intelligent energy - and that water in this case was a medium for experiments which have the workings of energy and vibration at the core.Having an esoteric background, when I picked up this book, I was expecting it to go a little bit further - as in consciously intending outcomes and projecting them upon the glass of water, instead of just writing the words and statement on paper. One can, for example, also use litmus paper to measure the changes in pH levels in water after directing focused energy charged with specific thoughts, either purely mentally or through one's hands, into the glass of water."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Well, the photos are pretty. Cool idea but, as a Ph.D, I am appalled at the research methods. As a spiritual person, I appreciate what he has to say. Much more below:My contention with this book is that the research is so clinically unsound, unscientific, and haphazardly rendered that it can bear no weight at all. Also, this seems to be a spiritual book looking for a mystifying way to support the author's points of view about conscious life, while showing some pretty photos garnered from water crystals as evidence. I have Ph.D. and I don't buy it -- pun intended. (Actually, the book was a gift :)Faulty, unsupportable, unsound, unscientific, and extremnely simplistic research experiments. In one type of experiment, the author writes a word on a piece of paper and tape it to a glass of water -- word facing water -- then wait and observe the crystal formations of the water. He takes photos and concludes that the water is responding directly to the word (and not to him, not to anything else that might be in the environment.However, there is no proof for the \\"messages from water\\" theory provided in this book -- he concludes that water creates certain \\"peaceful\\" and \\"beautiful\\" crystal patterns for positive words, emotions, and icky ones for negative words, emotions. Furthermore, the experiments did not account for the subjectivity of his own culturally-informed value judgments regarding what is considered positive/negative.For instance, same example: the water's so-called response to the word -- it could be caused by any number of things, including arbitrariness. Say you go with his theory that water has messages for us, which I believe is not proven by his research, which is not to say it can't be \\"proven\\" or that water doesn't contain messages, but this is to say that he fails to consider so many other factors and influences such as:Is the water responding to the experimenter who taped up the word? Is there a difference in crystal depending on the water source? Real science would have incorporated variables, and multiple multiple repetitions. Variables were not used such as different kinds of paper, different shapes, shades, sizes of paper, different writing/typing styles and sizes, different languages, different kinds of tape, different glasses with the same word. Instead, the author simply accepts as objectively given his own interpretation of water crystals as a true spiritual message.Further, there is no idication of how many times he repeated the same word experiment? Because without repeat experimentations in a controlled environment, nothing is anywhere near proven. In the book it seems like each experiment is a one-time event and the parts about the crystal experiments read like arbitrary trials -- \\"hey, let's see how water responds to this word. Okay, now let's try another word. Wow, look at that.\\" This doesn't prove anything. But the photos are beautiful. I'll give him that big time.The author also fails to acknowledge quantum physics long-accepted breakthrough that an expermenter's own involvement with and presence during research effects the results of the research study? Suppose the water is responding to the researcher himself. Or some other factor. What is the margin of error for these so-called studies? I'd say huge, but the author never bothered to try to figure it out. Instead, we get a \\"beautiful\\" little \\"profound\\" spiritual book which is *really* about the message of the author, which actually may interest readers, because the message is inspirational and lovely and will make you feel good. (Unless you are is irritated as I am about his faulty water experiments held up as proof.)The random pairing of water's messages and the author's message, while an innovative approach to draw seekers in and introduce them to his spiritual beliefs/philosophy is a dubious combination. I have no problem with his beliefs, but his attempt to \\"illustrate\\" them and concretize them with non-scientifically produced evidence is highly suspect. He has A LOT to say about contemporary issues and the spiritual state of the soul and consciousness, and I think his words would hold more water if he just wrote *that* book, instead of looking for proof for his beliefs in water crystals. His writing and thinking are very clear and his theory of life (not of water crystals) is beautiful and inspiring and mindful. but the two don't go together -- he is forcing them together. The theory is beautiful and fascinating (about the water crystals,) and would be moreso if it were true. But he provides no leaky evidence.Yes, the water crystals are a lovely additionto the book (I guess they are suposed to be the subject of the book, but his spiritual philosophy is the subject -- they just agument, except that they don't. The experiments he did with water are fascinating. They just provide no evidence of anything other than that water forms hundreds (or more?) of kinds of crystals. But hey -- so do snowflakes. (I have no idea what the estimate is for how many different patterns snowflakes make.) But does this mean snowflakes are talking to us? Are their messages in snow?This book will appeal to hopeful soulful people, and also uninformed, non-thinking people who will believe just about anything if novel enough -- if it is in a published book format, with photo documenation (\\"evidence.) It seems to be a \\"feel-good\\" book aimed at people who do not think too much and who want to be mystified by the universe.But on a positive note, the author is a fantastic and innovative photographer, so the photographs are really cool -- an exhibit would be worthwhile. Perhaps the novelty of the chance process of how the crystals formed before the photographs were taken (which words, artworks, music) will appeal even more, due to the unusual circumstances under which these photographs came about. It would make for a great post-modern photo art exhibition and he has exhibited.Conclusion: Phoney science; no statistics, no margin of error, no variables, no controlled environment for doing the water experiments, no accounting for the subjectivity of the author and his expectations of what he will discover -- for these surely influence what he discovers. As I said, he uses the crystals to prove his theory, but they don't hold up as objective messages separate and uninfluenced by the author himself. Representation is misleading. (In one case water provided a diffent \\"message\\" than expected, but the authors found a way to account for this difference in a way that that fit it back into their theory.)There are SO MANY factors that could be going on in creating the water crystals and the only factor the author/photographer provide is that water has a message for us and that message is readible, and predictable, by them, through its crystals. I think MUCH more research would need to be done -- scientifically controlled with variables and so forth -- in order for his water to support his theory.On another note, this is a spiritual book and it is interesting and in line with contemporary spiritual, consciousness, intelligent universe beliefs. He is an excellent writer and there are *certainly* \\"grains of truth\\" and \\"nuggests\\" that the reader can appreciate.Well, drink 6-8 cups of water a day and think happy thoughts. This will produce positivity in your life and the optimism model and the water requirement ARE proven with excellent socio/scientific evidence.Two stars to give him credit for trying. He really is intelligent, and his photos are lovely"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This is a repackaged version of the research and photos of Dr. Emoto that were originally in a set of books that included a Japanese version of the text. This research has been popularized by a number of holistic health practitioners and new science/new thought metaphysical advocates. Emoto's evidence is very impressive, although I don't think he fully understands how the water reacts to its environment in some instances, such as the response of water to specific words. Words are energetically connected to human concepts, so the word actually transmits the concept/idea/feeling that people associate it with rather than the word actually having an energy apart from the consciousness of those who have used the word. If everyone suddenly decided that \\"satan\\" \\"devil\\" and \\"Hitler\\" were positive forces then those words could become positive influences on water. Water is inherently a neutral compound - neutral pH, etc., which is perfect for transmitting energy and information without corrupting the information. Emoto has done wonderful work examining water all over the world and seeing how water reacts to a variety of environmental stimuli. Follow-up controlled research would be useful to examine how human beliefs, intentions, and consciusness may influence how water responds to various tangible or recordable stimuli. This book is valuable even just for the water crystal photos throughout the book, and should inspire more people with materialistic, mechanistic views to expand their awareness."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The basic premise of this entire book and the philosophy of Masaru Emoto is that water crystals are affected by thoughts, attitudes and feelings. This is a very exciting idea and one that I really do want to believe in.However, never in this book is there any scientific research - absolutely none. The most basic principle of scientific research is reproducible results by reputable third parties. Who are Emoto-son's researchers? Allow me to quote, \\"I wrote this experiment in the book that I published, and as a result hundreds of families throughout Japan conducted this same experiment for themselves. EVERYONE reported the same results.\\" And that's all you get folks!Really, I want to believe, I really do, but show some respect to human logic and scientific discipline. If there is ANY real research it should be in the book."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"I was really fascinated by this book. The photography is outstanding. Although the author is Japanese, the English translations are coherent and easy to follow.The idea that vibrational resonance stemming from intention can affect the crystallization of water is really intriguing, and I really *want* to believe that this is hard-core science. If it is, then the work published in this book represents a profound link between the physical and the psychological. However, I really *wish* that some reputable scientists in the US would take up this research and re-test for validity and reliability.It's very hard to take this work at face value, as the author uses his data(?) to extrapolate some far-fetched theories about the content of his photographs.But DO buy the book and have a gander at the photos. Even if you have a few healthy questions about the content, I'll guarantee it'll change the way you look at the emotions you direct at your world."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"I purchased this book having read the reviews on Amazon first .... which just goes to show how variable we all are in our judgemental levels, Eh?First, let's be quite clear on one thing, as the word 'science' is mentioned so often by other reviewers of this book; there is no science in this book what so ever. The methodology used (where one can divine it) to 'test' water crystals is completely undocumented, unregimented and without rigour. Any results reported in this book therefore MUST be seen as conjecture, and highly coloured conjecture at that. I really was hoping for something better. The text itself is just chock-full of unqualified statements about the author's conclusions, as in \\"we can see....\\" and \\"it can be inferred...\\" and so on, when in actuality it is far from clear to see and it really can't be inferred at all. My hackles were well and truly up by the time the author administered the Coup de Grace, and I quote: \\"It is universally accepted that there can be no life without water, and if we accept that water, the source of all life, was sent from Outer Space, then logic leads us to the conclusion that all life, including that of Human Beings, is alien to this planet.\\"At this point, having acute mental indigestion already from the preceding 57 pages of tripe, my brain exploded.The photographs in this book have drawn praise in other reviews - they are of interest, much as snowflake photography, or ultra-high definition audio recordings of micro-sounds can be (the proverbial sound of a pin dropping - yes, you can buy that as a recording), however they are presented as some sort of tea-leaf devinition, which they most certainly are not. One may as well lie on one's back in a field and give anthropological descriptors to cloud-shapes... this sort of schoolboy activity is just as \\"scientific\\" as Emoto's claims for the water crystals.To close, let me say that I am unable to finish this book - it is just too 'specualtive' in the worst \\"crysal gazing\\" manner. There was so much that *could* have been done with the research, that what is presented here is not merely disappointing, it is an insult to a promising area of \\"bleep research\\". Others have gone before in researching water and it's mysteries - I refer particulary to the German farmers who sing ancient tonal songs to buckets of water and stir it in a rhythm before sprinkling on their crops - they have done so for generations; or the nineteenth century forest warden who developed and produced specially shaped flumes to 'activate' water on it's way to crops, with impressive results. Alongside these empirical stories, this book full of extraordinary and unsupported assertions is just useless. Sorry, lads, this one will hurt your mind - keep away."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"I've been reading (and buying) more books lately that have New Age themes. For some reason, I seem to crave such knowledge -- especially regarding the environment and our spiritual ties to it.The Hidden Messages in Water caught my attention immediately and quickly found its way to my home.There's no way for me (as a layperson) to prove or disprove Dr. Emoto's thesis. I'd have to recreate his experiments and take incredible photographs of water molecules from all over the world. No way. One of the reviewers who claims to have a connection with Dr. Emoto gave me pause to wonder what's really going on behind the scenes with the man. Could all of this be a hoax? Sure it could.But here's how I look at it: Even if his research methods are sloppy, I don't think that detracts from the message of his book. And his message is that water is crucial to life. Without it, we die. It's that simple.What worries me about Dr. Emoto's detractors is that people may throw the baby out with the bath water (no pun intended). Let's look at the facts:1. Human beings are made up of 70% water.2. Pure, fresh water is becoming more scarce every day.Hypothesis Question 1: What will happen to people (on a molecular level) when their sources of water are tainted?Hypothesis Question 2: Is water \\"alive\\" and able to respond to environmental stimuli (much like plants)?Hypothesis Question 3: How much like water are people? Meaning, if we study water, are we also studying ourselves?My personal opinion (for whatever it's worth) is that I believe Dr. Emoto's research -- regardless of how far-fetched it may seem. Why? I'm not sure why. But I think it's because I can't argue with the facts. People are 70% water. The earth is 70% water. Interesting coincidence. I don't know what to make of that. But the coincidence is intriguing. Enough so that it gives me pause to dismiss Dr. Emoto's photographs and conclusions.The conclusions derived from this line of thinking are staggering. What if water *does* react to environmental stimuli? Would that not mean that the earth, too, might also be \\"alive\\" in some sense, also reacting to environmental stimuli? Many religions and cultures down through the ages have affirmed as much. What if Dr. Emoto is finally proving that to be true?Bottom line: I believe this book. I have no proof to back up that statement, however. I'm going by sheer gut feeling. I think there's more to this world that we don't see than we do see. For example, the fact that every solid object is really -- at the atomic level -- merely a collection of whirling protons, neutrons and electrons freaks me out. I can't see them. But scientists tell me they're there. In constant motion. Vibrating at a specific, unique frequency. So that, in reality, nothing is truly solid. I have no proof of that. Yet I believe it.If Dr. Emoto's book does nothing except raise the level of awareness regarding the importance of water, I think it would have served its purpose. Even if water isn't alive as he claims, the fact remains that we can't live without it. We need to do all we can to preserve and protect it!Read the book. Draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"If you haven't seen the film (it's out on DVD right now), then you'll be amazed to see Emoto's new book, The Hidden Messages in Water. Back in the \`90s, Emoto -scientific researcher, doctor of alternative medicine and lecturer - discovered that water exposed to words, photographs and music were enormously affected on it as evidenced by the crystals that formed when the water was frozen. When the water was exposed to loving positive words and music, the crystals formed vibrantly-coloured complex and complete snowflake patterns. Under negative exposure the patterns were dull in colour and incomplete, often chaotic.In 1999, unable to get his fascinating results published, Emoto resorted to simply printing out his now famous high-speed photographs, selling them and giving them away in an effort to deliver his beautiful message. Having self-published three books now ( The Message of Water I, II and III), Emoto finally saw his dicovery published last year as The Hidden Messages in Water. Although this book has only a small portion of the actual photographs, the cover alone caused shivers to go right up into my scalp. Truth has that effect.If we, like ,the planet are made up of 70% water, then Emoto strongly suggests that we should therefore be able to heal ourselves and the planet by conscious loving. If water is, as has been defined, the interface between the dimensions in which we live and the dimensions of our soul, then we cannot ignore this clear vision."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This concept and the explanation of it is remarkable, and has been helpful to both myself and some of my patients. There is a lot of redundancy from one of his books to the other, but the information is important."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"It's interesting that no one else seems to be able to replicate Mr. Emoto's findings.

But there is simply no basis for the author's conclusions - no scientific studies, no proof, just this individual claiming all these unsupported conclusions on his personal experiments. Moreover, it is simply ludicrous to believe that somehow water, in any form or essence, would respond to our printed language - as some of his \\"experiments\\" allegedly have proven. Are we so arrogant to believe that somehow another force (whatever) is going to place the same meaning we place on a jumbled collection of letters written in what we refer to as \\"Japanese\\" or \\"English\\" or whatever language the author was using in these so-called experiments? This may be the most inane book I have ever seen - impossible to take it seriously."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Dr. Emoto could easily change the title of his series of books to the one I use above. What struck me as I read this book was the fact that what Dr. Emoto was witness to was the power of our thoughts. Our thoughts contain energy and that energy is transmitted to...water, other people, our own experience of reality.Dr. Emoto's photographs, at least in those cases where he pointed the energy of words or thoughts at the water and then photographed the crystalline structure, document the power of our thoughts.So what became obvious to me is that water is a mutable substance able to readily reflect energy back to us.I was less certain that abused water itself holds an imperfect form as opposed to holding the view of the researcher toward that abuse. In other words, the scientist truly impacts what he or she is studying in the case of water.It is my impression that water contains a natural energy, as suggested in the books by Viktor Schauberger. You may also learn more about that at www.cleanairpurewater.com. And while Dr. Emoto's photographs are extremely impressive and suggestive I was led to wonder how one could actually measure the health of water through photographs without inserting subjective interpretation.In other words, if water reflects our thoughts so readily, how can we 'see' it without also affecting it? Dr. Emoto's books are most fascinating but I'm not at all certain that the apparent insinuation is all that exists. Water in its natural state is indeed poorly understood by this species that acts as if it knows all...."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This book is full of misunderstandings of basic physics and even arithmetic.

The \\"facts\\" are not accurate, are misunderstood, or just make no sense.

In this book you will see beyond any shadow of a doubt the effect our words, both yours and mine, have on everything in our world. The old saying, \\"Sticks and stones may break your bones, but words will never hurt you, will certainly not prove true in your mind anymore after reading this book.Our author does a study on water and the effects words, music, sunlight, etc. have on it. He found a way to capture the changes made by freezing the water which caused it to form crystals. His findings were absolutely amazing. When words of love were spoken the crystals were beautiful, when the water was called words such as, fool, the crystals became ugly and deformed. He tells of an experiment where polluted water had words of cleansing spoken to in and in a matter of time the water was clean. Now you have to stop and think. If water is effected with words, what happens to us, humans, who are made up of so much water. That thought is mind boggling.You have to read this book to understand the impact that it makes.

I'm not even sure where to begin with this review because this book was so full of awesome that it's overwhelming. Dr. Emoto has been studying water and, based on his experiences and findings, has drawn some really unique and interesting conclusions.While I expected this book to be heavy on science, it's really not. It's a book about spirituality and changing your life. He talks about how our energy affects everything around us and how our negative thoughts are polluting ourselves and the world around us. Considering that the human body is composed of 70% water, how are we polluting not only the water of the world but also our bodies?The experiments he did with crystals are absolutely fascinating and serve as visual proof of how words can affect us. The many color photographs in this book are simply stunning and can completely transform how you see the world around you.He also discusses some interesting theories about where water came from (outer space?) and how meditation and prayers can be used to purify water. There's also a lot of information about research on water and how we can use technology to make our tap water healthier.So if you're concerned about water, this is an excellent book to start with.

When one comes to understand the dynamics of water, it should not be considered a stretch to then see water as life itself and hence, the \\"Noblest Element\\".Masaru Emoto has studied water for years using an intriguing method of analyzing various samples of water from the crystals formed when frozen. Pure water forms beautiful prism-like ice-matrices, while polluted water forms distorted, or no ice-matrices at all.Perhaps the most amazing discovery of Masaru's research is that water demonstrates that it has sentient qualities by reacting with healthy or sick responses to various stimuli such as good, loving thoughts or bad, negative thoughts. These same studies were performed on plants with the same results and related in the book, \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\" by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird. Both books conclude that ALL life is sentient and dynamic.Skeptical or not, one should find this study of water and ice-crystals to be fascinating and with the many beautiful photographs of crystals included, that makes the book worth the time all on it's own. Indeed, there are few other forms of art so profoundly beautiful, whether from Nature or humans, that can compare with the awesome matrices formed by ice-crystals, especially those from pure, un-polluted water.In her book, \\"Taking The Waters: Spirit, Art, Sensuality\\", Alev Croutier also relates the need for respect of water and humble feelings of gratitude for all that it does for us. This is a perspective and over-view of the history of how humans have been \\"taking the waters\\" from drinking, to baths, to health spas and more, and all over the world. Towards the end of this beautiful, colorful book, there is a prophecy of the water story from the Cogui Indians who live in the Columbian Mountains and have decided to break their traditional isolation from the outside world by giving humanity a strong warning about the abuse of water and environment.In the Cogui language, the word for water and spirit is the same. [They refer to the act of creation as \\"water thinking\\" and all their teachings begin with the question \\"what is water?\\" Water is life itself. It thinks, it is alive, and it needs to be fed.]- (p 183). Indeed, considering what water is and does for all life, it needs to be held in high reverence and not abused.Masaru Emoto has truly clarified and enhanced what \\"Love and Gratitude\\" really means in his beautiful little book!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This is literally incredible.

The prologue introduces the reader to the crucial role of water in life and in our bodies and psyche. Physically, humans consist mostly of water, 90% at birth & 70% as adults. Dr Emoto considers water the essential life force, pointing out the various functions it performs, its unusual properties that include the copying and memorizing of information as in homeopathy. He explains the history of the project and the technique of photography employed: Freezing water & photographing the crystals that last for only 20 - 30 seconds. First he noticed the effect of music on the form of these crystals, then the effect of written & spoken words.The first series of full color plates contain 69 photographs of crystals with captions & explanatory notes. The most beautiful to me are the ones exposed to the words Love & Gratitude (more about this later), Wisdom in its Japanese, English & German forms, Cosmos in the same three languages, Beethoven's Symphony no. 5, Swan Lake, Yesterday by The Beatles, Heartbreak Hotel byElvis, Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Negative & coercive words created distortions, chlorinated water is \`dead' and proximity to computers, mobile phones & televisions had the same negative effect as heating in a microwave oven. However, a wholesome TV program produced a lovely crystal so the content of the information modifies the effect of the electromagnetic carrier waves.The narrative then moves to the vibrational nature of the universe. Emotions, objects, locations & individuals all emit frequencies. This means that everything emits sound too. Then follows a fascinating section on music, Hertzian waves and the concept of 42 octaves plus an explanation of resonance. Like attracts like and fundamentally incompatible frequencies cannot resonate but there may be resonance between non-identical frequencies, e.g. when the difference is two-, four-, eightfold or one half, one quarter etc. More detailed information on this subject is available inSacred Sounds: Magic & Healing Through Words & Musicby Ted Andrews and Jonathan Goldman's bookHealing Sounds: The Power of Harmonics.The author revisits the miraculous properties of water, explaining its remarkable differences from other substances & its unique abilities to sustain life, to heal and to purify. The research of Joan S Davis of Zurich Technical University is thought-provoking; several quotes are provided. She distinguishes between \`juvenile' & \`wise water.' The baby water is that which has just fallen, whilst the wise is that which has spent time underground and gathered minerals, \`memorizing' their vibrations. Correspondences exist between the vibrations of emotions and elements amongst others. The effect of consciousness on the physical world and quantum mechanics are discussed next, as well as Quantum TheoristDavid Bohm'stheory of the Explicate Order observed by the senses and the Implicate Order experienced within the mind. The work ofRupert Sheldrake& his theory of morphic fields & morphic resonance are highly relevant here. Dr Emoto provides a simple explanation and some quotes by Sheldrake.The second series of plates, titled Water Shown Photographs of Natural Scenery, offers 65 photographs of crystal forms influenced by natural features like Mount Fuji.Much of the author's thoughts on vibrations & the influence of the observer on the observed will already be familiar to those interested in quantum science & metaphysics; what is new is the way that this phenomenon takes physical shape in water. Eldon Taylor's bookSubliminal Communicationexplains how wave patterns created by sound can be displayed visually. Powders, liquids & metal fillings scattered on a disc formed geometric patterns as the disc resonated to music, even taking on organic shapes. This book includes visual configurations of the mantra OM and the concluding chord of H&auml;ndel's Messiah by means of a tonophone. Works of related interest includeCymatics: A Study of Wave Phenomena & Vibrationby Hans Jenny andHarmonograph: A Visual Guide to the Mathematics of Musicby Anthony Ashton.Dr Emoto believes the two emotions love & gratitude combined form the most potent healing force and a powerful immune shield. Gratitude appears to have the greater influence in the blend. He argues that they are fundamental principles of nature. In the epilogue he mentions the destructive side of water in the worldwide legend of a great flood and speculates about the possible future applications of his discoveries, for example the ability to predict earthquakes The book concludes with a short biography of the author. As a work on consciousness it is valuable for discussing the factors that influence water and how the substance responds to these influences; those working in or appreciative of the visual arts will find the beautiful photo's reason enough to read the book."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This book was fascinating, riviting and fantastic!!!

The title \\"The Hidden Messages in Water\\" was the hook that made me buy the book. \\"This book has the potential to profoundly transform your world view.\\" I wondered how this little 157 page book could manage that monumental task, so with skepticism I read on.Dr. Masaru Emoto discovered that crystals formed in frozen water reveal changes when specific, concentrated thoughts are directed toward them. He found that water from clear springs and water that has been exposed to loving words shows brilliant, complex, and colorful snowflake patterns. In contrast, polluted water, or water exposed to negative thoughts, forms incomplete, asymmetrical patterns with dull colors.The implications of this research create new awareness of how we can positively impact the earth and our personal health.Of what is the universe made? Is it possible to change the world with our thoughts? Do the frozen crystals in water demonstrate our Creator aspect? Is this the proof that invisible, unseen frequencies of thought directly affect us and everything around us?You'll have to conclude that for yourself. But, if you ask my opinion...I send love to water everyday...water I drink, water I wash and bathe in, water in my acquarium. Who can say or measure on a graph the impact and result of these thoughts?

Why then are his books and ideas so popular and accepted as true by so many people?Emoto has successfully published several books, presented his work as scientific fact, been featured in a popular movie, What the Bleep!, and been invited to lecture around the world. All of which lends credibility to his claims of scientific veracity - without the necessity of requiring any of his statements to actually be True.Emoto's message is not ultimately about the water crystals; he uses water crystal shapes as a vehicle to communicate his views on human relationships, God, human origins, the environment, and other subjects important to him.In my estimation Masaru Emoto's books are allegories; he has invented a fictitious universe that behaves according to the requirements of the story he is trying to tell. In \\"Hidden Messages in Water\\" and \\"The Shape of Love\\", he creates water molecules that are sensitive to human communications and magically transform messages into crystal shapes. It does not matter whether the water is actually responsive to his manipulations - only that he can find the right crystal (among the hundreds that probably form in a given experiment) to convey HIS message to readers.Below are just some of the more easily extracted passages Emoto seems to present as Scientific Fact that I suspect will set off the mental alarms of most scientists who read his works.Use the analytical portion of your brain and evaluate the quotes below based on your common sense, experiences and understanding of the world - check some of them against authoritative library or Internet references; are they statements you would accept as scientifically valid?______If we consider that before we became human beings, we existed as water, we get closer to finding the answer to the basic question of what a human being is. (HMW pxvi)And as sound is created, there is a \\"master listener\\" to receive the sound: water. (HMW p43)The written words themselves actually emit a unique vibration that the water is capable of sensing. Water faithfully mirrors all the vibrations created in the world, and changes these vibrations into a form that can be seen with the human eye. (HMW p43)What information did ancient water bring with it when it left outer space and fell to earth? We can assume that it carried the program needed for the development of life. (HMW p60)In the process of falling to the earth, seeping into the ground, and then emerging, water obtains information from various minerals and becomes wise. ...Water records information, and then while circulating throughout the earth distributes information. This water sent from the universe is full of the information of life, and one way to decipher this information is through the observation of ice crystals. (HMW p61)Scientists estimate that there are between 108 and 111 elements (I suspect that the number s 108 - for reasons which I'll explain.) Thus far, 90 elements have been verified in the human body - of all the creatures alive, only the human body contains so many elements. ...The more evolved creatures contain a greater array of elements. Compared with human beings, plants contain far fewer elements, and what is the result of having fewer elements? We can deduce that fewer elements means a smaller capacity for emotions. (HMW p69)If we consider that the human body is a universe within itself, it is only natural to conclude that we carry within us all the elements. According to Buddhism, the human being is born with 108 earthly desires... I think it is logical to conclude that these 108 earthly desires have counterparts in the 108 elements. (HMW p70) ...Humans are made up of combinations of all 108 elements - the 103 elements in the periodic table and the 5 new elements {found through nuclear reactions}. Other animals, plants, and substances have fewer elements. For example, roses may be made up of combinations of thirty atoms. (SOL p136)The simpler atomic composition of a plant means its hado is purer and has stronger energy for specific types of information. This may explain why plants have better communication abilities than humans and animals, and they can communicate with other plants on this planet as well as with the home base somewhere in the universe. (SOL p86)I was able to measure the vibrations coming from many different people, and I realized that the negative vibrations that we emit correspond to the vibrations emitted by the various elements. For example, the vibrations created by irritation are equivalent to those of mercury, by anger to those of lead, and by sadness and sorrow to those of aluminum. (HMW p70)Let's say that you fall from a building and hit the ground. At the moment of impact, your body's frequency increases many hundreds of times, creating an obviously critical situation. Dramatic and sudden changes in the body's frequency result in great pain and damage. In such cases, treatment must involve equal or stronger frequencies to be effective - often having to do with the scalpel. Sharp instruments, by nature, have a high frequency, and it's the surgeon's job to use such instruments to cut into the body and return the patient's frequency to normal. (HMW p75)When I talk to people about vibrations and frequency, I use what I like to call the \\"Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti theory.\\" This means that the frequency of everything in the cosmos can be summarized in seven parts - do, re, mi, fa, so, la, and ti. (HMW p47)I believe we came from the Big Dipper, which may sound startling; but the reason may be explained by my special attachment to the number 7. Why do we have seven basic notes? (sound): Why does a rainbow have seven colors? (color): Why are there seven days in a week? (time): Why do we have seven chakras in our bodies? (body):I am fascinated by the fact that the important elements for humans (sound, color, time, and body) are related to the number 7. So when a friend of mine and I were talking about our origin, he said it must be the Big Dipper, seven stars. I was immediately convinced. ...Of course this belief is just the result of my own reasoning. (SOL p107-8) ...Among old fortune-telling practices, I believe we can find the keys to discover where our true home is. (SOL p130)...scientists at the beck and call of those in authority in Japan who insist that water must be tainted with chlorine, resulting in an overall decay of society. (HMW p140)______Emoto rants in several places about the evils of water chlorination (xxiii, 45, 140) and implies that Japan would be better off if their water were not chlorinated - without providing any alternative strategy for disinfecting the water.Emoto is completely wrong about something as simple to research as the number of elements in nature. There are 88 - 94 naturally occurring elements, depending on definition and 118 total. His acceptance of 108 elements because of the number of \\"earthly desires\\" may be religion: it is not science.More here:[...]"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me.

Other researchers have discussed evidence to support the idea that humans, cats, and other animals as well as various plants respond to our emotional expressions. If we interact with them with love, they will let down their defensiveness and adapt to their environment and thrive. If we interact with them with anger, they will become defensive to protect themselves. It is then not too much of a stretch to imagine that water molecules respond to our emotional expressions in similar ways as well. After all, water molecules are just further down the line on the evolutionary ladder if we think of the evolution of matter itself. An absolutely stunning book that illustrates this nicely is a book called \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. If you read the book by Sato, you will realize that all of this fits in very nicely into a systems approach to evolution. Masaru Emoto shows us one aspect of how matter with various levels of consciousness interacts with each other even though it is not readily noticeable in everyday life. I think this is very interesting work and would highly recommend this to anyone interested in the relationships between matter and consciousness."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This book is amazing but it's only the tip of the iceberg.Masaru Emoto's work is profoundly interesting if you are open to what he has to offer. My husband is a scientist and when I first told him about this book he thought that I had gone mad. He couldn't understand how anybody could believe what Emoto is saying. As I showed him the photographs and we talked about energy from a biophysical perspective, these pictures began to make perfect sense to him. They are the logical conclusion to what will be accepted as fact by everyone in a few years. For a long time people have known that there is more to life than what is easily measurable in the material world. By photographing ice crystals, Dr. Emoto found a way to look at the nature of the energy that constantly surrounds us and courses through us.Check out this book for yourself. It might make you question what you think you know. It will certainly get you thinking. And isn't that what life is about?"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The author of book claims that water gives good crystalline structure in response to good music, good (moral) words, good photos, and good contaminants (good for human health), whereas, in response to bad music, bad words, bad photos, or bad contaminants (bad for human health), water produces bad crystalline structure. Water is not an independent living being; it does not have central nervous system and hence it has no consciousness to respond to music (pages 43, 17-27), photographs (pages 33-36, 101-111), or written/spoken words (pages 5-15). Water is a simple polar molecule with some unique physical and chemical properties. It is a universal solvent that solvates (hydrates) macromolecules and some low molecular weight compounds under physiological conditions which confer some unique properties to these molecules. Water does not have any extraordinary properties that confer thought process to individual water molecules. The hidden message of water is its unique structure, simplicity and the chemical characteristics. Water is medium in which life is born, but oxygen is the molecule that supports life and provides energy.Water/water vapor condenses into ice in shapes dictated by the geometry of molecules, rate of cooling; temperature, pressure, humidity, and motion/stirring of the liquid. Ice crystals range from simple faceted structures to complex branching networks. The physics of ice formation argue against the influence of music or written word on crystal shape. However the crystal formation is affected by the compounds dissolved in water (pages 113-132). Water obtained from different sources has different amounts of minerals, biological and organic molecules that accounts for the difference in the crystal formation, but crystal structure does not depend on their health effects. The experimental conditions used in this work are unscientific (pages xxi-xxv); appropriate control experiments (for example, studying ice crystal formation without the effect of written words or music) have to be performed side by side under identical conditions to eliminate the extraneous effects. In addition, the experiments have to be repeated few times to verify the repeatability of same ice crystal formation and calculate the statistical significance. Philosophical reasoning based on Vedic and Tantric philosophy or modern philosophy also precludes conferring consciousness to water molecules.Several unscientific statements have been made about the universe and life, but I have not itemized them individually (see Prologue, and pages 38, 44, 46, 52, 58, 64, 66, 86). To learn more about scientific aspects of ice crystal formation, I recommend: The Snowflake by Kenneth G. Libbrecht; and Snow Crystals by W. A. Bentley and W. J. Humphreys."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The very idea that beautiful water crystals are formed by positive words such as love or gratitude spoken or written on a piece of paper or even through beautiful classical music, or spiritual chanting may seem incredible.The further idea that the opposite is also true and that bad words such as evil or devil, and heavy metal metal music causes the formation of bad looking crystals or no crystals at all may confound your idea of reality. Is this possible?Can water read the word love from a glass, or understand when someone yells 'you fool' at it and react accordingly? Science would suggest such a thing is preposterous, and most people would probably agree.Yet, if you consider there is no such thing as reality, only perception then there is room in the world for Emoto's contention that water is transformed for the better by the energy of our good intentions, or our good emotions.This book is packed with interesting anecdotes, the most interesting to me was to imagine the monk chanting at the edge of the lake, and seeing the lake transform, and become clearer.The implications of this are far reaching and profound. Imagine the possible explanations. That knowledge brings with it certain responsibility.If you are like me, you will find this book very thought provoking, you might even have some life altering insights if you read with an open mind. At the very least its an interesting read, and a perfect addition to your coffee table."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The core of this little book are the pictures of water crystals that change when surrounded by music or words. Beautiful music (e.g. Mozart) and words (e.g. Love & Gratitude) create magnificient crystals while negative music (e.g. heavy metal) and words (e.g. You Fool!) create ugly, deformed crystals. This is a fascinating finding that shows the power that words and music have on the formation of water crystals.Unfortunately, the text of this book proposes some speculative, new age theories with little or no supporting data or empirical observations. For example, the author claims that each object and each emotion emits a distinct vibration that is absorbed and remembered by water. Though there is certainly a scientific basis for vibrations in the universe (e.g. String (M) Theory), to claim that each object and each emotion emits a unique vibration, without observing and measuring it, is hypothetical at best. Because of this, one might even question if the author followed scientific procedures in collecting the pictures."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The Hidden Messages in Water helped prove my theory of the interconnectedness among all life that I wrote about in my book, Harmonious Envrionment: Beautify, Detoxify & Energize Your Life, Your Home & Your Planet.An excellent example of how our thinking and feeling can institute change comes from Dr. Masaru Emoto's study. Emoto's experiments show how powerfully your thoughts can affect your physical environment. In his book, The Hidden Message in Water, Emoto demonstrates how water will change form in response to thought.Emoto mentally projected love to a bottle of water, which was then frozen and the ice crystals were photographed. The crystals were beautiful, clear and symmetrical.Next, Emoto allowed the water in the bottle to melt and directed hate to the water. He froze the water and photographed the ice crystals. This time, the crystals were misshapen, dense and ugly.Every one of us, consciously or unconsciously, affects the objects and people around us--including ourselves--on a continual basis. Think about the expression \\"laughter is contagious.\\" It is! How do you feel when you are around happy, laughing people? Usually, you can't help but feel good yourself. All emotions are energy and energy passes from one body to another; from one object to another; matter to matter. Emotions are contagious!Emoto also found that low frequency water reacts extremely negatively when exposed to low frequencies, but high frequency water is not affected in any way by low frequencies. This is because low and high frequencies are not on the same wavelength, and when we are in a high frequency state we are not affected by the low frequencies of our environment, other people, objects or food.This book will convince you to chose what emotions to own.Oh--and the photographs are lovely!Author of the award winning book, Harmonious Environment: Beautify, Detoxify and Energize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"I have always been a \\"fish\\" and loved the water.

Perhaps, for the sceptic person this kind of experiment doesn't means anything. But I thing it's time to open our minds for the new experiments. The scientists who desagree, they must propose new experiments to refuse.It's time to people learn that our feelings and thoughts influence matter. All of the atoms and subparticles are vibrating all the time and our thoughts and emotions are vibration too. Hence, the waves are emitted by us influence the atoms and subparticles.

It feeds a certain habit that is more debilitating than healing."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Mr. Emoto's book has inspired me. Now that I know how much water loves us and wants to be loved I look at the world differently. I had what I thought was a near death experience at the age of twelve but I wouldn't have done all that thrashing, sputtering and screaming if I had only known at the time that my uncle's swimming pool was just trying to give me a big hug.It might be of some interest to know that I have taken Emoto's research with liquids to the next level. I have studied extremely thick semi-liquids like raw cookie dough. I placed a cookie sheet of Pillsbury Chocolate Chip cookie dough in front of my television and tuned in an episode of Jerry Springer. I then place another sheet of dough in front of my set and tuned in a rerun of \\"Touched by an Angel\\". After the cookie dough was baked, as you might imagine, the Jerry Springer cookies were lumpy and deformed looking and reminded me of cancerous lesions. Interestingly enough, the \\"Touched by an Angel\\" cookies looked very similar but they tasted oh so heavenly. I have no idea what those Springer cookies tasted like, I wasn't about to put one of those disgusting cancer biscuits in my mouth but I think I've proven my point.Buy Mr. Emoto's book this instant and you will know the kind of deep love that solid matter can never give you. I write this from my laptop computer. I haven't left my bathtub in ten days."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This was the most horrendous piece of literature I've ever been forced to read (for a book group). I can't even begin to put into words what a joke this was. And the sad thing was that it actually had potential. The photos of water crystals were interesting, but the attempt to put it into a valid scientific analysis was just completely insulting to anyone with a brain. Another contributing factor to its horror was the hideous translation and complete lack of editing. Reading this book made me livid."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"Very interesting, informative book. Everyone should read this, to get an idea of the mysterious properties of water, and by extension, all life.Wonderful photographs!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This is the most amazing book I've ever read. While I cannot make crystals, I know that much of what he discusses is true. If you've spent any time around a large body of water, you become aware of the different feeling around water. There are different vibrations.Some of what Dr. Emoto discusses involves every day experiences. His explainations make sense and immediately ring true for situations that were once unexplainable.I almost didn't read this book because I was afraid it would be too technical. I'm glad I didn't let that stop me. This book is technical in parts but Dr. Emoto always connects back what he's discovered to practical life. I feel empowered to make changes in my world and positively affect the entire world after reading this book.Some reviewers have blasted this book saying it is bunk.

His studies over the past decades have indeed upturned even one of the most widely accepted of notions in our world: that we are unable to control elements outside of ourselves and our immediate environments. Through simple language that is readily understood even by those of us who are non-science-minded, the book gently explains that the findings of Dr. Emoto have been ground-breaking in understanding the impact of our thoughts on the world around us. He clearly explains that the affirmations of a positive attitude are as impacting upon our evironments as actions. Emotions like love and gratitude are shown to be creative forces in this universe. Likewise, the impact of negative thoughts and emotions can be shown to destroy. With an open mind, Dr. Emoto's studies could change your world, as well."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The Hidden Messages in Water is a cutting edge book in New Age thinking. From his own research and experiences with water, Masaru Emoto draws his theory that water is directly affected by human consciousness.Emoto used high speed photography of frozen water samples to do his research. The pictures show that water forms the most beautiful crystals when exposed to goodness. Be it in a form of positive thoughts, uplifting feelings and emotions, or kind words. At the _expression of gratitude and love, the water formed the most gorgeous crystals.The author's research demonstrates how water reacts to human thoughts, emotions, feelings, and spoken words: if they are positive, the water forms beautiful crystals; and if they are negative, the water is not able to form such crystals but only forms distorted ones or none at all.Photographs, images, music, and words written on paper appear to affect the water too. The water exposed to high tech devices such as computers, cell phones, television screens, and microwaves, doesn't form crystals either.Emoto's research shows also that despite the pollution or damage done to water, it could recover if exposed to prayers, meditation, or likewise.The underlying assumption that Emoto argues in this book is that we humans are mostly a water body and so is the universe around us. If our consciousness can affect water so deeply, that means that our consciousness is able to cause health or sickness to our own bodies and to the universe around us as well.That is a quiet powerful find, because as humans if there is one thing we own it is our consciousness; and if our consciousness is that powerfully connected to our world we are that much more powerful. It also puts the responsibility of our own lives and that of our natural surroundings right on our laps.I loved this book, and it was an eye opener for me and it raised my awareness to how devastating and harmful to me and to my world my thoughts, feelings, emotions, and spoken words can be; if they are negative. It also made me more aware of what I expose myself to, such as movies, music, pictures, news, friends, etc.., and thus more selective."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"I think the ideas outlined in the book are intriguing; that thought can change the organization of water. The experiments done in this book are not scientifically correct in method, and as a result it is highly likely that his ideas are not completely true. Without question more work needs to be done to determine whether his conclusions are valid. However, I still think there is a greater truth to what he is saying. Even if we can't affect water, our thoughts and intentions can certainly affect ourselves, other people, and other living things. Whether we can affect water or not, we can still heal ourselves and those around us though using a constructive attitude.I would not recommend buying this book unless the ideas are validated by further research. I would recommend other books instead that cultivate a positive attitude."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"This book has helped me tremendously in one especially practical way: in teaching my children how physically their bodies are impacted when they choose to think and speak with love and gratitude and when they choose to think and speak from a disempowered position.These photographs from Dr. Emoto made it very real to them - finally they \\"got\\" what Mommy has been saying for all this time!(We mothers sometimes need validation, don't we?!)The words in this book are simple, elegant and helpful companions to the phenomenal pictures which show us how water molecules change in response to the energy and intention of the language we use. It gives us a physical signpost to point towards.Not everyone will believe this approach - and for them, well? I am sorry.For me? I am grateful for the affirmation. This book is gloriously vivid and helpful in shifting energy towards what is good and right and pure. That is more than enough for me."},{"Title":"The Hidden Messages in Water","review":"The research Masaru Emoto has put into this book clearly demonstrates the positive and negative effects that our thoughts, feelings, and environmental conditions have on water.

Yes, Emoto does show how energy does have a great deal more of an effect on us than may be readily apparent. It is also important to note that \\"miracles\\" of people that have been placed in prayer groups, only to be \\"miraculously healed\\" from the energy of positive prayer, that left many doctors shaking their heads, is hopefully another area where science and spiritual energy can bridge, rather than broaden the divide.

Is it any wonder that the first thing space probes look for is evidence of water because water is the conduit oflife-supporting information? This gives a new meaning to how does the observer affect the observed.The book isn't preachy and I found it rather soothing to read.

This book showed how brave Sacagawea really was. She never once panicked when the boat tipped over. She was calm and quiet. Seaman, one of the main characters, was a wonderful, intelligent animal. What I liked about this book was that I really enjoyed reading it. It made me understand the Lewis and Clark expedition a lot better, and I loved how they included Seaman along in their journey. Seaman was a really smart dog and he cheered the explorers up whenever they were sad and homesick. This book was also based on true events. What I didn't like about this book was how at the end, Seaman didn't stay with Merriwether Lewis. He stayed with John Colter and continued to explore the West. I wish I knew what happened to Seaman.

Besides Seaman, my favorite character would have to be the ever cheerful George Shannon. Next would have to be John Colter. He showed his bravery at the right times, and he as was calm and levelheaded as Shannon in most emergencies. Then come Sacagawea, the only girl on the expedition. She turned out to be one of the most important women in history because she was so peaceful and quiet on the outside, yet was energetic and playful on the inside.

Sacagawea and York, a slave owned by Clark, are shown in their pivotal contributions (often ignored) to the expedition. My only criticism revolves around the portrayal of the various Native American groups encountered by Lewis &amp; Clark. Because she has drawn on the diaries and their viewpoint, various tribes are depicted as either &quot;noble savages&quot; or &quot;thieving Indians&quot; and deeper cultural issues are not explored as to the traditions of these varied groups.

Seaman, a 150-pound Newfoundland dog, is introduced to young historians. Seaman travels the long journey with the Corps, serving a key role in the expedition's success, catching and retrieving game, and protecting the expedition team from wild animals and hostile Indians.

OMG they are traveling west, wow, do I give a ****. Plus just because your american and the story is american doesn't make it great you mother*******. **** you. Hope the book rots in hell."},{"Title":"The Dum Dum Bullet: Adventure of a Corporate Soldier","review":"Sandeep has written a very enjoyable read. Biographies generally tend to be self congratulatory. This book strikes a balance where the author is generous in spreading encomiums among his team members. The name dropping is subtle. The job hopping and account snatching done by the author was made to look justified.The only slip in the book is that there are no deep dives in to failures. I read this book almost at one go, I am sure you will too, if you a corporate warrior."},{"Title":"The Rosette Habit","review":"I have to admit, I was surprised at first by Jim Accardi's newest novel, The Rosette Habit. I read Saigon Landing last year and thought this would be another law thriller. Surprise, surprise. It took me a few chapters to get used to it (Accardi keeps changing points of view), but in the end it blew me away! Caution: better have a box of hankies ready for the last few chapters! All in all, an excellent novel!"},{"Title":"The Rosette Habit","review":"Ryan Meagher is led on a spiritual journey while his body lies in a coma, struggling to survive. His spiritual leader, &quot;Quisait&quot; helps him understand how even the most blessed lives can be wasted by self-indulgence, pride and stupidity. A thoughtful, exceptionally well-written book about simultaneously looking forward and looking back at the purpose and meaning of life and the lessons to be learned before it's too late. Life is about more than just &quot;surviving&quot; the rocky, cold climate of our existence."},{"Title":"The Rosette Habit","review":"Jim Accardi has a flowing prose style that makes this book an easy read, even though the material is thought provoking. This is the story of Ryan Meagher, an attorney who suffers a serious head injury in a car accident. While Ryan's body lies in an Intensive Care Unit, his spirit is taken to another realm--a matrix. Inside this matrix, Ryan encounters \\"Quisait\\", his spirit guide and conscience through life. Quisait assists Ryan in a review of selected moments from his life, moments Ryan would rather forget. Disbarred from law practice and addicted to drugs, Ryan struggled to hold things together and succeded only in alienating everyone, including his wife and son. By facing his shortcomings and suffering the journey through his past, Ryan hopes he will be allowed to return to his family and hislife. Jim Accardi takes us through the metaphysical realm and back to reality with a fascinating look into possiblities outside our own physical world. Rosette Habit explores wonderful spiritual mysteries and makes me wonder what lies on the other side.........."},{"Title":"Houses on Country Roads: Essays on the Places, Seasons, and Peoples of the Four Corners Country","review":"Here is a collection of essays written as a column for the Durango Harold newspaper from 1985 to 1995 by an archeologist, newspaper editor, mayor and fifth generation Coloradoan. Part almanac and part personal reflection, this book is a collection of sparkling, poetic nature writing that will cleanse and refresh the city-weary soul. Each essay carefully illuminates this segment of the western landscape for those who may think they already know it and for those who don't know it at all. The descriptions alone are so precise and accurate that Thompson could be writing of only one place in the world. At the same time, Thompson's choice of words and the way he skillfully uses language to draw meaning and signifcance from his surroundings is at once wise, prophetic, disturbing and comforting. This a book that provides inspiration over that first cup of coffee in the morning. It is also a book that provides rest and assurance that somewhere the world is still beautiful even after a long, difficult day at work."},{"Title":"What Is Rhetorical Theology?: Textual Practice and Public Discourse","review":"A short work that is not to be taken lightly.

I teach veterinary anatomy at Colorado State University, and I advise my students that anyone planning to include dogs in their practice should own this text. Beyond the tremendous scope and excellent supportive illustrations, two things distinguish this book. One is Dr. Evans' meticulous adherence to anatomical nomenclature as dictated by the latest edition of the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (the international set of \\"rules\\" governing anatomical naming). Students can feel assured that the name given in the text (both in Latin and in English, in most cases) is the most correct for the structure. The second truly outstanding feature is the abundant footnoting, which is supported by an encyclopedic bibliography. Dr. Evans cites hundreds of original anatomical publications as he describes the common variations that have been described and presents relevant opinions about disputed functions or constructs. The bibliography is especially useful for anyone intending to use this book to aid their teaching or research. This book belongs on the shelf of all veterinarians and veterinary students with an interest in canine medicine and surgery."},{"Title":"Miller's Anatomy of the Dog, 3e","review":"You will either love this book or hate it. I loved it mainly for the pictures, which it has a ton of. They are well labeled and there are usually several different views. I found them very, very helpful in identifying structures in anatomy lab. Our professor even required us to have at least one copy at every dissection table every day!Most of the pictures are hand drawn in black &amp; white (sometimes with red arteries, blue veins, and yellow nerves). They are some of the best anatomy drawings I have seen and are not too difficult for me to visualize three-dimensionally. There is also a section on bones and the skull in the beginning of the book that includes radiographs.I think the reason some people use this book only as a doorstop is because the text can be overwhelmingly detailed. Additionally, its large size (1113 pages) makes it very heavy to carry around. There is a much smaller book with pictures out of Miller's, the Guide to the Dissection of the Dog, which has many fewer pictures and was therefore not my book of choice.I would highly recommend Miller's Anatomy of the Dog to every beginning veterinary student, unless you are pretty sure you don't want to carry around such a heavy book. Use it for the pictures rather than the text and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Miller's Anatomy of the Dog, 3e","review":"I initially didn't like this book because I was intimidated by it. Quite frankly, it has A LOT of information. I was required to buy this book as a 1st year vet student taking anatomy and grew to really enjoy this book. I will say that is very tedious to read straight-through, but for reference, it is unbeatable. Every student and clinician should have a copy. The pictures are wonderful and the color-coding of the vessels and nerves make the structures very easy to visualize. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Miller's Anatomy of the Dog, 3e","review":"I found Miller's guide to be very helpful. It provides thorough explanations of anatomical structures, as well as wonderful diagrams/drawings that serve as a helpful guide in dissection lab. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to fine tune their knowledge of dog anatomy."},{"Title":"Miller's Anatomy of the Dog, 3e","review":"This book is a comprehensive guide to canine anatomy for the veterinary student. It contains excellent illustrations and written descriptions of the location and anatomical significance of the bones, muscles, nerves and vessels. Although very detailed, the layout is logical and easy to use, with a nice balance of illustrations, radiographs and written descriptions. It also describes the embryological derivation for different tissues and overall, perfectly complements anatomy lectures and practicals. It has been very helpful for the locomotor apparatus and cranial anatomy. The detail contained within this book make it ideal for any student planning a career in small animal practice."},{"Title":"Miller's Anatomy of the Dog, 3e","review":"The pictures are great, however they can lull you into a false sense of security come prac exams.

The illustrations are awesome (many of them are also in the dissection guide) and it is very thorough. Basically, any anatomical feature you want to read about is covered in great detail. And it's written in a way that makes sense. The section on the head and the cranial nerves was very helpful for the head exam. Plus, as I've found, the professors draw a lot of their test questions from this text. I would recommend this book for any first-year vet student. And, it will serve you throughout your career if you go into small animal medicine, or even a horse vet that does cat spays on the side."},{"Title":"Miller's Anatomy of the Dog, 3e","review":"I used this book as a first year veterinary student. I found the suggested text for my class (Dyce) to be useless. While it isn't logical to think you will sit down and read this book through at a thousand and some pages, it makes a great reference to read on a particular topic and fill in questions you have. I found it very helpful to clarify points my professor breezed over but would surely be on the test. Contains hundreds of detailed pictures and way more info than the dissection guide in a concise easy to read format. I look forward to always having this book as a reference to come back to."},{"Title":"Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)","review":"There are mainly two reasons why Montequieu's book is important. One is for his ideas, which still have relevance for current political issues, such as separation of church and state. The second is that it represents an important historical milestone in political thought. The real bonus is that, in the translation, his work reads in a way that is both intellectually engaging, by which I mean he gets you thinking about the issues, and also engaging (if entertaining is not quite the right word) as a series of philosophical perspectives delivered in a direct way generally free of jargon.The most interesting part of his book for me was at the outset, in his comparison of despotism, republics and democracy.The really important aspect of his book is that so many of the threshold policitical issues that he discusses are still live issues. How much should the state intervene? What constitutes good laws? What parts of life in a political society are the business of the state?"},{"Title":"Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)","review":"an understanding of Montesquieu is critical for today's emerging democracies, in that he was one of the first to recognize the importance of securing the liberty of the governed with the aid of reason, such as by constitutional design and by the rule of law.

Every member of congress should read it and take it to heart. It appears that the majority of our founding fathers did read it and take it very seriously. It is something that all Americans who are interested in our government should consider reading. It is amazingly quite easy to read though, I would suggest having a good dictionary handy while reading it. Some of our members of congress I just do not believe would understand, even if someone was reading the dictionary for them.

The second most cited source, with 8.3% of quotes, are from Charles Montesquieu.Why are the greatest works ever written not studied in public schools?

The Spirit of the Laws exercises the mind instead of entertains the mind which is what true education is all about.Our Founding Fathers felt the Bible was a book worth more than all other books ever printed.

But it is only that: a statement. It is not a defence. Montesquieu rails against despotism and carefully spells out the separation of government powers. But, unlike Locke or Mill, he gives little argument for why liberalism should be accepted. And those few sketchy comments he does give (e.g. despotism is bad even for the despot) are unconvincing."},{"Title":"Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)","review":"This is a book that could (should?) have faded into history without being a great loss to the world. Yes, there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy, but they're far and few between, and mainly either just thrown out as Montesquieu's personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination, or flimsily based on historical examples. As a reader, I didn't find most of his arguments (where he didn't seem to be contradicting himself, which happens frequently) very convincing. This was obviously written with the 18th century French salon crowd in mind, and reads as such. I'm sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time, but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history.He claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal; well, I did read the whole book and at the end couldn't see an overarching structure at all. The work just seemed like a long, rambling, unorganized mess. The only people I might really recommend this to are people interested in Greek, Roman, and French history (especially legal history), but not to people interested in political science or philosophy.Bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought, there are much more interesting reads out there."},{"Title":"The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on Western literature","review":"In writing reviews I adhere to the policy that five stars should be given only to books that profoundly alter your perspective. In that sense, this book deserves to be spangled liberally with a good sized constellation.Ever wanted an approachable and informative guide to Western Literature? Have you ever tackled some purported classic that left you wondering why those damn nymphs and fauns keep proliferating? Your quest has ended: this book is the Baedeker of Western European Literature that all you literature addicts have been looking for.First of all, the author is dazzlingly erudite; he is apparently at home in Greek, Latin, English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian at least. Its primary purpose is to show the hidden scaffolding of Greco-Roman classics in Western literature, age by country, by selecting a choice group of writers with his personal preferences attached. The result is remarkably readable, never ostentatious, and his thesis rarely imposes strain on belief because the proof is always at hand. Thus the reader learns the overtones of classics in Shakespeare, or is made to see the hidden Doric column in Byron's passions fairly concretely.But in my opinion, this book is truly excellent (1) for the list of influential writers in all ages that he had himself hand selected (I've never heard of Abraham a Santa Clara and now I'm itching for a translation), and most importantly, (2) because it gives the necessary cultural backdrop that anchors a given author to an era with all its advantages and limitations. For example, the book gives a reason why the Augustan poets (Dryden, Pope and friends) were driven to mincing affectations (partly a reaction to the Renaissance, partly a particularly Baroque censorship of vulgar words that comes from a misunderstanding of the classics. Highet provides some choice sample of Juvenal's trenchant and vulgar satires as a counterexample).Of course, all books must have some faults. First, this book is very anglophillic; when works of two nations are compared, the British are crowned with the laurel with somewhat suspicious frequency. Whether this represents the truth is far beyond my capacity, only I submit that if I were a Frenchman, I would contest some of the outcomes. Second, his preference is certainly open to criticism. I may be alone in this, but I never found a single page of Gibbon's magnum opus soporific. I don't agree with his encomiastic treatment of Byron, either. I thought Coleridge was ushered off the stage too speedily. And sometimes you do get the feeling that an author with extensive classical training is definitely favored in the eye of a very classicist author.The nettlesome issue of a hierarchy in writers is bound to cause some clashes with readers' opinions. But no matter: I am very certain that this book will still provide an addictively informative read to anyone with an interest in reading a sweeping survey of European literature. This book is a MUST READ for amateur/professional literati, world literature bookworms (me), and ...... especially the classicists. Because the book's final and most salutary influence is that it reintroduces the Greco-Roman classics to our age where the classics field is increasingly untilled. If the very fact that a millenium of writers have turned - whether coerced by social convention or not - continuously to the Greco-Roman classics does not convince us, after rading this book one can't help but wonder whether, beyond the frigid marmoreal busts that say nothing and the wild raging toga party orgies, the ancients really have something very urgent to say to the present, or that they say it better than any of us alive."},{"Title":"The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on Western literature","review":"It is difficult to believe that one person can so eloquently present the influences of Greek and Roman literature on Western European literature with such care and enthusiasm, given that the scope of the work covers almost 2,000 years. Gilbert Highet is a true scholar and this volume is an inspiration to any reader who wishes to understand what Greek and Roman literature has meant to civilization."},{"Title":"The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on Western literature","review":"I had the good fortune to read The Classical Tradition right after finishing Werner Jaeger's \\"Paideia\\" and the two works make an incredibly compelling case for the importance of classical study. Highet does take you on a tour of Western Lit with Greek and Latin authors close by. I learned about The Battle of the Books, the baroque era's rather slavish following of Aristotle's theories and met a whole bunch of authors I had never known (I am also waiting for those Abraham a Santa Clara translations to see if he is as entertaining as Highet makes him out to be)I've read a lot of Highet's books and can tell you there are no duds. I am reading Poets in a Landscape right now and it is hard to put down. Also, check out the surveys of Greek and Latin Literature written by his colleague at Columbia, Moses Hadas."},{"Title":"The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on Western literature","review":"Excellent source for an introduction to the beginnings of Western Literature.

He captures what can often be an awkward time of soul searching with above average prose and understanding.The author has done young readers a great service by treating them intelligently and providing them with this positive and thoughtful book.\\"The Green\\" concludes with a series of thoughtful reading comprehention questions and essay ideas, a great asset to parents, teachers, and readers alike.

This book touches the heart strings of kids (younger and older than junior high) and adults alike.The guided questions lend itself to being in school libraries and classrooms. By discussion, readers can clarify their beliefs in a fun and interesting manner.

Boring, environmentally destructive, expensive, the list goes on. But after reading 'the green,' I've found myself wanting to get out for a round or two on the links.It is the characters that make this book great. Our protagonist, Jason is every bit as smart, thoughtful, funny, and vulnerable as all of us can be in our pre-teen years. And through his eyes, we make an amazing transition in this book.Eugene, the geeky golf nut, is good for more than a few laughs and has some insights as well.

Only about a third of it was finished, but what is here is still well worth reading if you are a Hornblower fan. Like &#34;Flying Colours&#34; most of this novel would have taken place on land behind enemy lines, and like Flying Colours it would have been one of the best in the series. Too bad that Forester did not live to finish it.The Back Bay paperback edition comes with two very brief short stories, one set when he was on the Renown and the other set in 1848, after he had retired. They are both good."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"I REALLY enjoy the Hornblower books.Having said that, the transfer to e-book format is VERY POOR. It looks as though it was just scanned to a text editor such as Word, which automatically changed all the apostrophes at the beginnings of words to single open quote marks. For example, the British dialect which drops initial 'h's is presented with single open quote marks, which curl down from the left and to the right, instead of apostrophes, which curl the opposite way.Either the spell checker does not recognize the word 'borne' or the proofer doesn't. They were all changed to 'born'. It also appears that the proofer or spell checker is not familiar with the verb 'kedging', which refers to a method of moving a ship by means of a light anchor. The word 'hedging' is substituted.These Hornblower books were also not properly formatted for the different page preferences in the Kindle app for Android. Although you can set it for black page with white letters, the only thing that actually shows on the black background is the title of the book. For some reason, though, it works correctly for the Kindle app in WebOS on the HP TouchPad.These and other poorly transferred instances are why I cannot give this digital edition, as well as others by eNet Press, five stars."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"It was a good story, or rather the start of a good story, but the are many inconsistencies with rest of the series, in both story and tone.

This incomplete book should never have been published. It does not really add to the Hornblower saga. Instead, it detracts. The story is unfinished. The written part is in need of editing. I think Forester could have done much more if he did not die first."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"This last story by Forester, in 1966, is as gripping and realistic of all his other tales. The addition of the two short stories doesn't lessen the gripping tale of this classic of the sea."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"The main story in this book had all the markings of being rollicking good fun. Unfortunately, due to the author's death, it ends just before Hornblower leaves on a spy mission. How wonderful that would have been to read. So the main story is missing the second half. For a Hornblower fan, it's probably still worth having this bit of a spot filling betweenHornblower and the \\"Hotspur\\" (Hornblower Series)andHornblower and the Atropos (Hornblower Saga), but it is somewhat unsatisfying nonetheless.Also, included are two short stories, one taking place during Hornblower's days as a lieutenant on the Renown and one in his later days as an admiral. The first story showed Hornblower solving a somewhat interesting puzzle, but it really wasn't that outstanding a story on its own. I had no need to see it, especially in this book taking place much later in Hornblower's life. It probably would have been better placed at the end ofLieutenant Hornblower (Hornblower Saga)with an explanatory note. The later story was also a somewhat interesting puzzle of its own, but again not that outstanding by itself and would have been better injected at the end of a later book. They are both more like brainstormed ideas that should have been included in a larger book.Overall, this book is worth reading for the fan because of how it fills in a place in the series. However, it's not that great as a stand-alone, and the main story ends just as it's getting good."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"I greatly enjoyed all of C.S. Forester's Hornblower novels. This particular volume adds an unfinished novel and two short stories to the Hornblower saga. As a stand alone read I wouldn't necessarily recommend it (ergo the four star review). But as additional material to fill out the Horatio Hornblower story I found this book to be equally enjoyable as the complete novels."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Forester sets the scene for a Hornblower story with a difference - here Forester brings to our attention the intriguing shadowlands where, even in an era where appearances and honour trumped realpolitik, there was considerable covert activity to manipulate and distort the enemy's perceptions of reality.It would have been fascinating to see how the author had his central character, with his narrow, circumscribed upbringing and professional development, cope with a journey into these shadows.I set about trying to find whether any credible efforts had been made by others to complete the book, and had little success seaching the www, until a chance remark came up with paydirt. A Scottish historian, R W Smith (Bob) has written a creditable ending, published by the C S Forester Society. He demonstrates a deep understanding of how challenged and unsettled a character like Horatio H might have become when required to sustain behaviours and actions which were dishonest or dishonourable. This isn't the place to review this other work, which goes considerably further than I have already suggested, but I do commend it to your attention."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"There is not one false note anywhere. We encounters some of the finest characters: Commander Meadows who replaces Hornblower as captain of the Hotspur; Captain Baddlestone of the water hoy; Mr. Marsden, Secretary to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty; Mr. Barrow, the Second Secretary, 'his name nearly as well known as Marsden's'; and last but not least, the Rev. Claudius, Doctor of Divinity, my favourite.The scene that takes place in the elegant room in the Admiralty overlooking the Horse Guards parade grounds is scripted like a play. The dialogue is superb and Forester even provided stage instructions in the form of thunderclaps from a summer afternoon's downpour. Hornblower, under scrutiny from the two cynical secretaries, learns to keep his mouth shut at the critical moment and finally gains entry to post rank."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Hornblower During the Crisis (1967), also known as Hornblower and the Crisis, is the last Hornblower novel C. S. Forester worked on - he died before he finished it. It fits fourth in the chronology. The book also includes two short stories, \\"Hornblower's Temptation\\" (also known as \\"Hornblower and the Widow McCool,\\" and \\"The Last Encounter.\\"In Hornblower During the Crisis, Horatio Hornblower, promoted to captain before the age of thirty, is relieved of command of Hotspur and sent back to England. But almost immediately, Hotspur's new captain sinks the ship. Hornblower is called upon to testify at his court martial, after which all the officers travel back to England on a water ship. They encounter a French brigantine, and Hornblower recovers important French documents. He works with the Secretary of the Navy to craft a plan to deliver forged orders to Villeneuve, the French admiral.In \\"Hornblower's Temptation,\\" Lieutenant Hornblower, serving on the Renown under Captain Sawyer, is responsible for arranging the execution of a deserter, an Irish revolutionary. In \\"The Last Encounter,\\" Hornblower, now 72, wealthy, retired and still as self-loathing as ever, is visited by a man claiming to be Napoleon Bonaparte, who insists he needs Hornblower's help to get to Paris immediately. Both stories are entertaining enough, although the chest gimmickry in \\"Hornblower's Temptation\\" is a bit much. \\"The Last Encounter\\" is noteworthy because it is Forester's final Hornblower chapter.There are 130-150 pages of Hornblower During the Crisis, depending on how the publisher formats it, which comprises half the novel or less. Where there narrative concludes, there is a one-page summary compiled from Forester's notes. Nothing unexpected happens - Hornblower has a crisis of conscience, his sense of duty prevails, as always, and his mission is a wonderful success, culminating in the Battle of Trafalgar.There is certainly a lot of potential in Forester's storyline, but all the reader gets is setup. Hornblower in the shady business of espionage is the perfect opportunity for him to wallow in a moral crisis, and Forester was clearly building toward the drama of the constant threat of hideous death for spies, but unfortunately, we never get that far.Forester once again dangles Hornblower's promotion in front of him, threatening to take it away before it's been confirmed. But Forester has gone to that well already. It doesn't generate any suspense, and it just feels tawdry on Forester's part.Hornblower During the Crisis is for Hornblower completists - it adds nothing significant to Hornblower's overall story arc. It has its moments, but it can easily be skipped."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Forester departed this earth in the middle of writing this story. Even so, this is a very good book. All the normal details that you have come to expect are there. Hornblower not quite trusting himself or his decisions, a stickler for rules and regulations, intense clashes of arms with the hated Frenchies...This story is mostly about how Hornblower hands of the Hotspur and heads for the Admiralty to acquire a new ship. His previous admiral, Cornwallis has named him as was the custom when an admiral retires. So, Hornblower is expecting to be made post and gain command of a ship.After leaving the Hotspur, he is being conveyed to England on a watering ship. Along the way, Hornblower is involved in the courts martial of the captain that recently took command of the Hotspur. Apparently, through some blunder in navigation, the Hotspur was lost. The captain and officers are being sent back to England for further orders. They find themselves in the company of Hornblower once again.Along the way, they are briefly chase by a French brig. Hornblower and company contrive to capture the French ship by ruse. They succeed, only to lose the ship soon after to the much larger brig crew that is battened down below. Upon retreating from the ship, Hornblower snatches up the ship spapers and orders.With these papers in hand, he proceeds to Whitehall. His capture of the documents leads to what the rest of the story was actually going to be about. Hornblower will be the leader of a small group of men with the sole purpose of delivering a carefully worded forgery to the French admiral in the hopes that he will quit his santuary and proceed to sea. The orders will direct him to a supposed meeting place with another French fleet. This is where the English line of battle ships will be waiting to pounce.The story never gets that far, but one can only imagine what it would have been like. Hornblower would have been in the thick of things. Probably in command of a small frigate.The other two short stories included with this reading are both interesting. Nothing special, but worth the time it takes to read them. The first is about Hornblower soon after receiving his leutenancy. The second is well into his life. Probably in retirement in the year 1848.This is a very good book. If you are into Hornblower, this is for you."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"While it is nice to see more of Forester's storyline in writing, I could have done without this book. The beginning does take off where &quot;Hotspur&quot; left off, but it was very aggrivating when the story concluded with brief notes about how the author intended the ending to be The short stories in the end appeared to just be thrown in for the sake of filling up pages. I would have liked it better had the book been seperate from the rest of the series. I am baffled why the publisher would make this the fourth book when it contains a short story that takes place when Hornblower is already and Admiral. If you bu the book, just read the first short story that starts after Hornblower leave Hotspur and save the rest for later."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"If you're reading Hornblower through for the first time and have grown to love the experience, this final piece of the story is a big downer. Not because of the story, just because it was obviously on Cecil's plate when he died and it looked like he had a ways to go before he was done.I guess the good news is there have been no attempts to write more Hornblower books by no-talent hacks.Someone once told me they cried a little the first time they finished the Lord of the Rings because they knew they would never read it again for the first time. That guy was an idiot, but I sort of know how he feels after reading Hornblower During the Crisis."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"It's hard to write a review of a Horatio Hornblower book that is less than superlative. But I must in this case.Hornblower during the Crisis is probably only of interest to Hornblower fanatics. It is the incomplete (and unedited) beginning of a story Forester was writing when he died -- matched up with two short stories about Hornblower.None of these stories are very good. I'll avoid revealing plot details as all three hinge on unlikely and rather obvious plot twists. The main story, which tells of the events between Hornblower leaving the Hotspur and the Battle of Trafalgar, drags a bit and stops right when it was going to get interesting. The next tells of an event in Horatio's early history -- an unpleasant one that seems to contradict his character. The last is an encounter near the end of his career and is rather amusing but not exciting in the least.Again, this book might be worth buying if you are interested in completing a collection (although, even then, the price is ridiculous). But casual readers should steer a course to the other ten novels."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"What one has to keep in mind while reading Hornblower novels is that they were not written in order. I think the first one was lt. Hornblower. If you keep this in mind and overlook certain inconsitencies in the plot, all of his novels gives you a very good read. He also wrote an account of his travels in South America , that unfortunatly i only read once ( in the public library i Southampton, UK in the late sixties) I wish sombody would republish it as it gives a very good insight in the time and frame of mind of C.S Forrester when he wrote these books. One can certenly see connection to Webers Honor Harrington series. (HH+HH = true). If you like one you will certainly like the other... Fred"},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Hornblower During the Crisis is apparently a couple of pieces of left over script that Forester hadn't finished when he died, and was later published. The first half deals with Hornblower's trip home to England as a passenger on a water hoy (a supply ship that brings water to ships of the line). The water how is such a dog that after several days of beating back and forth they are still where they began. When they finally do get a fair wind they are chased by a larger French brig and only by some of Hornblower's usual trickery and bravado do they turn the tables and escape. The battle is a little too unbelievable for me; it relies too much no surprise and a sleeping French crew, which I found beyond the realm of possible. Nevertheless our hero returns safely to England.The second part of the book is another short story about how Hornblower was assigned to be some kind of spy in Spain to deliver fake messages ordering the Spanish fleet out to sea. It's more plausible, but a short story.Despite its shortcomings, the detail of ships and sailing in the early 19th century make the Hornblower series must reading for any man who loves the sea."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"I always worry that the final, unfinished, work of a great author will be a disappointment. This one is not. The first part shows how the author worked, completing a final chapter before moving on, unlike many authors. So the pieces we get are complete and satisfying.But most importantly, in my mind, is the wonderful last chapter. This is how a series should end. After reading all but one of the series, I care about the characters. I want to know how they ended up. Call me a softy, but I wanted Horatio and Lady Barbara to \\"live happily ever after\\". Forester gives considerable space to Horatio's thoughts about his happiness in \\"The Last Encounter\\" and does it in keeping with his established Hornblower series style. I am grateful that Forester left us with this final story of Hornblower."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Volumes I through XII get the same top notch review. I'm a retired Navy man who likes a good &#34;sea story.&#34; Weave these stories into the history of the British Navy during the Napoleanic Era and the books become that much better. C. S. Forester is every bit as good a story teller as his reputation states.I could not find 3 of the volumes on Kindle. I had to buy paperback."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"This unfinished book takes place immediately after the conclusion of \\"Hornblower and the Hotspur\\" right after Hornblower received his promotion to post-captain. As usual the story was interesting and showed what an interesting character that he is. Unfortunately, the book is very incomplete due to the author's death. The author did write a paragraph explaining how the book would end; it would have been great reading I'm sure.This book also contained two short stories. The first is called \\"Hornblower's Temptation\\" and it occurs prior to the time he meets Lt. Bush and involves an interesting experience with a traitor. The second short story is called \\"The Last Encounter\\" and takes place when Hornblower is an admiral toward the end of his career and explains an encounter with an interesting individual.This book is recommended for Hornblower fans that have been through the first three books. It is not to be read independently since it really is an incomplete novel."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"C.S.

CS Foresters was unable to complete this book, but there are a few author notes about how the book would end and two interesting short stories at the end of of the 100 pages of 'Hornblower During the Crisis'. I would recommend reading the first short story after 'Mr. Midshipman', and the last short story after you completed the 11 book series.Of course the writing, and continued story line of Horatio Hornblower is superb even with it being a partial book and story. But, I was not particularly happy that this partiallly completed book of 100 pages cost the same as any other book in the series. I give the rating of 2 stars only due to this fact.Otherwise, I will still continue to look forward to reading the next in the series. I am very much addicted to the story line!"},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"I have read the first, numbered half of the Hornblower Saga (from &quot;Midshipman&quot; up to &quot;Beat to Quarters&quot;), and I very much enjoy the series. I like Hornblower's ability to meticulously plan, the human way in which he is so self-critical (something all people probably can relate to), and his ability to unerringly know the right moment to take a risk in order to enhance the fruits of his careful planning.However, I was reluctant to pay full price for something that was, essentially, half a novel. And so it was with mixed feelings that I purchased &quot;Hornblower During The Crisis.&quot;I was pleasantly surprised.I just finished reading the book, and I can say that I did not feel at all cheated out of my money.It would have been pleasant to have actually read the rest of the story, instead of reading a synopsis that describes its ending, but all the elements from the other Hornblower books are here: and, ultimately, it did not leave me with the feeling that I'd read an incomplete thing.If other Amazon shoppers are considering buying this book, but have the same concerns I had, I feel comfortable in telling them that they probably won't regret the purchase."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"&quot;During the Crisis&quot; features three novellas by C.S. Forester. The first, best and the only incomplete novella is the first which occurs after &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;. The second occurs sometime after Mr. Midshipman and Lieutenant Hornblower. The third, I think (I have not completed the entire series yet) should be one of the last things read about HH. I don't know how Forester intended on introducing these three well written, but very chronologically disjointed pieces into the life of HH, but it would seem that his estate put together his remaining notes about HH and published it under the title &quot;During the Crisis&quot;. My suggestion to anyone who is reading the Hornblower series for the first time is to pick this book up and read the sections after you have read the books in the order I have mentioned them. Reading this before I read Lieutenant Hornblower would have been enlightening."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"I am just reading the Hornblower series for the first time and reading them in the publishers order.

The story was fairly interesting. Not as good as the others in the series. But If you are to read the whole series you shouldn't be too cheap to spend the extra cash on 1 book of a series. I think it would be foolish to hold out on 1 book of a series to &quot;not get your moneys worth of 100 or so pages.&quot; My advise, JUST READ IT!"},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"This is the next Hornblower chronologically, it was not the next one written.

The basis of the story is quite compelling. If it was finished, it would be a great link in the Hornblower chain of books. However, it was a dissapointment to have to guess on how the story would twist and turn leading to the battle of Trafalgar. At the least, I believe that the publisher should discount the price on this volume. However, avid followers of Hornblower must read this to follow along Hornblower's life."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"like most of the reviews the book is unfinished, which I thought was unfortunate. i really love reading about HH. i find his thoughts and thought process intriguing and his outlook on others who are involved in his life. CS Forester really gives you a feel for this charactor and puts you in his mind.&quot;Hornblower During the Crisis&quot; is only 117 pages. i enjoyed it and have read all of the novels up threw &quot;Crisis&quot;. im reading in chronological order. so i was dissapointed for it to end so quick. it is your typical HH novel, he starts out sailing and then the frogs show up, HH comes up with an idea and ofcoures it works out for the better. ends up in england with some important papers from boney. he gets promoted to captain only if he goes on a spy mission he came up with, that is where the book ends. a shame, i really wanted to see HH as a spy.&quot;Hornblowers Temptation&quot; - is the first short story. it comes after &quot;Midshipmen Hornblower&quot; although one review said it came after &quot;Lieutentant Hornblower&quot;, the reason is because Mr.Bush is not on board and captian sawyer is still alive. good short story, i agree with some reviews that the character is not like the HH we know. he does things for his own conscious , and not for king, for county. also this mentions that they have gone to the west indies, but in &quot;Lieutentaunt HH&quot;, he remarks to Bush how he has never seen some sort of fish which are only in the west indies. good short story, if u like HH series then you will like this, although we are not use to this softer side of Horry.&quot;The Last Encounter&quot; - this makes no sense with the HH books. his wifes is named Barbara, who he loves and can't keep his eyes off of, his only child is named Richard and he likes wine or &quot;port&quot; as they call it. never the less is was an ok read. i think forester wrote this just for fun. the story is about a man who comes to the door and says he someone famous and dead. HH is like whatever, but helps him anyway. not bad, i didn't really like it because it didn't hold true to Maria and his 2 kids.this is a decent book, i wish it was finished, it really leaves you dangling. the only regret is the price $15, which are the prices for completed books. we should pay half this since we are getting half a story."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Sometimes, I almost wish people wouldn't dig up unfinished pieces. Not because they may be bad, but because they may be so good that it's frustrating and disappointing to have reached the end and realize there's no way it will ever be finished. This is the case with Forester's &quot;Hornblower and the Crisis&quot;, unfinished at the time of his death.Forester had deliberately shied away from writing about Hornblower's role in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar because he didn't want to deal with such a famous battle nor take away from the real heroes of the day - as such, Hornblower's exploits jump from Commander to him being given the command of Nelson's funeral boat after the battle. However, Forester finally decided to reveal the crucial part our hero played in the months leading up to the climatic sea battle of the Napoleonic Wars.From the first chapter it's obvious Forester had not lost his touch. The prose flows cleanly and elegantly, and I was soon lost in a tale of Hornblower in his prime. A secret mission is handed him, to misdirect the French, so Hornblower prepares to play spy - but then the book ends, with only a few brief notes to say how the story ends. Somehow, this isn't enough - we know Hornblower will emerge victorious and history told us Trafalgar would be a triumph, but I still wish we could have had Forester tell us these things in his own inimitable style.Two more short tales are packaged with the unifinished novel, as a consolation prize of sorts. These are also top notch, but don't quite take away from the disappointment of what might have been."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"The Horatio Hornblower series by C.S. Forester is simply the best naval adventure writing in all of literature. The Hornblower series deals with the career of a fictional British naval officer, Horatio Hornblower, during the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain is engaged in a life-or-death struggle with Bonaparte. The various novels and short stories which comprise the series essentially trace Hornblower's rise from humble midshipman to Admiral of the Fleet.\\"Hornblower During the Crisis\\" is a group of short stories that Forester apparently wrote to fill gaps in Hornblower's life in between the major novels which make up the series. While the novels are in chronological order, there are gaps between several of them. This book completes the most important of these, and also has some interesting little snippets about Hornblower in his old age.The most important story in \\"Crisis\\" deals with the period of time immediately after Hornblower is promoted from Commander to Captain (although not confirmed yet by the Admiralty) and he leaves the HMS Hotspur, which is too small of a command for a Captain. I found this story to be a penetrating and interesting one, which highlights the importance of good luck, and the willingness to take advantage of it by taking risks. As the story states, Hornblower realized, in dealing with high British political and military figures upon returning to England, that his whole life and career perhaps turned on a few remarks he made over the space of a few minutes. Who among us has not had at least one such pivotal moment?... The other stories in the book are all interesting and worth reading. The Hornblower afficianado should not pass this book up. Newcomers to Hornblower will probably not want to \\"break in\\" with Crisis, although I think any reader will appreciate these well-written stories."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"This novel picks up with Hornblower relinquishing command of the Hotspur and returning to London for a new command. As typical in a Forester novel, nothing ever goes as planned and action follows Hornblower on his way home from a supply ship. There are only about 150 pages of text in this story and what was missing in the story were what Hornblower did that lead to the eventual decisive Battle of Trafalgar. It was nice to see what Forester wrote anyway only because I like the genre and I like Forester's details and descriptions of being in the Service and living during that time. But this book wouldn't be good on its own."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Or is it? The incomplete story, 'Hornblower During The Crisis' seems to be set just after 'Hornblower And The Hotspur'. The story was never finished and the ONE page of notes at the end DO tell you how the story turns out but doesn't have much in the way of details. It would of been nice to see a dozen pages or so of the author's notes.The next two stories, 'Hornblower's Temptation'(which seems to be set after 'Lieutenant Hornblower') and 'The Last Encounter', which is the very last tale about him, are both short but complete. They show us a very interesting view of Hornblower's inner thought process when he was young and when he gets old.So in a way it does end the series, but also shows him during earlier periods of his life."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"There are three rather short stories in this book. The back cover describes the book as following \\"Hornblower and the Hotspur,\\" and the unfinished first story does, so you probably shouldn't read this book before reading \\"Hotspur.\\" But the next story is set between \\"Midshipman Hornblower\\" and \\"Lieutenant Hornblower,\\" and the third story is set at the end of the entire series. You don't need to read the whole series first, but the last story won't make sense unless you at least read \\"Beat to Quarters\\" first. And nothing in this compilation is necessary for understanding other books. So you shouldn't read it in the sequence listed on the cover, and you may as well save it for last. That said, all three stories are worth reading.As you know, the main story was unfinished, which is fine. It's an ambitious tale of how an out-of-work commander saves Britain from invasion and deals the French tyrant a mortal blow through luck, skill, luck, cleverness, luck, and derring-do. It ends about halfway through the story, with about a page of notes about how it ends. The half that's finished is entertaining, but does rely a lot on luck. I have trouble imagining the second half being written without relying too much on luck. It's great the way it is.The next story explores the young Hornblower's character as he must guard a devious prisoner and face financial and professional temptation. The last story shows the peaceful life of an old, successful, wealthy, respected, contented Hornblower interrupted by an entertaining echo of his old enemy.All told, it's a fun, easy-to-read book for Hornblower fans. But there's nothing wrong with saving it for the end of the series."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"I did enjoy the unfinished story, although it its of course sad that we can never enjoy the fully finished work. I was very frustrated to learn that the Kindle digital version did not include the two companion short stories. Seeing their mention time and again in these reviews, I had no idea they would be left out. These were the deciding factor in my decision to purchase this book. This should have been noted in the description."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"I give this book two stars, but in no way am I implying that C.S. Forester deserves two stars for his work. Rather, I give the publisher of the book two stars for giving us half a novel but presenting it as a full entry in the Hornblower saga. I was looking forward to another great Hornblower novel, but found instead the beginnings of a promising story and a few short stories. The whole edition is much shorter than the other Hornblower novels, but costs the same price. I would recommend skipping this book until you have really exhausted the other Hornblower novels already."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Let me begin by clarifying what this book is before you purchase it.The beginning is the first 30-40 percent of a novel that C.S. Forester was working on at his death called, Hornblower During the Crisis. The events take place immediately after Hornblower and the Hotspur.Next comes a short story (or very brief novella, if you prefer) called \\"Hornblower's Temptation\\" which deals with his first posting as a young Lieutenant on the Renown. The action takes place after Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and before Lieutenant Hornblower.Finally comes another short story (or very brief novella) called \\"The Last Encounter.\\" It deals with the time during which Hornblower is already a lord and an admiral.\\"Hornblower's Temptation\\" deals with Hornblower's assignment to take control of a prisoner who is being court-martialed for desertion. The story is pretty grim, but contains all of the elements of the better Hornblower stories. A difficult challenge is presented. No obvious solution exists. Hornblower finds a good way out, and overcomes mental and moral hurdles to succeed. I would advise no one to miss this story. It is good background for later stories where Hornblower must find a way to do the right thing without fully disclosing what has taken place.\\"Hornblower During the Crisis\\" has many attractive elements. The story deals with Hornblower's experience in handing over the Hotspur to his replacement after Lord Cornwallis promotes him to Post Captain at the end of Hornblower and the Hotspur. On the way back to England, Hornblower fights as improbable a naval battle as you can imagine, and in an unexpected role. As a result of his quick thinking, important information is developed which he takes to the Admiralty. While there, he helps devise a remarkable scheme for influencing the French. The book ends at that point. You then get 164 words of author's notes on how Mr. Forester planned to finish the novel. The finished parts of the novella are reasonably polished. Forester probably would have added more details to the beginning to make it more interesting and dramatic. The parts in London look like they are fully developed.If you are like me, the best parts of Hornblower stories are where he has crises of conscience. Hornblower During the Crisis promises just such crises in the 164 words, but does not deliver them. As a result, most people will see this novella as less than a full Hornblower novel. It is too bad, because the concept was a sound one . . . and I would have enjoyed reading the end. I graded down the book accordingly.As to \\"The Last Encounter,\\" this story is intended as irony without any testing of Hornblower either intellectually or morally. It is a piece of fluff. Be sure not to read this story until after you have finished the whole series. It contains references to other characters that will spoil your enjoyment from reading the books ahead in the chronology of Hornblower's fictional life.Should you read this book? If you like Hornblower, I say \\"yes.\\" I slightly prefer reading it in order to reading it in the end of the series. For me, the right solution was to read all but \\"The Last Encounter\\" in chronological order . . . and then reread those sections and read \\"The Last Encounter\\" at the end of reading all of the other books.If this were your last day on earth, what unfinished business should you do today? How would it improve your life and the lives of others if you do that unfinished business anyway? Imagine, for example, how much more rewarded C.S. Forester's readers would be if he had completed a thorough outline of the rest of this story before he died. That would have taken no more than a day . . . and the benefits would have been enormous."},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"This is genuine Forester and Hornblower, lovely what there is, but a bit out of sorts. First, one of the two short stories appended to this volume, Hornblower's Temptation, should be read immediately following the Mr. Midshipman book (#1). In it we see Hornblower in his first Lieutenancy, solving a mystery.Second, the main novel here (#4 biographically) is the &quot;final&quot; one left incomplete by Forester's death. Hornblower has left Hotspur on the Brest blockade, but not finally, due to his incompetent successor. After that flurry of action, Hornblower waves to his wife and is off to London to become a Post Captain, but is promised a ship only if his rash espionage plan successfully penetrates Bonaparte's Empire. In the succeeding book 5 (Atropos) there is no allusion to Hornblower's incredible deception of the French set up here (but unwritten). Third, the other short story in this volume, The Last Encounter, as its title implies, might be reserved for reading after the last novel in the Hornblower saga.The Author's Note published here to forward the unfinished novel--setting Hornblower ashore to deceive the French Navy into its most colossal blunder--is disappointing in its brevity. On the other hand, one infers that Forester must have been in the habit of writing only the sketchiest of outlines and usually wrote from page 1 right through to the end in order. The 9 chapters that were completed are fully formed and polished. Perhaps Forester enjoyed writing his stories the same way we enjoy reading them: inspired from the beginning and no skipping!"},{"Title":"Hornblower during the crisis, and two stories: Hornblower's temptation and The last encounter","review":"Like all the Hornblower books we see our hero in many unconfortable positions, from the Court Martial of his successor to finding himself a junior officer in a battle situation after years of command. Unlike the other Hornblower books we are left with an incomplete story. It seems to me that this drop doesn't change a thing.Most people who read Hornblower will know their Navel History and will be able to put the pieces together, (on more than one occasion Forester talks about Hornblower's fellow captians putting the pieces together from a brief statement in a report.) and the reader can do it without problem.The two short stories that follow are both of high quality. (I was very disapointed that we didn't see the story of Barry McCool in the lastest Hornblower movie.) His encounter with McCool and with Napoleon III were both well written and interesting.Unless you are reading the series in chronological order (don't forget to read the McCool story AFTER Midshipman Hornblower then put it away till you finish Hornlober and the Hotspur) this book should probally be read last. I wouldn't buy this book first, but I wouldn't recommend missing it either."},{"Title":"La Gesta del Marrano (Coleccion Fabula) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Marcos Aguinis is truly a gifted writter and this, I believe, is his masterpiece.

Everything that makes a MacDonald paperback.At first glance John D. MacDonald may come off as a pulp fiction writer. Indeed, the cover art and plot summary on my used copy do nothing to diminish that impression. But anybody who has read him knows that he is much more than that. His characters are always interesting and have intriguing motivations. His writing is exquisite and vivid. And the book, as all good books are, uses its story to reflect the world at large.I found this book in a used book store. Since so many John D. MacDonald books are out of print I would recommend to anybody learning to love this author as much as I do to buy up any old MacDonald titles the next time they are in a used bookstore because you may never find them again."},{"Title":"THE ONLY GIRL IN THE GAME","review":"Of course John D. MacDonald would write a crackling good crime story while at the same time examining the politics of the early golden years of Las Vegas. Our hero is the manager of a popular Strip resort who becomes romantically involved with a female employee. Of course, she has secrets and is under the control of a not-very-nice heavy. It's your standard noir pulp plot, but the rhythm of MacDonald's dialogue and his story pacing elevate it. There are some remarkable descriptions of soul-searching in a lonely cabin in the desert outside town. There are also fascinating descriptions of the inner workings of a casino resort. Along with \\"Clemmie\\", \\"Please Write for Details\\", and \\"Murder in the Wind\\", this is one of the best non-McGee MacDonalds."},{"Title":"THE ONLY GIRL IN THE GAME","review":"This pre-Travis McGee John D. MacDonald novel is undeniably compelling as it describes a mob controlled Las Vegas where corruption permeates each and every aspect of the gaming and entertainment industries that together go to make up the city's life's blood. The novel's protagonist is Hugh Darren, an up and coming assistant hotel manager, through whose eyes the reader learns the harsh facts of life about Las Vegas. It's an unforgiving place that, given half a chance, will corrupt and destroy. The Only Girl in the Game is most definitely not a book the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce would want you to read.There are a number of well fleshed out and believable characters and two major subplots both of which involve individuals close to Hugh Darren. Both subplots are hard edged and intriguing. In neither case does MacDonald pull a single punch.The Only Girl in the Game is a viscerally engaging page turner of a novel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE ONLY GIRL IN THE GAME","review":"Agree with above comments. This is typically plot-driven, expertly written j.d. macdonald. Most of his work is of this quality; a rare few are a little disappointing; and then there are the cream of the crop. For those interested, I most recommend, of course, the Travis McGee series. Read them in order, starting with The Deep Blue Goodbye. The Green Ripper was my favorite, and Freefall in Crimson was, for me, the weakest. Of short stories and novels, my favorites so far are The Empty Trap; April Evil; The Price of Murder; The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything (great). I thought Barrier Island took too long to get going, though. Don't miss his short stories, Good Old Stuff, etc. And a treat is his early sci-fi stories, Other Times, Other Worlds-- while he was not the writer he would become at that time, they show why he was compelled to begin writing. Also, there's a little-known novella called Linda, found in the two-novella collection Border Town Girl, that I found to be particularly good."},{"Title":"The Coming of the Cosmic Christ: The Healing of Mother Earth and the Birth of a Global Renaissance","review":"If you are on the Path and looking for the truth, buy this book, It was an interesting read.

Then I read another book by Harold Bloom who said the same thing in a slightly more poetic way!I think Fox may originally had reform or something like it in mind. Then he must have found various groups that encouraged him to use meaningless jargon, superlative expressions which seemed meaningful because of their superlativity, rather than because of any possible meaning, etc. You know, newagers who confuse jargon with substance.

I found a lot of Consciousness, Awareness, Forces, Being, Quanta, Fields, Trends, and Direction. Lots of spirituality but no religion. Lots of gender but no sex. Lots of insight and belief, but no dogma, no doctrine, no drama ... a wondrous postmodern utopia, and so disconnected from anything real and so utterly irrelevant to our human condition. If you're looking for a book (and an author) to inspire you to change your life, look elsewhere. Though the words are golden, the soup is thin.

Freeing himself from the chains of stale Christian dogma while protesting the cold emptiness of agnostic modernism, Fox fashions a theology and spirituality that combines mysticism with a &quot;first world&quot; liberation theology. Fox is a panentheist, experiencing the Divine in all of nature and humanity. The Cosmic Christ is that incarnation of God in the universe and especially in Mother Earth. He develops a relevant, postmodern interpretation of the Paschal Mystery, imaging Mother Earth as Christ crucified, resurrected, and come again. Fox's union of mysticism, science, and art, and the four spiritual paths he outlined in &quot;Original Blessing&quot; open up individual and communal possibilities for a spirituality that is inwardly personal and contemplative, yet outwardly driven by justice and compassion. If you want to reconnect to a progressive Christianity, this book ties together ethics, myth, and theology like no other."},{"Title":"The Coming of the Cosmic Christ: The Healing of Mother Earth and the Birth of a Global Renaissance","review":"In what may be considered the most comprehensive outline of the Christianparadigm shift of our Age, Matthew Foxeloquently foreshadows the manner inwhich universal redemption may be usheredin via the spirit of Christ in terms of the return tomysticism, the expression of creativity as the highest spiritual value, the blessing of Mother Earth and the recovery of eros, the feminine aspect of deity.Rather than alluding to prophecy or a literal second coming as the title might suggest, Foxoutlines in painstaking yet illuminating detailthe conceptual contents of what that eventor it's cultural revolutionary equivalent mightbring to mankind at the millenium. This includesthe necessity of a Christian apology towardsthe indigenous peoples and Earth-based spiritual cultures throughout the Christian era that have been the victims of literal and spiritual genocide, hypocritically commited by supposed followersof the Messiah of love and forgiveness.These ideas issuing from the collective unconscious signal the death of fundamentalismwhich must occur in order for Christianity to be&quot;born again in the spirit&quot; of mysticism from which it originallly issued forth.Fox has stepped away from hardened dogma and taken the heat for teaching the path of love,a path far closer to the words and actions of the Master than the path of those who label Fox a heretic.This is a must read for those who still believethat God is Love and grow weary of theabusive doctrines of vengeance"},{"Title":"The Coming of the Cosmic Christ: The Healing of Mother Earth and the Birth of a Global Renaissance","review":"In academic, seminary thesis-style prose, Fox weaves together the insights of a variety of traditions to present a vision of today in terms of the Cosmic Christ. What this book lacks in humor it makes up for in resourcefulness, as Fox exhaustively cites mystics, scholars, theologians, saints, politicians, scientists, poets, the gospels, and Christ himself. The point, which appears with mantra-like frequency throughout the book, is that the Cosmic Christ is in everything and that everything is in the Cosmic Christ. We are to see our times as one of mother earth crucified, according to Fox- a paradigm for the religious institutions of the west and culture at large, both of which he charges at length for devouring the youth, and dismissing sexuality, creativity and feminine strength in exchange for patriarchy and its left-brained, domineering competitiveness.On the whole, this is a valuable read for anyone who wants to understand where religion might (hopefully) be headed in the next century, as we move towards the embrace of a \\"living cosmology\\" that draws on science, mysticism, and imaginative art. Although Fox clearly describes a healthy vision of transformation for our institutions, the message lacks \`bite' regarding tangible solutions, elements which are noticeably missing from his hopeful forecast. But who has solutions, anyway?If one can get past the style of delivery, which borders on prosaic, then there is a wealth of readable insight that may or may not be news, but is certainly important for our times. Will it make you laugh or cry? Probably not. Will it enthrall readers? On occasion. It is definitely recommended- if for no other reason that it's one of those controversial works that people tend to love or hate.

How is M. Fox expressing his vision, quoting biblical themes from infancy narratives, of all four Gospels, viewing Jesus life as revealing Cosmic unity in his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension is relatively unique in contemporary western theology. He keeps assuring the novel reader that he follow the steps of creation mystics and oriental Church fathers. He mentions the recent writing of Jaroslav Pelikan of Yale, the most prominent doctrine development theologian, who devotes a chapter to the Cosmic Christ who gives meaning to the Cosmos, redeeming its divine order and revelation.Now Matthew Fox, a Dominican Creation Mystic in the Book's following chapters concludes that the Cosmic Christ is the title for the crucified and resurrected, whose paschal mystery is the prefigured salvation in the Old Testament, even more relevant for third millennium Christianity, redeems redemption of mother earth, and of cosmic pain, reveals the divine in all creation!So far, so good.

There are plenty of books on the trends of evil in this world system, plenty of calls for peacemaking, plenty of appeals for spiritual renewal, but Cosmic Christ addresses all these issues and more, with information, insight, and inspiration.\\" He concludes, \\"Yet The Coming of the Cosmic Christ is the one almost certainly to be remembered as his masterpiece.\\""},{"Title":"The Coming of the Cosmic Christ: The Healing of Mother Earth and the Birth of a Global Renaissance","review":"This is a book for serious students of the deeply mystical.

(Rossum's universal robots)","review":"THis book is a play written about Artificial intelligence. It is very short and doesn't take much to read it. I would recommend it to a younger audience."},{"Title":"R.U.R. (Rossum's universal robots)","review":"and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. Hamlet, Act iii, scene 2.The ultimate problem in Karel Capek's extraordinary play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) is that the robots created by humanity's journeymen imitated humanity so abominably well.Written in 1920 and first produced in 1921 RUR opened to critical worldwide acclaim. Although RUR is best remembered for introducing the word robot into the lexicon (the word was coined by Karel's brother and some time collaborator Josef Capek) it is more a somber reflection on humanity than on the emergence of robots.The play opens on an unnamed island at some point in time after 1920 where lifelike robots are being produced by Rossum's Universal Robots. The officers of the corporation meet a young lady, Helena, who has come to the island on behalf of the League of Humanity, determined to help liberate these robots from the inhumane working conditions that confront them. The executives fill Helena in on the history of the company, particularly the father-son team of Rossums that developed the first robots. Capek makes it a point to describe the difference between the father and the son. The father was a \\"scientific materialist\\" whose desire to create an imitation of man grew out of his wish to prove that God was unnecessary. The son thought this was both silly and inefficient and sought nothing more than to produce robots capable of working non-stop.Each of the following scenes takes place at some unspecified point in the future. The millions of robots produced take on all the industrial and agricultural work performed formerly by men and women. This leads to unintended consequences. First, the lack of necessity (the need to work) in everyday life leads to a few worker revolts. This causes various governments to arm the robots to quell the resulting riots. Further, these governments decide that all future wars will be fought by robots. As one might imagine, a well-trained robot-militia is not conducive to the future health and welfare of the human race. Second, the lack of work and the general lack of purposefulness of life render humans incapable of reproducing.As the play nears its end, the robots have united and have set out to destroy the human race. Clearly, the robots have learned to think for themselves and as such they have taken on (or evolved into) something that more closely resembles the human race. The fact that the robots behave so abominably does not belie this similarity to their human creators. The problem the robots face is that they do not have the inherent capacity to reproduce (they have a shelf-life a bit shorter than is average for humans) and they have inadvertently destroyed those humans that know how to create more robots. They are faced with extinction just as surely as the humans they have destroyed.As the play concludes the sole remaining human, Alquist, spots two robots whose clear affection for each other indicates that the robots are about find a means to reproduce without the assistance of the humans who gave them life. This pleases Alquist no end and as the play ends, he \`anoints' the robots with his blessing. It is a poignant, jumbled mixture of the creation story (and on the sixth day) and the Song of Simeon (Let us now thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.) The rich irony in this biblical blessing of the new, robotic Adam and Eve brings us to a place dramatically different from the elder Rossum's stated desire to create robots to disprove the existence of God. Alquist's benediction shows man at the height of his humanity and speaks directly to Alduous Huxley's dictum that \\"the humanity of men and women is inversely proportional to their numbers.\\"R.U.R. was written at a time when the world was still reeling from the horrors of the First World War, which horrors were magnified by technological advancements that made the killing industry far more efficient than it ever had been in the past. Capek's pessimism must be viewed through that prism. However, it must be noted that &Egrave;apek's pessimism was not directed at technology itself. I think his concern was with the unchanging human nature of those who think they control the technology and who direct, for good or ill, its use. In some respects this harkens to the political slogan that \\"guns don't kill people, people kills people\\". In this instance and in view of the horrors Capek witnessed first hand, it does not seem inappropriate.It should be noted that R.U.R. was written 85 years ago and the words Capek wrote were meant to be heard by an audience and not read.. As such, some of the dialogue will sound a bit stilted or dated to the reader. However this bit of apparent aging should not diminish the enjoyment to be derived from reading R.U.R. R.U.R. and Capek' other great dystopian work, War With the Newts are a must read for those interested in some of the early 20th century's most compelling fictional looks into the heart of darkness that is mankind. The introduction by Ivan Klima, a biographer of Capek is noteworthy and adds a great deal of illumination for the reader."},{"Title":"R.U.R. (Rossum's universal robots)","review":"This science fiction play by the Czechoslovakian writer Karel Capek (1890-1938) introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; (from the Czech word &quot;robota&quot; for work). Any serious student of science fiction should read this play. A factory on an island produces robots (actually, in today's terminology, the products being made by this factory are androids, not robots) to do man's labor and to grow his food. But, as the years go by, governments misuse the robots, having them replace soldiers. Robots begin to be used in wars everywhere. They rebel and man is exterminated. However, the robots don't know how to build new robots and discover that they are doomed to extinction as well. But, the sole two robots of a later model discover beauty, compassion, and love. They become a new Adam and Eve. Interestingly, one of the characters in the play builds robots so that man won't have to work. Yet, he doesn't build any to do his work since it is something he enjoys doing."},{"Title":"R.U.R. (Rossum's universal robots)","review":"I first read this play in the late 1940's when I was in High School. The author died in 1938 at about the time Turing was &quot;inventing&quot; the Turing Machine. Perhaps the author intended this work as a parable about Bolshevism, but the steady growth of the computer makes it read today like a straight-forward prophecy which will come true in about 50 more years. The technology projected is all wrong in the details, of course, but it is fun to read today and draw the parallels and differences."},{"Title":"R.U.R.

(Rossum's universal robots)","review":"Most 20th century plays are focused on the exploration of characters, not ideas. Karel Capek's R.U.R. (short for Rossum's Universal Robots) explores instead ideas, leaving character to one side. The character in this play are somewhat beside the point, irrelevant. The ideas about human beings, about the centrality of labor to give their lives meaning, of the pressures of modern capital to strip workers of their essentially human characteristics are what the play is all about. The robots are emblematic of what, Capek believes, modern capital want to do to workers, taken to their logical extreme.The play is, therefore, a profoundly political play. Capek's own politics do not fit comfortably on the current political grid. He could properly be called conservative, if one could recover an older conservative tradition that was not linked so powerfully to business and corporate interests. Historically this was not always so. John Adams, for instance, the second American president, wrote passionately about the need for the executive branch of government to stand between the greed of the economic elite and both ordinary Americans and the republic. This tradition in American politics was transformed earlier just after the half century mark in the 20th century, much to the chagrin of traditional conservatives like Russell Kirk. Capek shares much in common with this earlier tradition, seeing the greed of corporate interests, which would reduce workers to mere machines if they could. But Capek also shares with this older conservative tradition a fear of technological development. He does not believe that much genuine good will arise out of increasing technological development.The play is perhaps most significant for having popularized the use of the word \\"robot,\\" a word coined by Karel's brother Josef. The robots of Capek's play have far more in common with what we would today call cyborgs or androids, being apparently human creatures made by humans. I find it fascinating that this, the first truly important SF play, focuses on robots. The novel that is usually considered the first SF novel, FRANKENSTEIN by Mary Shelley, also is about an artificially constructed human being. The first SF feature length film, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, also had a robot as one of its major characters. Capek's particular version of the robot has many connections with subsequent depictions of constructed people. To take merely one instance, there are many parallels between Capek's robots and the Cylons in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new version, not the 1978 one). In both versions the robots were created to undertake work for humans to make their lives easier. In both versions the robots or Cylons turned against their creators. In both versions the robots or Cylons are obsessed with replicating themselves, though in BSG the Cylons are capable of laboratory reduplication, but aspire to procreation sexually. Clearly Capek anticipated many ongoing questions in SF.This remains one of the important works of SF of the 20th century as well as one of the most crucial works in the history of imaginative explorations of what it means to be human through the creation of artificial people."},{"Title":"R.U.R.

There is a ton of spreadsheets you have to fill in but you need to know very specific information to do so, and then the information you get is only relevant to a larger cooperation. Also, and this is the kicker, the author made a reference to an exciting new ad technology coming out, Google Whisper, and he was serious. He was not kidding, he actually thought Goole Whisper was real, its an ONION STORY, you know \\"The Onion\\" the fake news site that makes up funny fake stories, the author thought one of them was real, and put it in his book."},{"Title":"The Marketing Plan : How to Prepare & Implement It","review":"I have no idea what the author is talking about - it's just the way the book is written.

I reached Chapter 7 (with skipping some material in between) but can go no further. I read a lot books on management and marketing - this book has just confounded me. Luckily I got it from the library and didn't buy it.

Among much else, this is the best thing I've read about the great election scandal, and it's right on the nail about alligators, oranges and Miami Vice too.

Overall, it was an enjoyable trip through the anecdotal history of America's most um...culturally diverse state.Diane Robert's family history is one that most people wish they could write. Going back some 10 generations (she is lucky to be able to trace back that far) for stories. You might as well give up keeping track of all the relations in you mind. As she described it, a written version of her family tree would cover the floor of a small apartment.When her ancestors were not available during a particularly important point in Florida's history, she provides a description of events that is a stew of fact, anecdote, illustration, and rumor to make it colorful for the reader.On the downside, when describing current events in business and politics it is clear that her political leaning is Democrat. Even though I may agree with her, this point of view may turn off some more conservative readers. My advice is, get over it, you'll still enjoy the rest of the book.This was an entertainment read, however, Diane does make one key point at the very end that most of us can learn from, and that is history is written by those it serves. An event may have occurred one way or another or not at all, but the way it is relayed to others will serve the purpose of it's author."},{"Title":"Dream State: Eight Generations of Swamp Lawyers, Conquistadors, Confederate Daughters, Banana Republicans, and Other Florida Wildlife","review":"People have been ordained for writing things less divine than this book -- I know, I'm one of them. This visionary, confessional lightning-bolt of a travelogue/history/expose of Florida is enough to make a pan-handler of anyone. I used to be a real bishop before I went freelance, and it's journalism like this that made it worthwhile. I love this book more than I love the anhinguas at Wakullah Springs. Alligator in the water; people back in the boat.

Perhaps the author's less-than-glowing assessment of Florida is what hooked me, but just the same I read it cover to cover.

So my opinion is biased...against her. Like Diane, my people are from Tallahassee going back to the very beginning, and before that to the Spanish Period at Amelia Island and St.Augustine. And like Diane I descend from the Roberts' Line; so we're probably cousins....as are most people with Tallahassee roots.Diane's writing reminds me of my father's Aunt Jimmie. Like Diane, she and her heirs protest their association with the Old South (especially slavery) but you couldnt loosen their grip on the inherited silver service and china and crystal that slavery paid for (with dynamite!). Both are proud as hell for descending from aristocrats and money, and both are deluded in believing that anyone takes their protests seriously. I mean, this is what her book is about. On the one hand she asserts her equality & fraternity with the unwashed masses then discloses how she wipes her ass with monogrammed linen.

Well, if you need some books on ESD or IO design, you won't be able to find many. This book is one of several good books with comprehensive coverage on ESD protection.

Especially, in Chapter 6 (ESD Failure Analysis and Modeling), virtually all examples were borrowed from others, and the reproduced FA images are poor. Also, I agree ... that the book was not well written. It has too many long sentences which make you read uneasily.Looking for a better one? Wiley just published the second edition of \\"ESD in Silicon Integrated Circuits\\" which is far better than first edition, and it's more practical and much cheaper than this book, with super quality.

It more closely resembles that of the radio programs of the 1940's-1950's, an art mastered by Orson Welles.The dialogue on this CD shows good character, though often a bit exaggerated; this is common in radio performances as you have no other means of conveying emotion but inflection of voice. The plot of the CD mostly follows the book, but much has been omitted. The background soundtrack contains sound effects and music, though the level is well-balanced in effort to reduce the amount of distraction from the dialogue.It is not substitute for the novel.Raymond Chandler's novel, _Farewell, My Lovely_, may be one of his most stylistically clever works. Brimming with sarcasm, repressed anger and sexuality, and criticism of both upper and lower classes, Chandler's prose makes any audio adaptation challenging. For those who love old radio programs, this will do for a few hours enjoyment."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This is the best book I have read in ages. I don't read everything start to finish. I like to be taken in, and to finish a book, I usually feel compelled to do so. This book had me eagerly flipping page after page. I couldn't wait to find out what would unfold next. It was the highlight of most of my recent days. Chandler's failed career as a romantic poet shows admirably in this prose. It's really beautiful, to the point, and not pretentious at all. It was fun. The pace was quick, and you are trying to put the pieces together with Marlowe as he brings you along. I don't usually read mysteries. With Chandler, I at least plan to read all of his. This is better than the best noir films. If you dig noir films and literature, read this book. (It's also clear why so many people idolize Marlowe from this one, a man's man if there ever was one..."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I read mostly at night in bed and I'm tired because I could not put this book down. I kept looking ahead for convenient places to stop, but blew right by them instead. The combination of Chandler's pace and piquancy is simply irresistible.Farewell, My Lovely isn't the most believable of books, but just like The Big Sleep, it doesn't matter. Indeed, there's a tongue-in-cheek charm that peeks out quite often from behind the hardened facade. Chandler excelled at caricature. He danced on the edge of parody. But, he did it so exquisitely well that he detracted not a whit from the earnestness of the story.A paroled con comes back to LA in search of the woman he loves. Philip Marlowe, our protagonist, stumbles into the plot thus derived. Conspiracy and murder follow among the landmarks of the Los Angeles area. There's a magnetic pull to 40's-era LA and Chandler takes full advantage of it. Farewell, My Lovely is quintessential, it is provocative, and, in places, shamefully vulgar. And, still, I recommend it highly, because it is worth every bit of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"According to Wikipedia, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY (1940) was Raymond Chandler's second novel and created from three short stories--\\"The Man Who Liked Dogs\\" (1936), \\"Try the Girl\\" (1937), and \\"Mandarin's Jade\\" (1937). This makes a lot of sense to me, since Chandler's great creation, Philip Marlowe, seems more like a character from a short story than the deep and complex creation that a great novelist can achieve.Yes, Marlowe is certainly a well-defined in FML. He's a guy with high integrity, down-beat and droll, lyrical in his descriptions, relentless and lonely, and he drinks too much. But why is he this way? And what greater issues do his struggles touch upon? Here, Chandler offers next to nothing, unless you have a film-Noir vision of life and view all winners as corrupt and brutal. Instead, he stays small with Marlowe, a highly focused creation developed in short stories, who offers a perfect streamlined literary voice to tell a novel-length story of crime.This is not to say that Philip Marlowe is ever an uninteresting character in FML. But does he really have a very interesting mind? Take away his lyricism and the grouchy humor of his metaphors and his limits show--he's everybody's sour uncle, boyishly uncompromising, for whom things didn't work out.Of course, you can't really separate character and voice in fiction. And, Marlowe's voice, its absolutely uncanny metaphors and amazing lyricism, explains why Raymond Chandler, among hundreds of crime-fiction writers, is the guy I choose to read. (I'm usually bored by mysteries and crime fiction.) Here are just two examples from FML.\\"He wore a brown suit of which the coat was too small for his shoulders and his trousers were probably a little tight at the waist. His hat was at least two sizes too small and had been perspired in freely by somebody it fitted better than it fitted him. He wore it about where a house wears a weather vane...A tie dangled outside his buttoned jacket, a black tie which had been tied with a pair of pliers in a knot the size of a pea. ...He had a big flat face and a highbridged fleshy nose that looked as hard as the prow of a cruiser.\\"\\"Then there were no more houses, just the still dark foothills with an early star or two above them, and the concrete ribbon of road and a sheer drop on one side into a tangle of scrub oak and Manzanita where sometimes you can hear the call of the quails if you stop and keep still and wait. On the other side of the road was a raw clay bank at the edge of which a few unbeatable wild flowers hung on like naughty children that won't go to bed.\\"In FML, I also enjoyed the brief Hemingway parody and was surprised to encounter--SPOILER COMING--a multi-bullet suicide. This was something Martin Amis used to make a point about crime fiction inNight Trainwhere the narrator is, like Philip Marlowe, burned out but amazingly lyrical."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's second novel, Philip Marlowe gets embroiled in a complex plot involving murder and lost love.Marlowe's on the wrong side of town when he gets drawn into watching a murder in a bar that blacks frequent. As usual for this day and age - this is decades before civil rights, remember - the white cops brush it off as meaningless. Only Marlowe shows some interest in what is going on, and the lug of a man that desperately misses his lost love.Marlowe, pretty down on his luck and drinking hard, pries into the situation as much out of intellectual boredom as anything else. He's not after money, and indeed half the time he's not getting any. He's after making some difference in the world, no matter how small. He's after doing his part to help out those in need. These qualities of honor are taken up by many detectives who came after Marlowe, and are admired by millions of movie viewers who saw the movie version of this book.The gritty world that Marlowe lives in, the desperate state that many of the characters are in, the racism and disregard for the poor and drug use were all harsh realities of Los Angeles in the 1940s. In that swamp of despair roamed Marlowe, barely keeping his own head above water, but determined to do the right thing. It's his doggedness and his adherence to his own rules that make him a man to be admired throughout the ages ... and it's Chandler's brilliant writing style that brings this world to life.Those reviewers who cringe at the drinking, the despair and the racism should thank Chandler for bringing these realities into such clear view, instead of blaming Chandler for showing them a glimpse of a life beyond their air conditioned living rooms."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"After reading The Big Sleep, I was weary about picking up another Chandler book. I was told that his writing style matures and is easier to follow and grasp in later books. And yes, that is true in his second book.Farewell My Lovely is a novel about a hard nosed L.A. detective name Phillip Marlowe. Marlowe is the master and snappy one liners and sarcasm. Chandler brings Marlowe to the L.A. area and delves him into the world of 1940s noir crime, with excellent description and tons of ambiance befitting the genre.At first, Marlowe encounters a murder by near accident, and without giving away the plot, he is entwined in a much deeper scandal with many different type of characters throughout the area, from a curious woman, to psychics, corrupt cops, organized crime leaders, and crooked sanitariums.Near the end, the book become a little harder to follow, and the plot turns and twists become a little too much, but all in all, it's a great detective novel."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I'm not much of a fiction reader, but I have just about everything Chandler ever wrote, including a copy of his screenplay for &quot;Double Indemnity.&quot; Every couple of years I go back and read everything all over again. How many mysteries can you do that with?The thing is, of course, that you don't read Chandler for the mystery, which is just as well, because it's hard to figure out the story line in his books sometimes. You read, and re-read, Chandler because he created a whole universe in his novels - an image of a Los Angeles with a seedy underside, which suited perfectly the milieu that was associated with the town in the 1940's - the movie people and the parasites that lived off of them, the internal immigrants that flooded California from the Midwest during the Depression, the alienation under a bright sun. A lot of people got their image of California from Chandler.You also read him for the irresistable charm of his protagonist, Marlowe, the shopworn Galahad with the relentlessly absorbing internal monologue that has been imitated by everybody from Jean Claude Belmondo to Garrison Keillor. For a while, Hollywood couldn't get enough of Marlowe, and well into the 70's movies were being made of his books - several of them have been made into movies twice, including this one. I sometimes think that the Marlowe character appeals very strongly to men, or at least a certain type of men, and that's why so many actors - Bogart, Robert Montgomery, Robert Mitchum, and especially Dick Powell - really wanted to play him on the screen.The story starts out with Marlowe just walking down the street and not minding his own business, as usual, and ends up with multiple murders (some of them totally senseless), unspoken mistakes in judgement ( a favorite device of Chandler's) and a lot of unanswered questions. You always find yourself with a sense of brooding emptiness at the end of a Chandler book, a feeling that you've been through an incredible struggle to no purpose at all, and yet you're always glad you were along for the ride all the same.This may very well be the best of the Marlowe novels; it's in my top two for technical perfection along with &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, although I have a personal emotional attachment to &quot;The Long Goodbye.&quot; My advice: try them all."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This book is a good rather than a great read. The story got a little over complicated as Chandler tries to tie in and link too many threads - all connected to the gigantic villain Moose Malloy. There were times when I scratched my head a little despairingly as I tried to work out what these connections were. There were also times when sentences and paragraphs made no logical sense to me at all. I put this down to the language of the time but it did leave a feeling of bewilderment.However, I did enjoy this book and the character of Marlow is strong and amusing. His one liners did on occassions grate a little but nevertheless his overwhelming sense of optimism rang through and made me laugh.Although written many years ago - it still had quite a modern feel to it."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"While working a job that never pans out, PI Philip Marlowe is drawn against his will into a bar called Florian's by a very huge man.

The new owners and employees know nothing of any Velma, but Moose gets mad and someone gets dead, and Marlowe finds himself in the middle of something he never bargained for.Being a good PI, Marlowe calls the police, and the case goes to a fellow named Nulty, who tries to inveigle Marlowe into helping him solve it. Marlowe says he'll let him know if he thinks of anything, then decides to follow up on the Velma angle. He goes into a hotel near the bar, asking about the previous owner, and learns where the man's widow still resides. So Marlowe decides to pay her a visit.Mrs. Florian is a house-bound soul with a fondness for alcohol. It isn't hard to pry information out of her, armed with a bottle and a willingness to suffer being her drinking companion in order to get her to talk. The widow plays coy, but when she learns Moose is on the loose, she grows pale. Velma is dead, she says, so no use looking for her. Marlowe informs Nulty and goes back to his office.There he receives a phone call about a job, although the caller is being very vague and mysterious about what he's to be doing for his money. Money is money, so Marlowe gets the address and agrees to meet the client that night. His name is Lindsay Marriott and he lives in the better part of time. He wants Marlowe to go with him while he does something, but he isn't to be seen or do anything. Marlowe doesn't like that and makes no bones about it, and then he lays down his rules. It seems that Marriott is paying to retrieve some stolen jewelry--very valuable jade, to be exact. It was taken from a lady, and the thieves are holding it for ransom.Marlowe agrees to the job, for a hundred dollars, and instructions are received, along with directions. However, nothing is simple, and Marlowe gets sapped. By the time he wakes up, there's a strange girl there by the name of Anne Riordan, and Lindsay Marriott is deceased. Marlowe checks the man's pockets and finds something interesting--marihuana cigarettes in a cheap case. However, by the time the police arrive, those are no longer there.Turns out Anne's father was once police chief of Bay City, so she can't help but be nosy about what she's stumbled across. Marlowe finds her attractive in a more than pretty face kind of way. She returns the cigarettes she stole to him, and he makes an interesting discovery--hidden inside are the business cards of a local psychic, Jules Amthor. So Marlowe sets off to investigate.A dead man, an escaped convict, a missing girl, graft in high polices, a crooked doctor, gambling--all these things and more lie in wait for Philip Marlowe. The question is, has he bitten off more than he can chew, and are there people who are determined that he not find out the truth, no matter how they have to silence him?Farewell, My Lovely is the sequel to The Big Sleep. It's another great read from Raymond Chandler. I'm really enjoying Marlowe's adventures. He's not a super hero, he's just an ordinary guy, doing his job, and as such he's not beyond getting hurt--and he does, because he keeps sticking his nose where it isn't wanted.One thing to keep in mind when you read this is that it's a product of its times, much as Huckleberry Finn. Some of the terms used would be considered racist now, but they weren't then, so you have to realize that and either not be offended, or not read the book. Those don't detract from the enjoyment of the story.Chandler has a definite way with words that I enjoy. For example, in talking about Marlowe's first sight of Moose Malloy: \\"He was looking up at the dusty windows with a sort of ecstatic fixity of expression, like a hunky immigrant catching his first sight of the Statue of Liberty.\\" His description of scenery is also unique, pure Marlowe: \\"I got down to Montemar Vista as the light began to fade, but there was still a fine sparkle on the water and the surf was breaking far out in long smooth curves.\\"This story has a lot of twists and turns, and I didn't see the ending coming until it was on top of me. Raymond Chandler set the bar for detective stories, and he set it pretty damn high. I recommend this to anyone who loves mysteries and detectives, and to those who haven't put your toe in the water, try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I don't read a lot of thrillers and this is the first Chandler I've read. As many have said before, this is a step and a half above your average good thriller, the reason being the wit and intelligence of the prose, the elegance of the descriptions and the understanding of character which is compassionate, passionate and cynical all at the same time.His flip one-liners aren't just clever, but oil the wheels of the plot. Some of the references I couldn't understand, they belong to the period or the locality, but the plot moves along because the characters find common ground by means of their expressions in the shifting sands of what is acceptable and what is not in the way of behaviour.Another thing is that reading this is a bit like watching a film, Los Angeles comes to life before your eyes.On the downside there's a slight sense of not looking very far beneath the surface, it would slow the book down."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"If you like incomprehensible story lines, improbable plots and connections and an overtone of misogyny then this is your book.If not this is book best left unread."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Oh how I wanted to hate this. It's racist, sexist, rude and absurd. But man oh man could Chandler write. He dragged me down into the seedier side of 1940 Los Angeles, and I couldn't get out until he let me go at the end of the book. The plot? Not so much to it in the end, really. Just a basic hunt for a killer who hunted for the girl he once loved. The twists and turns along the way just provided excuses for more wallowing in the seamy side of life--decadent rich, smelly poor, liars, cheats, and killers. If you asked me, I'd say it wasn't my cup of tea. But the man could describe everything from people to houses to a crawling pink bug in a way that kept me mesmerized. Read this if you want to know what hard-boiled is supposed to sound like."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"A hard-boiled detective novel featuring Philip Marlowe. A great read with a surprise ending. I really enjoyed Chandler's description of people and situations -- very colorful, like \\"he stood out like a pair of spats at an Iowa picnic.\\" At one point in the book the author has another character speak like Marlowe, whereupon he says, \\"that sounds like something I should have said.\\" not surprising how popular these became, along with the whole film noir genre. I can almost hear Humphrey Bogart speaking the lines!"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Essentially, in this book, Marlowe just keeps getting his a$s handed to him in every way imaginable and you have to wonder what Chandler was thinking when our hero gets beaten down over the skull for the sixth, seventh and eighth time. I kept thinking he was going to die from internal bleeding or a serious head wound but instead he just pines for another long shot of whiskey.The story is actually a bit thin but still interesting. Historically, some have complained that this book bleeds into areas that have racist overtones and ideas, but it's a time-capsule look back into the past more than it ever will be a damning piece of evidence against Chandler. I' sure some literature of this day and age will be thought of as racist or troubled when read fifty or sixty years on.A long and tangled story, but a beautiful read full of some of the best dialogue between characters ever. It's no wonder everyone aped him in every other genre ever after. Chandler was as bold as he was blunt and could could write literature disguised as Noir Detective fiction better than anyone or since."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"It's nice to read a mystery novel without all the blood and violence that are part of today's fiction.

It is hard to choose which one is the best, because they are both so good. In this new adventure of his best character Philip Marlowe there are many more adventures, thrills and mysteries than in the first novel.In this second step of the noir literature, Chandler has built up and developed his style and characters, so he spends no time with that. The novel begins with plain action, and it takes only a few pages for the writer to set the main mystery of this narrative. Once it is done, he has all time in the world to make the weirdest people cross Marlow's path.Like in the previous book, the prose is dry, there aren't many descriptions --only of some characters, but nothing that evocative-- and it is not a bad thing. by using such a device Chandler is able to write non-stop action making the main plot more and more intrincated, until its solution. A great book, highly recommended to readers who like mistery novels of high quality and beautiful prose."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Can YOU feel the pain from a right hook thrown in a darkened alleyway at 2:00 a.m. on a cold April Thursday, or the well-worn warmth of a ragged wool carpet runner tacked to the seventh floor of a well past acceptable rent-up in pre-war Los Angeles against the leather shoe sole, or perhaps your face? Read Chandler and you very well might be able to."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Phillip Marlowe is over on Central Avenue, searching for a barber who left his wife. He notices a big man walk into double swinging doors, almost immediately a youth is thrown through the air into the gutter. Marlowe looks in, and is taken upstairs by Moose Malloy. More violence breaks out while Malloy searches for Velma. Marlowe calls the police to report the problem. The police lieutenant strongly suggests that Marlowe should look for Velma. Marlowe gathers information, and looks up Mrs. Florian, wife of the now dead owner of this bar. Mrs. Florian says that Velma is dead, and gives Marlowe a picture of Velma. Marlowe gives her his card, and reports back to Detective Lieutenant Nulty.When Marlowe returns to his office, he gets a phone call hiring him by a stranger to act as his bodyguard. Marlowe accompanies Marriott to a deserted country spot to pay off a jewel thief. Marlowe leaves the car to make the payoff, but nobody is around. When he returns to the car he finds Marriott dead. A young woman shows up and gives Marlowe a ride to his car. Marlowe returns to the West Los Angeles police station to report another murder.Marlowe continues to gather more facts. Marlowe has meetings and adventures in pursuit of the truth. The story effectively exposes the crookedness of Bay City politics, and the corruption of the rich and powerful. The ending seems tacked-on to meet the moral conventions of the time: nobody gets away with murder, not in fiction. The author sort of admits this in the last chapter: \\"we'd never have convicted her\\". If the trial and scandal hurt her older husband, she'd be a rich widow. If not, they could move away from this scandal and notoriety."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"After reading &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; I knew that I was going to read more of Raymond Chandler. After reading this book I know that I will continue to read even more.A very interesting and entertaining crime yarn. I will give it the 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's crime world, everyone's got a gat (a gun) - even sickly old women (&quot;I feel like Death Valley&quot;) and nice daughters of former coppers. People are led to locations where their screams will not be heard. Drinking establishments are respectable if there hasn't been a knife fight in the past month.****Chandler's detective, Philip Marlowe, is looking for a case that pays. But the action starts when he's not on assignment. He follows a stranger into a &quot;Negro dinge joint&quot; for no other compelling reason except that it wasn't any of his business. The dinge joint turns out to be a homicide scene, and Marlowe continues to follow the case without a real client in sight. Even the police aren't overly-interested in his participation.****He's a smart-mouth. An almost-heel. He frequently talks to himself out loud. Sometimes he hears a voice replying and realizes it's his own. This guy's a freak.****It's not hard to imagine how a recent writer like Jonathan Lethem could create a detective who has Tourette's Syndrome in &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (Vintage Books, 1999). A detective is really just a man with serious quirks - he's also smarter than you think he is and likable enough to get the girl, at least for a little while.****Marlowe's a special brand of freak. He notices with exacting detail and describes in kid-like exaggeration what people wear. He fixates on the body musk of henchmen, the desirability of women, and a pink-headed bug crawling around an office.****There are &quot;agents&quot; in the universe - men with fluid positions that we merely call private investigators. Marlowe can fall into a scenario not of his creation. He can be as one character describes, &quot;a late comer to the show,&quot; but just in time to be in on the action. He carries the arc in a story and brings clarity. If he can't figure things out, there is no solution to be had.****&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is typical Chandler - tough, sardonic, thickly sliced but smartly dialogued, and oddly, funny as hell."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Hooray! I finally found a classic crime noir novel that I really liked...This is book #2 in the Phillip Marlowe series. Marlowe bumps into a huge man named Moose and unwillingly sees him murder a man while trying to find his lost love. That is the beginning of a fairly complex, well plotted story.Book #1, The Big Sleep was also well done, but what was missing for me was a glimpse of the human, softer side of Marlowe. This book filled in the missing pieces with the aid of a genuinely good woman. Marlowe's ability to see her good qualities rounded out the tale for me - I got a little of everything I needed to enjoy it.I have to say, there's a lot of prejudice in these books. I suppose it was more common for the time period, but I'm hoping I never get used to it. And there's slang that I don't understand, but I'm catching on slowly. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Dodgy dames, crooked cops, one charlatan, one Moose and plenty of booze.Philip Marlowe is a pretty bright tough guy private eye in Los Angeles, when he is hired to be a bodyguard on a very strange assignment involving supposedly a jewellery ransom buyback.He is soon crossing paths with various police departments, the rich and powerful, and crimelords, not to mention saps and drugs, as this book improves throughout with some entertaining phraseology."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Chandler is great fun to read. He structures his sentences and paragraphs with such metaphoric precision that he turns the mundane crime noir into literature. His hero is none other than perhaps an alter ego of Chandler himself Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is the straight talking, honest PI that will not accept any money until he is on the case and everything is legit. I wondered as I read this if Chandler didn't wished he could live his life in the honest and opened fashion of his hero. In \`Farewell, My Lovely\\" Marlowe searches for Velma a nightclub singer and love of ex-con Moose Malloy. Murder, dope dealers, gambling ships, femme fatales and the always questionable police keep Marlowe on and off his toes.This is another of Chandler's canon that is worth adding to the reading list."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets is right at home here in his search for the inevitable \`missing woman' (\`dame' for the non-politically correct types) of an ex-convict who will not take no for an answer. And a \`missing woman\\" who wants to stay missing and will not take no for an answer. There is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the identity of the above-mentioned \`dame' that caught me off guard. Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day.

Read on."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Farewell, My Lovely was my first Raymond Chandler experience, a novel I first read back in junior year of high school, and one that will forever be known to me as the novel that defines noir, hardboiled detectives and gumshoe novels.In this classic, detective Philip Marlowe gets hired to recover stolen jewels, which in turn has him running into the rogue gallery of gamblers, con men, crooked cops, and (of course) femme fatales. With this said, the story is completely character-driven, making it full of action and narrative. Just flip the book open to any page, and you'll clearly read slick, muscular dialogue and snappy comebacks. Chandler is a benchmark author for stories stripped of any literary fat.Besides Dashiel Hammett, Chandler is the perennial writer of gumshoe detectives.

Fatal debs seem to assault him from every angle, and Marlowe is beaten, drugged and abused mercilessly, but somehow he never gives up and keeps doggedly pursuing the truth about corruption and death in Los Angeles.Chandler's use of language is brilliant as always, and the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, but really, with Chander at work, who needs plot? The book is beautiful and the prose is blossoming with unusual and evocative images. Chander ranks as one of the great American masters of prose.Read this and weep..."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This novel is simply the best detective novel by the best writer of American detective fiction.

The rich descriptions of the seedy side of pre-WWII LA is enough to make this book a winner. Our hero (Marlowe of course) gets drug into a bar and almost witnesses a murder, then gets hired by a rich playboy who drags him to another murder scene. He meets a spunky young lady, gets hired by a rich dame (to use the language of the genre), and runs into a pyschic and other strange characters. How does it all tie together? Does it even matter? Just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Private Eye Philip Marlowe's curiosity for affairs that are none of his business sets him on a trail of murder, blackmail, jewels, women and a man who would always need a shave.Subsequent to Raymond Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep, this second installment from Chandler oozes class and atmosphere that is absolutely unparralelled.Farewell, My Lovelly is a book that grips the reader from the first paragraph and where The Big Sleep slacks and breaks apart in the middle, the book picks up the pace with astonishing prose, particularly the way in which Chandler starts and finishes a chapter makes it hard to set the book down.Marlowe gets involved in a case of murder involving a man named Moose Malloy who is searching for his old girfriend. The poilce take over the murder case and Marlowe is hired by a mysterious client for an evenings bodyguard work which ends in a nasty way.By the time Chandler had set to work on his second novel it is clear that his skills as a writer of detective fiction had improved and he was virtualy unparallelled and unstoppable.Chandler's character creations not only remain fresh and quirky, he has set the standard fom many more titles in the genre; The hard boiled P.I, the cop who is too dumb to fuguire anything out and of course the femme fatal. The key character Marlowe is a slueth on a trail he did not expect, Chandler writes with tremendous naturalism and his genius creation of Marlowe comes forth through the dialogue and attitude fully conveying his hard boiled persona.The prose and description furnish this book with undertones of classc dusty Noir which have become the benchmark for generations of writers and while the movie may have been a hit, it hardly compares to the book.I was lucky enough to stumble upon Farewell, My Lovelly through a reading list from my university and I was not dissapointed, the tension and themes along with the twists and turns leave the reader gripping their lip with thier teeth. The Big Sleep may have been the novel where Chandler broke out into the literary world but this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This is my favorite Raymond Chandler book and that's saying quite a lot. It has a sense of mystery to it that transcends the mystery genre."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This review is for the CD version of Eliot Gould's reading.I love Chandler's writing and have read &quot;Farewell&quot; at least four times. Gould does a good job of reading it, too.What's frustrating about the CD version is that the disks are not indexed. There was no effort to make a disk begin at the beginning of a chapter, for instance. Also, each disk holds one track only. That means if you want to pause for the night at the end of chapter 5, good luck finding your place when you return to listening in a few days.Breaking the audio into tracks is a very easy thing to do, so primitive a technology that it makes it seem that this CD box set was mastered in the 1980s.There is no competing product as of June 2003, however. Devotees may want to make their own MP3 files and then donate the CDs to a library."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Farewell, My Lovely is one of several Philip Marlowe detective stories from Raymond Chandler known for their smokey, 1940s L.A. feel. Philip Marlowe is the private eye whom ladies love, but he seems to be more interested in solving extremely bizarre crimes (and not getting paid for his time) than in romance. Sometimes Raymond Chandler does a brilliant job in building a story around the Marlowe character, as he did with The Lady In The Lake. However he misses the mark with Farewell, My Lovely.Why? Hmmm, let's see. Well certainly the story scores well on the bizarre-ness scale. Marlowe finds himself in a pickle complete with killers, boozers, psychopathes ... the usual lot. But Raymond Chandler does a poor job with building on these characters; there are simply too many of them with only cameo appearances. The author fails to give his Marlowe character much to do other than waltz into one improbable scenario to another. Naturally in the end the story comes together, sort of. But Farewell, My Lovely sadly falls into the &quot;curious but forgettable&quot; category of mystery novels.Bottom line: Raymond Chandler on a bad day. Passable entertainment."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler, an everyday detective, Marlowe, gets wrapped up in a hermeneutic search that could eventually cost him his life. Everything he does affects what will be and, in turn, he winds up changing the course of his search as he becomes caught in its very tentacles. Leading from one murder and scandal to another, this mystery novel addresses corruption and deceit in all of its forms. While it is occasionally difficult to understand because of Chandler's creative habit of inventing new detection slang, it yet creates for an engaging read as it keeps readers in suspense and \\"in the dark\\" until the climax of the book, during which time everything is revealed. More than many other detection novels, this one follows a more Sherlock Holmesesque method of detection by revealing and explaining all in a very short, descriptive, \\"aha!\\" type of moment, which is exciting to the reader who has been trying to solve the mystery all along.However, while the eventual mastermind turns out to be a cunning, selfish woman, the overall portrayal of women in this 1940's novel is daunting. Although often depicted as intelligent, they are also often depicted as needing and revering men. Furthermore, Marlowe's sarcastic confidence and desire to rescue women just gives an overall bad taste to the novel as he looks at women as burdens, sex objects, and inferior beings. In fact, he doesn't very highly esteem African Americans, either. In conclusion, while this book is an interesting read, it is too great a reminder of gender and racial inequalities to be enjoyable."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chander's second novel is both more and less successful than his first. THE BIG SLEEP suffered from a plot that fell apart in midstream; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is much more consistent throughout. On the other hand, for all its twists and turns, THE BIG SLEEP was quite plausible; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is about as farfetched as you can get. But once again, such criticisms are almost beside the point: the great attraction is still Chandler's knock-you-flat prose, his tone of voice, his often imitated but seldom equaled style, and it is so powerful that it keeps you turning page after page after page.In general, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY once more finds street-smart and super-savvy California P.I. Philip Marlowe sticking his nose where it has no business being--and when curiosity leads him to follow a massively built white man into a black nightclub he finds himself embroiled in a murder no one cares about solving... at least not until it begins to figure in what seems to be a completely different case with a high-society spin. And encounters with stolen jewels, a spiritualist racket, police corruption, and a gambling ship quickly follow.Along the way Chandler again paints a gritty portrait of the seamy side of life. On this occasion, he takes a passing look at race, and makes the point that from a police point of view two standards apply: the authorities care nothing about the murder of a black man, but they treat a white man's murder very differently indeed. This portion of the novel is intrinsically controversial, for Chandler uses the slang and racial slurs common to the mean streets of his era--but it is worth noting that although Marlowe uses the same language, his attitude toward the blacks who appear in the novel is considerably different from that of the authorities, who could not care less about the murder of a black man who don't much care who knows it. And once again, Chandler graces his pages with dames and dandies, broads and bums--and he makes them live with remarkable vitality. The famous prose is as rich as ever, although noticeably less witty and quite a bit darker than that found in THE BIG SLEEP. We've stepped off the curb and into the gutter, Chandler seems to be saying, and we're walking in it all the way. Impressive stuff and a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Farewell My Lovely, Raymond Chandler's second novel in the Philip Marlowe series, transcends the genre it helped to create, and is now (deservedly) viewed by many as literature and as social criticism.Chandler creates moods and telegraphs emotions via the poetic ramblings and outrageous similes from the mind of Philip Marlowe, the protagonist/detective/narrator who is picked up by the collar and dragged into a murder mystery that exposes not only the hypocrisy beneath the surface in the lifestyles of the rich and beautiful, but ultimately, the depravity of the human condition. And all of this is delivered with a caustic sense of humor, a wry wit, and a hypersensitivity to the visual world and it's translation into the language of the mean streets.Although Chandler died shortly before I was born, I grew up in L.A., and I can say that the L.A. Chandler wrote of is in many ways the city of my childhood memories, so well did he capture the ambiance and ambivalence of the 'city of angels'.Some have criticized his plotting and plausability, but emotion, action, and detail were what interested him the most, and in these he excelled. FAREWELL MY LOVELY must be viewed within the context of it's era (published in 1940) to be fully appreciated, but the flow of action, the visual aspect of it's language, and the insights into the very human conflict of corruption verses conscience are timeless.This book, like the first in the Marlowe series (THE BIG SLEEP) was written at the height of Chandler's creative career, and exemplifies the style that has made him a writer's writer, possibly the most imitated author of the past century."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler was such a master at his style of prose that you only have to read the first two paragraphs of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY to know exactly what sort of story you're in for. Those two paragraphs perfectly set up the plot that follows: a thriller crossing in and out of the racial divisions of 1940's Los Angeles involving seedy speakeasies, and off-shore gambling, with double-crossing as far as the eye can see. Wonderfully gritty stuff.This particular Chandler novel has a lot going for it. The hero, Philip Marlowe, is as entertaining as ever. The setting is the familiar scene of other Chandler stories -- alive, heavy and oppressively Los Angeles. The plot is logical, but jumps around a lot, which is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the more it moves around, the more room Chandler has to incorporate evil-doings; I quite lost track of exactly how many crimes are committed or alluded to during the course of the book. No matter how farfetched it is, Chandler's prose is utterly gripping and absorbing.I think Philip Marlowe must drink his weight in cheap liquor several times over during the course of this adventure, but you can't help but like the guy. He punches, he shoots, he boozes. He even solves the case by the end. He sure takes a beating in this one, but he keeps coming back for more. He's everything a pulp detective should be - angry, arrogant, determined, and with just a hint of pathos to make him interesting enough to carry the story.The book as a whole is just too appealing and entertaining not to be a fun experience. Chandler is pretty much the benchmark for these sorts of stories about guns, police, and corruption, so if you like the genre, you might as well read the man who invented it. Tough guys yelling, \\"Beat it!\\" at each other might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Chandler is so good as telling the story that any inadequacies in the conventions of this genre are wallpapered over with some slick dialog and snappy comebacks.I read FAREWELL, MY LOVELY more for the great atmosphere and tone than for its overall plot. The fact that the storyline wraps up nicely at the end is merely a bonus. But the real way to enjoy this book is to just let the atmosphere, the characters and the prose just wash over you."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Only THE LONG GOODBYE merits higher place in the shining canon of prose-poet Raymond Chandler. This violent, shabby, hilarious, and ultimately very moving novel rockets P.I. Phillips Marlowe through the darkest, seamiest side of Chandler's textured world Los Angeles. In no other novel does Chandler's razor sharp and witty prose slice so sharply, and his sense of tragic irony (&quot;It isn't funny that a man should die, but it is funny that a man should die for so little&quot;) reaches its zenith. Hard to put down, impossible to forget."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This is the second Raymond Chandler novel I have read after \\"The Long Goodbye\\". I rarely ever read fiction but I can not overemphasize how much I enjoy reading Chandler's novels. These stories are most definitely NOT \\"page turners\\" and I mean that as a compliment. A \\"page turner\\" leaves the reader in suspense about what is going to happen or what is going to be revealed, often leading me, at least, to superficially scanning much of the prose in order to move ahead more quickly. There is some of this suspense in \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" (actually more than in \\"Goodbye\\" which spends more time philosophizing) but it is in taking every sentence as it comes, rolling it around in your mouth and savoring the flavor that gives the real pleasure in these novels.What particularly stands out in this story is the shades of gray of everything. Whereas many detective stories try to fit all the pieces together at the end and show us good guys and bad guys, Chandler's protoganist PI Philip Marlowe sees the world in shades of gray. He doesn't attempt to get to the bottom of people's motivations, and that includes himself. At the beginning of the story, he sees a big white man enter a black nightclub and then sees a black man come flying out the door. For no apparent reason, and admitting that it was none of his business, Marlowe goes in to see what is happening and gets drawn into the mystery. We see people commit murders and yet Marlowe feels that they are not \\"all bad\\". Marlowe encounters some policemen who are good, some who are bad and some who are in the middle. In the end, Marlowe figures out more or less what happened, but admits there are holes in his theory, and he can't completely explain why the characters he encountered acted the way they did. This is the way the real world operates and Chandler/Marlowe is telling us to be honest with ourselves and to admit that we often don't know why we do the things we do and whether we are being really consistent.I find it interesting to note that although this story was written almost 70 years ago, it shows a world that is pretty indistinguishable to our own. The story does not seem \\"dated\\". We see the materialist Los Angeles society that I grew up in during the 1960's and 1970's, and the type of people who live on its fringes. The only jarring note I encountered showing the changes in technology since 1940 was when Marlowe mentions he saw an \\"ice truck\\" parked on the street. Well, I guess time does move on.In closing, this novel has one of the most famous Chandler-quotations of them all: \\"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat, and a gun.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"The tough-as-nails writing of Raymond Chandler has overtaken mysteries to so great an extent that it's easy to forget his role as a trailblazer.

Thirtyish private investigator Philip Marlowe starts with a dull case, before he gets pulled onto the scene of a murder at one of Los Angeles's Afro-American bars. The huge, White assailant Moose Malloy has recently left prison and is searching for his lost girlfriend. Marlowe finds himself beside a dead body and a load of curiosity. Helping with police investigations, he enters a labyrinth of the Los Angeles underworld, including crooked cops, hot blondes, swindling psychics, and racketeers.Chandler's storytelling in the first person narrative of Marlowe is hard-boiled crime before it took on clich&eacute; status. The writing style is crude by necessity; found here is the private detective's rough and cynical attitude that influenced later antiheros like Peter Gunn and the noir style that dominated Hollywood movies. Besides several adaptations of Chandler to the big screen, other directors have paid homage, such as Roman Polanski in 'Chinatown' and David Lynch in 'Blue Velvet.''Farewell, My Lovely' is a well-constructed novel, but not without flaw. Chandler lets none of the characters go to waste, each holding a pivotal role in Marlowe's detective work. This novel stays consistent with his first project, 'The Big Sleep,' in having Marlowe revisit the same territory of earlier chapters. There is no predictability at all and Chandler creates genuinely tense moments.Marlowe, however, is steered by chance far too often and there are times when the action seems contrived, or without inevitability. The easy-going narration helps to smoothen over farfetched elements, such as the unlikelihood of Marlowe getting shoved into Moose Malloy's bar brawl, which is needed just to launch the story. The climax is also rather disappointing, taking place in an unimaginative location.While dealing with the social realities of 1940s California, Chandler's novels still need to be considered as great entertainments rather than full-fledged literature. The novels make generalizations about human life but are mostly driven by plot. It is pulp fiction of the highest rank: well-written, often humorous, and highly dependable. This novel, like others of Chandler, should hold its place in the detective genre for ages to come.The Chandler novels have been republished in an attractive collection by Black Lizard, the crime subsidiary of Vintage Books. 'Farewell, My Lovely' is 292 pages long, in a nice art deco format. Imperfect but highly entertaining, the novel is a must for crime fiction fans."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"From the first paragraph to the last, I was held hostage by Chandler's writing. The action comes at you faster than a bouncer's fist and is just as relentless. This was the first Chandler book I'd read and though I'd heard a lot about his stature as a noir writer, I have to say he did not disappoint in the least. Marlowe is a man's man. He doesn't back down from a challenge, he enjoys the women he likes, dismisses those he dislikes, fights the good fight, and he always tells it like it is!I worked my way through Hammett, Thompson, Mosley, and others, and now it looks like I'm going to work my way through Chandler."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In &quot;Farewell, My Lovely,&quot; Raymond Chandler's second Philip Marlowe novel, Marlowe reluctantly agrees to help a careworn police detective search for a nightclub girl named Velma, a former girlfriend of an ogreish ex-convict named Moose Malloy who is wanted for murder. Marlowe's first lead is the nightclub owner's widow, whom he plies with liquor, only to find out that Velma's whereabouts are being kept a guarded secret. Then, in what initially seems like an unrelated subplot, Marlowe is hired by a man who wants &quot;backup&quot; while he delivers money to some jewel thieves. The man ends up murdered, and Marlowe meets a mysterious girl at the scene of the crime. To think there's no connection between this event and Velma's disappearance would be to underestimate Chandler's genius at plot construction.Chandler cleverly plants false leads to twist the already unpredictable plot and subtle clues that make sense at the end. His colorful characters are masters of deceit; the reader imagines that these people must have great poker faces. They know a lot more than what they're telling Marlowe, and it's exciting to know that Marlowe will eventually be able to guess what they're leaving out. Like J.R.R. Tolkien's Gandalf, Marlowe is one of literature's greatest magicians; the fun of reading the book is waiting for him to pull the rabbit out of the hat at the end."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" we see the stereotypical detective, sitting in his detective agency, at his desk, looking out of a rain-streaked window, pondering something, something we will probably never figure out. The detective here is Philip Marlowe, Private Investigator, and he is presented with what seems like a simple jewelry theft case. Marlowe, with his wit and charm, instead confronts crooked cops, fraudulent psychiatric hospitals, blackmailers, con men, and beautiful and deadly women. Marlowe jumps, almost literally from situation to situation. Each scenario is highly entertaining, but a little difficult to believe. Either Philip Marlowe manages to fit thirty-four action-packed hours in one day or I don't know what. It's interesting how witty the character of Marlowe is and how unaffected he seems to be by all the events going on around him. Even when he is beat up, drugged, and almost killed, he gets up, and carries on. It is difficult to determine whether or not he does this solely for the money, or if he feels he has a personal investment, or perhaps desires the glorification. Chandler incorporates wonderful descriptions of sunny Los Angeles into his novel as we follow Marlowe around the city chasing after people, details, and a solution. He also uses a great amount of similes and metaphors, comparing everything to some strange seemingly unrelated object. Yet, when it comes down to it, this quintessential detective mystery fulfills all my requirements for a good book and left me guessing up until the end."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"With the exception of Charles Dickens, has any writer has more influence on narration than Raymond Chandler? Dozens and dozens of writers -- not always crime writers -- have tried to sound like Philip Marlowe. Dozens of movies have featured Philip Marlowe-like narrators, including the theatrical release of BLADE RUNNER, where Rick Deckard sound nothing so much as a 21st Century updating. And perhaps there have been even more parodies. Either way, we all know what detective narrators are supposed to sound like, and we know this because of Raymond Chandler.Raymond Chandler did not invent hardboiled detective fiction. He essentially took Dashiell Hammett's invention and focused nearly all his attention on prose style, character, and detail. There is an almost tactile quality to many of his stories, to the extent where you feel you could almost reach out and wipe the dust off a desk with your finger. There is, also, an almost wanton disregard of plot. If you read Raymond Chandler for plot, you are misreading him. I'll admit that in several of his novels I'm still unclear what happened. But who cares? The brilliance is in the texture, the detail. Take smell. Read virtually any other detective, crime, mystery, or hardboiled novel and look at how often other writers mention smells and then look at Chandler. He is constantly telling you what places smell like, whether mesquite or sage or sandalwood or whatever. Chandler wrote with heightened senses. I frankly can't get around to caring that his plots aren't very tight because other things absorb all my attention.FAREWELL, MY LOVELY is one of my favorite Chandler novels, perhaps only behind THE BIG SLEEP and his flawed masterpiece THE LONG GOODBYE. It featured many of his most memorable characters, especially the doomed Moose Malloy, and many of his most unforgettable scenes. Because of Chandler's ability to sketch a scene in such astonishing detail, there are scenes in his books that are as easy to visualize as it is a scene in a movie. He is that vivid and precise in his depiction. A great example is Marlowe's visit to Mrs. Florian in his search for Velma. It would be a person of very poor imagination who didn't get a strong sense of what her house looked like, smelled like, felt like.This is also one of his best books because it is one of the most tragic. The end of the novel feels almost like the end of Hamlet, with nearly all of the major characters either dead or at least shattered. And like with most of Chandler, there isn't an overly nice resolution of the mystery, whereby the detective magically makes everything nice and tidy and correct. Marlowe gets to the bottom of things, but often what he finds when he gets there is an abyss. And speaking of Chandler's influence, can one imagine the end of Raymond Polanski's CHINATOWN without Marlowe?As a side note, there have been two very good film versions of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. The first was made by RKO while Chandler was still alive and was originally released with that title. It tanked at the box office, mainly because it starred former Warner Brothers boy crooner Dick Powell. His style of musical had gone out of style and no one wanted to see what they assumed was a musical. So RKO renamed it MURDER, MY SWEET, which obviously could not be a musical, and re-released it. It was a box office success and was crucial in launching the second half of Dick Powell's career, this time as a serious dramatic actor. Chandler himself was horrified at the casting of Powell as Marlowe, but later proclaimed that he thought Powell was outstanding in the role. By the way, the person that Chandler himself thought would have made the ideal Marlowe was Cary Grant. The second version of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY was released in 1975 with Robert Mitchum as Marlowe. With apologies to Humphrey Bogart, Mitchum is my favorite Marlowe. He was a tad too old for the role, but apart from that he absolutely nailed the cynicism and latent nobility of Marlowe. My only regret is that Mitchum didn't begin making a string of Marlowe films when he was 35. As it was he was too old in his second appearance as Marlowe in a bizarre version of THE BIG SLEEP set, of all places, in London."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"The second Philip Marlowe novel written by Raymond Chandler, and also the second one read by me was already familiar to me, having seen two film versions. Therefore, this story was the first real introduction to the character (Robert Altman's version of The Long Goodbye bears very little resemblance to any Marlowe novel I've read).I walk away from a Marlowe novel with an incomplete understanding of all the intricate mechanisms of the plot and how they fall into place (although Farewell, My Lovely is more straightforward than The Big Sleep in that respect) although I leave the book fully cognizant of a world created in a specific time and place with a self-contained atmosphere and a self-contained and pulpishly poetic language.In Farewell, My Lovely, Philip Marlowe is trying to mind his own private eye business but somehow ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, somehow running afoul of crooks as well as cops. A simple case of tracking down an old flame for a massive ex-boxer turned convict is never going to be simple with Marlowe. His encounters with seedy crooks, smugglers, dope peddlers and gambling joint operators provide the reader with a tour of, to use an overworn phrase, the \`underbelly of society.' With Chandler, the law enforcement officers and the laws of the government they are sworn to protect are often as corrupt as any of the pseudo legitimate businessmen/crooks.Culturally and sociologically, this is an interesting depiction of the U.S. in 1940. The racial attitudes are probably pretty typical of the time although aside from occasional uses of the n-word, Chandler doesn't exploit stereotypes as much as most of the films of the time period. Marlowe's attitude toward marijuana also seems to be fairly non-judgmental, unlike what one would expect of many of the law enforcers of that time.Marlowe is a collection of contradictions. On one hand, he can be as brutal and deadly as he needs to be although I don't recall him intentionally killing anyone. In this novel, I don't believe he kills anyone at all. On the other, he is sensitive to washed up losers such as Jessie Florian and he seems to want to believe that others are as principled as he is. Unlike many other popular private eyes, he seems at least somewhat cultured and even quotes Shakespeare on a couple of occasions. If one accepts the prose style as the creation of Marlowe rather than as simply the mouthpiece for Raymond Chandler, then Marlowe has a very poetic view of his world and describes it in metaphors that have been parodied to death and yet Marlowe has used the perfect set of words to describe what he sees.Chandler's plots have been criticized for their contrivance and implausibility. Implausible they may be, but plots are not why I read Raymond Chandler's Marlowe stories. I'm reading them for the reasons I enumerated. I am reading them for the unique world view of a character who wears the necessary armor to do battle in a corrupt world and yet wants to believe in a world of chivalry and moral order."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler creates a world of grime and crime in his second novel Farewell, My Lovely. Protagonist and private detective Phillip Marlowe falls into a case when he's taken into an old nightclub with a large ex-con named Moose Malloy. Malloy is looking for his girl Velma, but it seems that the place has been taken under new ownership. Malloy winds up killing a man there, unable to control his temper, but that isn't Marlowe's only trouble. He goes along for the ride on a jewelry ranson deal where his client is brutally beaten to death. Things get stranger and stranger the more things happen, and plenty does.Even if you've seen any or all of the movie versions, you'll probably find yourself guessing to the very end. How? Because Chandler creates a world like no other, a world truly his own. He preferred Dick Powell as Marlowe in the 40s noir film Murder, My Sweet, an adaptation of this book.Chandler has an amazing grasp of the Marlowe character. Every line is distinct and memorable. Despite the lurid setting, you'll probably find yourself laughing at Marlowe's wit and sarcasm. This is no childrens' book, but it's an indulgent read. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I purchased this Audiobook on Cd, being familiar with Raymond Chandler as an author, but having never read any. I bought this solely for Ed Bishop being in it. It turns out I really totally enjoyed this book being dramatized. I have since purchased the other Marlowe plays available. I love the honesty, though brutal at times, of Marlowe's character. To me he is a dedicated, likeable guy who gets the job done and done well. For anybody who enjoys the old radio plays from years ago..this is a must for you. Any mega fan of actor Ed Bishop, (like me who totally fell in love with him years ago) this is also a must to own!

This novel reads like a Quentin Tarantino production where every one seems clich&eacute; cool, moves swift, and screams with devious intentions. The main detective Philip Marlowe knows the underground world around Southern California as he is initially recruited to find stolen jewels but ultimately stumbles upon a murder case full of twists and turns. Crime follows everywhere he goes as he meets gamblers, fraud, vixens, con men, prostitutes, poor, and rich. This books relishes in the criminal underground and that is exactly what makes this novel such an enticing read. Perhaps one of the greatest attributes of this book is the fact that Marlowe, like the rest of us, is not flawless. Rather than being the astute Sherlock Holmes, this gifted sleuth has normal problems which we all can relate to. He never seems invincible and always seems to be on the verge of trouble which ultimately makes the book more enjoyable. The only drawback is by the end of the book I had already guessed the criminal, but then again, I may have just gotten lucky."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Farewell My Lovely puts Chandler's detective hero, Philip Marlowe on the trail of Moose Malloy, a hulking ex-convict who's looking for his ex-girlfriend Velma. Marlowe stumbles upon Malloy as he tears up a bar looking for her. Velma had worked there when the bar had a white clientele. The place has the same name but is now for coloreds only. Molloy murders the bar's owner. The police are uninterested since the victim was a person of color. Marlowe looks into the case on his own initiative, even though no client has hired him to do so. A mysterious wealthy playboy hires Marlowe to be his bodyguard at a ransom exchange. Marlowe is knocked unconscious and his client is murdered. The story proceeds from there with all the loose threads being tied together at the end. There are a lot of plot points that don't make much sense.Bay City is a fictitious town abutting Los Angeles where a good part of the story takes place. It is a haven for crooked cops, corrupt politicians, quack doctors, phony psychics, and illegal casino gambling. Marlowe makes a huge effort, risking his life several times, to meet Brunette, the mob boss that runs Bay City. That effort seems worthwhile only in hindsight. The climactic confrontation between Marlowe, Molloy and the missing girlfriend seems contrived. All of that is unimportant. Raymond Chandler's novels are appealing more for their witty dialogue and clever metaphors than for their stories. Farewell My Lovely's best line describes Moose Malloy's girlfriend: \\"It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window.\\" Molloy himself is described as follows: \\"He looked as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.\\" Pure genius."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"With smooth moves across the literary dance floor, author Raymond Chandler has his way with his partner, the fortunate reader. Without a word too much or too little, Chandler created a style both casual and elegant. His lead character in this work, private detective Phillip Marlowe, must solve a murder, one that is connected to gambling, beautiful women, guns and danger. If you like the sleek style of the 1930's or 40's, then this writer is probably the one for you.\\"She got out a gold cigarette case from her bag and I went over and held a match for her. She blew a vague plume of smoke and watched it with half shut-eyes.\\"Sit close to me,\\" she said suddenly.\\"Let's talk a little first.\\"\\"About what? Oh...my jade?\\"\\"About murder.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I recently listened to the unabridged version of this book narrated by Elliott Gould, and while Chandler's glimpse of 1940's era Los Angeles was surely entertaining, I still like Dashiell Hammett's \\"Continental Op\\" novels better. In Farewell, My Lovely, private dick Philip Marlowe starts out working for a barber on a minor job and unrealistically stumbles onto a murder by a hulk of an ex-con, looking for his old girl Velma in a club where she used to work. Marlowe then is mysteriously contacted out of the blue to provide security for a shady jewel transaction, in which a rich dandy is to attempt to buy back some precious jade from the thieves who stole it.The novel moves at a brisk pace, and while some of the plot twists seem a little forced, they are entertaining nonetheless. One of my main problems with the story is that Marlowe seems to spend most of the novel putting his life in danger, getting knocked out, shot at or drugged, without much of an incentive to get involved. He often seems to be acting on his own, without a paying client, despite warnings from the police to stay away coupled with the obvious dangers. Hammett's continental op, in novels like The Dain Curse, at least had a paying client ordering him to snoop into the multi-layered mysteries, with significant insurance money at stake.Ultimately, without giving away too much of the story, Chandler does a pretty good job of throwing a lot of balls in the air and wrapping up most of the loose ends by story's end. Some threads are left unresolved, like the whereabouts and motives of the mysterious doctor and psychic in Bay City, but most of the rest of the plot makes sense. LIke another reviewer said, at the end of the novel, while you may have enjoyed the ride, you are left with somewhat of an empty feeling.As for the narration, I expected a little more from Mr. Gould, an accomplished stage and screen actor who seems to sleepwalk his way through the beginning of the book as if he was handed a copy of the novel, a microphone, and told to read. He later changes pace a little, adopting different voices for different characters, but I found the voices ill-suited to the characters and sometimes caricatures of policemen or gangsters, as if the novel was a scene from a \\"Bowery Boys\\" episode."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Tough guy, hot woman that might leave you with a bullet lodged in your back, lies and double dealing all served up on a corrupt California landscape.

Usually it is when you think they will get away with it.R HemingwayPast Twilight"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In this his second adventure, private detective Philip Marlowe - more or less in between cases - pokes his inquisitive nose where it doesn't belong. Encountering a behemoth of an ex-con, Moose Malloy, on the street, Marlowe follows the big man into a bar and witnesses a murder. And before the reader can ask, \\"Where's my Velma?\\" - the question makes sense when you read the novel - Marlowe finds himself embroiled in police corruption, a blackmail scam, chasing a gang of jewelry thieves, another murder and encounters a young female who becomes his pseudo-partner, a psychic con-man, a crooked doctor and is propositioned by beautiful young woman who is married to a much older and very wealthy man. All the while Marlowe attempts to keep tabs on Moose.If possible the plot/story-line of Farewell, My Lovely is even more convoluted than its predecessor, The Big Sleep. Marlowe meeting new players with each twist and turn of the investigation and getting physically bounced around on a regular basis. (For the politically correct there are a handful of racial slurs which may make the reader cringe.) But somehow the author ties it all together in the end with maybe a not so neat bow.This being a Chandler novel there are plenty of classic \\"Marlowe-isms\\".

Moose Malloy is bigger then nearly everyone else and not overly bright but he is dead set on finding his Velma, last seen eight years before when Moose got turned into the cops for a bank job he pulled with some others. Marlowe witnesses Moose in action, while on a case, and gets sucked into the search for the big guy and his long lost honey by one cop while being warned off by another. But Marlowe is too bull-headed to do anything but keep pushing and, surprisingly, not particularly bright, since he keeps getting suckered and hit over the head and put at serious risk of his life. Situations he ought to see coming, as an experienced detective, he seems to persistently misread, perhaps because his liking for liquor has blurred his senses or maybe he just isn't a very good investigator. But, whatever the case, he stumbles on, from one life threatening situation to another. He also can't seem to get his arms around the fuzzy set of coincidences that follow hard on the heels of his run-in with Moose as he gets a job offer that anyone in his business with half a brain would walk away from . . . and then mishandles it badly. The seedy atmosphere of L.A. is very nicely handled and the characters sharply limned and convincing, but the perpetually soused Marlowe, with the self-defeating wise-cracks and nasty mouth is a little tiresome. I had a bit of trouble acclimating myself to the racist mindset that Marlowe and his cohorts present in this 40's milieu, too, since I thought it was somewhat gratuitous and even mean-spirited, but maybe that's how some folks thought in those days. More troubling was my profound sense that Marlowe was just not bright enough, or slick enough, to be a half-decent private eye. He seems, in this book, to have a death-wish, a bad trait for someone who hires himself out as bodyguard and investigator. He takes chances a green kid shouldn't take and never seems to see the blackjack coming. Still, he manages to stumble along, thanks to a combination of apparently undeserved good luck and just plain hard-headedness, until the cause of all his troubles unfolds itself before his and our eyes. Surprisingly, given his drink-induced obtuseness, he solves the mysterious set of coincidences that have led to so much murder and betrayal, and gets the girl who wants him though he's too tough to ever openly acknowledge wanting her. This was a very odd detective tale, if ever there was one, and yet, for all its irritations and flaws it kept me reading to a most satisfying conclusion that pretty much wraps the central problem up in an almost too-tight, neatly tied bow. Moose finds what he was looking for and Marlowe figures out how to find Moose and the killer of Marlowe's mysterious client is unmasked. Marlowe, of course, has another drink. -- SWM"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This is a great novel for so many reasons. The dialogue is clever without descending into cuteness. The supporting cast of characters is a truly fascinating one. The descriptions of places are vivid. Be they the homes of the obscenely rich or rundown slum dwellings. The intricate plot unfolds in a way that really holds the reader's interest with a couple of nice plump red herrings thrown in for good measure.As always, Marlowe himself is tough as nails and completely hard-boiled. Except that towards the end of the book, he surprises us by becoming sentimental. This uncharacteristic sentimentality is not directed toward either of the two female love interests. But rather toward a tall, violet eyed boatman named Red who helps Marlowe in his hour of need. You really have to admire Raymond Chandler for knowing just when to interject the unexpected.I would love to give Farewell, My Lovely 5 stars, but I have to deduct 1 star. The reason? I can't for the life of me understand what the killer hoped to gain by commiting murder in the first place.If Mr. Chandler were still alive, I'm sure he would address that particular concern in the manner of a college professor talking to a kindergartener. I can just imagine him saying: \\"Reality is not straightforward. Only in the world of fiction are motives clearly defined and unambiguous. My writing is meant to reflect real life.\\" {From The Big Sleep (1939)- \\"It had the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled woof of fact.\\"}"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I finished THE BIG SLEEP in a few days and was so impressed by the book, I immediately bought FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. Another great novel by Chandler.The book begins with Marlowe being pulled into a barroom mishap when an ex-con is looking for his girl. Once Marlowe finishes with the police reports, he thinks his day is over. At the office he receives a phone call from a man who needs his help. The man asks Marlowe to accompany him to a 'business' meeting. This is only the beginning of a twisted mystery which Marlowe is faced with solving.Once again Chandler does a great job of weaving various stories and characters in an effortless manner which takes the reader easily through the mystery. I look forward to reading another Marlowe mystery...they are pure joy!"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler's creation, Philip Marlowe, is a character that has influenced modern fiction greatly. Without Marlowe the archetype of \\"private dick\\" would not carry the cultural weight that it does today. It is true that the plot lines of many Chandler works are contorted to the point of no return, but it is not the plot that counts. The reason why these books are so successful is because we the reader become enthralled by Marlowe and his immediate knowledge of all things that surround him. Because Chandler made Marlowe such a carefully wrought character, Farewell, My Lovely becomes an examination of the human character rather than a list of dastardly deeds committed by crooks without depth. Every scene is an interaction between fully developed characters. He defines himself in relation to the people and actions that whirl in and out of his life. Marlowe offers us plenty of insight into his opinion of his relations. Because he is such an endearing person we want to believe every word he says. He is a product of the LA scene where he works. We the reader build confidence in our hero because he is capable of sizing up any situation immediately. Slowly we learn to trust Marlowe's way of navigating the underbelly of LA. I truly enjoyed Farewell, My Lovely because Chandler forces through Marlowe an undeniable wit and charm. He will make you laugh and draw you into his brand of thinking about other characters. I wonder sometimes when reading Chandler about how Marlowe would size me up. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about interesting characters and loves a wry wit and dark charm."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I hated how 1940 racism suppurated in this story and nobody saw anything wrong with it.I didn't like how sometimes I didn't understand what was happening, but then neither did Philip Marlowe.By the time I didn't understand I was mesmerized by red neon flashing further and further across grimy hotel ceilings, the damp smell of sage in the canyons that flared my nostrils, the scraping of pebbles pulled by the ocean tide.I liked seeing how words can be magic.Here is a random paragraph (truly) about the same as you'll find on any page in this book: \\"After a while there was a faint smell of the ocean. Not very much, but as if they had kept this much just to remind people this had once been a clean open beach where the waves came in and creamed and the wind blew and you could smell something besides hot fat and cold sweat.\\"I loved seeing how paragraphs can also be poems."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Given Chandler's enormity I'm feeling (as I did with Austen) more like I'll be reviewed than him - and this is complicated by the fact that I've been too busy lately to get to the review soon after reading the book. Anyway, with these disclaimers I'll push on.Great stuff - Chandler really has his own voice, mood and characters. Indeed, he's quite self-conscious in this book, having Anne Riordan remonstrate with Marlowe about how he *should* have run and concluded his investigation in a more traditional and elegant fashion:\\"You ought to have given a dinner party ... and you at the head of the long table telling all about it, little by little, with your charming light smile and a phony English accent..\\"Marlowe responds for Chandler, \\"It's not that kind of story. It's not lithe and clever. It's just dark and full of blood.\\"Interesting that Chandler felt he had to justify his deliberate departure from the classic mannered English detective story - or was he just enjoying highlighting the contrast?And it's not *just* dark and full of blood: there's flirting, camaraderie, humour, honour, and even a romantic ending. Still, along the way Marlowe takes a hell of a beating given his somewhat inexplicable method - which involves identifying particularly dangerous individuals and locations and just walking in without preparation, protection or backup. If you somehow manage to still be breathing after they've pounded you for a while, you've got some more clues to your case. And you even get the (nice) girl on your own terms:\`You're so marvellous,' she said, \`So brave, so determined, and you work for so little money. Everybody beats you over the head and chokes you and smacks your jaw and fills you with morphine, but you just keep right on hitting between tackle and end until they're all worn out. What makes you so wonderful?\`Go on,' I growled, \`Spill it.'Anne Riordan said thoughtfully: \`I'd like to be kissed, damn you!'So who's reviewing this book - me or Chandler?Marlowe is a pretty cool pro, but anything but a schemer. He throws himself in the ring and improvises. He blurs the lines, liking some of the bad guys a bit much, being rough and coarse - but then bugging the good guys by showing he's read a bit and can show more chivalry than they do. And just what was going on with \`Mrs Grayle' and the midnight assignation which could have ended very differently:\`I bet it's fun to be played by handsome blondes,' Anne Riordan said. \`Even if there is a little risk. As, I suppose, there usually is.'I didn't say anything.He's quite a contrast with the cold, aloof (but still troubled) Sherlock Holmes. If getting involved might cloud his judgement a bit, hey, what the hell...Chandler has a knack for making his characters shine - Marlowe is actually a bit of a soft touch, he can empathise, and from his perspective we find things to draw us to them the way he is. An odd thing in his in other ways very bleak, rough world."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is such an amazing book. From the first page, this novel does what all Chandler books do-- transports you to a whole 'nother world, so real it feels like you're actually there. FML is such an awe-inspiring accomplishment for the immensely talented man of letters, Raymond Chandler. Most of the time I was absolutely floored, just sitting there with my mouth wide open, marvelling at his genius. Writing is hardly ever this good, and when it is, the great stuff usually isn't the abundance of the book (as RC's is), rather, it's in little snippets here and there. There must be a God, because Chandler's writing makes me realize the potential of us humans to transcend the ordinary and be what he is-- extraordinary. Not to mention that the mystery will have you guessing all the way through, and even without the cynical prose (yes, I said prose) which manages to be beautifully ugly and positively negative at the same time (I told you he was a genius), is excellent in of itself. So, I urge every person who hasn't yet done so to read Raymond Chandler. He is not just a mystery writer (which usually means sub-standard literature) but he totally, without a doubt, transcended the genre. I guarantee his writing will blow you away. His clever, cheeky remarks, his sarcasm, his minimalistic prose, his cynical outlook, the dames, the coppers, the criminals-- that and more is what you can look forward to in this masterpiece of the English language."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"For me the main pleasure of reading this novel derives from wisecracks zinging on almost every page. Here are a couple, plucked randomly:The coffee shop smell was strong enough to build a garage on.A bogus heartiness, as weak as a Chinaman's tea, moved into her face and voice.And here is another one, a shot at Hemingway, as Marlowe explains a corrupt cop why he keeps calling him by that name: \\"A guy that keeps saying the same thing over and over until you begin to believe it must be good.\\"Hemingway may not be a great writer -- I'm not a big fan -- but he was a far better one than Chandler. That little charming fish story of his alone has (rightfully) much greater literary acclaim than all of Chandler's works put together.Still, Raymond Chandler is a pleasure to read. He has a tremendous gift for storytelling. The wisecracks, the colorful characters, and the snappy dialogue make reading this novel, as well his other ones a pleasant experience, especially on lazy, boozy weekend afternoons. Nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Being a fan of \\"modern\\" mysteries, I always enjoy picking up a \\"classic\\" such as \\"Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"I,the Jury.\\" THis was my first Chandler novel. I won't say I liked this book as much as the others mentioned yet reading it made me think of a dialog line from the first \\"National Treasure\\" film where Nicholas Cage reads the Declaration of Independence and says \\"they just don't talk like that anymore.\\" The same holds true here; the characters, the way they talk, and the way a bottle of booze can take care of everything captures the time and makes you understand what made Chandler so revered up to this day.As so many great novels do, the story line is secondary to you getting engrossed in the time period, the city of Los Angeles, the hero(??), private eye Philip Marlow, and those he meets up with. As some have mentioned, the plot seems somewhat disjointed early on. It almost borders on Quentin Tarantino movie territory in that you have to wait awhile for a couple of separate incidents to come together in order to grasp the entire story. Marlowe literally stumbles into the middle of a couple of murders and the women, bad guys, and good guys that Marlow comes across makes for a sometimes confusing yet very interesting novel.A good novel but, for me, not as much fun as Spillane or engrossing as Hammett's classic work. Still, this is the kind of book you read, enjoy, and say as you are closing that book cover, \\"they don't make 'em like they used to.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I started reading Raymond Chandler after the author of one of my favorite new authors of last year, Richard K. Morgan, was compared left and right to him. The comparison was apt, and Morgan should be flattered, because Chandler is a genius.Farewell, My Lovely is Chandler's second book, and features his hero, Philip Marlowe, a smart-mouthed, hard-boiled private dick who is straight as an arrow. I had read that The Big Sleep, Chandler's first book, was his best, and that they descended in quality chronologically. But after reading this book, I know that is wrong. This is one of the best stories I've read in a long time. not only is the wonderful noir narrative there, but the mystery is first-rate."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Ah Chandler. And Phillip Marlowe his private eye. This is the second time for this novel, but it's been so long it was like reading it for the first time. The characters, descriptions, and plot are vivid and complex. Marlowe witnesses the murder of a bar owner in the black side of town (1940s LA) by a big lug ex-con, Moose Malloy. Malloy is in search of his lost love, Velma who used to sing here when it was a white bar. This simple set-up embroils Marlowe knee deep in connected crimes. Well done, by a master."},{"Title":"Better Man","review":"I enjoyed the descriptions of daily life in an Indian village. Other than that, this book had a lot to dislike. For starters, the language was too contrived: \\"...she let him grope the curves of her breasts and tease the nubs into nibbly nuts...\\" \\"Then in Bhasi's eyes, Mukundan saw the star he had sought in the heavens shine and burn\\". The storyline was equally aggravating. This could have easily been the plot of a high-school movie: newcomer (Mukundan) is scared and wants nothing more than belong. He makes friends with a dweeb (Bhasi), who is genuinely concerned about him. He finds true love (Anjana). But when the \\"in\\" clique starts paying attention to the newcomer, he mistreats those who care about him. Through a series of events, he eventually realizes what a rat he's been and makes ammends.Honestly, i'd rather watch or read the high-school version!"},{"Title":"Better Man","review":"With many a fiction being released with exotic corners of the world in the backdrop, \`The Better Man' has the entire recipe for a potential blockbuster in that category, but for some reason fails to emulate even a \`God of Small Things'. The reason, I believe lies in the basics of writing: the author failed to identify the audience of the book. With the globalization taking the literary world on stride, it is hard, but still important for the producer (author) to clearly identify the consumer (reader) for success (effective communication).The story of Kaikkurussi has all the ingredients for an interesting netherworld tale. There is the curious Bhasi who can look into the minds and cure them with the help of exotic herbs and pure commonsense. There is the protagonist Mukundan, who discovers and rediscovers himself with the help of Bhasi. There are the images of death, tyranny, submission, defiance and ultimate tragedy of the various other characters with the Kerala social setup in the background. But the author fails to build the necessary background for a person unfamiliar with the society to digest all this. At the same time, for a native, the book does not provide anything new or exciting as there have been similar books written before, albeit in the local vernacular. It appears Anita Nair had the former category of readers in mind.I would point to Marquez's Macondo (One Hundred Years of Solitude) as the epitome of the stories of other lands, factual or fictitious. It is amazing how skillfully and seamlessly Marquez weaves the strands of the land, people, society, culture and times of Macondo with a strong story line in the foreground. May be that is a little unfair a benchmark to new writers like Nair."},{"Title":"Better Man","review":"Set in the Malabar region of Kerala, this story shows how Nair can weave imagination with realism. Mukundan Nair, the protagonist returns to his village to be overshadowed by his tyrannical father. His fear of his father does eventually diminish with the end of the book as he emerges as the better man. But on the way, he enlists the help of One-screw-loose Bhasi who plies him with herbs and at one point has him sitting in a clay urn which is in the shape of a woman's womb, so that he can be born again without his emotional hangups! Mukundan is a man whose character is under attack. He can succumb to greed and flattery, but he doesn't. He wins the respect of the villagers without loosing his own self-esteem. Nair is a natural storyteller but what I like is that she doesn't turn India into exotica."},{"Title":"Better Man","review":"A simple tale told in a very beautiful manner. With the use of simple language, but still not losing the charm, Anitha Nair has done a wonderful job. Simplicity, detailing of characters and environment, and a good story are the trade marks of this book. Picturized in the malabar region of kerala, in a village called kaikurussi, the novel tells the story of a man,Mukundan who returns to his village to settle down after retirement. But he realizes that his life is still in the clutches of his tyrant father, whom he was always afraid of. He starts believing that he's indirectly responsible for his mothers death. He even starts hallucinating of his mother's ghosts. It takes the help of a painter by name Bhasi (who is known as one screw loose bhasi) to help him out of his misery and realize that his fears are baseless. Mukundan is made to be reborn out of a clay urn, shaped like a woman's womb. But soon mukundan dismisses bhasi and his love anjana for the sake of power and name in the village. Later at the end of the story mukundan regains his diginity and emerges as The Better Man free from his fears. Anitha nair has taken the finest care to portray the village ,the villagers, their beliefs and customs. Truly a brilliant work."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I'll cut it short, just took the A+ hardware test today and passed after some here and there experience, and reading this book in one weekend in about a day and a half, whew what a long night, suprisingly I did very well. The questions at the end of the chapters and on the CD-ROM literally read like for the most part the questions on the actual tests. I'm not kidding, not sure why other people say the books questions and cd-rom don't match the level of the tests. This I found to be quite the opposite. The font type almost looks the same. I blew threw ten question is about a minute. Perhaps the test should be harder. I thought I was reading the questions from the end of chapters while I was taking the actual tests, actually I was suprised at how clear and uncomplicated the questions and choices actually were. Trust me the Transcender and Measure Up tests are far more difficult in the way they question or word their questions, so in a sense they probably over prepare you which is never a bad thing. Actually if there is probably one seriously wrong thing about this book is that it tells you too much. More detail than the level that you are tested on. The A+ test is very practical, a good concentrated reading and an outline study session and lookover of this books contents will help you pass the hardware exam. Of course the best prep is the COMPTIA objectives themselves located on the COMPTIA website. I did however only rate this book four stars for a couple of reasons and for reasons I think could be improved in the new upcoming edition that is already available for pre-purchase. I think that through the book there should be some kind of key throughout the text to the COMPTIA objectives. Also more coverage of electricity, viruses, virus prevention, backups, and networking would make the book more infomrative, I was worried the scant coverage of these topics would pop up on the test so I turned to the Andrews book' to inform me of these topics as her book goes more in depth. Other than the occasional oddness and weirdness that perhaps might appear on the test like some oddball knowledge questions, a thorough reading and understanding of this books questions will get you through."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews I read here, but if I could do it over, I would &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; buy this book.Issue #1This book has A LOT of errors. The author's website dismisses all the mistakes by saying, &quot;All printed material has mistakes.&quot; First, I doubt that &quot;all&quot; have mistakes. Second, this book has A LOT of mistakes. I have many books and this one has the most errors. I went to their site to get the errata and found a mistake in their corrections!Issue #2The CD that comes with the book is quirky and it's not easy to find all stuff that's supposed to be on it.Issue #3Now that LearnKey is defunct, you cannot get a code to unlock the rest of the info on the CD.

Fortuneatly, with the help of this book, I scored in the high 80's on both sections. From top to bottom, the everything you need to know for the test is there.

The Comptia exams for A+ certification changed AGAIN after the release of this book and there are several questions on the A+ exam that you will be totally clueless about if you rely on the text and, even more so, the CD-ROM sample tests in this book. The CD tests contained therein are simplistic and do not cover hardly a thing that's contained in the actual test...in fact, the CD tests in this book don't even test you on much of anything you were to learn from the book...just 49 random questions that will have you staring at the screen during a Comptia A+ exam wondering what in the world they mean by that...very disappointing considering I once beleived this was THE book to use to pass the A+ exams."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I studied for the exam ONLY USING THIS BOOK AND MADE 85 percent!

So in one month this book becomes obsolete. Keep an eye out for the updated edition that should be published shortly.All of that aside this is a great book. Beginning with historical back ground then bringing the reader &quot;up to date&quot; helps make these ideas stick. After each chapter there are sample questions that insure you are truly getting it.Add to that the bonus CD with practice tests and useful utilities that you, as an official CompTIA certified technician, might actually use in the field and you got a no brainer.Five stars!"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This book was very good but it didn't cover everything on the exam.

It definitely helped a lot but I will be looking for other sources before I retake the test."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. I have the impression that it is the result of a quick update to its older edition without being focused on the newer material on the A+ exams.

Meyers is remarkable and this book is a must have for those serious about A+.Again. Meyers manages to pack more information 960 plus pages than any other book I have read on the subject. Meyers is a class that no one else will ever attain. His amazing ability to detail A+ makes him the most respected name in the industry.Packed with picture, diagrams, tables, and figures, you'll have trouble understanding or comprehending the ideas and concepts laid out in this book. Utilize the question and answers and you have an unbeatable combination for success.Meyers once again gives you and excellent glossary of terms, a cd with 2 core and 2 dos/windows exams plus utilities. Stop wasting time with the others and get the only book you'll need - great job MIKE!"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I've been teching for a long time (10+ years) so most of the A+ topics were stuff I already knew. This book did a great job of keeping my interest while going over material I was familiar with, and explained the stuff I didn't know in a very clear and concise manner. I found some of the illustrations a little cutesy and grating (computer components talking to each other via little cartoon word balloons) but thats probably just me...As others have mentioned, the CD is not nearly as impressive as the book. The instructional video is interesting, Myers does a good job of going over the fundamentals of hardware, but it moves kind of slow. The sample exam questions were just bad. I had to download a patch from the TotalSem website before they'd even run on my Win98 machine, and even then the graphics were so bad I often had trouble determining which answers I'd selected.Still, I was able to nail both exams with just this book and about 25 hours of study time. I'd recommend it highly whether you're a computer newcomer, or an old hand who just needs to fill in the gaps."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I bought this book to supplement the reading material I was given as part of the A+ course I recently completed. I found the book to be reasonbly thorough in it's coverage of the exam material with a definite objective of teaching the reader about PCs and not solely being an exam prep. As with any book of this nature, the author must make a subjective decision as to what material to cover and in what depth. No exception here. However, as a companion reference source I was very happy with the product and would recommend it as such. I was able to pass both exams on the first attempt with scores in the 90s, but I don't believe this would have been possible if I had relied on a single book."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I was so psyched when I started reading this book. A third of the way through the disappointment set in. Near the end I was bitter towards the writer and grinding my teeth realizing how much time I had wasted.I'm confident that Michael Myers is competent in the field of computer repair and knows what he is talking about. My feeling is that the Third Edition was rushed to press to meet the 2001 exam update and the editing suffered severely because of it. They were so hasty you'll actually find editor's notes alongside several of the pages, completely missed - totally unprofessional.There are so many typos, inconsistencies, and copy editing errors you'll find yourself focusing on those rather than learning the material. I ended up having to backtrack through chapters because of the mistakes. My satisfied study sessions quickly turned into anxious fact-finding hunts and puzzling wonderings of, &quot;I'm confused; didn't he say something different earlier?&quot;After you muddle through the lengthy chapters, Myers offers a ten-question quiz - no review, just a quiz. One of the chapters offers a quiz where three of the answers are incorrect. It takes a short time to realize this, so you sit there wondering how you got the answers wrong and trying to find the information that you supposedly didn't understand. Then you realize that you were actually correct and, in fact, Myers offered the incorrect answers. An eerie feeling sinks in as you begin to wonder how many of the answers on previous chapter quizzes were marked wrong but actually right, and vice versa.Due to all the aforementioned problems, I found myself questioning the validity of the information. This is maddening, especially given the fact that I'm studying for an exam that can make or break a job opportunity for me.I gave this edition two stars rather than one just because after you wade through the fluff it did cover a lot of information on the exams. Due to the inconsistencies, though, I ended up studying from other materials for the tests. If Myers were to cut down on the drivel, correct the multitude of errors, and add a review at the end of each chapter, it would be a worthwhile read. With work, I'm sure the Fourth Edition could be much more effective. This edition was pitiful - a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I have been a computer tech for some time now, but I finally decided to make it official by taking the A+ exam. Looking for a book that would help me see how the exam would be like, what types of questions would be asked, etc. I must say that I was very surprised at the quality of the book! The author goes into detail on everything you need to know about the exam and about the profession of techs in general. It's obvious that he knows what he's talking about! The text is excellent, the test questions are very similar to what was on the exam, so I highly recommend it. About the only semi-sore spot was the weird software that came with the cd, as the practice exams on it would only install on one of my five computers, and on that system it tended to crash a lot. But the video that was on the cd was great, even if he (The author) was a bit over-enthusiastic with the subject matter. =) This book now sits above my main system for easy reference, and I use it for that purpose more times than I would have thought. You can't go wrong with the book!"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"Very good book. Helped me pass both A+ exams the first time. I have been in the IT field for about 5 years, so I already had a good overall PC knowledge, but had to pass the A+ before I can become IBM certified for work. Reading this book cover to cover filled in a lot of the gaps in my knowledge.I took all the practice exams at the end of each chapter and all of the tests on the CD. I did come across several questions that we just out right wrong on the CD. I agree with several other reviewers that the book was much better than the CD. Overall, I still give the book 5 stars because the content was there, very complete, and very up to date...including Windows 2000.

I used it as an additional supplemental book to the PC Repair/A+ Certification course I took. It gave me the needed edge and push to pass the exams.Meyer's book is VERY easy to read and follow and is also extremely comprehensive, particularly for the Core objectives. The diagrams and charts, both technical pictures, diagrams and cartoons illustrate his points very well. The book is written in a way that explains extremely well how the technology develops. Meyers makes a strong effort to make sure you understand the concepts which is very important for passing the exam. He does more than &quot;prep you for the exam.&quot; He preps you for a career as a technician. I believe this book will be great for &quot;beginners.&quot; It you are an experienced technician who just wants to get ready for the exam, this book may be more &quot;remedial&quot; for you.After reading the book you come away with a great understanding of how computers work. It may not be so much of a &quot;study&quot; book. I think of it more as a &quot;foundation&quot; book. After reading it though, I believe you come away with more than enough knowledge to pass the exam because the book gives you that strong foundation.Whether or not this book is your &quot;one-stop&quot; resource for passing the exam is more a matter of the individual. For myself, I took a prep class and used additional training software. This book filled in many of the gaps for me and did n fact provide me with additional and stronger background into the technologies.Summing it up, I can only see this book as a help for you in your quest to become A+ Certified. It won't hurt you. It worked for me.Good: VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND EASY TO READ. Great for novices. Awesome prep tool for the Core in particular. The author shows a true mastery and understanding of the technologies and he passes it on well. Easy to follow charts and illustrations. Comes with CD-ROM with four 25 question practices tests with additional &quot;locked&quot; practice tests that can be bought for a fee of $79. FREEBIES!!! The CD also comes with diagnostic software you can use on the job or at home. Definite winner!!!!So-so: Practice tests are okay. I used the free ones that come with the book. Not bad, but you may find better practice testing software out there (like MCP Prep or NIIT) Coverage for the Windows/DOS portion was not as extensive as the Core, but still adequate. He goes over EVERYTHING you need to know.Bad: If you are a seasoned tech this book may go into TOO MUCH depth for you. You may consider a regular &quot;study guide&quot; like the Exam Cram book.Note: Keep in mind though, the A+ exam will be revised in Jan. 31, 2001, so this book will not be current. However, given his track record, I would think his future updated editions will be just as comprehensive and effective. Meyers is a winner."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I read through this book once and it was really in depth in a lot of the areas it was all I needed to pass the exam and it was a great source."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"For anyone hoping this book kills two birds with one stone by covering OS as well as Core, think again. I just passed the core exam using this book as my main source of study, no doubt about it, it covers all you need to know for the hardware exam, it sometimes covers more than you need to know in that area. As far as OS goes, it really fails big time, im going to get the Meyers &quot;Passport&quot; book to help me as I prepare for OS, ive heard good things about it.

I needed only a month,in the evenings after work to study for them, and I used only this book and the original MS-DOS 5.0 manual.It's so enjoyable , I read it twice, once from page 1 to the end, like a novel, and then did it again slowly, getting really into each chapter.Use the CD! The tests in it are very good, and you can get many more, in a special CD-Rom if you connect to Mr. Meyers site. Don't bother trying to get the number key to open other tests, that company went broke.I couldn't get the CD with the exams because they, the sales people, seem to be unable to obtain the cost of shipping and handling (Mr. Meyers should get an assistant!) but, really, now I don't care anymore, I approved both tests anyways ( I saved over $70!) :-)When you finish the exams they ask to fill a survey, one of the questions asked how much you spent preparing for the tests.I only spend the cost of this book! (less than $100 was my choice)There are very few mistakes, particularly in the answers of some tests at the end of each chapter, but you can get them rigth.I know somewhere in the author site there is (was?) a list of the mistakes, but I was unable to find it. They did a good job hidding it. A pity really.I recommend absolutely this book, I wish that all authors were so pedagogic, it's so easy to understand everything! (only Dan Gookin was easier, try its \\"C for Dummies\\"!!!)Perhaps Mr. Meyers can write also for the MCSE, that's my next stop."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This book was my major source of information and although it had a few errors it was the book with the least errors of the 4 that I read. This book goes into a little more detail than the test requires but it is very thorough and great for a beginner. Although it was my favorite, I would not recommend this book as your only study material if you are a beginner."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This book goes far beyond A+ Exams. It is also a great reference book. Most chapters are easy to understand, with the exception of the memory management chapter. I read this book for one week and used the Exam Cram Practice Tests and passed with 88% core &amp; 92% DOS/Windows. My Windows 3.1 knowledge was lacking, but this book helped me in this area. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"Well, this book covers it all,but all of the typos in the review questions are just unbelievable. Those that have read it know what I'm talking about. And as others have noted, the software basically stinks. Just to run the practice exams, I had to download a patch and hope for the best. Well I took my Core Hardware exam last week and thank god the server went down toward the end, because the practice tests that came with the book were nothing like the actual test. So I left and reverted to Trancender Study material which is very much like the test. I dont recommend this book, its a lot of reading to find out it didnt help at all."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"The book is easy to read with good analogies, the book can be better illustrated but in general a good book with a lot of information that is presented in an easy to understand format.Excellent for the beginner, may be a little too slow if you have more than 4 yrs of break/fix experience."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I just got the book and I must say that I am learning more by reading the book then my professor in college who taught A+ I am about to take the test and I truly feel confident now that I have the Michael Meyers A+ book.One thing Im sadden about is that in Michael Meyers \\"Third Edition\\" for A+ he included in his book a poster in full color of a motherboard and it's features. But in the forth edition he left it out.I would really like to find out how can i go about getting a poster do detailed oriented so that I can just have and study.If anyone knows please email me.....Thank you very much,Irene :-)"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I bought this book hoping that it would help me vastly in getting my A+ certification. I read the book cover to cover and did all the practice exams many times. I took the core hardware part of the test and passed. I read the book's O/S part over and over again until i couldnt take it anymore and went up for the test. None of the questions in the book matched up to the real A+ test. So i just figured i didnt study it enough and pick up enough so i read it all through again and again until i could practically recite the book from memory and i failed again. This book goes into details about topics that it does not need to and it just a waste of you time when it comes to the O/S part. It helped somewhat on the hardware part of the test. Do not just use this book as your primary means of studying for the A+ exam."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"Written for novices and experienced techs. Micheal Meyers A+ book was all I needed to pass the A+ exam. Why? Mike Meyers writes his book in a way that shows you what you need to know, in a way you can understand and not lose interest in, even with a sense of humor here and there. The diagrams are great. This book is meant for people of all learning styles. Everything on the test was on this book, the CD roms practice tests are very useful. I can keep writing paragraphs and paragraphs why this book is great but let me put it like this. Do you want to pass the A+ exam? Do you want to be an efficiant Computer Tech? Do you hardly know anything about troubleshooting or computer hardware for that matter? Do you want to take the first step to becoming an accomplished IT professional? If you answered yes to any of these questions then this is the only book you will need. Because of this book I went from being a computer novice to becoming a proficient Technician, which helps me now pursue a Network + and CCNA certification. On his way to becoming a IT professional."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"The core strength of this book is that it goes beyond the normal testable topics and really wants you to know what REAL WORLD problems you're likely to face as an actual technician.A problem for beginners or people trying to get into IT is that they just want to get by and pass without having a clue of the REAL WORLD problems facing a A+ tech. Beginners might complain that the book does go a bit too in-depth at times because Meyers's passion to show you everything he knows about computers makes it possible to get lost in the wealth of information to not focus on critically-tested subjects. But the fact remains if you truly understand even 50 percent of this book, you'll pass the exam. I love this book because it not only deals with you passing the test but also teaches you REAL WORLD problems that other books do not. If you want to be just a paper A+ tech then do not buy this book. If you WANT to have a well-rounded education that goes above and beyond the A+ exam then buy this book.In short, this is simply one of the best test-prep books on the market and it's also one of the few books that are completely honest...."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I needed to get my A+ Certification for hopes that it would improve my search for a Computer Support Specialist position. I have been a part-time CSS for 3 years and thought that if i just spent a week studying on my own i could pass the A+ Test.. The little self assessment test in the beginning of the book suggested i put in about 61 hours of studying.. That was about right.. I focussed on about 3 chapters a day (about 7 hours a day) over 8 days and then took the test.. I definitely didn't feel like i was overly prepared for the test, however i did pass with about an 830/900 on the Hardware test and a 791/900 on the software test.Things on the test that i was not prepared for was the error codes during the \\"post\\" and like 2 questions on I/O addresses...In my opinion the book was worth the money, however, there were some errors still present within the text, questions, and the software tests, so be carefull and if something doesn't seem right cross reference it with other sources.For example Question 8 Chapter 9: The 3 main filez that make up DOS are: c)IO.sys, msdos.sys, and command.com, however the answer says they are c)IO.sys, msdos.sys, and Config.sys which is kinda .... . He he... doesn't make sense..I give it a 4/5 stars :-) Mike seems like a great guy and i am likely going to buy bookz by him in the future. If Mike needz any help i am still looking for a job :-("},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This book covers the material necessary for the A+ exams in well-written, easy to understand langauge. I did not come across anything in my studying for the exams that was not covered in this book.Other reviewers have said that extra practice tests are necessary, and I agree, but I don't think that takes away from this book's quality. The two A+ tests simply cover too much material (although you only get 20-35 questions, the possibility is still there) for someone to study this huge book and remember everything. I think this book is a great place to start, though, and practice tests are a great way to focus on the specifics for the test and find areas you need to work on again. Once you know what you need to work on, you can come back to the book and focus on those areas.I used this book, practiced on practice tests, and passed both A+ exams easily."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I don't even work in the computer industry (yet) and I passed both tests the first time (83% for Win/Dos &amp; 90% for hardware)using only this book (I read and studied it twice) and an Exam Cram for practice tests. I thought this book was a complete resource to pass the exam. Mike Meyers makes understanding the material easier than other authors might by providing pertinent background and history along with the whys and hows. Ample illustrations are provided as needed along with some levity to make it more interesting and less stressful. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those just starting."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I just took the A+ exam and passed. I used this book and some internet rescources (certyourself.com, cramsession.com). This book did a great job of preparing me for the Hardware exam but did not do the same for the OS exam. I scored 1041 on hardware, but only 641 on the OS. There were a lot of questions on Win2K that were not covered in this book. I found myself seeing many things on the test for the first time and feeling rather dumb. Good book for an introduction, but you will probably need more reinforcement on Win2K unless you have used it extensively."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This book is really all you need to pass the A+ Exam. It isparticularly strong in the Core Service Technician area, but a littlebit weak on the DOS/Windows protion of the exam. There is way, way more here than is needed to pass the A+ Exams, but it makes an excellent guide for troubleshooting even after the exams have been passed. All the same, you may want to wait until the tests are upgraded before testing; Windows 3.x and Windows95 are still included on the test, which is rather silly now that we have Windows98, Windows NT, and Windows2000 out. The book is so large that review is difficult, and the questions provided at the end of each chapter are nothing whatsoever like the ones on the exam, so you may need to invest in some testing software as well. The CD asks you to pay more money before you get full access to it, which is kind of a dirty trick. All the same, this book can't be beat for the sheer amount of information and detail that is in it. Caveat: it may not be best to start out with this book -- it is really not for beginners are those with no experience under the hood of a PC. A more basic book may be in order before feeling comfortable with identifying the varying types of expansion slots and so on. But on the whole a great book."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I have to say thanks to Mike and to everyone else in Total Seminars, because the A+ All In One Guide was the main book I used to prepare for the tests, and it helped a lot! I read through the full book once, then went back and highlighted everything like recommended. The 3 practice tests were more than enough for me. The first two tests I was getting in the 80's and 90's on the hardware, but only in the high 60's and 70's in the Operating System. So then, I used an Exam Cram A+ book, read through it, highlighting key facts, which helped me more with the Operating System exam. On my last test yesterday, got a 86 on Operating System and 84 on Hardware, so went out and took the exams today and passed!Basically, I felt that the Operating System exam required more studying than the Hardware exam. I recommend reading this book with another short one, like the Exam Cram A+ Second Edition, to help improve your Operating System knowledge. The A+ All In One Guide is defeinitely a very awesome book for the Hardware exam, and is all I needed. Compared to the Exam Cram, Mike's guide was much clearer and better written, with many illustrations that helped a lot! This book had everything I need for the A+ tests (well, maybe not everything for the Operating System test) and put it in such a way that it was fun to read and I could actually read the book from cover to cover! That is something not many people can accomplish, but Mike did.The only faults the book has is that the book itself contained a few errors, so I would make sure to check Total Seminar's website .... for the errors and correct them. Also, the CD-ROM with the 3 practice tests and a lot of problems on different computer configurations, but the Tech Support at Total Seminars is great and they'll get you through everything you need to know and even send you a new CD if they have to. So even though there were a few errors, my overall experience with Total Seminars, Mike, and this A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide was good, and thus it gets 5 stars! Lastly, another benifit of Total Seminars is when you are ready to take your exams, you can buy vouchers from them and save [price] on taking both exams, which is more than the price of this book, making it not only an excellent book, but also a great value!"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"The most striking feature of this book is its size. Over 1200 pages covering hardware and software for the COMPTIA A+ exam is almost intimidating at first sight. However, when you start to read this tome, it is actually a pleasure it is so well written.Mike Meyers is a knowledgeable authority, an able teacher and an excellent writer. Sitting down to read technical information is not always interesting to even the hardest core computer afficionado. The author's clear explanations and descriptions make the technical points easy to understand. The added benefit of his writing style makes the material enjoyable to read. No other book in this category brings all these strenghts together in one book.Even after years of using and building my own computers, this book had a lot to offer me. Thanks to this book, I think I finally have a solid understanding of how the computer works. I knew before what I had to do to build and get a computer working, but now I find I have a more thorough understanding of why it works.The test questions at the end of each chapter were very helpful as well as the practice exam on the included CD. You may want to supplement this book with another book that has more test questions for additional practice.Some reviewers have criticized the book for the numberous typos and a few technical errors. It is obvious that the editing of this book was sloppy and I suspect that there was a rush to get this to press in time for the new A+ exam, which this covers. However, these flaws are really minor in comparison to the book's overall excellence."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"Head and shoulders above the competition.

I read it through twice, took both CompTIA core and dos adaptive exams the same morning and passed very comfortably.Without this book to put it together from start to finish I would have had to study longer and harder.My only suggestion is in making the Operating System Architecture section more simplified like it is in A+ Dos/Windows second edition Chapter 3 by David Groth."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I have used this book to teach over seven classes of A+.Results: 100% passed the core exam the first time 95% passed the DOS/Win exam the first time.

They also bring the book up to an intimidating 966 pages.If you also use the Learnkey video's, Mike talks like he writes. A good sense of humor mixed with memorable hints, mnemonics, and thought processes.Still, about 1/4 of the book is history and trend information which could be considered extraneous."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This book was probably the best book to help me get ready for the exam.

I think this book helped me more than any other book I could have purchased. Also there is not any other book that could have helped me more to pass the test. Now also what I looked most about it was that it had a very helpful review over the important material at the end of the chapter with keywords so that helped a great deal. What they could have done though is put more pracice exams included with the CD-Rom I think that would have been most helpful and also if the tests were a little more like the exam.

Meyers delves into the history of computers and gives reasons why they operate the way they do today. For example, instead of just listing the different bus speeds of different chip sets, he goes into detail as to what the system bus does and how it works. My one complaint: the practice tests were not at all the ones on the actual exam.

By reading three different books, I got a much better understanding of everything and as a result found numerous mistakes in this particular text. Sorry Mr. Meyers, you don't get an A+ on this book.

I have been working with/on PC's since 1986.Overall I found this a good preparatory book for the exams. I especially liked the historical perspective Michael Meyers gives at the beginning of many chapters. I did find an occasional mistake in these, but nothing major. I feel the explanations throughout the entire book are simplified enough that someone with little to no experience after studying the book could probably pass the two exams. I expect the sheer size of the book; 1137 pages, 2 1/2 inches thick may discourage some beginners.I feel at times the author went overboard with his analogies, especially with the ones related to how a CPU works. He does this so much that I could not find a clear definition of the function of the external data bus, in the external data bus section. It was clouded by his analogy. Instead I found it in the questions at the end of the chapter.I feel in some places the proofreader(s) for the 2002 edition left some things the way they were in previous editions, when they should have been updated for the current technology and prices. A few examples; p 245 \\"Document the position of the wires for the ...turbo switch, turbo light...\\" and p 377 \\"Buying floppy drives one at a time is expensive and a waste of time.\\" (since 2000 I have been buying new floppy drives for $10-$15 individually. I don't consider that expensive.) and lastly p826 \\"A CDR burner must be specifically designed to support the longer 80-minute CD-R format, something that currently only a minority of CD-R drives do.\\" The author needs to be carefull of using the phrase \\"all versions of windows\\". NT does not have Device Manager or a Safe Mode, but \\"all versions of windows\\" on page 598 and 546 would leed you to believe so.I think for the sake of beginners I would have preferred that all of the images of the Celeron SEP package show the side with the actual CPU chip on it. Many show the backside with the circuit traces.This book did save me money. In the front it suggests to buy vouchers, vice paying the full cost for the exams. I bought vouchers, along with an enhanced version of the practice examinations and still paid less than the retail cost of the exams.Dispite my criticism of this book I did like the book and I plan on keeping it for a long time to come as reference material. There is no way I could ever have written a book, this in depth, with as few errors as this book has. I passed the hardware exam easily (I took 6 minutes for the adaptive version) and expect to easily pass the operating system exam tomorrow. I only used my experience, this book and an enhanced version of the practice examinations that came with the book.A new version of the A Plus exam is due fall or winter of 2003. Comptia has already published the new exam objectives, so I would expect a fifth edition of this book early 2004."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"There's no doubt about it, this book will help you prepare for the A+ exam, but do not use it exclusively. I liked the conversational style, and the historical/conceptual information aids in understanding present technology. Some of the explanations helped me to better understand concepts which my other main reference (Jean Andrews, &quot;Enhanced A+ Guide to Managing and Maintaining Your PC)did not always elaborate on. This book also contained information which my other book did not.What I didn't like? Some terms/concepts are introduced prior to their explanations. This could potentially confuse a reader if s/he has had no prior exposure to this term/concept. In some cases, the explanation can be found a few pages later. Also, once into the test specific section in each chapter, what really is on the test is not clearly designated. I guess I was a little spoiled with the Andrews book (even though it is not perfect either), because test specific material is clearly marked along with its corresponding objective(s) for the exam. Furthermore, I could not get the CD to work without ripping out some registry entries, though I think this was my system because it did work on other PCs.It is interesting that one reviewer found that reading this book and passing A+ did not prepare him to be a PC technician. I would fully agree with this, but this is not fault of this book. Meyer's book merely prepares you for the A+ exam, which validates your skills as an entry level technician. No book could or should ever claim that it could develop the type of skills that are gained through the actual day to day experience gained by working with PCs. In nearly any career, experience is gained by doing, not by reading or studying alone. The book does a good job in helping prepare for A+, but experience can only be gained through real world application of what you've learned. Use this book along with a few others, as many practice tests as you can find, and by all means get a computer or 2 you can potentially dispose of and starting tinkering!!"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I used this book as my only study material and I got an 878 on Core Hardware and an 864 on Os Technologies. I'm not new to the field though (i've done most tasks asked of a tech: building, repairing, upgrading, installation, networking, and phone support). There was only one question on the test that this book didn't prepare me for about what causes an NMI (Non Maskable Interupt) which isn't refered to at all in the book that I could find. I read this book cover to cover once (not in one sitting of course) including the web chapter and skimmed it the day of the test. I used the book mainly as a review and also a guide as to what information needed to be memorized (knowing that IRQ 8 is the &quot;real time clock&quot; isn't knowledge that you use everyday or maybe even ever, but that was one of the questions I was asked on the test).I would recommend this book to anyone studying for this test, especially if you don't have a lot of experience since this book has a large amount of background material at the begining of each chapter. The Background material is separated from the tested material so that those who want the fast track and know their stuff can skip it making the 1200+ pages a little more digestable. I chose to read all of it even though i've been working on computers since my brand new 12MHz 286 with MS-DOS 3.1 (I remember having to use the turbo switch on the back to slow it down to play some games because it was tooooo fast).This book is written well enough that I would also recommend it to people who aren't studying for the test, but are casual users interested in learning more about their computers.As a supplement to this book (or any other A+ book) I would recommend going to a couple motherboard manufacturers web sites any studying the pictures of some AT and ATX motherboards layouts. The hardware test used some very low quality drawings of motherboards and you will have to identify parts by clicking on the pictures with crosshairs. The parts are not totally to scale which will make some parts hard to identify if you don't know where they are normally located (trying to tell a floppy connection from an IDE connection is much more difficult than in real life).When you do take the test GET A VOUCHER to save yourself some money. I paid full price for my COMPTIA Network+ certification and had no idea I could have got a discount until I read the beginning of this book.Good Luck!!!"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I have had to teach several classes form this book. Students complain to me on a regular basis. It is hard to read for someone with no technical experience. The book covers several areas in grave detail. It then leaves other areas of A+ with a lot to be desired. For instance there are 20 chapters in this book. Four chapters are on the DOS\\\\Windows portion. You can not expect to pass the exam with just the book. There seems to be a lot of page fillers in this one. I have read several A+ books and this rates at the bottom. Please do yourself a favor and buy another book.Adam Roberts A+, Net+, MCT, CNI, CNE, MCSE Instructor"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This book has great A+ content, and will be a great reference book it the future, but it is not complete for the test. It has great illustrations and photos of PC hardware, and goes into much needed detail in some areas, but you need a supplement. I passed the test on the first try with 85 on core and 88 on Dos/Windows. I studied with the questions from Freepractice.com and the questions that came with an A+ for Dummies Book. The cramsheets on freepractice.com and cramsession.com are helpful also. I would recommend A+ for dummies as a supplement for this book. This book does not supply enough practice questions with the cd."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"If you are preparing to take the A+ exam, then the \\"All in One, A+ Certification Exam Guide\\" by Michael Meyers is definitely worth your while. Why only four stars, then? Well, to be honest, I was hoping to learn practical techniques that would make me a better potential pc technician. In this regard, the book falls short.Looking back, I now realize that I was somewhat naive about A+ certification. Having only had personal experience with computers, installing cards and drives, I truly believed that in the process of studying for the A+ exam I would gain the knowledge and troubleshooting skills necessary to become a professional technician. What a joke.After passing the A+ exam I thought, \\"Great! Now I'm ready!\\" I quickly realized, though, that none of what I had read in this book, or had been tested on, had anything to do with real-world troubleshooting. I simply encountered problems that I was in no way prepared for (missing .dll files, PCs that wont start, PCs that will start on the occasional full moon, plug-n-play devices that neither plug nor play). I felt like an idiot. It has taken me a couple of years to REALLY learn what I needed to know in order to fix these more common software problems.The bottom line is this: if you already know what you're doing (unlike me) and are just looking to earn A+ certification for the heck of it, then Meyers' book will prepare you for the test. But, if you think that you're going to study this book, pass the exam, and then be ready to take your first service call, then you've got another think coming...."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This All-In-One book has cartoonish pictures and explains basic computer techie stuff. I did extremely well on both exams. I do have a couple years of hands on experience, but I have a habit of buying books and not reading them. However, this book I read cover-to-cover. It may be a bit of overkill in terms of theory for the test. However, I'm a better tech because of doing the exercises. Especially, the ones in the lab manual. For daily reference, I use Upgrading and Reparing PCs."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"While a technically excellent book, this edition covers topics for the 1998 A+ tests that were retired on March 30, 2001.

But decided that this book would help me with the test. Was I ever right. The test is now adaptive in its testing methods, meaning they start with easy questions and get progressively harder as you answer correctly. Each question has it own difficulty level so its quite possible like in my case, your test may not cover certain areas. But this book will more than prepare you for anything thrown at you. This book certainly did fill in the missing gaps to questions I would have gotten wrong. I strongly recommend memorizing the tables in the book, such as I/O addrs, IRQ settings, etc. These are asked on the test. I would also concentrate alot of Windows 95 for Part 2. In my test there were no Windows 3.1 questions at all, so don't go crazy with it. Even CompTIA says 3.1 is about 10% of the exam but with the adaptive method you may not get any. This book is easy to read for the beginner or to review for a pro. Get the book and pass the exam. It's worth the money."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"Hello everyone. I found this book to be very easy to read, especially for beginners. Its print is medium, and the concepts are analogous to real world concepts. It is still very helpful for the more advanced tech.

He is friendly, and very helpful. I would be very open to buying other books authered by Micheal Mayers."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This is a good book for A+ test, however, I would not rely solely in this book. The information contained within is enough to pass the test, but the author goes in too much detail about old computer stuff that is good to know, but is too detailed for the test. Also, the organization of the material is not adequate. He jumps too much from topic to topic. There isn't a sequence. I actually stopped reading the book and used other sources to study from. I bought the book because I watched the video tapes for the A+ and I liked him, however I was quite dissapointed with the book.

THIS BOOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHORTER, TOO LONG.OTHER A+ BOOKS (LIKE THE ONE WRITTEN BY DAVID GROTH) ARE EVEN WORSE. FOR THIS REASON,I STILL STRONGLY RECOMMEND MIKE'S BOOK.

One would probably be able to pass the exam using just this book in combination with some previous knowledge and/or experiance. However, I would recommend picking up Tamara Dean's Network+ book to fill in some of the areas not covered closely enough by Meyers, such as Remote Access, WAN technologies and Network Troubleshooting. Also, the end of chapter questions in this book are weak at times, and do not accurately represent the difficulty of the exam itself. The tests on the CD-ROM are a good practice tool."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"No doubt about it, it's a textbook. I read it through thoroughly, and as a person wanting to just pass the test, it's not up to expectations. It teaches the material fully, but unless you have a lot of time to read and absorb all the in depth material, it probably isn't for you. By no means is it a cram book, as it covers pretty much everything with many small details the A+ exam doesn't even ask for. If you want to be a good tech, read this book. If you're in need of certification fast and need to pass the test, I suggest using this with a test prep book (I found &quot;A+ Adaptive Exams&quot; to be a good book) or not using this at all."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"The book, many times, goes off on tangents and gives WAY too much history about certain topics.

The A+ exam, which I just passed, has a hardware component and a software (Windows) component. This book, and a little tinkering I had done at home, was adequate preparation for the hardware exam, but the software exam covered far more than is in this book. I would go ahead and receommend this book, but don't stop here - find a better reference source for the software exam... or risk spending over $100 just to fail it. Other irritations about this book: 1) The publisher was in such a hurry to get this to press, that it was printed with DOZENS of important typographical and content errors!!! They don't tell you in the book, but before you begin reading it, you need to go to the publisher's website to get the lengthy list of corrections! 2) The included CD flat out would not work. Fortunately, the publisher mailed a new one for free - but still, it's another unwelcome hassle. For [price], I would have expected not to have to face these problems."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"There are many books that give you the details you need for earning your A+, but none that I've seen is even close to as well written as Meyers' book is. If you have any interest in the subject at all, you will simply enjoy reading it! With its gazillian pages (by actual count), this is important. I had already earned my A+, and was informed that I might be chosen to teach it. Even though I know that the college I might be teaching for uses another book, and even though I still have the text I used to earn my A+ (and it is still current), I bought THIS one to study for review purposes. I had borrowed a friend's copy before, and was impressed with its readability. I simply can't recommend this book any more highly."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This is the book that I used to brush up and study with before taking my A+ and passing both tests the same day.I feel that this book is well writen and has humor in all the right areas (trust me humor is very important when studying a 1000+ page book). Author Michael Meyers kept my interest from beginning to end and I wasn't bored through the book. Some would say that he goes way to far in to subjects taht aren't covere on the test, but my feeling is that the areas that he covers either are good to know as an IT professional or help you to understand the relevant matter better and more completely.Mind I do have 3 years professional experiance and over 15 years of hobbyist, so take this for what it is worth.Now if only his Network + book was up to date on the 2001 Objectives and testing methods."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"The easy way the author wrote the book helped me considerably. I work in a new and used computer store and was just learning. I pretty much knew the basics but this book opened up the door all the way. How Mr. Meyers goes in depth without losing you was very refreshing and useful. Going from the begining to modern technology helps considerably. I am a Windows generation person so the older technology was beyong me. Now I actually understand the not only the evolution of everthing, but the relation from old to new. This certainly helped me for the A+ test."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I took the new 2001 exams today and passed them both (690 Core, 791 OS). Unfortunately there were some serious errors in this book (like the viewable size of a monitor is not the glass!), but overall very good. I should note that the quiz program that comes with the book is also poor and doesn't really prep you for the real exam because the real 2001 exam is 70 questions and 1.5 hours. Also, a note about the hardware exam: I should have done much better but the new 2001 exams have graphics that are impossible to decipher (like identify the *blank* in this graphic). Even if you got 92%+ in practice exams (like I did), study more because you're doomed on these questions. Aside from that, I would recommend this book, as all I did was spend about 30 hours reading the book and about an hour or so before each exam going over what I highlighted!"},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I used the Mike Meyers book exclusively and passed both exams without a problem. Unlocking the supplemental questions on the CD was a HUGE help in preparing AFTER I had read the material.

A+ Exam Cram."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I think this is an excellent book for anyone wanting to learn computer hardware but I would recommend supplementing your studying with other material for the actual exam. Study guides and free practice tests available on the Internet will help you focus on what is actually on the exam. Meyers' book goes into much more detail than what is needed for the A+ exams, making review a daunting task if you depend only on this book. The author seems to care more about teaching you something than preparing you for the exam (that is commendable but this is supposed to be geared for the test). To sum up, this is a very well-written book and I learned a great deal from reading it, but it is just way too much too review with. I passed both tests on the first try with good scores but I don't think I would have if I had depended solely on this book. So read this book but use study guides and practice tests for review. By the way, according to the CompTIA site the Dos/Windows exam is changing this spring or summer. They are dropping the Win 3.x info and adding NT, Win98 and Linux. None of which is covered by this book so keep that mind if you don't plan on taking your test before June. Good luck."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"This third edition of &quot;A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide&quot; is one of the first (and currently one of the very few) A+ Exam preparation books that cover the new 2001 exam.In case you are not familiar with the name Michael Meyers, he is major name in PC hardware book authoring. He has a wonderful writing style that makes concepts easy to understand. This book uses excellent analogies and illustrations to further clarify and explain concepts. While the book may appear daunting at 1260+ pages, keep in mind that much of that length is due to the heavy use of illustrations, photos, tables, and screenshots. Remove these extremely helpful and virtually essential items, and I would suspect a book of one-half to two-thirds the size would be the result.Each chapter concludes with review questions and their answers. While not enough on their own to serve as the only practice exam as part of your exam preparation, they do help considerably to solidify the concepts presented in the chapter, and test your understanding.One of the major benefits of this book is that is not solely aimed at A+ Exam preparation, but on PC's as a whole. While presenting the material, Meyers identifies and breaks it up into three categories (as explained in the book's introduction):1) Historical/Conceptual: Material not on the A+ exams, but it is knowledge that will help you understand the material that is on the A+ exams more clearly.2) Test Specific: Topics that are on the A+ exams.3) Beyond A+: More advanced issues that most likely will not be on the A+ exams (but would be beneficial additional information).This categorization of the material makes the book an excellent textbook and subsequent study guide.This book can easily help anyone learn and understand the material needed for A+ Certification. You will find Myers to be knowledgeable and an easy to read author. I highly recommend this book as your choice for an A+ Exam preparation book.There is, however, one caveat: The enclosed CD-ROM, which contains practice exams published by Total Seminars, has some bugs. The most prominent one is that the software will (currently) not run on Windows NT or 2000. This fact and other bug related information is available at Total Seminar's web site.... Once you get around these bugs, the testing software is pretty good. Even without the enclosed software, the book is well worth the price."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"When I took my A+ tests I used the second edition of Mike Meyers book. This choice was based on a recommendation from several people and I was certainly glad I did. Now that I am a technical instructor there is no doubt as to what I will use on the classroom to help the students pass the newest exam - the third edition.Mike Meyers is the master of the A+ exam and this book is loaded with more than enough information to pass the exam. After reading through the book I can now understand what made this book one of the most anticipated books, the author simply covers everything in great detail and makes sure you are fully prepared for the exam. About the only thing this book doesn't do is take the exams for you.Updated to the newest exam, this 1260 page book starts with the breakdown of the pc, moves on to microprocessors, ram, bios and motherboards, buses, power supply, modems, printers, portable computers, storage systems, cd-roms, sound and video.Thinking you might be done, not even close. Meyers then breaks down operating systems starting off with DOS, and then to Windows 3.X and 9.X. Excellent coverage for NT and 2000 are also a major part of this book. Finally you have coverage of the networking side of things and the information goes far beyond the A+ arena.Normally this would be enough material and information for anyone, but what separates Mike Meyers from the rest of the pack is the other things his books include. There is review Questions, information beyond the A+ objectives, pictures, figures, tables, screen shots and even a pull out poster of the motherboard.Every section is detailed yet easy to follow and understand and comprehend. The book includes a cd-rom that has 6 practice tests, if this is not enough you can go to the Total Seminars website and order more. There are video clips, tools and utilities for technicians completing and rounding out what I would say is probably the best and must buy for every technician on any level."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I work with TeraTRAIN - an Information Technology Training program. We highly recommend the Meyers book to our students. This book does an excellent job of giving detailed information on a wide variety of topics and does so in an INTERESTING WAY! Meyers makes it easy for anyone to understand and learn. In addition, Meyers uses more pictures and illustrations than any other A+ book that I have seen. Errors are a BIG problem in many technical books. Meyers does an excellent job of paying attention to the details and giving CORRECT information. This book is a great reference even AFTER you pass you certification test, or if you aren't even interested in taking the test. You can't lose with the REAL WORLD knowledge that he puts out. Hats off to Meyers for the best A+ book in the business."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"Before I started studying for the A + exam with this book, I was a bit leery about it because of the fact that I had very limited hardware experience. I had questions like &quot;how realistic is going for this certification when I don't have experience?&quot; and &quot;Will I be able to understand the material because I don't have the experience?&quot; Thanks to Michael Meyers, the answer to that second question is YES. I am writing this for all the people out there like me, who are unsure whether they will be able to learn all of the information necessary to pass the exam just by reading this book. Meyers made all the material in the book very easy to understand. Instead of throwing a ton of technical jargon at you, he explains things throughout the book in a very simple, concise way. One of the criticisms I saw in a few other reviews was that he spent too much time talking about old, obsolete equipment. I personally liked that. Because the older equipment is simpler, it makes it easier to understand concepts(especially address busses)and apply that knowledge to newer, more complex computers. To get to the point, even if you aren't a tech right now, if you read this book you WILL understand it and you will pass the exam. I got a 87% on the core and a 90 % on windows/msdos and more importantly, when I do get a tech job, I am confident that I will be able to apply the knowledge without a problem. as highly as I reccomend this book, it is still good to take alot of practice exams."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"While the book is exceptionally well presented, I found that the accompanying CD with sample test questions to be a disappointment.

That information is NOT disclosed until you use the CD."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I bought the book for PC Maintenance course I am taking in Tech College(recommended text for class). I've had 6 months of formal training in PC repair, not to mention the LearnKey 7 cd bundle by Michael Meyers, and the book by Michael Meyers. I failed pretty bad. This is no pansy test by any means. Use the book as a learning source, not exam prep. I have learned much about computers which is good. I feel confident enough to say I have the tech experience of a someone who has 6 months experience. However, according to COMPTIA, I still have much to learn. I did express to COMPTIA that the test seemed a little more geared to someone with a great deal more experience and time in this field. Oh yeah, just to let you know, I took the Cisco CCNA Exam 640-407 and passed with an 869. This COMPTIA A+ Exam made the Cisco Exam seem like a walk in the park. I prepared just as hard for both. Nevertheless, great book for beginners, not for exam prep."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"I have to admit that this book was an easy read. The author has a very straightforward writing style and adds a sense of humor to the topics. It tops out at roughly 900 pages, and I managed to finish it in the week before my exams. It definitely managed to keep my interest, and not bore me to death (like other study guides have...) *cough... cough... SYBEX*Great illustrations and analogies... pictures everywhere. They really help to visualize the more difficult concepts.This was the only book that I used to take both the Core and the DOS/Windows. I took them both on the same day, and passed them both with flying colors.This is also a great reference if you need a &quot;starting point&quot; because you LOVE computers and you HAVE to know more about them, but don't know where to start. I have recommended this book to friends, and even my Tech support unit at work is thinking about purchasing one as a Unit reference for our in depth calls.Of course, I just pull mine of the shelf when I need it... heh heh heh.The enclosed CD is a nice reference, but I was too cheap to shell out the extra eighty bucks to open up the rest of the test questions.I just had my wife go over EVERY review question with me until I got it. Hey... call me cheap.It's a great text all around.

However, wanted to get some real &quot;hands on&quot; by going to a traditional school/training facility. The pace of the class is very fast and the program is very difficult to keep up with.

Even for those who think they are very familiar w/ PC (Like me, my 1st computer was Zenith &lt;Hmm...never heard of it!?&gt;), I still found something that the book remind &amp; refresh what I overlooked or forgot. The book is thick (1263 pg.) due to lots of pictures &amp; illustrations, but is absolutely necessary. I just want to suggest Mr. Meyers to make them smaller in size. Some typing mistakes occur (minor), also watch out the answers of Ch. 14 review questions, they should correct it in next edition.

I found it helpful for filling in the holes when preparing for the A+ exams, which I passed with scores of 795/900 (OS) and 825/900 (HW) with one reading of the book. However, I didn't approach the material as a total novice, and was a little disappointed with the lack of depth on some topics. It does cover the exam material well; the shallow spots are actually beyond the scope of the exam. If you have never built or serviced a PC, this book should do quite well to provide basic instruction."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"If your are just starting to learn how computers work, then this book is okay, after wasting some time and reading only 1/3 of the book I passed the test.

The hardware section goes into all the detail you need to know for the A+ and then some. All the while it is easy to understand even if you are veging. The software section goes into what you will need to know as well, but you will need to pay a little more attention to what he is writing about if you want to pass.

If your buying this book just remember that they are changing the exam sometime around sept 1, 2000 so only buy this book if your going to write before then cause there are new books coming out around sept....

After failing the two exams initially, I bought this book after reviewing many of the recommendations from previous buyers. This book helps explain some of the more complex facts on Core &amp; Dos/Windows in terms that I believe the average person will be able to understand. If you have no or minimal computer experience, I would use this book as an additional study supplement. This book along with Transcenders makes for a powerful combination to help you pass the the A+ exams.

Everything that you need to know to pass the Core Exam and the DOS/WIN Exam is in this book. However, it also covers other details that are useful in the industry.

I'm not an idiot and I have a lot of experience working on computers so I know it wasnt a user error problem. Second, there is NO chapter ending summary and review questions in the book. Instead, you have to read entire chapters line by line and highlight the info you think is important. Which makes no sense if you have to cram right before taking the test.I recommend that you buy another A+ book in addition to this one. Maybe A+ for dummies for its conciseness. Also, subscribe to an A+ newsgroup."},{"Title":"A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide","review":"**Not enough questions on the CD** Its always a little worrying when the front of the cover says that the CD contains hundreds of questions only to find that to get any more than 100 from the CD, you have to pay another $80.

However, the CD-Rom is much less impressive, I am running Win'98 and unable to view the contents on the CD-Rom I would love to see the contents but the warranty is limited and not much help is available in replacing this bad batch that has been duplicated which I find to be very disappointing in that in buying books the software is usually the bonus for such a purchase.

I don't know what the big deal is with everyone saying there are typos because I have yet to come across one. If your a begginer to the computer world or have some knowledge previous(like me) it's a good book eithere way. It starts out at ground zero.

When I was A+ book shopping I sat in stores and started reading several.

I'm sure of it! And with Mr. Meyers' sense of humour it is fun as well.The CD contained a great set of practice exams including an awesome adaptive test engine that was dead-on in my opinion. I kept reading and re-reading the book until my scores on the practise test engine were to my satisfaction and then I took the real exams. My real exam marks matched very well with my marks with Meyers' test engine on the CD!!!Every text book has errors but these are completely covered on the web and since either Mr. Meyers himself or his staff are constantly reading the alt.certification.a-plus newsgroup most errors have been caught long ago and new printings don't have them.In case you are wondering, I do not know Michael Meyers personally I'm just very enthusiastic with his product!You simply COULD NOT GO WRONG if you bought Michael Meyers' &quot;All-In-One A+ Certification Exam Guide&quot;!

It arrived in mint condition and i will put them to good use...thanks so much! Well packed and prompt delivery makes me feel confident to return to Amazon."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"Very easy to read for the beginner. Descriptive booklet enclosed. This wicca based deck is a great addition to your favorites."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"I had this deck on my wishlist for a long time. Then decided I didn't want it. Basically kept going back and forth. Well I was at my local shop and saw they had a copy and just bought it. It seemed this deck had been putting itself in my path repeatedly, so I gave in!And I am SO glad I did. I am a Witch of the old tradition (not wiccan) and I guess I thought or was worried this was the cheesy wiccan junk most of the other tarot are. Not so! The profound depths and beauty of the art and symbolism in these cards are unparalled. The Majors are by far at least number 2 in their stunning luminescence. So much detail and thought went into them. And the minors at first glance I was not pleased with. But with only the 2nd viewing I was madly in love. The faces are each so different and evocative. This is one deck I could instantly connect with and read intuitively. There is a lot of white on the minors and an intense focus on the person or persons on the cards, so you hone in on the symbolism and meaning right away.Many of the Majors have been renamed which is fine and very well done. The cardstock is excellent and they're the perfect size I find. You don't really need the book, though I bought it along with the deck, but it does explain some of the meanings of symbols, animals and flowers that are found within the cards. I enjoyed the section on Barabra Cartland explaining why the Lovers card is dedicated to her.If you think you might connect with this deck, and love the old ways, then for sure splurge and get this deck, you will not be disappointed.I own MANY decks and this is the only one other than The Nigel Jackson Tarot where each card feels connected and like it is it's own kingdom/world."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"The Tarot of The Old Path is a beautifully drawn deck, quite different from the Rider-Waite standard. I bought it somewhat blind, based only on the reviews here, which I'm always wary about. Tarot is a very personal thing, and not every deck is right for every person. I still have mixed feelings about this deck, but will describe it as best I can in hopes that it will help others make a more informed decision on the cards.In the introduction it states: \\"The Tarot of the Old Path has emerged in recognition of the many card readers who are witches and initiates of Wicca, often referred to as The Craft, The Old Religion, or the Old Path. In fact, no witch is truly a witch without a good working knowledge of these ancient symbols.\\"I am pagan/heathen, though not Wiccan or a witch, and because of this, as well as the much more feminist approach (I personally prefer more balance) I don't think this deck was the best for me, though it may be for many others. As I said before, the cards are beautifully done. The Major Arcana are especially richly colored, filled with the symbolism of many old pagan religions.Some of the cards have been re-named, such as \`The Hierophant' is \`The High Priest', and \`Judgement' is \`Karma' in this deck. \`The Hanged Man' becomes \`The Lone Man' and wears a Jester's outfit. A few others are re-named as well, and the \`cups' have become \`cauldrons'. The Pages are all very well done in that they are unisex. You aren't sure if it's a boyish girl, or a girlish boy, which is good for the pages. The Queens are beautiful and poised, though the Queen of Swords looks rather cruel... more so than in other decks I've seen.The backs of the cards feature a bluish-green design of twisting, flowering, vines in an \`8' figure. And though the design itself is symmetrical, there is a very small print copyright note which makes it easy to tell whether or not the cards are reversed before turning them over.The Minor Arcana seemed almost bare in comparison to the Major Arcana, featuring very little in the way of background scenery... though after doing a few readings with them I found it seemed to click in a way, because once I looked past the mostly blank backgrounds, I was drawn to the richly detailed facial features and even body language of those in the cards. The nuances of meaning have been refocused in this deck directly into the people portrayed within. Who knows, this could grow on me."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"I bought this deck because I love the middle ages and it has a very British feel to it. Plus the photos of the cards I saw in the bookstore were very beautiful. The major arcana cards were my favorites in this deck.My primary issue with the deck is that many of the faces in the minor arcana look aggressive and cold. That disturbed me a little bit and I would often feel a funny vibe when I did readings with them. However, I had no such feelings when working with the Major Arcana because that aggressiveness was not as strong in these pictures.If you are not sure about whether this is the deck for you, find a new age shop or website where you can look at several pictures of the cards to see if you like the overall feel of them. Just make sure that it shows you minor arcana cards and not just the aces.In general, though, the images are colorful, well drawn and definately different than what you'd find elsewhere. Because of this uniqueness, the deck is well worth a look."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"My review will be unique -- so far-- since I am not a Wiccan and not interested in Wicca, and I do not \\"read\\" tarot cards. I collect tarot decks (over the last 40 years I have owned about 100 decks, and currently have about 70), and I study each card individually for its beauty, artwork and symbolism. Using these criteria, Tarot of the Old Path is simply beautiful. It is a British deck and the artwork by Sylvia Gainsford is lovely. The medieval costumes are gorgeous in a fairy-tale kind of way, at least in the Major Arcana. The Minor Arcana are more like Mother Goose Medieval and display an impish sense of humor. As for the symbolism, it is evocative and sometimes scary (in a good way.) I refer you to the Moon card (which is here called Illusion) or the Judgment card (called Karma). The Empress, Emperor, High Priestess and High Priest make up a kind of little family (especially if you include the four children pictured, including the unborn baby of the pregnant Empress, and you can also include the all fabulous wild animals,including the mythical unicorn) and they tell a strong, positive, marvelous narrative. I originally bought just the deck, since I didn't think I needed the instruction book (not being a reader), however, I have now ordered the book to discover the \\"language of flowers\\" on the cards, as well as all the other symbols (is that a pelican on Card 13?) I can't recommend this deck too highly."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"The imagery in this deck is outstanding. The pagan themes make it all the more meaningful for those of us who follow the Old Path. It is one of many decks I own but practically the only one I use"},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"This is a beautiful deck that incorporates images of nature and pagan concepts. The gifted artist also included the language of flowers and herbs to deepen the meaning of the cards. I have been using this deck for 20 years. I have replaced it once after storm damage. Love this deck! It has always been my go to deck for readings both personal and professional. There are a few differences in the Close (Death) and Temptation (Devil) cards but I prefer this decks interpretations."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"I bought the deck originally because of some of the contributors for card designs, such as Patricia Crowther (especially the Karma card, very interesting). But was delighted for many reasons. First by the excellent quality of the deck itself, which has a smooth feel and is easy to shuffle (very important for those of us who make readings with some regularity, sticky decks are a stick in the mud!). Also by the successful transmission of the main themes and simbologies of the Tarot to a pagan orientated language - without great distortions or distracting alterations (something that many other &#8220;theme decks&#8221;, sadly, ignore). Elements and symbols of pagan traditions can be found and easily transmit concepts that are familiar to those who know and live by them. Thus, the experience (so far) has been quite enchanting.Not the greatest fan of the mainly white background and bright &#8220;pastely&#8221; sort of colors (a little darker would have been nice&#8230; but that&#8217;s just me). But the rest is so great, that I think I can get use to it&#8230;All in all, a great deck for pagans (and Wicans)."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"Im a new witch, The Tarot of the Old Path is my first deck and it has been very nice to learn....not the best for a first timer in tarot. I like it but because it had a large female side to it and that was what I was looking for being new to the Craft."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"Cards are ok, but would have liked the book that goes with this deck, also would prefer deck larger."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"This was my first tarot deck. None of the \\"traditional\\" decks such as the Rider-Waite appealed to me at all. When I found this deck, there was an immediate feeling of connection.Memorizing card meanings isn't my strong suit; I've found that for me, with this deck, meanings come through very clearly simply through the artwork. While they don't always correspond with the \\"book\\" descriptions, they're invariably accurate. (YMMV, as always.)The images are somewhat fantasy-inspired drawings in mainly pastel colors, with much herbal and floral symbolism. Be sure to watch the details on the cards- the backgrounds may offer hints that will help clarify your reading.Each suit has a base color corresponding to it's element (swords-air-yellow, cauldrons-water-blue, etc.). Each card also has a distinct \\"personality\\" to it, unlike some decks that seem to use the same face for all the queens, or kings.For those concerned about such things, there is some straightforward nudity on a few of the major arcana cards, but nothing crude or salacious.All in all a deck that I enjoy working with, and also simply enjoy looking at."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"This was one of those decks that came out after the Tarot geyser began spewing a new deck each month, so I initially ignored it. Many years later I was to pick up a copy after my tarot revival and was pleasantly surprised. This deck is wonderful as far as the traditional meanings are concerned.As far as the updates to new meanings are concerned-referring to the archetypal Rider-Waite style-I was very happy with Death becoming the Close and Judgement becoming Karma. How insightful and modern. The major Trumps all ring musical insight into my readings.That brings me to my problems with this Pack. The minor trumps fall short. For starters, there are no ethnic repesentations here. True, this design is specifically based on European pagan traditions. Pagans are all caucasian, right? Anyway, that is beside the point. These minors lack the depth of the majors. I do like the Flower language referred to in them.Never the less, this deck is an important addition to any collection. The colors are conducive to a warm summer afternoon suited for readings and meditation. Young beginners would find this an excellent launching pad for occult dabblings of all sort. Green gardening, outdoor full moon rites..."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"I just recently bought this deck. I'm very interested in Wicca so I wanted a deck that reflected the Wicca feeling. And it does.I bought this deck after reading several reviews, some of them talked about little bits of silver on the major cards. This seems to be the case only with OLDER decks. The new decks don't have any silver. This was a bit disappointing for me, but I still think this is a beautiful deck.The majors are very well done. But the amount of white on the minor cards takes some getting used to, and they could have been nicer if they had a bit more colour. Some of the mouths on the minor cards look weird, and the teeth are a bit strange. But the eyes are great, really well done.The cards are very detailed; I see something new every time I look at them. I would recommend this deck, but it might be nicer to get an older, secondhand, deck; with the bits of silver on it."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"This is the deck I use when reading for Pagans/Wiccans/Witches of all Paths. The images are often in-your-face and like the Dark Mother as a deck used for readings it suffers no fools (in other words, I wouldn't use it for reading after reading for the same person asking the same thing each time......) but will bring about Truth one way or the other - there's a LOT to see in each card and I believe it transcends Tradition. This isn't just for Wiccans or Pagans of various paths, it's for those who walk their talk. If you want a deck with the bright colors and images, go for something more like the Robin Wood Tarot, this one isn't bright and shiny - it's deep and thought-provoking.Well worth reading these cards - my one suggestion: Toss the wee book that comes with it. The cards will tell you what they mean more than any book can."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"a beautiful deck, softer than many other cards for or by wiccans. advisors on the cards included the Farrars, and Margot Adler. for me the deck works very well,and i have gotten very accurate readings after owning it for only a short time"},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"This was my first Tarot deck. At first (esp. for newbies to Tarot) it seems a bit intimidating. I have used this deck for 7 years and they have proven to be a wonderful asset. Beautiful graphics highlighted with silver. I highly recommend this deck!!"},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"I only recently came across this deck. Having seen the images online, I decided to order a copy. What a beautiful deck! The artistry is magnificent. The character's faces are the most expressive of any deck I have ever seen. The colors are rich and vibrant. The deck itself is a Waite-Smith clone but the artist adds some clever twists and nuances to the basic Waite-Smith imagery. I found some of the trumps a little weak. They tended to gloss over the more difficult aspects of life and even rename the Death card \\"the Close.\\" Now every time I draw that card I think of Kyra Sedgwick in The Closer. I guess Death acts as kind of a closer, though. Some of the trumps are brilliantly executed, but I prefer the medieval-Renaissance imagery of the early tarot decks.In any case, this is a wonderful deck and I highly recommend it. The images are beautiful and evocative and lend themselves to ease of use in readings. The LWB that explains the card meanings is very well done too and is also in the Waite-Smith tradition. I haven't read the larger book that goes with this deck, but several reviewers have said that it does not add much more information than what is already in the LWB, so it may not be worth an extra ten bucks. In the short time that I've owned this deck, it has become one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"These were a gift I got for my friend, but she loved them! The little book that comes with the cards is extremely helpful, and its small size keeps it kind of discreet if you happened to forget what a card meant while doing a reading."},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"It's my belief that certain items are more intuned to certain people. In other words, particular items call out to individuals. Not everything is for everyone. This tarot deck, however, was an instant connection with me. I am an extreme newby but found this deck easy to use. The pictures are thought provoking and not cartoony. The booklet that accompanies it shows one layout, the celtic cross, as well as interpretations. It is a great launching point for learning. Once I've conquered this layout, I will be looking to other books on layouts. Take a look at the card samples that Amazon supplies. If this calls to you, buy it! You won't regret it! :)"},{"Title":"Tarot Of The Old Path Deck","review":"I love my tarot deck. I feel very confident with it and everybody who consults me trusts it and as not afraid of it.

Reichley does justice to the complex relationship between religion politics and human values. His typology of value systems provides a very useful framework for understanding the differing perspectives on the issue and avoiding simplistic characterizations of those who hold differing points of view. There is a very good examination of the intentions of the Founders of the USA and the proper interpretation of the First Amendment to its Constitution. The historical analysis covers the period of the founding of the USA up to the mid 1980's. It is balanced and fair and presents a good case for the vital and necessary role that religion must play in American public life within the context of the separation of church and state.I see that the author has written more recent books that expand upon and update the material this book but, even as it is, this book contains much relevant and important material. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Religion in American Public Life","review":"Anyone interested in the fascinating and contentious issues in American religious history is advised to read this work. It is hard for me to believe anyone would be truly dissapointed here. Its strength is its breadth and conclusions.At 360 pages, this is about as comprehensive as any general history is likely to be. Reichley starts with a discussion of the constitution and beliefs of the founders, and goes on to relate our religious history to 1985. Segments include the Jews, Mormons and evangelicals as well as mainline Protestants and Catholics. All of the major court cases and public debates are explained. It is worth a read for this material alone.But the author also makes us think about these issues. He makes it clears that many of today's assumptions-particularly about church state seperation, were not even considered earlier. The Founding Fathers, even Jefferson, never intended that religion be driven from the public square. Reichley states that those who see religion as merely a private choice in the manner of sports or entertainment fail to appreciate its crucial role in our democracy.

They're going through the usual early stages of a romantic relationship--dressing to impress, going on coffee dates, and saving the world. When Buffy tries to be more like the girls from Angel's distant past, she succeeds a little too well--becoming helpless in the face of real evil.Career week at school finds Buffy questioning her future as the Slayer--and all the relationship baggage that title comes with--until an unexpected ally gives new insight into her calling. And when Angel is taken hostage by an old aquaintance [sic] with sinister plans, Buffy realizes she must draw on all her passion to save the one she loves. Now, collected for the first time, are three stories from the hit-TV series chronicling Buffy and Angel's growing romantic relationship.\\"REVIEWVolume 2 of the Angel Chronicles novelizes three strong Second Season episodes. The novelizations stick very close to the scripts, with the only original material being a new prologue and a new epilogue.In \\"Halloween,\\" Buffy and her friends are transformed into the people they've dressed up as for Halloween--thus, Willow becomes a real ghost, Xander becomes a soldier, and Buffy turns into a simpering eighteenth century noblewoman. A good example of how the show can be humorous without becoming stupid and silly (contrast some season four episodes) makes \\"Halloween\\" a good read.\\"What's My Line\\" parts 1 and 2 introduce Kendra the Vampire Slayer and sees Buffy attempting to survive a trio of assassins while facing teen career-fair angst. These episodes have some fun action sequences, introduce a whole new dimension to Cordelia and Xander's relationship, and provide more insight into how Buffy views her life. Spike and Drusilla play a major role in part 2.Much like Volume 1 of the Chronicles, Angel fans should note that their gel-haired favorite is mostly on the sideline in the first story, although \\"Halloween\\" does have a few touching scenes involving Buffy and Angel's failed first date.The \\"What's My Line\\" stories contain more Angel, as his presence is a major plot point in Spike and Drusilla's plans.Overall, Richie Tankersley delivers a smooth, straightforward adaptation of all three episodes with no surprises."},{"Title":"Angel Chronicles #2 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Chronicles)","review":"I thought this book was excellent because it has a little of everything.It has romance, suspense,action,and a bit of comedy."},{"Title":"Angel Chronicles #2 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Chronicles)","review":"This second volume to the Angel Chronicles measured almost as good as the first one.

However, I soon realized it was fun to read about the shows I had seen because the dialogue still rang true in black and white and some lines I might have forgotten, I could look up. The best part is the author chose some of the best Buffy episodes from the second season of the show including one of my favorite episodes to date: &quot;Halloween.&quot; Since the three episodes chosen follow each other almost choronologically in the sequence of the Buffy show, (The others are &quot;What's my line part 1&quot; and &quot;What's my line part 2&quot;) you can read this book from cover to cover and derive much enjoyment. Another bonus is that these episodes include two of Buffy's most engaging baddies: Of course I am referring to Spike and Drusilla. &quot;Halloween&quot; is the best of the lot. If you never saw this classic episode, here's a synopsis: It's Halloween at the Hellmouth-this is a traditionally slow time for vamps. Principal Snyder ropes the students including Buffy and her friends into chaparoning kids while they trick or treat. This episode also marks the debut of Ethan Rayne, an old adversary of Giles. He owns a mystical costume shop and he sells many people in town their halloween garb including Buffy and friends. Buffy dresses up like a noble woman to impress Angel. Rayne invokes the Roman god Janus and casts a spell which transforms everyone wearing one of his costumes into whatever they are dressed as. Good for Xander who becomes an soldier, but bad for Buffy who is turned into a meek and powerless maiden, prompting Willow to lament, &quot;She couldn't have dressed up like Xena?&quot; Spike discovers Buffy's predicament and relishes in the bedlam. Giles confrontation with the mysterious Ethan Rayne is one of the highlights of this spectacular show and book. The &quot;Angel Chronicles Vol.2&quot; doesn't disappoint. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Angel Chronicles #2 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Chronicles)","review":"This book has three of the best Buffy episodes in it. I dont think that it could have picked better ones,the only way that this book could have been better is if they added on another section and put 'Becoming' parts one and two in.

I'm a big Buffy fan and I've read most of Buffy books and this one is my favorite one ever. It features 3 of the most classical Buffy episodes. They couldn't have picked any episode better than these 3. They are funny and well-depicted. The thoughts of the characters are funny, awkward and adorable at the same time. This one is even better than the Angel Chronicles Vol. 1 coz Buffy and Angel's relationship has grown stronger and their love for each other is irresistable. You have to read it to love it. If you're a buffy fan, this one is a must, if you're not, get it anyway, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Angel Chronicles #2 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Chronicles)","review":"Whether or not you have seen the episodes &quot;Halloween,&quot; and &quot;What's My Line&quot; parts 1 and 2, this book is a must have for all Buffy and Angel fans. Tankersley takes you into the minds of the characters, and gives you a glimpse of the motives for the action we see on television.&quot;Halloween&quot; is one of the funiest episodes in the BTVS series. All hell breakes loose when the population of Sunnydale is transformed into their halloween costumes. And who is there to fight the children turned demons? Not the slayer, who unfortunately believes herself to be a noblewoman from the 18th century! There is a serious side to the episode, however. The appearance of an old friend reveals secrets Giles would rather have remain hidden.&quot;What's my Line&quot; is an emportant episode in the Buffy mythology.

Why wasn't this more on Angel? Not that I'm a big fan of his, but isn't this supposed to be the ANGEL Chronicles? Sure, this provided us with a view from other characters like Oz and Spike, but this oughta be coming from Angel's p.o.v. Also, the dialogue was a little too off in some places (take &quot;I wish we could be like regular kids. Just a regular kid and her 200-year-old, creature-of-the-night boyfriend.&quot;). If you ask me, that just rubs off a layer of what the show is all about: witty lines that would come from a teen. Considering this is a novelization, and not an original novel, such lines really should not be too off from the originals. It strips away part of the show, and turns people off.

It took them 4 days to even ship it and 9 days to get it. Unacceptable."},{"Title":"The Coast Watchers","review":"There is a shelf-load of books extant about the exploits of the coastwatchers, the Allied (mostly Australian) men who, along with their Melanesian allies, hid out in the jungles of the Solomon Islands and reported on Japanese convoy and aircraft movements during World War II. But this book is one of the most important of them -- not only because, first published in 1946, it was pretty much the first -- but because its author, Commander Eric A. Felt, R.A.N., was the man in overall charge of the coastwatcher operation. So while this title may lack some of the first-person narrative power, the coastwatchers' stories in their own words, of books like Walter Lord's &quot;Lonely Vigil,&quot; it's still hard to beat for its strategic insights and true measure of the coastwatchers' operations and importance.A man who from civilian life was familiar with the Solomons and their residents, Feldt is generous with praise for the civilians and natives involved with the coastwatcher operation. He is also a skilled writer and storyteller. The coastwatchers played a critical, if now largely forgotten (if it was ever really even known) role in the fight for control of the South Pacific. Nearly 60 years after it was first published, Cdr. Feldt's book is still an exciting and revealing contribution to their memory."},{"Title":"The Coast Watchers","review":"The buyer should be aware that there was an Australian printing of his book, and an abridged version printed in the US. The US version is a bit over half the size of the original version. I had to order this book from a used book store in Australia in order to get the original version. This is the definitive book on the Coast Watchers. Feldt gives the different locations, names, problems, and outcome including the period after Guadalcanal where he had a heart attack and was replaced. Other very good books that cover the Coast Watchers include \\"Fire Over the Islands\\" by Horton, \\"Alone on Guadalcanal\\" by Clemens, \\"Hunted\\" by Murray and \\"Lonely Vigil\\" by Lord. The bibliographies of these books will lead you to a dozen or so more. Some are only available in Australian or English used book stores.These men were courageous and under terrible conditions managed to keep their equipment operational."},{"Title":"The Coast Watchers","review":"In the annals of the Pacific war in WW2, there is no job comparable to that of the coast watcher. His was a lonely world, cut off from all but a few comrades, living in primitive conditions, his only link to the outside world a radio. He had to be particularly adept at sizing up island natives and whether or not they were loyal to the Allies or to the Japanese at any given time. He also had to be able to anticipate when his position had been compromised, and be able to relocate his operation on a moment's notice.In his book, The Coast Watchers, Royal Australian Navy Commander Eric Feldt tells the story of \\"Ferdinand,\\" the organization of Australian military officers, plantation owners and island administrators, who at great personal risk occupied key vantage points among the Solomon and Bismarck islands and New Guinea, sometimes only a few miles from Japanese bases. The name Ferdinand was selected by Feldt from the story of Ferdinand the Bull, who attacked, only when he was \\"stung.\\" This was a reflection of the philosophy of the coast watcher, who had to avoid any offensive action against the Japanese, lest he draw attention to himself and thereby become unable to fulfill his main mission: that of observing and reporting movements of Japanese ships and aircraft.Feldt proves to be not only capable as a military commander of Ferdinand, but a skillful author as well as he relates the history of that organization and its men. The personalities of Ferdinand's coast watchers are numerous and varied, but all possess the same essential qualities: self-reliance, self-control, patience and intuitive ability to sense danger, especially regarding the shifting loyalties of natives. Feldt does a fine job of developing these personalities within the confined space of a military history narrative.There are sufficient maps in the book, and the first page of each chapter lists the locations of the maps for that chapter. The main deficiency of the book is lack of an index. This was a poor editorial decision, given the many personalities to keep track of, and no way to refer back to them later in the book. Nevertheless, I recommend this book to all readers of the Pacific war, especially Americans who might not appreciate the essential role performed by this Australian organization. No less a commander than Admiral Halsey did appreciate it and said, \\"The coast watchers saved Guadalcanal, and Guadalcanal saved the Pacific.\\""},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes(1962).Ray Bradbury, author of such renound classics as The Martian Chronicles and Farenheit 451, took a stab at the horror genre in 1962. Much like Mary Shelley(Frankenstein) and Bram Stoker(Dracula), Ray Bradbury helped in the shaping of the Horror genre, now ruled by such authors as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Combining Horror and Classical Literature, with a plot of Greed and Deception, Bradbury created what today would be known as a Horror Classic, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and also one of the most recognizeable novels in his catalog. Bradbury was the first Horror author to use children, the most unlikely heroes, that Stephen King later used in his commercial smash IT and his short story \\"The Body\\", and lods have been used by numerous other authors and directors of popular culture. Based on a famous quote of Shakespeare, Something Wicked This Way spawned a popular movie of its own, and Modern Day Metal Artist Iced Earth even used it for the title of their popular album. In the next paragraphs, you will read just what made Something Wicked This Way Comes such a timeless classic, and one of the very few classics I can stand!Plot-During the time before Halloween, in the cold Autumn of October, a Train seemingly spawned out of hell comes into town, a dark omen of the days ahead. As a calliope crackles mysterious doomy tunes, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, a carnival of sorts, unloads their dark materials, tents, animals, and sideshow freaks of equal gruesomeness. Jim Nightshade and Will Holloway, two young curious 12 Year old boys, seemingly are the only ones to hear the hellish calliope(FYI, an organ) music at Three in the Morning, so they set out to see where all the noise is coming from. Soon they find out, and flee back to their homes to await the coming storm. The next day, The Carnival is out in full force, and most of the entire town is there, to view such rides and shows as A Mirror Maze, a Ferris Wheel, seeing Skeleton Men, Dwarfs, Fortune Tellers, Mr. Electro, and Mr. Dark, the Amazing Illustrated Man. Their is also a Merry-Go-Round, but it is strangely Out of Order. After the crowd leaves and the carnival shuts down, the crowds subsided totally and all is quiet, Jim and Will stay behind, hiding, waiting to learn the mystery of the carnival. Soon they are thrusted into a world where their wildest dreams are imaginable, and their worst nightmares are staring them right in the face, and they are the only ones who can subside the Growing Storm...Writing-Since this is my first Ray Bradbury novel I've read(And probably not the last), I won't compare Something Wicked This Way Comes to his other works, but instead rate his writings as my observations as a reader. The most memorable part of Bradbury's writing, is his descriptive writing, which, even such a simple act as running, Bradbury lets you Feel, Hear, See, Taste, and almost makes you think you can reach out and touch what isn't there. Although many times his descriptions run-on for too long, other times he hits the right notes in the right amount of space, and his genuine talent for writing and descriptions bring the story and the characters alive. Something Wicked This Way comes, along with Stoker's Dracular, is one of the few classics I can stand, because too much emphasis in other classics is placed on descriptions rather than plot, but Bradbury's plot is deftly place Center-Stage here, and the Reader never feels bored or let down. Many times his ideas may seem unreasonable, but against the other material it doesn't take too much away from the book to me.Overall, Something Wicked This Way Comes left a strong impression on me for Bradbury, and this won't be the last book I read by him. If you noticed the 4 star rating, it's mostly because of the things that plague classics so much for me. Overlong descriptions. I must emphasize though Bradbury isn't nearly as inconsistent as many authors, so this is just minor. Also some of his plot ideas seem odd and leave the reader thinking \\"Huh?\\", but most of the time the plot is easy to follow.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A GREAT HORROR AND CLASSIC NOVEL NOT TO BE MISSED BY ANYONE! BRADBURY MAKES THE CARNIVAL SEEM MORE EVIL THAN IT DOES IN REAL LIFE!(...)"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"For English I wrote a response to this book, in poem form, and I'm going to share it with other Amazon-Niks:'The crescent moon I have marked on the bullet is not a crescent moon.

It was much more analytical and philosophical than I expected, thinking it would be more of a traditional horror plot without a lot more. While some of the long speeches from Will's father got a little tedious, the main point -- that evil feeds on sadness and despair and can be vanquished by happiness, laughter and love -- was excellently woven into the plot. Will and his father are great characters, juxtaposed against Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger and even Jim, who has both light and dark in him."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"\\"Don't look back on happiness, or dream of it in the future.

This is the first time I have read this book, I will blame it on laziness rather than lack of courage...It's the classic tale of good versus evil. A dark carnival comes to town led by Mr. Dark, The Illustrated Man. This is no ordinary carnival. Mr. Dark is out to recruit people to a life of misery in his sideshow traveling tour. Two boys discover his secret and will be forced to decide if they are \\"autumn people\\" or \\"summer people\\".

Will and Jim went to watch it set up. The train was old and black, and the tents went up in complete silence like magic. It scared Will and Jim so they ran home. The next day they went to go check it out but it seemed like a normal carnival. So they decided to ride all the rides. As night fell they came across and \\"out of order\\" carousel where they met Mr. Cooger and Mr. Dark. Mr. Dark seemed interested in Jim But he and Will left. They hid in the bushes and saw Mr. Cooger get on the carousel backwards and get younger. Later that night Jim went to go see if he could get on the carousel to get older. Will tried to stop him and they ended up putting Mr. Cooger on forward to many times and he died. Later, the dust witch from the carnival, under Mr. Dark's control, put a mark on Jim's house so they could find him later. Will and Jim washed it off and Will tried to kill the dust witch but it didn't work. The next day the carnival had a parade through town to secretly look for Jim and Will who were hiding under the street. Will's dad, Mr. Halloway, saw them and agreed to meet them later in the library to figure out how to beat the carnival. They figured out that the carnival came every thirty to forty years so no one would remember it. Then Mr. Dark came looking for Jim and Will. He crushed Mr. Halloway's hand and then had the dust witch put a spell on Will and Jim. Then they went back to the carnival. Mr. Halloway showed up to volunteer for the bullet trick. Using the crowd, he was able to break the spell on Will and kill the dust witch. After the crowd and all of the carnival freaks left, Will and his dad went to go find Jim. Jim was still under the spell and was being pulled toward the carousel. He got on it and it started going forward. Will ran over and, with some difficulty, pulled Jim of the carousel and they fell to the ground. But6 when Will got up Jim didn't move. Will started to cry because he thought Jim was dead. Then a little boy came to talk to Mr. Halloway, but he turned out to be Mr. Dark. Mr. Halloway killed him and then went over to Will and Jim. By just singing, dancing, and laughing, they were able to break the spell on Jim and he was okay again. They all agreed that they would be able to handle whatever evil that was up ahead. Although parts of this book are boring, overall it was very interesting.Parts of this book were very boring and confusing. For example, whenever they talk about life. They talk about it to much and it can get boring to read. You could skip over those parts and the story wouldn't change at all. Also, when Will is talking to his dad about being a good person. They were talking about if being a good person meant that you were happy. I didn't find that part interesting. They could have just skipped to the part where Will warns his dad to stay away from the carnival. This book uses a lot of metaphors and strange descriptions that make it hard to understand. For example, when Will and Jim were watching the carnival set up. You kind of have to reread parts of it to figure out what they were seeing and what you were being told.Parts of this book were funny and interesting. For example, it was funny how Will and his dad saved Jim. They were jumping around being goofy and even though Jim was pretty much dead, it made him okay again. And when he woke up, he didn't even question what they were doing, he just joined in. It was interesting when Mr. Dark was looking for Jim and Will in the library. He made it sound like he could hear their hearts beating. You want to keep reading to find out if it will lead him to them. Also, it was interesting when Will was trying to kill the dust witch. At the last possible second his weapon broke. He had to throw the arrow himself. Maybe she would have died if it didn't brake.Some parts of this book creepy, but still kind of cool. For example, when Will and Jim see the carnival set up. It was completely silent and they said it was like a spider with all the ropes everywhere. And the big tent seemed to pop up out of no where. It scared them so much that they ran home. Another creepy part was when Mr. Dark crushed Mr. Halloway's hand. You have to have a lod to strength to crush someone's bones. It made Mr. Halloway collapse in pain. Another creepy thing was the tattoos that Mr. Dark had of Jim and Will. If he pinched the tattoos then they actually felt pain. His hands were bleeding s Jim and Will's foreheads started to bleed. That is just weird.I would recommend this book to people who under stand metaphors and don't mind some boring parts. I would recommend it to people ages twelve and up. Little kids might find it a little boring and confusing.C.

This book is all about a mystery. The mystery starts with this weird and creepy man. Jim and Will are the two main characters in the story. They are introduced to this shadowy man early in the book. This man puts a spell on the two boys. Many things are happening to the boys all through out the story. At certain parts of the book, they are chased by a storm. This storm continues to bring many bad things to the boys. There was a special day for Jim's dad; he could not wait until his son had come home. However, the surprise that he was expecting was not what Jim had brought to him. Jim and Will had been arrested by the police. They would not tell His father where they were. At that point, of the story, I thought to my self, \\"What could the father be thinking of his son?\\" At that point, I could only feel sorrow for how he felt. This story goes on to more details and to more problems to the two boys. The story ends in a surprising ending.

It takes patience, the reading can't be rushed or the mood will disappear. Personally, the reason I enjoyed this work so much were due to the feelings of nostalgia it invoked. It took me back to my boyhood, and the mystery of every autumn night. The prose is filled with description and metaphor, transporting the reader directly into the shadowy side of Jim and Will's sleepy little village. The ominous carnival on the outskirts of town and its strange denizens all come alive through Bradbury's master storytelling . If you are a fan of Gothic fiction or just want a tale of the dark fantastic, it doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Carnivals are creepy. I have always thought they were creepy and I will not hear otherwise. My only source of confusion is whether I've always felt this way or only since reading \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes.\\"Ray Bradbury is amazing. He can lure you into a story about a planet far, far away and make you believe in the alien landscape. Or he can bring a haunted carnival to town and cause you both nostalgia and dread. Bradbury is a puppet master and guess who is dangling from the string?\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a perfect book for anyone who has not yet been introduced to this story telling master. It is a perfect book for anybody looking for a literary chill to go with the melancholy of an autumn night. It is damn near a perfect book in just about every way.It is the story of two boys whose innate love of a carnival is interupted by something unholy that lurks among the barkers, the dazzling lights and the spinning rides. Something sinister is afoot and therein lies the tale.This is vintage Bradbury. At its face, a simple horror story with evil men and their evil intentions set within the neon glare of the inherently creepy carnival.But in classic Bradbury style, it is also a look at the murky, unmanageable chasm between youth and adulthood, and the many pitfals of traversing it. An absolutely must read. The kind of book that will provoke long rested memories of childhood while providing the kind of chills that spring from long autumn shadows. You will hear the sound of far off carousel music long after laying the book to rest."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury's dark novel of a mysterious carnival that strolls one night into a quiet Midwestern town has attained a deserved classic status in the forty-some years since its unheralded release. Here Bradbury's oft-demonstrated gift for recalling the mindset of childhood and returning it however briefly to a reader, is in full bloom. Two thirteen-year-old boys, James Nightshade and William Halloway, each a sort of contrast of the other, exist as the heroes in this fable of good versus evil. In this book the weight of the desires of the human heart and the capacity of those desires to ensnare the soul (here, literally) merit the fullest exploration. Nowhere else in literature is a Mephistophelian bargain made so simplistically appealing, and it is a delight to see how Bradbury delivers his temptations like ripe red apples inwardly rotten to the core. And while thinking about the nature of evil, it seems certain constants have been there to bind the forces of ill in the genre of light versus darkness. One of these is that evil has universally stood revealed in the end. Can evil not hide itself? It seems it always gives its nature away. In this book at least Bradbury has the unmasking come in the form of the intuitive perspicacity of two small boys. I liked this enjoyable tale and I liked its characters, from the wickedly charismatic ringmaster Mr. Dark, to its peculiarly vulnerable wicked witch, to the custodian of the town library, Mr. Halloway, whose seemingly dull life is truly one of secret worlds opening to him each night amid the stacks of books. And what WOULD we each give, either now or one day, to be young all over again? Stop to think about that. And if not a return to youth, do we each have some secret desire for which we would do anything, or pay any price? Under the guise of a soft read, Something Wicked This Way Comes delves deep into humanity's consciousness, and explores what lies within."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Bradbury's novel opens up with a wonderful prologue describing good months and bad months. After reading this, I couldn't wait to delve into the novel to discover what other morsels of genius he had to offer.The story of good versus evil, youth versus death, and love versus hate is timeless. It will never get old. It will be recycled in various formats until the day people stop telling stories. Bradbury uses his story as a vehicle to expound upon these themes.When a wicked carnival comes to town it tempts its inhabitants with youth and life. It's hard to say no to your greatest wishes as Will, Jim, and Charles Halloway discover. Some townsfolk cannot turn their back on their dreams. Others discover that true happiness means accepting Life's twists and turns, no matter how cruel they may be.This novel is full of exquisite figurative language. Bradbury shows his prowess as a storyteller in this tale of good and evil."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Bradbury's classic tale is about two thirteen-year-old boys who dally with a strange and evil circus and end up fighting a battle to save their town from the dark forces of evil. There are many vividly frightening characters and scenes along the way. When things are looking really grim for the boys and the society, one of their fathers steps in, believes their outlandish tales, and joins forces with them. The father figure spouts eloquent philosophy on a wide range of subjects, and in the end, he's the true battle hero, which is a little disappointing, because I wanted the young heroes to shine more. Overall, this is a great read around the month of October, and I know it will be enjoyed by generations to come."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Mr. Neal Luis PeraltaEnglish 1 9/2/03Dear Peers,SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMESPeer reviewIf you are looking for a book that has eloquent vocabulary, you should read SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES by Ray Bradbury who wrote the book in a very eloquent vocabulary.

How these two innocents, both age 13, save the souls of the town as well as their own, makes for reading on timeless themes. What would you do if your secret wishes could be granted by the mysterious ringmaster Mr. Dark? Bradbury excels in revealing the dark side that exists in us all, teaching us ultimately to celebrate the shadows rather than fear them. In many ways, this is a companion piece to his joyful, nostalgia-drenched Dandelion Wine, in which Bradbury presented us with one perfect summer as seen through the eyes of a 12-year-old. In Something Wicked This Way Comes, he deftly explores the fearsome delights of one perfectly terrifying, unforgettable autumn. O"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"For someone in search of a dark read, this is it. The poetic prose of Ray Bradbury swept me off of my feet and into the small town in Illinois country where the midnight carnival arrived with it's empty promises and tantalizing shows. Bradbury shows us how people can be good or evil, and that the choice remains in every person; he also provides beautiful examples of how joy and imagination triumph over fear and doubt. He uses the carnival as a symbolic representatation of what happens to people who allow themselves to drift in the past and not make progress towards future happiness. Bradbury alludes to several of his earlier writings, tying together many of his other works into this chilling novel. Even if you have never read Bradbury's work before, this book holds great insite into the world and the individual within it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"There are so many levels to this novel, so many important subplots that to dismiss this book as an &quot;evil carnie&quot; story would be totally irrelevant and unfair. The evil- and this book defines evil, it hits the nail on the head- takes so many forms and affects so many people; but here are the most important:... 1) Jim and Will's friendship. They're best friends, but they're obviously spereated by their characters. Will has been brought up by both his parents; he's thoughtful, a little neurotic; shy, conservative and introverted. Jim is the opposite. He was brought up only by his mother, his father left when he was little; he's outgoing, impulsive, daring, eager to grow up, leave the past behind. Bradbury expresses their differences several ways: Wills' blond, Jim's dark-haired; Will was born one minute before Halloween, Jim's one minute after. And even though he's older, Will always feels he's behind Jim. Like Jim's always in a rush to grow up, leave Will behind... there's symbolism in a scene where Will's running after Jim, and Jim's constantly slowing down for Will. This is important when the carnival comes to town, because Jim, perhaps anxious for a father figure, is easily swayed in going with the carnival. In Star Wars, Jim would turn to the dark side, and Will the light... 2) Will's fathers age. Mr. Halloway feels like he's grown up too fast; and now, in his fifties, he believes that he's never done anything with his life. He feels particularly ashamed that he's never been there for Will: never young enough to play ball with him, run with him, climb with him. And now he's afraid that Will doesn't love him anymore, and is gradually turning into his father. Mr. Halloway bears a mental load on his back of age and regret. Bradbury does a wonderful job here, as in all his stories, of really communicating a man's personal fears and longings. You really side with Mr. Halloway, because his insecurities and insights are the same as ours. You feel his angst, and when the carnival comes beckoning, offering him the chance to be young again, you can truly understand his dilemma... This is really a novel about the evil which resides in us all, merely manifested into something tangible. It's about humanity: their desires, fears, longings, insecurities, regrets, and how we can't let go of them. This is a horror book, not it the sense of ghouls and goblins (though there's plenty of that); it's a horror book about the stuff inside of us, and what we don't express to the ones we love. This is my favorite book, and might just be yours once you read it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Okay, sorry for the pun, but it's true. Hear we have probably one of the most effecting horror novels ever written. What makes Bradbury so powerful a writer. It's not just the simple, yet lyrical, prose, but how every word seems to pulse with the theme of his stories. Bradbury is a master fanticist, who, like Gene Wolfe or Harlan Ellison, has written an large amount of stories in various genres (SF, Horror, even mainstream) yet alway maintaining the same style and texture. Any one who loves good writting should at least read this, The Martian Chronicles, and Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This magnificent story of a dark carnival that visits a small town is a masterpiece. Ray Bradbury weaves an incredible blend of grace in prose with this tale of a would-be boyhood dream turned nightmare. The head of the circus 'Mr. Dark' will really give you chills as he is a pure through and through villian seeking the souls of everyone in town. 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' is one of Bradbury's paramount works of pure genius. Anyone will truly be a Bradbury fan after reading this one."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"_I've always considered this book to be the dark companion to Bradbury's _Dandelion Wine_. Will Halloway is Douglas Spaulding is...young Ray Bradbury. However, where _Dandelion Wine_ dwells primarily on the innocent and uncorrupted side of small-town America in its golden age, this volume dwells with its shadow side. You see, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show doesn't bring darkness to town, so much as it cultivates what's already there. Like all portrayers of vice, if there weren't already a potentially willing market, they would have no success._Yet, every generation the black train steams into town- always on the cusp of the seasons- always in a long October, half way between midsummer and Christmas. Every generation they tempt and entrap. Every generation must either resist or succumb to their dark tricks. These October people are still out there, still making their infernal rounds...._This book bears rereading. First of all, like much of Bradbury's earlier work it is as much poem as prose. I know that I myself didn't really appreciate poetry, the right brain side of seeing things, until I found his work. Also, as one grows older, one identifies less with Will, and Will's potential shadow, Jim, and more with the other characters. For me, Will's father, an old man who has wandered the world and has suffered a thousand petty defeats- and a much lesser number of minor victories- becomes more and more familiar._This book will give you nightmares. It will do so not because of graphic violence, but because of the way it subtly undermines the spirit and spreads doubts through the chinks of the soul. Still, without Dark to contend with, how would Light define, and strengthen, itself?"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This book is a fiction masterpiece. It is enormously frightening in a very subtle way. I found it easy to identify with the two main characters, whose lives are forever changed in an instant by the sudden appearance of evil. It reminds us just how very fragile our surroundings really are and how evil can have many, not so obvious faces. At the same time, we see how good can triumph over darkness. Suspenseful to the end, I could barely put the book down."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I tried to read this book several times when I was about thirteen (the age of the two boys in the story). Although I was a Bradbury fan, and found the tone and premise intriguing, I could never get past the opening chapters, usually setting it aside about the time the carnival pulls into town.35 years later, I finally read it.I didn't lose anything by waiting, because I'm sure my younger self would have been disappointed. This story has a lot to offer in terms of its philosophical mood, and has a haunting quality to it, but it's told in a surrealistic style that is not always clear, and Bradbury's prose is clotted with numerous tangled metaphors and sentences that make no literal sense. It's still not what I'd call a difficult read; I whipped through it in a few days. Bradbury maintains an element of suspense(more by suggestion than by clearly describing anything) and the conclusion, although slightly heavy-handed, is satisfying.&quot;Something Wicked this way Comes&quot; reminds me of two books: &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeleine L'Engle, a children's novel which made a tremendous impression on me when I was nine years old; and Stephen King's &quot;Needful Things&quot;, which has a similar theme. There are probably dozens of stories using this theme; since this one was published 40 years ago it's not fair to call it derivative, but I'm not sure if it's genuinely original. None of that really matters, though, since it's Bradbury's feel for the time and place, and his accurate depiction of the adolescent point of view that make this story effective, in spite of its frequent wordiness, obscurity, and overwriting. Sometimes the best writers can get away with bad writing --- or what would be bad writing in the hands of a less capable author --- and that seems to me to be the case here.As others have observed, it's not a horror novel; more of a dark fantasy with a positive underlying theme. I find it encouraging that so many young people are reading and enjoying this book; although I'm not wild about it, it's likely to whet the appetite for further reading.If you haven't read Bradbury before, I recommend the short story collections such as &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; or &quot;October Country&quot;; or the novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and the collection of linked stories that forms his masterpiece &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Most of what needs to be said has been said above, but I'd like to add a word about Bradbury's lexical enthusiasm. Too many folks here knocking him for 'swallowing the thesaurus' or summat. What a dumbed-down, pathetic bunch of quasi-illiterate prats! Some folks could (can) write like that without dictionary, thesaurus, assistance or therapy. They did/do it for fun, for the sheer joy of language, for the ping-pong of Joyce, Woolf and Faullker versus Hemingway, Mailer and Co, avalanches of colour versus perfectly composed black and white. Bradbury never needed the paranoid little forewords that whinged about fantasy and sci-fi being peripheral to literature. He could write, late 50's/early 60's-style, and do it well. To judge him by the cretinous reductionism of the post-post modern is anachronistic, patronising and unfair. Sod off and complain about Moby Dick if you want to pick holes in language."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Well, Ray Bradbury pulled off something I never thought I'd see: heartwarming horror. Something Wicked This Way Comes is a truly frightening horror story about two boys living in a midwestern town visited by a mysterious carnival and its group of evil proprietors and \\"freaks.\\" The boys see too much and become the target of the malevolent forces of the carnival. Bradbury writes these characters to be truly frightening.The horror story itself would have been very solid, but Bradbury marries it seamlessly to the story of one of the two boys coming to see his father in a different light, even as the father finds something within himself that has sat dormant for far too long.A truly deep story that will scare you, inspire you and keep you turning the pages. This one should be read more often, it's a real gem."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Sometimes there seem to be two Ray Bradbury's. On the one hand, there's the writer of Twilight Zone-esque (before the TZ existed!) stories that are exciting or just plain creepy (The Illustrated Man, R Is For Rocket). On the other hand, there's Bradbury the stylist, who can write page after page of poetry in prose form (Dandelion Wine). Not everybody likes both.But in this novel the two Bradbury's meet. His love for boyhood, the beauty of a small town, the love of a father are all captured in gorgeous writing wrapped around a truly creepy tale. The Wonder Years meets Dracula? There's really nothing else like this work: it can stand up right beside To Kill a Mockingbird and a Tales From the Crypt collection.Oh, and whatever you do, don't watch the movie version."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Bradbury has always been a better short story writer than a novelist but occassionally he comes along with something that makes you wonder why he doesn't write more novels. However most of his best novels read like longer short stories and this one is no exception. Not that I'm complaining, mind you, because this one is so good you don't notice how short it is and really don't even care. His classic seems engrained on our collective conscious and most people probably think the phrase &quot;Something wicked this way comes&quot; comes from the title of this book and not from the Shakespeare play (Macbeth?). The one thing I notice that's different about his writing is that it's far more lyrical than normal, he seems to have a better command of the English language and every sentence and paragraphp seems dense with imagery and metaphors. The story itself ain't too bad either, the tale of a carnival that has come to take the souls of the unsuspecting town, and only two boys and a father who doubts himself can stop them. Mr Dark is one of the best villians ever to grace a novel and he exudes menace and pure evil all at the same time. The entire novel feels like a child's dream turned into nightmare and Bradbury's trademark nostalgia is still there, though less prominent than usual. Everything is beautifully constructed and you'll want to savor the writing over and over. Everyone who thought he had left horror should read this, even though it's not in the same vein as say The October Country it's close enough and just as enjoyable."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked this Way Comes is a story of mystery. If you like spooky and curious novels, you are going to like this one. Something Wicked this Way Comes has events you probably want to know who the bad person is and what is going to happen. I did not really understand the story in the beginning; because my opinion is that, the author goes from talking about a character and does not click with the rest of the story. The Novel is good to read though, because when you get closer to the end the story has a lot of suspense, and makes the story more exciting and interesting to read. The story has details that explain how the characters and setting look like. You can picture the theme of the story easily. Something Wicked this Way Comes is about two close friends that find out a secret magic that the carnival has. The two boys then are hiding in dark places and do not trust no one. They hide, because the carnival freaks are trying to hunt them down! If you choose to read this novel, read each chapter carefully, because if you do not you will get lost and would not know what is happening."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of the masters of modern literature. However, I have only encountered his excellent prose twice: in the superb science fiction thriller FAHRENHEIT 451 (a must read) and here in the pages of SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES. After these entertaining reads, I need to familiarize myself with more of his work.As for the book, Something Wicked is a story that every child (especially young boys) can relate to. It's the story of friendship and indeed best friends, the story of an evil carnival that gives people what they desire...but at what price, and the bond between fathers and sons. Truly the monsters in this book practically leap off of the page - the dust witch really creeped me out. The tattooed Mr. Dark is an evil classic and the confrontation between him and the main characters in the depths of the library is a page-burner (and made me remember the creepy feeling I used to get in librarys).If you are not familiar with this story...READ IT NOW! And, where this story cries out to the joys of youth and childhood, I feel I should also recommend BOY'S LIFE by Robert R. McCammon which in many ways is a reflection on this story...the two would definately make excellent book ends."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury's stories always manage to pierce through into a deep sense of longing. They leave you unsatisfied (because they do come to an end) yet, at the same time, filled with pleasure at the rightness of just how he does it (Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, for example).Something Wicked This Way Comes is no different. The struggle between evil for the possession of the boys' souls and the love, bravery, and sacrifice elicited from Will and his dad just knocks you out. The increasing pace, the looming threat, and the ever more clearly defined personal consequences of squarely facing it, all rachet up the tension in perfect phase--you'll know it when you get to that special chapter. Once I began this book, I did not stop until I finished it. Do not pollute your mental imagery with the movie version. Trust your own imagination. Read the book!

I think it would have clicked more with me at a younger age, but it was still fun to read. This is a classic example of Bradbury's &quot;indirect storytelling&quot;... he presents the framework or essential elements of a situation, and then it's left for your imagination to fill in the blanks and interpret it. In other words, this book does not spoon-feed you every piece of underlying plot or meaning - that depends on you. It is definitely a spooky book (though somewhat dated and long-winded), and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This was my first experience with Bradbury and I had to ask myself several times, \\"Why haven't I read any of his work before?\\" Bradbury has a wonderful style to his prose and his use of language really makes the reader pause and relish what has just been read before moving on for more.Several other reviews and comments have labeled this book as a book for teens or slapped it with the dreaded \\"Young Adult\\" label. While I do find this novel to be very appropriate for a younger audience. I also think that whether or not you read it at a younger age, it is a novel that will be more appreciated by those of a more ripened age. To me, a younger audience will be more drawn to the plight of the main characters whereas someone such as myself will identify and better understand the position and emotional makeup of Will's father, Mr. Halloway.The story itself is a wonderful coming of age type of adventure with plenty of tension and horrific moments that keep the reader on the edge of their seat. While the book is not so long as to be intimidating to more inexperienced readers, I found that it was anything but a quick read. That is not to say that I struggled to get through it, as a matter of fact, that couldn't be further from the truth. I found this novel to be one that I had to savor in smaller bites, taking a moment from time to time to sit back a reflect on the language and description provided by the author rather than rushing on to the next moment with our young heroes.All in all and enjoyable tale for both young and old that I will be sure to pick up again."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"With so many reviews there's not a lot to add, so I'll say this. If you like horror and haven't read Bradbury, read Something Wicked This Way Comes. The phrasing and language is very different from what you'll read in modern thrillers, but underneath the dark prose is a down to earth horrifying story that you won't forget.Poisoned Soil"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Was Comes was one of my favorite books when I was a kid. I picked it up immediately after Fahrenheit 451, which was the first book I had to read for school that I actually liked. Bradbury is probably more responsible than any other single author for my love of reading, and for that he has my eternal gratitude.Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are wonderful characters, in many ways alike (hence their nearly unbreakable bond of friendship), but in some ways very different (hence that bond's almost being broken)---and I could relate very much to them both when I was about their age (and to some extent still). Mr. Halloway is wonderful as well, and I've always had a special affection for him and his beloved library stacks.Rereading it now as an adult, it doesn't stand up quite as well as some of his other books, but it still shines with that irrepressible Bradbury spirit. It's quite entertaining and a lot of fun even for grown-ups, at least those of us who haven't become too jaded. There's just something almost inherently thrilling to the child in all of us about the idea of a dark, October carnival.And the book is a bit dark, at least on its surface, even compared with Bradbury's other Green Town stories (notably Dandelion Wine) which were themselves actually kind of dark. Like them, it deals with death, but more specifically and directly in a more focused novel. But in the end, it is a story of light and life, as Bradbury puts death in its proper place, concluding: \\"Is Death important? No. Everything that happens before Death is what counts.\\"Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is the story of Will and Jim, best friends for as long as they can remember. One night, a carnival comes to town. But something about this carnival is not quite right and the boys are determined to find out what.This is a fantastic story. It is about love and friendship, good versus evil. It is about our desires and our fears. It has wonderful descriptions, but the writing is a little difficult at times and interrupts the flow of the action. Were it not for that, this would be a five star book. Definitely a recommended read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Revisiting novels I loved in my youth. Purchased \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" Ray Bradbury after his recent passing last month. -Wasn't available in Kindle and so I purchased a hardcopy- haven't done that in over a year. Got it yesterday afternoon and finished half before I realized it.Such rich characters such as Tom Fury, lightening-rod salesman who tells the main characters that there is a storm coming the night a dark carnival comes to town. Will Halloway and his best friend Jim Nightshade, both 13 years old and born next door neighbors. They have the distinction of being born one minute apart at the stroke of midnight. Bradbury has them see the exact same events, but their point of view is so widely different. Blond Will is the optimist and Jim Nightshade ever the pessimist. Will's dad, Charles Halloway is the older-frail librarian who stands against Mr. Dark, the illustrated man and owner of the carnival- think surrogate father- who wants to lure Jim away as his new partner. I have to think that Stephen King has this book on his own shelf- themes are similar in so many of his own titles.Yup, I'm a fan and have been since I was Will Halloway's age- I cannot recommend this as a Young Adult title however. I am not sure if the themes adults willing to sacrifice their souls for youth or teenagers willing to sacrifice their youth for adulthood isn't too subtle."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The title of this book is what initially drew me in. I always wondered where this phrase came from; little did I know it was actually a Shakespeare quote. Either way, I had never read a Ray Bradbury book before and I wanted an easy read that would be suspenseful and satisfying.The book follows the adventure of two young innocent boys and their run-in with an evil carnival that comes to town. I found the friendship between the two boys to be very similar to my childhood friendships, which helped me make a quick fun connection. The circus magic in this book seemed to me to have a little influence in the magical Harry Potter series, although not so deliberate in its fantasy.One of the most unique aspects of this book that I noticed was the usage of a mixture of concrete/abstract imagery to set the scene and describe the characters. When describing the dark figure coming into the room, Bradbury writes, \\"The shadow seemed deliberate in its slowness so as to shingle his flesh and cheesegrate his steadily willed calm.\\" With noun-verbs in descriptions such as \\"cheesegrate\\" and \\"shingle\\" it seems as though we can trace the tendency we have in American English of \\"noun-ing\\" our verbs back to Bradbury. At first, the very detailed and obscure descriptions were a little annoying and hard to read through. However, as I got used to the style of the author, I began to enjoy reading the different adjectives and verbs he would use to paint the picture in my mind.Overall, although a little hard to find initial interest, I found this book to be an interesting and beneficial read. The characters that are brought life in vivid abstract-concrete detail provides for a creative story with enough suspense and emotion to keep you interested until this end of this short read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"When a shadowy carnival comes to town, promotional flyers touting a dusty witch, a skeleton, magic mirrors and the most beautiful woman attract the attention of 2 boys, the best of friends, having been born each side of midnight. But this is not a regular carnival, full of wonder and excitement. People start disappearing from town, a strange boy appears, and the carousel plays the Funeral March music backwards.The level of suspense and creepiness escalates with the turning of each page. But it's no simple horror story. Bradbury weaves a colorful and at times, poetic fantasy, bringing our best childhood nightmare creatures to life between the pages, and leaves us scrambling to grasp at a slim hope that an unlikely character might actually have the answer to stop them from devouring our two boys.What's especially impressive is Bradbury's ability to draw out the natural curiosity of boys who are full of life, one always just running towards what the future might bring, and the other leaping along more cautiously, one arm outstretched to protect his friend if danger should present itself.The suspense is held like a taut string all the way till the last chapter of the book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"On the surface this would seem to be a fantasy story about a dark carnival and the even darker man that runs it.However, all the fantastical elements of this story are really just a springboard for discussing teenage Will Hollawy's relationship with his over the hill father, Charles, and something most decidedly not wicked at all but wonderful: the redemptive power of love.It all starts in anytown USA circa 1930s when an otherwise common October is altered by the arrival of a carnival. Young Will Holloway actually witnesses the arrival of that carnival with his friend Jim Nightshade when they're out adventuring one night.Even from the start the boys suspect that there is something very different about this carnival. In stages their suspicions are confirmed when they play witness to a series of extraordinary things from a calliope that can alter one's age to the strange powers of the carnival's inhabitants up to and including the mysterious Mr. Dark, the carnival's operator.Perhaps more dark than even Mr. Dark are the quiet fears and unfulfilled desires of some of the town residents who Dark would prey on. This includes the supposedly elderly Charles Halloway. In that quaint way that authors sometimes betray the age in which they write (this book was published in 1962), Charles Halloway, though only 54 is still pre occupied with thoughts that his age makes him somehow impotent as a father. (As an aside the screenplay for the 1983 movie on which this book was based most powerfully underscored Halloway's concern about his age by creating an incident where another younger man, had to be called in order to save Halloway's son from a drowning.)For his part young Will Halloway and his friend along with him soon find that they're in deep way over their heads and they need assistance. It's in this way Bradbury cleverly uses his fantastical set up for an all too real story that allows both young Will Halloway to save his Dad and the older Charles Halloway to save his son, both using love's redemptive power.Will that redemptive power prevail over Dark's evil? And if so how? Those questions of course are best answered by reading this story which is, in my opinion, not just one of Bradbury's best but also one of the best stories of American fantasy and science fiction."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This small town October adventure is better than bobbing for apples and coming up with the grand prize kiss from your middle school crush. I love the poetry in Bradbury's prose. I love the way he writes images that turn the pages into a looking glass you can step through to join hands with his characters. And most of all, I love the way he wrestles with major themes beneath the immediate action. At its heart this read to me like a book about death. About the power we give to evil because of our fear of it. About always looking ahead, be we young or old, and wanting something other than the gift we have right now: the present. Great read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"When Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to town, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are drawn into a battle for their souls. Ray Bradbury's writing style sprinkled with half mad similes and metaphors turns a carnival into a place that breathes out wickedness and despair. There are a couple rambling philosophical sections that detract from the pace of the book, but this is one creepy page-turner!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I have to admit that I just don't get it. I'm baffled as to why Ray Bradbury is considered such a genius. This book, considered one of his best, really doesn't stand out to me as anything all that special. The plot is cute, at best. It's not terribly creative; in fact, it's quite formulaic and often predictable. The characters are interesting, but not in any profound sort of way. And the writing is choppy and unrefined. I might give this book to an 11-year-old looking for a quick, easy read. But I have to believe that the past forty years have produced better material in the way of fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I have read several Ray Bradbury works, I have yet to find one I like but other people rave over them and movies have been made of some of them. \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is, to me, one of his worst. The story is simple, a carnival comes to town, two boys, fast friends, visit it and discover the carousel has the ability to either age people or subtract years. The carnival owners find out the boys have this knowledge and plan to get rid of the boys. One of the boy's father comes to their aid and in doing so grows in stature in their eyes and the boys and the man rediscover themselves.In my hardcover copy it takes Bradbury 289 pages to tell this simple tale and he seems to have searched the dictionary for words that he doesn't know how to use, he groups them in awkward fashion, makes nouns into verbs, adjectives become neologisms, juxtaposes words together but making no sense thus used, repeats phrases for some reason which I am unable to detect and I think tries to make himself look greater than he is by this use of words, instead he disrupts thought, not helping the story and, frankly, making a fool of himself by his word usage. Vladimir Nabokov was a Russian who also looked to use uncommon English words in his writing, he seldom missed but his stretches could be excused since English was a second language to him. What was Bradbury's excuse?"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I'm an avid reader, and I am usually able to comprehend what I'm reading. But this story was a bit too descriptive, I'm sure that appeals to some people, but not to me or any of the other kids in my english class. It seems to the majority of us that one would have to be on acid to understand what's going on, this may be because it's the end of the school year and we're seniors, but I think it's mainly due to the over-descriptive nature of the book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This book used a mammoth amount of undecipherable metaphors and similies, confusing and unnecssecary description. The dialog had no point and about 85% of the book was pointless. In other words dont waste your time. I was looking on this site for a full review of this awful book so i can to my ridiculously long report on this book i didnt understand."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Though I usually enjoy books of this mysterious nature, this one was different. I do not reccommend this book for people like me with very little patience and a short attention span, for even in it's most exiting parts, it proves to be boring and slow-moving."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.

He uses to many pages describing... NOTHING. I guess he tried to make it creepy by the whole evil carnival but... it didnt work. I had to do this book for a book report so I had to read it.

That has certainly changed. I have passed this book on to my 10 year old daughter and she loves it. I can certainly see how Ray Bradbury has influenced many of todays best writers."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I found much of the book slow, perhaps because of the ornate style of prose that Mr. Bradbury employed. But perhaps he WANTED us to read it slowly, the crafty fellow! The plot was interesting, and the ending clipped along at a brisk enough pace to salvage things for me."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"For me to enjoy a book I have to be able to relate, on some level, to the characters and it was difficult for me to do that. It's not gender; I've read many books with male protagonists and still found them very enjoyable, but I just couldn't empathize with either of the boys' plights or thoughts or emotions. Both boys were just so unoriginal and trite.More unforgivable than the fact that the two young boys were rather boring and cookie-cutter, is the fact that this book did not cause me to jump, feel shivers up my spine or feel my heart beat speed up in dread at all. I felt cheated of a scare. I was promised that this was a classic horror story and that I would never forget it, but unfortunately, the reason I will never forget it is because it was such a boring read.I don't understand it - carnivals can be one of the creepiest settings for a story, yet Bradbury allows this choice backdrop to go to waste! He focuses on the carousel, which is great because that can be a pretty scary ride, what with all the bizarre colors and expressions on the animals' faces, but the reason the carousel was scary in this book just did not do it for me. When I read it, my initial reaction was \\"That's it? THAT'S the 'big' baddie?\\" I don't need my horrors to actually be physically manifested in some demonic thing or thrown into my face with no subtlety, but I do need it to actually BE scary and that was just not the case here.There were numerous times when I had to go back and re-read passages that were convoluted just for the sake of being convoluted, that I nearly tossed the book aside in impatience. Some authors write \\"complicated\\" novels well - consider Faulkner's Light In August for example - but Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes does not fall under that category.Doggedly I persisted and I finished this stupid thing and I wasted my time.Despite how much people seem to laud it (and that's fine - everyone's entitled to his/her opinion) I did not enjoy this book at all, would NOT recommend it if you are looking for a good read and would advise that you turn to Bradbury's short-story collections instead. I think that Bradbury is MUCH better at writing short stories than he is at writing novels like this one."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I know that Something Wicked This Way Comes is a classic that many readers love, but I found the novel rather disappointing and can in all honesty only reward it with three stars. For me, the writing was just too disjointed at times, full of little pot holes I kept catching my foot in. The real world of this dark fantasy, the town before the dark carnival rolled in under the cover of night, never seemed real to me, and the friendship of the two boys, Will and Jim, never made perfect sense. We are told they are so much alike, born two minutes apart, but they seem mirror opposites to me. One aspect of Jim in particular is mentioned rather prominently yet never explored or even mentioned again, a fact I found disheartening. Then there is Will's father, an older man stumbling quietly through just a few pages of the first half of the novel before becoming magically transformed into an eloquent speaker and incredibly able enemy of dark forces. Certainly, there are aspects of the story I accepted and enjoyed, such as the issue of time and the ways in which boys want to be older and aging men and women long for a return to youth; it was exactly these most innermost desires that fed the strange carnival operators Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger. The idea of the carnival freaks being the remnants of the carnival's former victims is also good. The machinery of the story, though, just never worked for me. The mirror magic of the maze was not developed enough to be convincing, and the inner mysteries of the darkly magical carousel never seemed anything more than foolish to me. Since the evils of the carnival were never convincing to me, the manner in which its harmful effects are fought seemed almost ridiculous. My entire reading of this novel was something of a struggle, one which offered me only a few moments of satisfaction. Knowing that this is Ray Bradbury, I tried very hard to like Something Wicked This Way Comes, but for whatever reason Bradbury's magic just never had any discernible effect on me."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"A carnival comes to a small town.

I looked forward to it. I liked Bradbury's short stories very much. Unfortunately this is virtually unreadable. Bradbury seems to like showing off how smart he is and renders most of the descriptions of places and things in flowery, overdone language. More often then not I had to reread a sentence multiple times before I understood it! This is a perfect description of the word \\"pretentious\\". The sad thing is this has all the elements of a good horror story. The description of Mr. Dark's carnival works (when you can understand it) and the Dust Witch \\"marking\\" the two kids houses is downright horrific. There's also the ferris wheel that ages a person at each spin. This is all creepy stuff but Bradbury seems more intent on showing how intelligent he is than making a coherent story. Too bad."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This review pertains to \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", Hardcover, ISBN: 978-0380977277.BEWARE!!!

Bradbury is one of my favorite authors, but I don't have much fondness for his nostalgia literature--like Something Wicked This Way Comes, or Dandelion Wine. My memories aren't made up of those landscapes or experiences, and so there's no personal fondness. I also begrudge that branch of his work its stylistic redundancy. Bradbury's science fiction has incredible atmosphere, but it's driven by a demanding premise and/or constrained to short form, and so there's less opportunity for the prose to run away with itself--instead, his emotional focus and quietude are atmospheric blessings. Something Wicked has fantastic elements, but they're powered by nostalgia--and so while it offers up some beautiful turns of phrase, those are lost within a mountain road of prose. I've read the book before, some years back, and find I remember some parts well: there's aspects of the book that I love, and Bradbury creates a veritable carnival of horrors which delight me; I see how they could make for a successful book. Bradbury portrays an intensely idealized but vibrant representation of youth and youth's confrontation with age (and with life)--and his themes, despite their lack of personal appeal, are carried through with conviction. But no matter my best intentions and my love of the author, Something Wicked isn't the book for me. I appreciate and can recommend it for what it tries to be, but I don't enjoy it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes, not bad for a horror novel. im usually not into horror, but all in all it wasnt bad. the storyline was pretty original, and the writing itself was not bradbury's best, but still decent.

He uses words with like meanings in long strings and it got old rather quickly. Some parts are like reading entries in a Thesaurus; I skipped over these \\"defining\\" paragraphs/sentences after the first couple chapters.The book was not 'wicked'; it isn't even as scary as some R.L. Stine books I dug up recently and those aren't even a fraction of the size and depth this attempts. With the name \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", I was expecting wickedness worded out; twisted thoughts and evilness dealt out by a ominous force. No deal.

Because its easier to understand."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I grew up reading Ray Bradbury (6th to 10th grades). So now some twenty plus years later, in a nostalgic mood, I ordered a bunch of Bradbury books. Something Wicked This Way Comes was the first book I chose to read and now I kind of wish I hadn't.In this book, Bradbury writes shorter sentences than Hemingway. And far too many of them contain exclamations such as: \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Oh gosh!\\"; \\"Dad!\\"; \\"It's hopeless!\\"; \\"Boys!\\"; \\"Like Heck!\\"; \\"Cheezeit!\\"; \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Jehosophat!\\"; \\"You're evil!\\"; \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Bangity-bang!\\"; and the best of all, \\"But for cri-yi, Jim, face it, you don't really want to be twenty!\\"How about this for a sequence:\\"No its all right!\\"\\"Jim!\\"\\"Will, yes, its ok!\\"\\"Stand back!\\"\\"This man is in a trance! As part of our new act I have hypnotized him! He could suffer injury if you shocked him from the spell!\\"The internes shut their mouths. The police stopped moving.\\"One hundred thousand volts! Yet he will come forth alive, whole in sound mind and body!\\"Now that's some writing. Ed Wood himself couldn't have done that scene better.All of this could be forgiven if there was an underlying story or even some characters worth knowing. But alas...The protagonist, Will, is a wussy. His father, Charles Halloway is dour old woman. Will's best friend, Jim, has some guts, but to Will and his father he is far too brash. The villains, such as they are, are not frightening or particularly villainous. There is a dwarf, a witch, an illustrated man--not to mention Mr. Electro. Oh my!And what dastardly deeds come to light? Why there is a carousel that can turn a young boy into an old man and vice versa! Gasp! There is a maze of mirrors that shows people their worst fears! Shriek! There is a freak show with the implication that carnival director Mr. Dark sculpted these freaks (pinhead, sheep boy, fire eater) from ordinary folks just like Will and Jim!As Jim would say, \\"I think I'm going to bawl now!\\"You aren't missing much if you take a pass on this book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I can't believe the constant showboating of the writing in this book. The metaphors per paragraph (MPP) is just ridiculous and totally distracting from the story. Simile and metaphor are meant to communicate meaning. In this book, however, many of them, while sounding interesting or \\"peotic,\\" simly don't do their real job, which is to help tell the story. Or maybe that's the problem - the story isn't very interesting so the author hopes to distract the reader from that fact with the spastic writing style. Bradbury here writes like a college kid whose only real chance of getting laid is by impressing some girl in his creative writing class. Really sad; I thought Bradbury was better that this. He apparently needed - and went without - a reasonable editor who certainly would have taken him out in the parking lot and slapped him around until he remembered what writing was supposed to sound like. Real writers use literary devices sparingly, if at all. And when they do, they make sure they are dead-on and impactful.

There are some sentences you re-read for pleasure, thinking: 'Wow, well said!' But he doesn't reign in the mannered technique enough for you to relax and enjoy the story.

It is a fiction book. In this book, the lesson is to help others in any way you can. It is like what John F. Kennedy said, \\"Ask not what the country can do for you, but what you can do for the country.\\" In this case, Will helped his friend without asking and that shows how much Will and his friend Jim care about each other. This book has a lot to do with friendship.The text is about a carnival coming to their town late in the year and Will's father has a bad feeling about it but the boys are enthusiastic about it and go many different times. Mr. Dark, the illustrator, has like an evil mind while Charles Halloway, Will's father, doesn't. Mr. Halloway outsmarts Mr. Dark, rescues his son, and kills the witch. Later, Jim falls into a stupor where he almost dies. Mr. Dark comes back as a kid when Mr. Halloway had recognized him and kills him with showing affection. While the carnival falls apart, Will keeps trying to revive Jim. Will and his father save him by singing, dancing, and laughing, anything that deals with happiness. Happiness brings Jim back alive and away from the edge of being dead.At the beginning of the book, it was very interesting learning about the two boys of how they were and described themselves. For me, later, it got less interesting, but then Mr. Dark came in with the carnival and everything all of a sudden was very cool to keep reading.Therefore, this book has to do a lot with happiness and heroic stuff. I hope this convinces you that Something Wicked This Way Comes is very interesting and fun to read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked this Way Comes is a story of mystery. If you like spooky and curious novels, you are going to like this one. Something Wicked this Way Comes has events you probably want to know who the bad person is and what is going to happen. I did not really understand the story in the beginning; because my opinion is that, the author goes from talking about a character and does not click with the rest of the story. The Novel is good to read though, because when you get closer to the end the story has a lot of suspense, and makes the story more exciting and interesting to read. The story has details that explain how the characters and setting look like. You can picture the theme of the story easily. Something Wicked this Way Comes is about two close friends that find out a secret magic that the carnival has. The two boys then are hiding in dark places and do not trust no one. They hide, because the carnival freaks are trying to hunt them down!

You never knew what to expect. Will and Jim were two young boys with dreams and hopes like every other boy. They never expected something wicked coming for them. I personally enjoyed the book and think the movie was great as well. The movie and the novel compare and contrast in many different ways. I rate this novel a 3 becuase it is in the mid-point of a great novel. I couldn't relate to it so that's why I didn't rate it a 4. But it is an excellent book to read. When I first read the book I was very confuse about the direction it was going, but in the end it all ties up and connects to each personal character."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something wicked did happen to Will and Jim. Two close friends about the same age wonder around and found something that changed both of their lifes. The carousel they saw by wondering around was a time machine. Both were present to see how the time machine works. They saw how the carousel took many weird people back in time according to their desires. A big disaster was the conclusion of their wondering, they were chased and tempted for looking at people and things they werent suppose to be seen."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I liked this book. It was hard to understand in parts of the book but after working through it I was able to get it. There was action, suspense and evil things happen.Jim Nightshade (13 years, 11 months, and 23 day) and his friend Will Halloway(13 years, 11 months, and 24 day) can't wait for their birthdays on Halloween. About a week before Halloween a carnival comes to town which is unusual because it so late in the year. At 3:00 the carnival comes. Curiosity overcoming them, Will and Jim run down to see it. That's when they knew this wasn't a regular carnival. In the morning they decide to go again but no it looks like a regular carnival. One ride stands out to Jim, the merry-go-round, which says, closed. The carnival closes and Jim and Will stay to look at the merry-go-round and they find out why it's closed. If ridden forward the merry-go-round makes you older, ridden backwards it makes you younger. They check newspaper articles and Mr. Cooger and Mr. Dark have been bringing the carnival every forty years. The same men that own the carnival now. Only the merry-go-round can answer that question. Going to Will's dad for help it becomes a competition against the carnival freaks that live off pain. When Jim, who wants to ride the merry-go-round, is nowhere to be found that's where Will looks first. Jim is they're riding the merry-go-round getting older. When he gets off, he's about 19 years old and close to dead. Will's dad suggests that if happiness killed the freaks then it should bring Jim back. Yes I did like this book because I have read other R L Stine books, but they where Goosebumps books and have really liked them because I really like mystery books.The book is about Emily and her family. Her mom tells her that she is going to be getting two new stepsisters. One is called Jessie and the other is called Nancy. Once they are at her house strange things start happening. Somebody killed Tiger, Emily's dog, while she was at a dance. Somebody killed Jollie and somebody put peroxide in Emily's favorite shampoo. When the family goes camping and Emily, Jessie and Nancy go looking for firewood, Nancy gets separated and Emily tries to get away from Jessie and she ends up in the old grave yard. When Nancy puts the shovel in the rabbit's grave the shovel lands on Emily's arm and her arm is broken. Why has someone been trying to hurt Emily?I recommend this book to anyone.But will it work?If you like dark fantasy you'll like this book, or science fiction. Advanced readers will like this book too. There is action and suspense so if you like that you will also like this book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"There is a dark veil hanging over this book and it absolutely scary. Scarier than some horror movies.Ray Bradbury is of course one of the greatest sf/fantasy writers of the 20th century and if you have never read any of his books, read this one or Fahrenheit 451.It has many dark and mysterious themes, a traveling show with many strange characters. It is about how people can play with time and how that may affect the souls of people. It could be, and I mean this positive, a Star Trek or X-Files episode.

Every paragraph in the book is a poem.It is a tale of two young boys, one bright, and one dark, who discover a great evil inthe autumn carnival. Somehow they must stop the evil from spreading without allowing it toengulf them as well. It is a carnival that makes broken promises and takes away your whole world,and Bradbury makes it come to life. The carnival is alive with everything from Witches of Wax, toShrunken Lightning Rod Salesmen.Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. It is experiencing fear at it's strongest, while sittingin the comfort of your own home. I would recommend this book to anyone, from children to seniors.Read it before it reads you.I don't know why I said that.David Warkentin, 14"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Great, pivotal book by Ray Bradbury. My sister needed it for a class and this is a great edition! I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Well, you've got to grant that Ray Bradbury is not a boring novelist. The entire story of Something Wicked This Way Comes runs almost entirely on enthusiasm. Part morality tale and part freak show, Something Wicked finds something of a happy medium as an exuberant young adult novel, a wild and unstoppable train of delight in every moment of living. The two protagonists Jim and Will live unimpeded lives without any great danger until the day the Dark Train arrives in the middle of the night, at the witching hour. Unfortunately, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show offers more than mere curiosities and entertainments: it offers your heart's desire... for a price. Are you looking for true love? Your lost youth? Cooger & Dark will give it to you, just take a short ride on this carousel over here.It's easy for a reader to lose the overall geography of the novel in favor of its individual parts. Bradbury's prose oozes with flamboyance and a baroque explosion of literary decoration. Consider this description of a library from the second chapter:\\"Out in the world, not much happened. But here in the special night, a land bricked with paper and leather, anything might happen, always did. Listen! and you heard ten thousand people screaming so high only dogs feathered their ears. A million folk ran toting cannons, sharpening guillotines; Chinese, four abreast, marched on forever. Invisible, silent, yes, but Jim and Will had the gift of ears and noses as well as the gift of tongues. This was a factory of spices from far countries. Here alien deserts slumbered. Up front was the desk where the nice old lady, Miss Watriss, purple-stamped your books, but down off away were Tibet and Antarctica, the Congo. There went Miss Wills, the other librarian, through Outer Mongolia, calmly toting fragments of Peiping and Yokohama and the Celebes. Way down the third book corridor, an oldish man whispered his broom along in the dark, mounding the fallen spices...\\"Arguably, the overall body of the novel takes second place to its members. Bradbury's prose is such a delight to read that you might find yourself surprised to see a story wrapping itself up in the final chapters.But what is this novel? A horror story? An allegory of sin and temptation? An exercise in literary gluttony? I would suggest that it's a little bit of each. The moral, insofar as there is a coherent one at all, concerns the power of a sanguine attitude over the dark despair that comes in the middle of the night when you're tossing awake in bed. The Dark People could be interpreted as embodiments of ennui or despondency, as noonday devils who twist one's head around backwards to glare forever at what he has left behind. They feed on the unhappiness of ordinary people, and have so fed for centuries if not millennia. The fact that laughter has such great power over Mr. Dark and his carnival freaks would support this approach to the story.Most of all, I think that Something Wicked is worth reading for its grab-life-by-the-tail-and-hang-on attitude. It lacks a certain type of literary quality, but makes up for it with spiritedness, like a child who creates a whole imaginative universe using only Legos and crayons. One might need to be in the right mood for this novel, but it's not an unpleasant mood. Not unpleasant at all."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The Disney version of this book that was done in the 1980s really doesn't do this book justice. The prose is extremely vivid and rich, almost poetic. This is an excellent tale for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I'd like to start this review by getting the negatives out of the way first. My main problem with the book was how wordy it was at certain points, which I felt somewhat disrupted the flow of the novel. I would assume I'm in the minority about disliking this style, but I read purely for fun, not for themes and life lessons(though if a novel has them, as this certainly does, it's not a bad thing). Some of Mr. Halloway's long-winded perspective in the novel, his philosphy, slowed the book down. It's not that Bradbury was over descriptive in general (I read Stephen King, so I'm no stranger to descriptions), but it was the fact that he describes one thing with about a dozen different adjectives, which almost tempted me to skim through, even though it was such a short novel. Perhaps it's just that I wanted to get back to the exciting parts. I'd really love to say \\"screw it\\" and give this book 5 stars, but I pride myself on giving my honest opinions. Just these minor issues kept it from being 5 stars.As for the other 90% of the story, no doubt about it, it's very good. Not many books could be enjoyed equally by a teenager and a middle-aged reader, but I feel like this could. There's enough carnival-type fun and fantastic images for the young adult (as well as an older) reader to enjoy, while maintaining enough serious writing for an adult. It's quite a nice balance and Bradbury deserves alot of credit here.I'd also like to say that I was pleased with how much horror/supernatural there is. I knew before going into this that it was considered a dark fantasy, but I didn't expect much genuine horror, but there was more than enough to be found. As for the fantasy parts, well, they were pretty great as well. Add in some supernatural and the coming-off-age feel to it, and you have a recipe for success.Overall, alot of good imagination, mixed with some real life issues and struggles, Something Wicked This Way Comes is a unique book. A whole lot of story goes on in less than 300 pages, and this is one of them books that makes you realize how gratifying reading a good book can be."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"How can you go wrong with a Ray Bradbury story....I sent this to my 17 year old grandson as an introduction to other fiction."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"2nd Witch:By the pricking of my thumbs,Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking]Open locks,Whoever knocks![Enter Macbeth]Macbeth:How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!What is't you do?The above quote from Shakespeare's Macbeth is whence this book takes its title, but it's the character Macbeth's quote immediately following the titular quote that seems to me more &agrave; propos to an attempt at reviewing the book; for Bradbury, despite the book's ending, is a full adept at exploring the secret, black and midnight thoughts of us all. The book's fault - in my eyes - is that it presents, in the end, a Manichean, Star Wars view of the world which just doesn't wash with me. Thankfully, throughout most of the book, Bradbury is more concerned with the dark carnival that comes into town upon a midnight wind one October and the dreamlike horrors it works upon the townspeople. This is where the magic in the prose lies. It rather reminds me of Blake's remark about Milton, that he was a true poet and on the devil's side without knowing it.Be all this as it may, it's very difficult to tell the prospective reader what this book is about, because of its wild poetic exploration of the dark corners of the human soul. But I think it's best seen as a sort of warning: Beware of your dreams and imaginings - regardless of your age or situation - for therein unfathomable darkness lies beneath the gilt surface. This is best set forth by the doomed schoolmarm, Miss Foley, bewitched by the memories of her lost youth:\\"Best skate the thin ice, lightly. Paused, the weight of your attention might crack the shell. Plunged through the crust, you might drown in depths so cold, so remote, that all the Past lay carved in tombstone marbles there. Ice water would syringe your veins. Transfixed at the mirror sill, you would stand forever, unable to lift your gaze from the proofs of Time.\\"And the doomed lightning-rod salesman, bewitched by the ideal of the perfect woman:\\"Once, as a boy, sneaking the cool grottos (sic) behind a motion picture theater screen, on his way to a free seat, he had glanced up and there towering and flooding the haunted dark seen a woman's face as he had never seen it since, of such size and beauty built of milk-bone and moon flesh as to freeze him there alone behind the stage, shadowed by the motion of her lips, the bird-wing flicker of her eyes, the snow-pale-death-shimmering illumination from her cheeks.\\"In an odd way, Bradbury seems to be telling us to beware his own writing. But the obverse side of this coin, embodied in the person another reviewer has dubbed - quite rightly, I think - the \\"hero\\" of the novel, Mr. Halloway, expounding upon the notion of the \\"soul's energy\\" that these outlandish carnies seem to crave, maintains:\\"How do I know this? I observe. The carnival is like people, only more so. A man, a woman, rather than walk away from, or kill, each other, ride each other a lifetime, pulling hair, extracting fingernails, the pain of each to the other like a narcotic that makes existence worth the day.\\"In other words, there's scarce relief to be found in any domestic bliss. The way out, the \\"good\\" way, seems to be laughter at the absurdity of it all. But, for this reader anyway, this - quite literally, towards the end - forced laughter is the scariest, most inhuman phenomenon of the lot!In the end, I'd rather have a wicked but all too human Macbeth than laughter at the meaninglessness of memory, imagination and human suffering.Perhaps, so would Bradbury's ghost."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Awesome novel; Bradbury is exceptional and the novel is extraordinary.

I hate to say it, but I don't think there are many imaginations like his anymore....imagination is, I fear, a casualty of the push into cyber space....I also love that many of his short stories refer to other classic writers, like Edgar Allan Poe...and remind (me) to read them again."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Yep, me again...made a Halloween book bundle gift and this was one of books I purchased.

Do yourself a favor and get this book NOW!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"When I put down this book yesterday, two-thirds of the way through, I was pretty sure it was the best book I had ever read on the subject of death. If not death, then the peculiar phantasm of death paraded by the ghoulish, the morbid, the interminably gasping, and the paranoid. There could be no more perfect metaphor for the fascination and terror death holds for us, than the carnival. Swooping in, strange, exhilarating, mysterious, dangerous, and familiar; overwhelming and sometimes nauseating.Bradbury's style for this novel makes heavy use of metaphor and simile, sentence fragments, and slang, which are often incongruous and insensible; at first this is annoying, largely because it seems like an affectation, but there are moments in his stream of images and phrases where all the disparate elements flow together and what's left, whether it makes sense or not, is really beautiful.The same can be said for the spates of philosophizing, shuffled in and out of the story as we explore the allure of the carnival, and the weaknesses of it's victims. After having researched urban legends, ghost stories, and various real acts of evil for the last few months, I tend to agree with his assertions (filtered through the character of Charles Halloway) about fear and death in particular. And having been a William (unnervingly good), and a Jim (fascinated with, inured by the macabre), and a Charles (trying to rationalize a world where both exist), I also tend to sympathise with Bradbury's views on humanity. Yes he does go on, (or as Jim Nightshade says \\"You talk a lot.\\") but he has something to say, even if it is wedged into a stream-of-consciousness style that is not wholly decipherable, or one-hundred percent the truth. What doesn't work, for me, and wholly forgivable for a book from the '60s, is the dated male perspective which shadows Charles' discussions of love and compassion, which makes it seem like women exist only to be a man's emotional consciousness; forgivable, but still somewhat disruptive to an otherwise interesting discursion.Now, the last third of the book. Perfectly suspenseful, somewhat satisfying, until the very end, which seemed mealy and saccharine compared to the subtly textured, fair-food substantialness of the rest of the book. Like having Spielberg direct the last ten minutes of a David Lynch film.In summary, a good book, but not for horror fans, certainly not for people who insist on direct communication, who are flummoxed by effuse evocation. Definitely for someone who can appreciate the simplicity of small town life, and the difference between the percieved and real dangers of the unknown."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I first read this when I was 13.

So powerful was the spell some of these delicious tomes cast that I can still remember how I felt when I read them. I can picture where they rested on the book shelves. Even their covers have been burned into my mind's eye.And that's saying a lot. Because I'm 41 years old. And some of these books were devoured some 30+ years ago.And in all that time I have never found a book to equal Something Wicked This Way Comes.I read this book yearly, sometimes twice a year. Always in October (my favorite month) and sometimes whenever I need an infusion of wide-eyed wonder.I can't explain what this book does to me. All I can tell you is that each page crackles with electricity. And magic. And all the joys, smells, sounds and feelings of being a boy in a small midwestern town.I doubt anything I say is going to convince you to read this book. After all, it's only my opinion. And you don't even know me.Yet, I can honestly make this prediction. If you have an imagination, a yearning for the days of your youth, a love of night-time thrills and an appreciation for how a master craftsman plies his trade, this book stands a chance of holding a very special place in your heart.Oh.

I have got some MAJOR gripes with this book. First off, being that there is absolutely nothing believable about Jim or Will. Not a single instance of these characters seeming real. Secondly, the way that Bradbury structures sentences in this book has to be some of the worst grammar I have ever seen in a publication, major or independent. The thing that really gets me about it is that this is pretty much an internationally love piece of fiction and I just can't see the justification of it. Even the actual story itself, which is wonderful in idea, is completely underwhelming because of the way Bradbury writes this novel. I still want to read Farenheit 451, I certainly hope it's much better written than this book is.

All of a sudden, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade find themselves caught between a fight of good vs. evil.I thought 'Something Wicked this Way Comes' was an excellent science fiction/ fantasy book and this book is definitely a book for people who enjoy scary stories.Charecters that the book mostly revolves around are Will Halloway, Jim Nightshade, Charles Halloway, Mr. Dark, Mr. Cooger, and other freaks of the carnival. The book Mostly takes place in the month of October at a carnival and soon mysterious things start to happen to the boys when they arrive at the carnival. The force of evil is so great that they can't control the situation by themselves. They must get help from Will's father to help defeat the evil.To me this was a great book and they best part of the book was when Charles Halloway carves a smile onto a fake, dissolvable bullet and kills the Dust Witch with the smile and goodness. The reason that the Dust Witch died is because of the happiness that was on the bullet. This was the most exciting part of the book to me because when Bradbury describes the scene, the image is so vivid in your mind. Also, he has the power to stop time and seem as if the world stopped for a second when Halloway shot the bullet.If you are interested by this book, there are many other books that have been written by this author. These book consist of 'The Halloween Tree' and 'The Illustrated Man'. I really enjoyed this book because it is very exciting and i really recommend this book to everyone. For me this was a book in which i can't stop turning the pages until the book endds. I hope you are encouraged to read 'Something Wicked this Way Comes' becasue of this review and i hope taht you enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Bradbury uses fantasy to drive home moral truths, and no where else is that more apparent than in this classic short novel.The Cooger and Dark Pandemonium show invades a small town in fall, but only two young boys, Jim and Will, understand its true intent, to prey on local citizens by giving them their hearts' desires and then stealing their souls. But the boys, especially Jim, are as susceptible to the sinister charms of the carnival as anyone else.This is a word-drunk book, crammed with imagery, as dizzyng and delightful as a Ferris Wheel. But it's a cautionary tale too. Bradbury seems to be telling readers that man must accept the nature of things, for if he fools with nature he risks losing his own soul forever.I have taught this book to college students on two different occasions. They love it for its fantasy and horror and sense of wonder. But this is a book for all ages.(For an excellent analysis of the book, see Stephen King's DANSE MACABRE or Russell Kirk's ENEMIES OF THE PERMANENT THINGS.)"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This book was what hooked me on Bradbury and made him my favorite author for longer than I can count. It was through this book that I came to appreciate his unique, often imitated but never reproduced, style, and made me move to the October Country, where I lived for some time. Bradbury is the master and creator of the Dark Carnival, and the concept was never better than in this book. But, like so many of Bradbury's works, this book has a deeper meaning. It is about a boy's yearning to grow up and an old man's yearning to be young again.

At it's heart it is simply magical, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates poetry, beauty, and the power of a well told story."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"it's obvious by looking at the other reviews that either you really understand this book or you completely don't. this is one of the best books i have ever read, but to understand it you must be able to look past the words and into what they actually mean."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is the finest book ever written!

Something Wicked is without question the finest piece of contemporary american literature to ever be written.Starting as a child's tale or fable, the book expands into a mult-layered, multi-complex novel involving death, life and all parts in between. The dynamic tension of freindship, lost loves and pubertyare all dealt with in this amazing piece of work. The premise, a &quot;dark&quot; carnival ariving in a small mid-western town in October is common Bradbury territiry. And there is no doubt of the autobigraphicalnature of this work. As the story weaves itself through the town's population, the two boys at the center of the story, are the only ones that sense the approaching darkness that the carnival brings.In classic Bradbury prose, the reader is trasported with eloquent descriptions into the story itself. One of the two climaxes of the story, a confrontation between one of the boy's fathers (an aging manwith buckets of regrets and no real hope for the future) and Mr. Dark, the owner of the Carnival is rollercoaster ride of words. In a time where action has displaced writing in novels, this scene is adelight to anyone who enjoys good literature.The film adaptation was atrocious, and looked (as Dinsey films do) only at a single element in a multi-faceted story. This film should not be used to judge this book. So don't be put off because of the film.If you read ANY book this year, make it this one."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Any fan of Halloween will fall in love with RayBradbury's dark novel about two boys and an evilcarnival that comes to town...

Will they finaly be able to ridthe world of it?A captivating story, combined with Bradbury's dark, rich,seductive tone of story-telling make this book almostimpossible to put down."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Gothic thriller with horrific overtones, this novel is not for the faint of heart. But it is brilliantly written, with some of the most deliciously macabre imagery ever put in a novel about children.The only thing that detracts from its brilliance is the weakness of the good ultimately used to prevail against the powerful minions of evil. Bradbury's worldview doesn't allow for anything more powerfully good than humor in the face of horror. Unfortunate. It would have been nice to see the boys use virtue or faith or hope to triumph.But, by all means, read this book! You will be thrilled, horrified and firm in your resolution to never be in a library after closing time!!!!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of the masters of modern literature. However, I have only encountered his excellent prose twice: in the superb science fiction thriller FAHRENHEIT 451 (a must read) and here in the pages of SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES. After these entertaining reads, I need to familiarize myself with more of his work.As for the book, Something Wicked is a story that every child (especially young boys) can relate to. It's the story of friendship and indeed best friends, the story of an evil carnival that gives people what they desire...but at what price, and the bond between fathers and sons. Truly the monsters in this book practically leap off of the page - the dust witch really creeped me out. The tattooed Mr. Dark is an evil classic and the confrontation between him and the main characters in the depths of the library is a page-burner (and made me remember the creepy feeling I used to get in librarys).If you are not familiar with this story...READ IT NOW! And, where this story cries out to the joys of youth and childhood, I feel I should also recommend BOY'S LIFE by Robert R. McCammon which in many ways is a reflection on this story...the two would definately make excellent book ends."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"There's something about the way Bradbury writes, as if you are reading synapses and neurons. He puts you right in his head and it is a wonderful place. With this book I became a fan of Bradbury's work. Apparently originally meant to be a short story entitled Dark Carnival Bradbury turned this into one of the scariest novels ever written. I'm not kidding folks. Under the guise of a children's tale is a story of a circus of bad intentions, a seller of lightning rods, an evil merry-go-round, and the terror of being a teenager. Highly original and entertaining. If you are a fan of horror fiction or just plain old good story telling pick this book up and enjoy."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury's stories always manage to pierce through into a deep sense of longing. They leave you unsatisfied (because they do come to an end) yet, at the same time, filled with pleasure at the rightness of just how he does it (Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, for example).Something Wicked This Way Comes is no different. The struggle between evil for the possession of the boys' souls and the love, bravery, and sacrifice elicited from Will and his dad just knocks you out. The increasing pace, the looming threat, and the ever more clearly defined personal consequences of squarely facing it, all rachet up the tension in perfect phase--you'll know it when you get to that special chapter. Once I began this book, I did not stop until I finished it. Do not pollute your mental imagery with the movie version. Trust your own imagination. Read the book! Greg Jefford"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury about a year ago, and was amazed by it. I loved how painfully true the story was becoming...I also was enchanted by the beautiful writing. So obviously, I had to check out more works by this wonderful author. I purchased Dandelion Wine, and Something Wicked This Way Comes.This book far exceeded my expectations. Though a few parts of the book are drawn out and uninteresting, the majority of it is fantastically written, with lots of beautiful imagery. The ending was very unexpected, but cute and thoughtful.Is it as good as Fahrenheit 451? I wouldn't compare the two, but I enjoyed this book slightly more, though Fahrenheit 451's message is more true. Five big fat shiny stars for Something Wicked This Way Comes."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Jim Nightshade and William Halloway are thirteen year old boys. They are still boys when Mr. Darks carnival, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, comes to town. By the time the carnival leaves many of the townspeople have sold their soul in exchange of their deepest desires. Many of the village people, including Will's own father will be tempted by the offer to be young again, while Jim will find the offer of growing up fast irresistible. William can see what's going on and saves his father and then the two of them fight to save Jim and the town.This book was thrilling, scary, and, wise in many ways. The author makes the reader understand that evil is such a powerful force not because it is so awful, but because it is so tempting. The people of the town aren't really bad people, but in their willingness to exchange their very souls for an easy chance to be something that they are not, and head down the path of evil. What Mr. Dark is offering is a temptation in every sense of the word. Will has to struggle against him in a truly heroic way."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The most important thing to know about this cd set is that it is NOT an unabridged sound recording of the book. It is a performance like a play. Amazon's description is not clear."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway are two best friends teetering on the edge of adolescence. They run wild like the archetypal boy has always run, free of worry and filled with a sense of anticipation and adventure. On a night indistinguishable from other nights both walk the streets of Green Town, Illinois, the kind of place where boys are allowed to roam with the world as their chaperone, the earth their toy box. There they meet the lightning-rod salesmen who deliciously warns the two of a coming storm with the prospect of lightening. What better enticement for the two than the excitement, the danger, the possibility that one of their houses--and only one--will be struck, changed by his predictions?Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is an evocative tale of friendship, innocence, and the horrors of death. As the two boys journey their way through a wicked carnival, they discover the temptations of life, the secret desires of people around the world that we do not leave behind with childhood, and the ever continuing battle of good against evil. There's no one who writes quite like Bradbury. It's a rare gift to possess the voice of childhood with all of its fears, joys, and sorrows, but it's an even greater gift to evoke a nostalgia for a childhood I never had. But Bradbury pulls from the reader's emotions something universal in all of us: desires of curiosity and friendship, fears of loss.The boys grapple with their friendship and the ultimate (and literal in this sense) threat of doom: growing apart. But in searching individually, the two find the strength neither has without the other. Bonds are solidified friend to friend and father to son in this touching and horrific tale of life and the things that make our existence worth every minute: family, friendship, and laughter."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is a book where Dean Koontz 'Funhouse' creation lack - visionary imagination. Bradbury has this unique ability to capture the mind of readers and pull them in a world of dreams that become horribly wrong in a world of doubt. Have you ever seen what an apple can do to you? Have you ever cross a railroad crossing, yet you stop and wonder? I re-read this book again because it is just soo good, yet so evil. A thick plot layered in so many ways that only the wicked be damned. Nightshade and Halloway wants to find out...will you join them?A highly recommended masterpiece of a read.....just forget the movie."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Best friends Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade were born 2 minutes apart, Will one minute before midnight on Oct 30 and Jim one minute after midnight on Oct 31, and their different personalities reflect that well. And each is tested in different ways when Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to Green Town, IL shortly before their 14th birthday. Characters from the carnival compliment the overall creepy atmostphere, from the Dust Witch to the Illustrated Man, Mr. Dark himself.Bradbury's unique writing style perfectly sets the tone for this spooky tale of boyhood and wishes. While reading it, I was reminded of other characters from newer books, especially Mr. Leland Gaunt, the proprietor of Needful Things, from Stephen King's book. And while some passages near the end of the book are a bit long-winded, it didn't detract much from a great spooky story, and one with a lot of insight into what it's like to be 13."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"\\"Something wicked, this way comes\\". You have to respect an author that is willing to take the title of his book from the master Shakespeare. Furthermore, Bradbury manages to incorporate myriad ideas for young and old into one true feast for the senses. No matter how many times I read this, I am always struck by the poetic manner in which the story is told.This is the story of Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, and how they outwit the evil carnival and its twisted custodians. Seems like a great idea for a kid's book, yeah? And it is. However, add in thorough discussions on the nature of growing old and the character of good versus evil and what it means to be one or the other, and you have a dissertation worthy of any graduate student. All this is told in Bradbury's characteristic bouncy, playful syntax and is always a consummate pleasure to read.This is required reading for the imaginative child or the adult looking to reconnect with their youth and the wonder therein."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"If there was a rating for zero stars, this book deserves it. I've never read anything so awful. If I didn't have to read it for school, I wouldn't have gotten past the 1st chapter. Hard to understand, slow moving, and plain old boring are just a beginning of all the things I hated about this book. As for everyone else in my class, they all hate it too. I'm about to form a petition against it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Except for the first 5 or 10 pages, the book is a terrible read. Bradbury starts well but turns increasingly pretentious and obscure. From the third chapter on, there is at least two metaphors per paragraph, and quite a few of them are undecipherable."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This novel is a coming-of-age tale of two thirteen-year-old boys, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade. A carnival arrives at their small town during October, the wrong time of the year for a carnival. Soon, it is apparent that this is no ordinary carnival. There is a maze of mirrors that drowns people with their fears about themselves, a tempting carousel that can both increase and decrease age, and a multitude of freaks that have fallen victim to these fears and temptations. The leader of the carnival is Mr. Dark, the Illustrated Man. Charles Halloway, Will Halloway's father, becomes the hero of the tale because he finds away to defeat the freaks: smiling and laughter. The freaks feed off of negative energy, so a laugh can render them useless and even dead.The novel started out rather slowly. The beginning discourse was intriguing, but it just didn't hold my interest through a large section. The freaks and the supernatural events were hard to believe at first. They seemed to be too easily accepted in the fabric of the story when they were first introduced. The author spends a lot of time letting Charles Halloway talk. There were times when I just wanted him to shut up and do whatever it was he needed to do.Despite the fact that Charles Halloway talked too much, he made a lot of interesting observations. There are beautiful passages in the book. I copied some out to remember them. I liked it that the main temptation, the carousel, played on the fear of death, the most common fear in anyone.I have mixed feelings on whether I like this book or not. I give it a 2 1/2 out of 5."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I read Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury. I give this book a 3 star rating. The author takes a long time to get to the point, so it's a little boring. If you don't understand metaphors then you probably wouldn't want to read this book.Something Wicked This Way Comes is mainly about two thirteen-year-old boys, who are best friends, experiencing the wrath of evil. It all starts with a flyer that says \\"Crooger and Dark's Pandemonium Side Show\\". Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade, the best friends, find this flyer. At three o'clock in the morning, they see the carnival roll in. Once they visit the carnival they quickly find out that there is something not right. The main attraction is the \\"Freak\\" show and the Mirror Maze will suck you in and you will never come out. Will and Jim visited the carnival one night and the \\"Freaks\\" caught them. The boys' got away but the \\"Freaks\\" hunted them down. Once the boys' and Charles Halloway were caught all it took was a little love for the \\"Freaks\\" and the carnival to go away.Will Halloway is one of the main characters in the book. He thinks about danger much more than Jim. Will was afraid to go to the Mirror Maze because he saw evil in it. Although, as the story unfolds, he becomes more confident. He shows this by cutting the witches balloon. Jim Nightshade is a main character also. He is the exact opposite of Will. Jim is a daredevil and carefree. He wanted to experience the wrath of the carnival and fight the evil. Jim shows that he is afraid of nothing by wondering the streets at night and going to the carnival a couple times alone before Will went with him.If you think or know that you enjoyed Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury then you would enjoy A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle, All Summer in a Day by Ray Bradbury, and The Veldt by Ray Bradbury. I am a seventh grade student in North Carolina."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature, and one of the best genre books ever. I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:\\"Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his feet on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds.\\"Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it. These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I thought this would have made a great short story. If all the action had been packed in to 1/4 the number of pages, it would have made for a very exciting read. But I got bogged down with all the philosophy and the description. Something exciting would happen, then there would be five pages of philosophy, and then something else exciting would happen. Sometimes the philosophical rambles would occur in the middle of conversations between characters.I would have enjoyed this book more if I had been in the right mood for it. I picked it up because I enjoyed the movie, and my experience with Ray Bradbury (mainly short stories) is that his work is exciting and entertaining. I was just looking for a fluff story, I wasn't prepared to work for it.The plot line was great. It revolves around two boys and a carnival that comes to town. This was a different sort of carnival, though, because it was run by evil people who fed off people's fears and unattained desires. The two boys manage to fight the carnival and loosen its grip on their town.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy or good triumphing over evil. But take care to realize that it's not a quick and exciting read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury is an exceptional writer....and this story is like a well-written Goosebumps book. It is NOT scary for an adult brought up on Stephen King horror. However, I was fooled by reviews claiming this book &quot;has been known to give some people nightmares&quot;.... well, those &quot;some people&quot; are twelve year olds. I recommend this book for pre-teens. For adults, I recommend Stephen King's Needful Things, which is vaguely similar."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Were the option available, I would have given the book 2.5 stars, but since it wasn't, I opted for 2 stars; I will not give this book half a star more than it deserves, and I don't feel too unfair giving it half a star less. Basically, this book strengthens my belief that just because a novel was published over a decade ago and it contains original concepts, it does not automatically receive the title of \\"classic.\\" Unfortunately, that is how I came to read this book; it was recommended to me as a classic.First of all, I cannot vouch that the idea of a \\"dark carnival\\" is entirely original, but for the sake of the review, I'll assume that Bradbury was the one to conjure it up. That aside, there are only a few aspects of this book in its favor, and a great many aspects that hurt its value.After reading the first ten or so pages of the book, I thought it would indeed be an interesting read; the contrasing personalities of best friends Will and Jim, the reclusive Mr. Halloway, and the lightning-rod salesman's encounter with the first two gave a solid opening to the book.But the next 225 pages of the book were nearly torturous. First of all, it's hard to follow protagonists with cardboard cut-out personalities, who encounter more lifeless shells. The only exception to the uninteresting characters was Mr. Halloway; even the \\"evil\\" characters are boring once you get past their basic premise (the fact they thrive off of the suffering of others, a concept that is never really explained). Second, Ray Bradbury's writing style was unique in the beginning of the book, but quickly became obnoxious. I'm talking about the sentence fragments, run-ons where every other word is \\"and,\\" and the ridiculous metaphors and similes sprinkled over everything. At some points, the philosophical description fit in, but most of the time, it just hindered the reader from going through the book smoothly. Even when I went back and reread some of these descriptions, it seemed as though Mr. Bradbury only used them to distinguish himself. He succeeded, and for that I congratulate him; this was the first book I've gone through where I had to reread sentences to the point where it became nauseating.Finally, there is the senselessness of some of the book's plot. A good example is Will's encounter with the Dust Witch, where he somehow knows how she is able to locate him. Nope, no explanation as to why he knows, no precedent he's basing the guess off of, he just knows. And how about Mr. Halloway discovering the carnival's secrets from research at the library? I guess a lot of books were written on the evil ulterior motives of circuses. Please.But to be fair, the book's last 50 or so pages were decent. But I just couldn't say this was a good book because of a DECENT ending; the fact of the matter is, the majority of the book was sub-par, and a merely satisfying ending didn't compensate for that."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally, for effect it seems, but to no discernible advantage. However, there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot - no doubt grist for a successful movie - where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers. In toto, an very unenjoyably read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"A good old creepy carny type story.The wicked in the title refers to the travelling sideshow/fun fair/show or whatever you want to call it attraction that rolls into a nowheresville USA town.

I think most peers like to read fiction books and this is a fiction book, so most people would like them. This book is one of a kind, I say that because most of the times you do not read this types of novels. This book takes place in a small town with a big storm on the way and no one in town cares except two kids. This book is also about two friends, Jim and Will that have been friends since babies and do most things at the same time. These two boys find out a mystery that most people in town do not know about because it does not happen that often. This novel is interesting because thing happen that are not expected. For example, an old man in a black suit told Jim and Will that Jims house was going to be hit by a lightning, so he gave them a lightning rod to help them. Then the old man in the black suit disappeared and Will went running to the house to help but Jim stayed behind like if he did not care that his mother was not in the house. Another example is when they went to the carnival when they are parents told them not to go because something weird is going on that only. Wills dad knows but will not tell his kids. In the carnival, they found out that the marry-go-round did work but went backwards. Then they saw the people who worked in the carnival were changing figure, which was weird.Well if you choose to know more about the novel, you should read it and if you do, I hope you like it as much as I did.Sincerely,Esmeralda Castillo"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books.

In reality, I found the book was not increadibly scary, only falling a few notches ahead of the series &quot;Goosebumps&quot; in terms of horror. Bradburys writing stye is quite different, and at a few points, almost hard to follow. &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; is a book made mainly of details, yet still depics many vague scenes. The paace of the book is very slow as you start out, and only real puts you on the edge of your seat in the last few chapters. I have fallen asleep while reading this book. The book in depth is shallow, yet the overal plot is an interesting one, and Bradury is an author every young reader should experience."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury is a master storyteller, there's no denying it. And his style is clearly on display here: a flair and passion for nostalgia he effortlessly imbues throughout this allegory: a morality tale which on the surface seems simple enough but has several complex themes running through it (if one cares to take notice and truly analyze it). The premise is familiar: a dark and sinister carnival, centuries old, led by a Mephistopheles-like character, Mr. Dark/The Illustrated Man, arrives one chilling October morning to tempt the fair people of Green Town, by granting them their deepest and most secret desires. However, as such similar allegories and parables play out, we discover the Luciferian-like temptations are nothing more than a Pandora's Box waiting to happen, and the most unimaginable horrors to be unleashed on the unsuspecting victims. But there are those among us with purity of heart who have the vision to see through such treachery and pose the biggest threat to evil. And therein, Bradbury harkens us back to such a time of innocence, a time of ageless wonder, an almost dream-like time, a time when our very thoughts and passions were at its infancy, and the dark and fearsome world, which lurked in the shadows and deep recesses of our unsophisticated and underdeveloped minds, were still years away at a safe and measurable distance, a time when we were all children... lamentably, a time when everything was a beautiful lie. As in most magical and sensory-leaden fairy tales, the ending is predictable and almost anti-climatic: Yes, good does defeat evil, as it always seems to in idyllic literature, but Bradbury's delivery is rather hokey as Bradbury is prone to get caught up in over-sentimentality, happily exploring the make-up of his past. In hindsight, I had hoped Bradbury would explore the depths of the dark underbelly of evil which lie within all of our souls and our pathetic attempts of the denial of its existence, instead of just skimming its surface."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is a great read.

There is no writer alive that can write with the same depth and compassion as Ray Bradbury..Anna Avitia"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of my two favorite American writers (Mark Twain is the other), and Something Wicked This Way Comes is a perfect example of why. He uses truly timeless themes (fear of evil, growing pains, freudian struggle between father and son, greed) and joins them with excellently layered and creative metaphorical prose. I literally get chills down my spine reading this work, both in terms of the alternating tension and relief in this dramatic tale of horror, and also because of Bradbury's wonderfully refreshing and unique ability to please and surprise with his descriptions of events. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"this wuz a very kewl book. we had to read it for an english class and previous classes that had read it warned &quot;us&quot; about it. once i started to read it i wuz drawn into the almost lyrical descriptions and the pure evil of the situation. it makes you look at yourself in a deeper way and value life more. i definately recommend it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"When I began reading Something Wicked This Way Comes, it seemed uninteresting and childish, but as I continued on, I found myself unable to put it down.

I highly recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"hehehe...I was reading this book one day and I really enjoyed it by the time I was done with it. I was reading it for school and it introduced me into the world of Ray Bradbury. I would recommend this book to anyone looking into a quick but fun read. This book took me about 4 hours MAX. Its better than the Martian Chronicles but not as good as the illustrated man"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Forget all the contemporary pretenders who write novels about the dark side. This is the only book that ever made me look over my shoulder; and in broad daylight. Bradbury demonstrates once again his mastery of words and images."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I'll admit. When I picked up the book, allowing myself 2 graze the pages, I thought it was 4 kids. A circus?? The freak shows coming 2 life??? But, having just discovered the joys of Bradbury, I decided 2 read it anyway.Something Wicked This Way Comes is definitely somewhat childish. Yet if it wasn't, it would be horrible. It is being able 2 see through the children's eyes that makes it all enjoyable. It is the perspective from which the tale is told that gives U slight scares... and it is the detail of the story that makes U want 2 bundle up and lock the doors... although, like many Ray Bradbury novels, there are a lot of extras thrown in, on the whole, this book cannot be beat"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The Book Something Wicked this Way Comes, by Ray Bradbury, is a great novel that shows a person quite a lot of life lessons that will guide him through life. In thisbook; there is a different kind of witting style compared to other writers. The genre of this book is scary but if you understand the situations, each character is going thru its notfrightening, is more of a mystery you want to solve. I would encourage you as a reader to go pick up this book and read it.William Halloway and James Nightshade are thirteen-year-old boys living in a green town, Illinois. They are going to turn fourteen in a week. However, a tragedy happened that changed this two boy's life. A storm was warned to themthat was coming to there village. The two boys go to wills father which is in the library to get some books. Wills father feels to old and he's is only fifty-four and he wants to be young like his boy and be able to run and have fun. Charles and William find out about a carnival coming to there town the next day.Wills father see's a sign in a store right around the corner of the library it read\\"Cooger & Darks Pandemonium shadow show\\" and Jim and will mysteriously found one like that also. They two boys paid no attention because they were too excited about the carnival not for long though. Charles had this weird feeling in his tummy about going to this carnival or not Mr.Halloway is concerned that this carnival came too late at a time were the man isreally close to death.The book has some parts were you just do not want to stop reading or leave yourself hanging. Bradbury had a type of writing that you just do not find in anyparticular book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is a great read with so many metaphors, themes and symbolism that it will take several readings to really grasp them all.The story is about two boys Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway that are friends. They were born, on Halloween night, one minute before(Will) and one minute after(Jim). Will..is the kind of boy that is caring and thinks problems through. Jim..is impulsive and acts before thinking. They seem in many ways to be completely opposite of each other. Will's Father feels old and that he isn't a very good capable father. He starts questioning his own abilities and about his existence.One Autumn day a Carnival comes to town...Jim and Will sense its' coming on the wind. The Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show arrives with its' siren song of youth, beauty and dreams regained. This siren song is played for each one of the people in Green Town, Illinois. The boys soon learn that the carnival destroys every life it touches. Soon they are on the run left up to Mr. Halloway to come to the rescue.I don't want to give away too much of the book but the idea of temptation's siren song played to everyone presents an interesting theme. Even when the carnival is gone...is it really gone...or is it just gone from Jim, Will and Mr. Halloway? Have they learned how to deal with its' song? Will it return again in another Autumn? Is it in reality always with us? There are always fears, regrets, desires and dreads in life and the way we deal with these and the conseqences that follow are indeed very frightening to think about.This is the kind of book that deserve to be read and seriously thought about."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I first read this book ten years ago when I was 13. At the time, I didn't understand the metaphors and symbolism that Bradbury's books are known for. I enjoyed it at the time, but it still wasn't one of my favorites. But now as I reread the book, I realize how great of a book this is. As I mentioned, like other of his books like Fahrenheit 451, this book uses a lot of metaphors.Anyways, I've been re-reading many of his books recently, and this is one of my favorites. I couldn't put it down and I read it less than a day. It's not really extremely scary, but the atmosphere and dialogue is masterful and tends to make the book have a mysterious and somewhat creepy feeling. It doesn't resort to violence and death to create this atmosphere as too many of today's \\"horror\\" novels do.It is essentially the tale of two boys, Jim and Will, who discover that the carnival that has come to town is evil. It is run by Mr. Dark, and a bunch of freaks that are pretty much actually souls that he captured. The two boys and Will's father much get rid of the carnival before it \\"destroys\\" more people.Overall, this book is excellent. While it isn't extremely scary, it is still a great piece of literature with a creepy atmosphere. It is as much a book about growing up as it is about terror and horror. I would recommend it to almost anyone who will understand the Bradbury metaphors. Another Bradbury classic."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I had heard a lot about this book, but just recently decided to read it. I was glad I did. The book is NOT science fiction (as the cover states) but is a wonderful and dark fantasy.Steven King, in Danse Macbre, notes that this book is a universal childhood fantasy book. I would qualify this just a bit, it is a &quot;boys&quot; childhood fantasy, and may be universal for boys. This distance from my personal experience(I'm a woman) didn't harm the book in the least. The themes are universal, so, while it may not strike and &quot;I know that!&quot; chord, it sure does ring true.Not the scariest, or spookiest, but full of wonderful images and tense moments."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Two young boys, William and Jim, are faced with quite the carnival. Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show has come to Green Town, Illinois where Will and Jim reside. Little do they know, this is more than your average carnival...This book haunts you, it's crazy, but you enjoy almost every minute of it. Ray Bradbury is quite the story teller, every one of his books explore a different world.. very unlike ours..."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes is an interesting and highly entertaining melding of fantasy and horror. The book is not exactly fast-paced, but it is a smooth and pretty quick read, and quite suspenseful (a trio Bradbury usually manages to evoke.) Bradbury has a very unique style. He has been called a &quot;prose poet&quot; and that is a highly accurate description. Though he is writing literary fiction here, it is almost as if you're reading poetry at times. He uses metaphor often and it is quite effective. The only problem with this is that the dialoge at times, though beautiful, can see a bit unrealistic. Alas. The book is a great read. The fascinating portrayal of evil and self-responsibility is all the more effective due to the two protoganists being teenagers. The relationship between one of the boys (Will) and his Father is very touching as well. Just a well-written book. Recommended."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"OKay, so you may have read this book and you want to buy it. Why the Limited? Well, Ray Bradbury signed it for one, Peter Crowther signed it. There are 7 pages of photocopied manuscript notes with handwritten changes so you can see the thought process of the author. See the artwork both by Bradbury and Joe Mugnaini. Oh and if it wasn't mentionned before it's one heck of a story! Go for the limited!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"If you like carnivals and magic, Something Wicked is perfect for you. I was assigned to read this for school. It became so captivating that i couldn't put the book down. i would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful, captivating book"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury, is a very exciting book that uses a lot of symbolism. It is about evil that comes to a little town in Illinois. It may be difficult to read for some people, but once you understand the symbols and the plot, the book is excellent. In this book, evil comes in many different ways shapes and forms. If you are not satisfied with your life, evil will temp you with your most deepest desires, but if you are not strong willed, you will be taken over by evil and lose something very important to you. I would encourage anyone to read this book if you are looking for a good book to read. Evil comes in town in the form of a carnival and everyone associated to the carnival is evil. All the &quot;freaks&quot; in the carnival are people that weren't satisfied with their lives and gave in to the evil temptation. The prince of evil, whose name is Mr. Dark, controls all the freaks and everyone else in the carnival. The main characters in the book are Jim Nightshade, Will Halloway, and Charles Halloway. These characters are the main people that evil is after throughout the book. Charles Halloway is Will's father and Jim Nightshade is Will's best friend. On a scale of one to ten, I would rate this book as an eight. I would strongly encourage anyone who likes to read to pick up this book sometime."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"First of all, Something Wicked is not for those seeking a cheap thrill, a sudden &quot;Boo!&quot; that sends you three feet in the air one minute and makes you wonder why it ever scared you the next. No, this deeply poetic tale is not for literary &quot;junkies.&quot; If you actually take the time to digest this marvel, you'll end up distinctly disquieted; truly, you'll see things in a depth you never did before, from the longings and regrets we all face, to the simple joys anyone can find right at the end of their nose. Oh, who am I kidding? There's no way to sum up this book. I have read it at least five times, and I still find myself unlocking undiscovered secrets I passed over the time before. As I age, my views about life are constantly changing. But always, this book hits me at the core. This tale will follow you for the rest of your life; I would advise all sincere Bradbury fans to keep a copy in the glove compartment. The man has been blessed with a gift of language that will not be surpassed in the forseeable future."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"My personal favorite of Ray Bradbury, and the first of his I ever read. This book is one of his most classic and timeless contributions to science fiction. I must buy for anyone."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This was my second Ray Bradbury book. The first was Dandelion Wine, which I liked better. Dandelion Wine had better stories and better descriptions. That being said, this was a very entertaining book and the story line will certainly make you turn the page without effort."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"What stood out the most about Bradbury's most famous work \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was the supercharged, heady wording. Full of allegories and not-quite-normal descriptions, the book was an interesting read even without the dystopian setting and robot spider dogs. In this book, the colorful language and oddball wording once again takes the front stage. Although it occasionally comes across as overbearing, Bradbury usually uses just enough off-ness to set the reader on a razor edge.The setting is a surreptitiously evil carnival, where the dead live again through the power of an electric chair and the mirror maze drowns souls with the weight of the future. The carnival is populated by all manners of freaks and horrors, yet when two kids discover its dark underbelly, of course, no one believes them. Carnivals are supposed to be strange and the freaks are supposed to be freaky, after all. It is under this guise of twisted normalcy that the Carnival feeds on the boys' hometown.You know that feeling you used to get when you read a fantasy book and the hero is confronted with Sauron or some other unimaginably powerful evil? That dread and utter hopelessness you feel when you honestly wonder if the hero will be able to stand up to it and win? Most of us have grown out of that feeling, too cynical to believe that anyone would write a fantasy story were the hero loses. Well, this book brought that feeling back, and that speaks volumes about its craftsmanship.When it comes to the psychological horror genre, you can't find anyone much better at it than Bradbury. While less popular, this book is as good of a horror novel as Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian one. Put on your white hat and read it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Originally released in the early 1960s, Ray Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" reads as fresh as any dark fantasy novel or horror piece written today, and it's as well written as the best of the genre, Stephen King and Dean Koontz and the like.The story in this novel starts off quite simply. There's a small town. In the middle of the night a train rolls into town and a carnival unloads itself off the train. Two young boys become interested and begin sneaking around the carnival at night, as young boys are likely to do. But then weird things begin happening in town.I won't say any more about the plot, because it would give too much away.But the writing here is great, flows easily and is full of awe-inspiring moments and some laughter. The darkness of this tale is not visually grotesque, so this is a perfect story for both adults and young adults. Even children nearing the teen years could enjoy this book.As far as a theme or subtext, \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" focuses a lot on age, on the young seeking their dreams, and the old wishing for dreams that had never come to fruition. The relationships between fathers and sons is also a main feature of this story.Read it, you'll love it. It's definitely a classic."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is hands down in my opinion Bradburys best novel and my favorite story his. Who knows how many stories he has published for the last 60 years and this one I hold dear to me. I have always been a huge fan of his, especially his short stories. If you want to check out a gerat book by this famous author I could only highly recomend Something Wicked This Way Comes!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"As described.

The book came quickly and was as advertised. This book is a quick read and is enjoyable. I recomend it to any one who likes fanasty/science fiction. Also gives an idea of what a small town in the midwest was like in the 1920s."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a dark tale about weakness in the face of temptation. A tale that is a moving commentary on youth and relationships, as well as being unsettling when it depicts how regrets affect our attitudes and actions in maturity.The book centers on two boys moving into adolescence, Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, best friends born two minutes apart. When Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show rolls into town with its carnival attractions, the boys natural curiosity for adventure lead them to discover the sinister intentions of the show. The boys, as different as light and dark but complimentary to each other, must work to save the community (and themselves). To stop Mr. Dark they must fight their own desires and growing impulses.Ray Bradbury's writing style is lyrical and poetic which takes a few pages to get accustomed to, but ultimately enhances a book that if written in a more direct style would feel slightly empty. The tone is dark and brooding in a beautiful way that carries the novel to heights above where it should be for the story alone. Although the story has wonderful coming of age yearnings, mystical and dark action and a lovely father and son awakening, the theme of loving yourself and accepting your fears is slightly bland. It is Bradbury's lyrical writing that creates an emotion on the page that leaves the reader mesmerized.There is much to enjoy with this book. Although the book is developed around the two boys and their relationship, I found myself routing for Will's father to shed his fears of being irrelevant and not miss the opportunity to show his son that it is his maturity that will be needed to beat back Cooger and Dark. I also loved some of the really spooky possibilities of how Cooger and Dark's carrousel could create situations where innocence of youth may not be so innocent.A good book with some very beautiful writing and scenes, but overall it seems slightly incomplete with many themes just touched upon leaving the reader wanting more."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked this way comes starts out as a book about two boys named Will and Jim. Jim always gets into trouble for not thinking but acting while Will usaully thinks and avoids things. This book is a mystery that will have you on your seat reluctant to put it down. The beginning scenerio is that there is a man who sells lightning rods walking down the street and there is about to be a storm. The man offers Jim one. This is the first time you see Jim's ignorance and Will's insight. Jim thinks it would be cool to have your house hit by lightning while Will is convinced that it would not be worth taking the risk. Soon the boys are in the midst of a carnival that claims the merry go round is broken when infact it runs backwards. They see a man on the merry go round get younger as it goes around. This sets the novel up for a great mystery and plot. The first thing that will catch your eye will be that you are constantly trying to figure this novel out, if you skip one scene or one page you may be confused for the rest of the book. Overall I beleive this book would be good to recomend to anyone looking for a very good mystery novel with good themes and a good plot."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes was my first contact with Bradbury, and it was a mindblast! The powerful story of archetypes and conviction that has inspired not a few of Steven King's books, and the beautiful and colorful prose of the novel enchanted me in a way that very few authors have ever managed.The story is set in a small Midwestern town. One October, a mysterious traveling carnival arrives, filled with strange attractions and stranger performers. And as the carnival's dark promises of secret desires turn to madness and despair, the lives of two 13-year old boys change forever.The beauty of Something Wicked This Way Comes is contained in its contrasts. Will Halloway is born a minute before midnight on October 30. Blond and blue-eyed, he is careful and timid. Jim Nightshade on the other hand - born a minute after midnight on October 31 - is his exact opposite. With his chestnut hair and dark eyes, brooding and always \\"looking at his shadow\\", he is ever getting into trouble. Perhaps it is this duality that accounts for the boys' friendship. It is also another beautiful contrast that Jim's brashness is what makes him the weak one in the story, while Will's timidity hides greater strength.The monstrous performers of Mr. Dark's carnival are among the most vivid images of nightmarish dementia I've seen in any type of fantasy, not in small part due to Bradbury's amazing descriptions. The scene of the Wax Witch's flight in a balloon held by her breaths, as she touches people's dreams in search for the boys, brands itself deep into the imagination, and won't let go long after you've put the book down. And it is but one example of the powerful imagery that occurs many times throughout the book.In the end, Something Wicked This Way Comes is a story of growing up and coming of age, of overcoming the greatest obstacles - your own desires and self-doubts - and of finding strength in what makes us human, against a power that would steal your dreams and turn them to nightmares. The book has mythic resonance, despite its \\"YA\\" setup and small-town setting, and in its wake one feels maybe a little stronger, as if the reader, and not the characters, has overcome the obstacles of Mr. Dark's traveling carnival. It is a beautifully written and imagined novel, and an attestation to the genius of Ray Bradbury's writing. I can not recommend it enough!10/10[...]"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is a tale of two boys: Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, one cautious, one adventurous and both who like to play and get in trouble as all young boys do. It also tells of the relationship between Will and his father who is an old man and has always felt that he hasn't been there for his boy because of his age.A carnival comes into town, and when Bradbury terms it carnival that means it's bad, because circuses are fun whereas carnivals hold the freaks and are dark. And that is exactly what it is; the carnival arrives at the evil time of 3:00 am in the morning unannounced and mysteriously sets up camp in one night. The carnival, as expected, draws in all the residents of Green Town, Illinois with its promises of fun and a good time for all. What the local residents do not notice that is for a select few the carnival, run by Mr. Dark, offers even more than fun, it offers dreams fulfilled.Jim and Will come across this revelation as they are sneaking around like young boys do, and they happen to be the only ones in town that know this carnival is evil, and they are praying on the towns people. Obviously, as boys, no one will believe them, except Will's father who for once in his life is able to help the boy and confront the carnival and Mr. Dark.This is obviously a classic in literature, and a classic for the horror field, the way Bradbury creates such a believable fantastic setting is unbelievable. Bradbury can describe young boys better than anyone else on the planet, when reading it you feel like the boys, you can visualize everything they do because you can relate. And add the wonder that Bradbury has for Circuses he creates a unique story that is a joy to read. I love this story!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Even being familiar with Ray Bradbury, I must confess this might be the most bizarre book that I have ever read. As a tale of youth that spins frightfully out of control, Bradbury gives readers a deep look into the soul of man. But even as Bradbury's metaphoric device comes full circle, one may feel that their equilibrium is corrupted.Jim and Will are the typical childhood pairing. Jim is rougher and perhaps more streetwise, while Will is somewhat naive. In the story, Will's father gives a sense of balance as the carnival reeks havoc on the town. Though the intentions of the carnival appear innocent at first, the boys are quick to note something peculiar. At the center of the mayhem is the carousel. As Will's father keenly observes, the carnival's power preys on the greed of people as note on page 152 of the 1970 printing. And once one gets what they want, they will find something else to want. Thus, a slave to the sideshow is created.This may be the type of book that requires thought and reflection for the reader to fully appreciate. While some of the sequences may be too fantastic for some readers, the overall picture is quite intriguing."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I was really excited to receive this cd of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. But I found the sound erratic and the acting and dialog stiff. Way too bad, since I love this story."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is Bradbury's finest novel, in my opinion. All of Bradbury's fiction is lyrical in nature, but in this work his prose flows quickly and magically from the first page to the last.The book is closer to horror than sci-fi, but I regard it as simply a great novel and believe that its universal theme of good vs. evil qualify it as literary fiction of the highest order. It is a book I read every few years to remind me of what language is capable of doing and to listen to the voices of Bradbury's unique small town characters as they attempt to deal with the mystifying forces of Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Show, a traveling carnival.The one-star reviews appear to be from the usual students who were forced to read the book. Don't be deterred. If you like a scary tale that also examines love and the human heart, you can't go wrong with SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I read this book for the first time about 16 years ago, when I was 10 or 11 years old. I was so impressed by the book, which had gripped me with its enchanting prose, that I immediately re-read it. Over the next couple years, I read several other works by Ray Bradbury and I periodically tried to imitate his style for school projects. I loved the book.I just re-read it for the third time, and I was still bewitched. Ray Bradbury's writing is impressive! He is poetic, and his writing perfectly fits the spooky subject of the book. In the book, there are dark characters whose bodies are covered with tattooed illustrations or who have been squashed down to resemble dwarves, and Ray Bradbury's writing, which is full of images, metaphors, and poetry, captured these characters and provided a great accompaniment for the book's story.Rereading it, now, after many years, I understood the book in a different way. The book's repeated discussion of immortality stuck with me, and has a different significance for me now. Also, between the first reading and this third, I had learned a bit more about Ray Bradbury's life. Did you know that Bradbury claims that, at a young age, he met a circus performer called Mr. Electrico? According to Bradbury, this performer, who had electric current pumped through him in front of a crowd of people, pointed his sword at Bradbury and declared: \\"You will live forever!\\" Knowing this story had a significant, and I think positive, impact on my reading!Finally, I'm glad that so many reviewers have liked this book. That's great. At times, I wondered whether other people would like Bradbury's wild writing, which jumps around, and calls forth images, and which captures the dark magic of the performing freaks. On a few rare instances, the prose felt forced, or seemed vaguely pretentious, or felt too overdrawn . . . But, when the writing seemed like this, the sour impression would only last for a moment before the story once again swallowed me whole.I was very glad that so many readers have found Bradbury's prose appealing."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Thirty-five years after its initial release, this magical and mesmerizing story still carries a punch. The opening pages are more like a thriller where you know something is out there...waiting. You can hear it; you can feel it getting closer. And it's not going to be pleasant.You follow a pair of young boys on their pre-Halloween adventure until you realize there is a lot more at stake than just going to the carnival. And the father of one of the boys, a meek and beaten down man, has a great decision to make. Others in the town face a temptation that could and does change each person's life.A small town story with universal truths about life and what you make of it. This is a true masterpiece using Bradbury's poetic phrasing and the hypnotic pictures he paints with words.Read it again."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This novel displays all of the trademarks that have established Bradbury as one of the premiere writers of our time. His prose is captivating, his use of allegory is brilliant and his descriptive imagery is perfectly fitting. The characters are memorable, the plot progesses at a satisfactory pace and the book's message of good/evil, human nature, youth, desire, self-awareness and more rings out clearly. I can see where some reviewers have found Bradbury's style here a bit difficult to get into, but if you go with him, he will take you on an unforgettable journey. Highly recommended to all Brabury fans. If you're new to Bradbury, this is one of his more notable works (though I might recommend \\"Martian Chronicles\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" as a starting point), just be patient and see it through to the end--you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I love Bradbury's style, how his writing calls up so many images from my own childhood.When \\"Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show\\" rolls into town, two thirteen-year-old boys become involved in a grand mystery. \\"And that was the October week when they grew up overnight, and were never so young any more...\\"I loved the merry-go-round that could speed up or reverse aging!I don't like to tell too much about a story, so I'll end with a high recommendation from a life-long-reader."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"*Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, two very different boys joined together by an evil carnival that thrives on misery and sadness. Will and Jim, two thirteen year old boys living in a small town in Illinois, were best friends since they were born and nothing separated them, nothing yet. An evil carnival comes to town, which is strange because carnivals stop coming after Labor Day, but also because it is named Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show. Will's father Charles Holloway thinks that this carnival is bad news. When the carnival comes Will realizes that the carnival is strange, but Jim is mesmerized by it. This carnival is strange, but more like evil. Strange things happen at the carnival, people go missing, the mirror maze shows everything but yourself, and the carousel makes you younger or older. Will and Jim set out to defeat the carnivals freaks and owners Cooger and Dark with help from Will's father. The boys soon realize how to destroy the carnival with their own most important emotions happiness and love. Something Wicked This Way Comes, by Ray Bradbury was an exciting story about the evil of a carnival, I recommend it to anyone who wants to read an exciting story about overcoming evil.*One reason I liked this book is because the character development. Will who seems so nice and shy, when pressured to do the right thing can become mean and tough. For example when Jim attempts to get on the carousel Will punches him so he cannot become older and leave him. Another character I like is Jim because he changes from wanting to get on the carousel, then when he realizes that the carnival is pure evil he decides that he doesn't want to.*Another reason I liked this book is because of the interesting plot. Ray Bradbury has a great imagination in creating the characters and their roles in the story. Some of Bradbury's characters were unnecessary though, like the Lightning rod salesman who appears in the beginning of the book and then the rest of the book as a dwarf, but Ray Bradbury never reveals what happens to the man. Bradbury is very creative in his way of writing, he writes in metaphors and similes for most of the book, which can become confusing at some times but make it sound cool.*Another reason I like this book is because Ray Bradbury keeps you on your toes by creating a sense of suspense. Bradbury hooks you in the prologue by shaping his words to make the book seem interesting, like I the quote \\"But this year Halloween arrived early.\\" Bradbury always ended the chapters with a metaphor that left you wanting more.*Something Wicked This Way Comes was a thrilling book with many twist and turns. A few reasons I liked this book was because the character development, its interesting plot, and its ongoing suspense factor. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a book about overcoming evil. Something Wicked This Way Comes, by Ray Bradbury was a very good book with many interesting twist and turns.M.Hom *:-)*(-:*"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"If there's one thing that Ray Bradbury excels at, it's his ability to recapture the range of emotions and attitudes that were present in all of us when we were just young, impressionable children. It's a sign of a talented writer if he or she is able to make the reader feel nostalgic for a childhood that one didn't have. SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES pushes all the right buttons in reminding us of the wonder that was present in everyone.A lot has been said about the prose of this book, and it's certainly of a higher quality than one would be expecting from a \\"horror\\" story. It's quite poetic and most of the time it is excellent at painting the scene. However, there are a number of places where it feels forced and pretentious, as if Bradbury is writing that way just to show off his thesaurus-reading skills. But for every turn of phrase that falls flat, there exist several chilling moments that will be forever etched in the mind of the reader. It's a step above the sort of material that one usually finds in genre works.The point of view from the two children is executed amazingly well. As in his other novels and short stories, Bradbury demonstrates his superb ability to realistically portray the beliefs and emotions of children. They aren't overly mature, but neither are they childish. He's hit the nail so perfectly that it really feels as though one is reading a true-life account of some curious boys, rather than a fictional account. On the other hand, breaking up the action between two children means that we never really get extremely close to either one. There's some nice interaction between one of the boys and his father that deals with the grown-up's attempt to develop a backbone and to stand up to the evil carnival people. This relationship creates some great dialog between the child and parent, as the older man tries to explain thoughts and concepts that are just slightly outside what the child can realistically understand.The story itself is quite chilling and is told well. Many of the actions that occur don't really make much logical sense, but they are nonsensical in the same way that fairy tales don't make sense; everything works inside the current context and that's just fine for their purposes. Evil men do evil deeds simply because they're evil. Good men attempt to prevent the spread of evil, because that's what good men do. Their motivation really isn't important. What makes it work is the journey that the characters go through.SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES is certainly a recommended work. Although often classified as a horror book, it really isn't all that frightening. But it succeeds at being a fantastic adventure tale that will remain with the reader long after the final page is turned."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Bradbury at his greatest is truly a great read. Any avid reader can remember the first time they read Farenheight 451. The thoughts and issues contained in that novel were truly amazing, causing one to pay attention to the glory our society can create and destroy. Something Wicked This Way Comes is as wonderful.The novel is ultimatly about a battle between good and evil, or truth verses deception. The main character is confronted with secrets he doesn't want to know and given the chance to live out long hidden dreams. The book plays out well, leaving the reader wondering until the last pages.Most important is Bradbury's ability to describe the elements in the novel. One could taste breath, feel the wind, and smell the carnival. Something Wicked This Way Comes is a wonderful book and should be enjoyed by readers of science fiction and other genres alike."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"\\"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\\" This quote from Shakespeare adequately describes this now-classic work of horror by Ray Bradbury. Bradbury manages to use evocative language and charming characters to draw the readers into what is almost a parallel world.Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade are boys born two seconds apart -- one on Halloween, the other on the day before. Will is the ultimate innocent, while Jim is darker and more knowledgeable about the world. These two have been inseparable friends all their lives, despite their different personalities and tiny events that divide them on subtle levels. Then, one day, a strange carnival comes to their town, with a freak show and a carousel.But a more sinister undercurrent runs in this carnival: The freak show, with its tattooed \\"illustrated man,\\" blind gypsy witch, and murderous dwarf, is more menacing than the townspeople expect. And when Will and Jim see the carousel change a man's age, they become the targets of Mr. Dark and his evil cohorts -- for fates worse than death.Bradbury's writing is a mixed bag. While it's extremely evocative and often surreal, it becomes a little clumsy at times. He refers to the carousel horses having \\"panic-colored teeth,\\" but never explains what this description means. His metaphors occasionally become very strained, and at times the lapses into philosophical musings become distractions to the overall plotline.However, he expertly draws out a feeling of horror with only a few words, never overdoing the descriptions of something that terrifies Jim and Will. Rather than using \\"ghoulies and ghosties,\\" Bradbury plays on fears in every human being, such as fears of aging, loneliness, physical decrepitude, loss of loved ones, and most horrifyingly when people are aged or de-aged and thus unrecognizable to their friends and loved ones. The buildup of suspense as the boys hide from Dark and his lackeys is utterly terrifying. And in a masterful use of nostalgia, Bradbury brings readers to the midwestern America of his youth, an innocent place of screen doors, fall leaves and barber shops.Jim and Will are good foils for one another. Too often in books with two lead characters of the same age and background, there is no personality difference, but these boys are radically different. Will is an utter innocent, with no comprehension of the seductiveness of evil and a great deal of fear for his family and his best friend. Jim, on the other hand, is more susceptible to Mr. Dark's offers. He wants to age to the level of a young adult with the carousel, while knowing in his heart that nothing good can come of it; his temptation is frightening in its intensity. The temptation is reversed for the quiet Charles Holloway, who is haunted by his own age and the relative youth of his son. His gradual changes of thought on this matter are never clumsy or sappy, but rather with the brilliance of Charles' new perceptions.\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is one of the rare stories that blends unusual prose, good characterizations, and skilful atmosphere into a true spinechiller. A great horror classic. Do not read after dark."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The book is great, and the Kindle price is very low ($1.99 as I write this). However, the Kindle file is riddled with errors: typos, bad returns, sentences run together, no table of contents. There's nothing like reading a great book and having the experience marred by a terrible translation to a new medium. I would have happily paid more for a decent, readable version of the book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I have read Something Wicked This Way Comes at least 5 times and every time I am amazed at the writing skill of Ray Bradbury in this novel. Each paragraph reads like poetry. I not only see, but I smell and feel the story.The book evokes the desires of all of us to be younger, older, prettier, or more famous. But there is always a cost for these atributes and there is even a cost to recover them from your past. We all know a Jim Nightshade (the darker side of each of us) and a Will Halloway (the brighter side of us). In this coming of age novel, the two best friends are only one day apart in age, but quite different in what they will do to attain their aspirations. They are anxious to be \\"older\\" and when a carnival comes into town during an electrical storm, they find the means to their desires. The question is whether the cost is worth it.This book is not for those that get high off of action, but for those that love to indulge in feeling goosebumps, smelling decay and hearing creaks. Just one example of Bradbury's prose from the book: \\"What's the answer, he wondered, walking through the library, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, is it all in the whorls on our thumbs and fingers? Why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves? They stoke a furnace all their lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes and start it all in the crib. Caesar's lean and hungry friends. They eat in the dark, who only stand and breathe.\\"Interestingly, the movie with Jason Robards as Will's remorsefull librarian father (quoted above), still maintains the same prose and feel. I recommend both. Read the book, but remember, there is a cost for going backwards."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"No one has ever written better about the enchantment of childhood than did Ray Bradbury in Dandelion Wine. Its a book that's all about the bright possibilities of youth, when the whole world seems magical. With Something Wicked This Way Comes, he looks at the flip side, how as we get older we discover that evil exists in the world too, and not just that it exists but that it is alluring, to us and all those around us.It's 1929, in Green Town, Illinois, and Jim Nightshade and William Halloway are thirteen, right on the traditional cusp of manhood. They are still boys when the dark carnival, Cooger &amp; Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, comes to town, but by the time it leaves they'll have grown up, for Mr. Dark, ringleader of the carnival, offers people their deepest darkest desires in exchange for their souls. Many of the townfolk, including Will's own father will be seduced by the offer of a return to youth, while Jim will find the offer of growing up fast irresistible. But Will can see what's going on and first saves his father and then the two of them fight to save Jim and the town. This book is thrilling, scary, and, most important, wise in the ways of man. Bradbury well understands that evil is such a powerful force not because it is so awful, but because it is so attractive. The people of Green Town aren't necessarily bad people, but in their willingness to exchange their very souls for an easy chance to be something that they are not, they head down the path of evil. What Mr. Dark is offering is unnatural in the strictest sense of the word, it violates the laws of nature, and Will's struggle against him is truly heroic, maybe even Biblical. You'll not often hear him listed among the great American authors, but with this book, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 to his credit, Ray Bradbury may deserve at least a mention.GRADE : A"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Two boys, a small town and an evil carnival. Sounds campy, but it's actually a good story, problem is, this is not a good book. Bradbury can invoke your childhood wonder of life and the brashness of youth and in that way it's a very good book. You can feel the fear of the boys of Mr. Dark, but you also feel thier wonder of him and his show, makes you really feel for the characters. The problem with this book is the semi-philosophical ranting, it was just irating to read, and he keeps doing it all though the novel. I can take it if it happens once or twice, but the thing is just littered with it. It breaks the momentum of the book, something happens, something else is about to, but first you have to push though three pages of these conjectures. That's the other problem with this book, the building of suspense is just that he talks about something else for awhile. Something is about to happen, and then he'll flash to a childhood memory, or moralize about society, or whatever...arghhhhh. I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"When I heard that my book club had chosen this book for our October reading with the idea of reading a creepy, Halloween-esc story, I was thrilled. I later found out that Something Wicked This Way Comes is often considered a genre book for horror. Even better. On top of all that, Ray Bradbury is a well-known author whose works are held in high regard. I was eager to dive into the book and went in with high expectations.I was severely disappointed.The overall idea of the book is really quite intriguing. A creepy carnival that feeds off of its customer's inner fears and insecurities mysteriously rolls into town before Halloween. Two boys know something's not right and set out to foil the evil that has invaded their small town. There's a lot of potential for an amazing story.However, the writing really ruined it.The style and overall writing struck me as overly poetic, clunky, and self-indulgent. Creating a captivating, bone-chilling setting is an essential for making a good horror. However, metaphors heaped on top of analogies do not a good setting description make. There was often so much description going on that I lost track of what exactly was going on plot-wise. It always seemed like there was more happening that there actually was. There were also a lot of sentences that contained prose like \\"He saw. He didn't see. He thought. He didn't think. He heard. He didn't hear.\\" At first, such prose was interesting and new. But it got really old, really fast. I respect Ray Bradbury as an author and I respect that all authors have their own, individual writing styles. However, the writing style really killed this book.The first fifty pages or so were actually quite well done. The scene settings were captivating and the way Bradbury set the characters of the two boys up was masterful. Then, the whole thing went downhill for the next 150 pages or so. The boys became really bland and hard to relate to and the writing got so clunky and confusing that it was difficult to figure out what was going on plot-wise. The last 50 pages picked back up and ended the book solidly enough with a satisfying conclusion. It was just a matter of slogging through the middle to get there.It really is a pity that the writing style ruined the book as much as it did because the idea behind it is truly intriguing and interesting. I haven't read a lot of Ray Bradbury's works, but I hope this is one of his worst and that his other works are far better."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I have to start by saying that I am an avid reader, but it usually takes me about a week to read a novel. On rare occasions, though, a book hooks me so thoroughly that I drop everything and read it constantly. This is what happened with Something Wicked... I am not one for heavy, thick, flowering language in my fiction, but I tolerate it fully with Bradbury. He never just says plain in simple terms what something is or what something is doing. He uses metaphors constantly and they work so well. Yeah, I know that's what good writing should be, but I've read lots of books that use lots of metaphors and it just doesn't work for me. I choke on it and can't see it and can't keep up with it. Bradbury does it masterfully in my opinion. As for the story, it is creepy and it is scary and it is wonderful! No, it won't freak you out or give you nightmares, but it will give you a chill if you let it. Let yourself visualize the characters and hear the calliope and you will be immersed and I bet you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Out of all of Ray Bradbury's prodigious gifts, perhaps none is greater than his ability to capture the true essence of childhood in a timeless manner. While his most prolific period is now four decades past, Bradbury's descriptions of the hopes and fears of childhood still strike a powerful chord; in particular, he is able to capture the fears of childhood from an adult's perspective, without in any way minimizing them.In \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" the reader is treated the pinnacle of Bradbury's writings on childhood. In it, he explores the most fundamental desire, and conversely, the most fundamental fear of childhood: growing older. Who among us wouldn't have leapt at the opportunity to be \\"grown up\\" at the snap of our fingers, but what about the consequences? Here, Bradbury uses the metaphor of a carnival that preys upon the fears of growing older, quite literally, in order to sustain itself.The two main characters, Will in Jim, are fourteen, and in that awkward time that is not quite adulthood but not quite childhood either. They are torn between the desire to plunge into adult life, even as they cling to the safety of childhood. In this regard they are no different from any other child, the difference is that the carnival, and it's mysterious merry-go-round make it possible for them to do something about this situation. Juxtaposing their dilemma is Will's father, who married and had Will relatively late and life, and feels his age all the more as a result of his young son.\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a clever, spooky story, perfect for Halloween time. Bradbury is a master of descriptive writing, and no one sets a mood better than he does. More than that, tough, this is a novel about coming of age, about the value of youth, but also about appreciating where you are and what you have achieved. It is heartfelt and sincere in an age where far too many novels use cynicism as a mask for a lack of ideas. For that reason alone, this is a novel that is well worth reading.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The novel \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes,\\" by Ray Bradbury is a book of dark wit and fantasy. With suspicious and unuseual characters, you must really keep up with the writings to recieve the messages tha the auther is throwing at you in an array of annalogys. That is what makes it hard to read and understand. such as,\\"His voice, Will thought, Inever noticed, It is the same color as his hair.\\" The main characters, Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway are but act like twin brothers. They talk the same, think the same, and often do the exact thing at the exact same time, including,\\"In one single motion,Will leaned from his window, as did Jim.\\"And a few paragraphs later,\\"both boys vanished in a quick and sudden motion and returned at the same tim e,each with binoculars. In conclusion,\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" asks for a devoted and patient reader. Sometimes you just have to just sit back and rethink what you read.It is a very different book in the sense of reading and understanding. I would recommend this book to a very academic person, or someone who wants to try something new. Thank You."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Perhaps I am a bit biased, but I just can't say anything bad about Ray Bradbury. I have read the reviews of \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" both positive and negative. I agree with both sides to an extent. \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" IS a dated novel. And while dialogue at times seems straight from \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" (Gee whiz!) and the ending can be deemed corny, I feel that this book and Ray Bradbury have stood and will continue to stand the test of time.Bradbury's style of writing may not be appreciated by everyone, but to say that his work is a waste of time seems way to extreme to me. I love Bradbury's works FOR the metaphors, FOR his long descriptions. Bradbury does not allow his readers to be innocent bystanders, instead he places them right there standing next to Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, witnessing firsthand the evil that is Dark and Cooger's traveling carnival. It is a perfect combination of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. For this, Ray Bradbury is definitely one of a kind.As for the ending, I was happy to read a novel with such a simple message at the end. There was no big complex (often ridiculously impossible) solution to ridding the town of evil, rather a pure, simple fix. For me, \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a welcomed stray from modern horror fiction."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"That Bradbury is the living legend of fiction so profound that it can move you for life is a well known fact. What is not known is that his stories are not just fiction. Rather every word he writes comes out of the experience he had in this life or last or may be next.Something Wicked This Way Comes explores the deepest, darkest desires of human heart. 2 Boys stumble upon the secret of a \\"dark carnival\\", its mysterious carousel and even more mysterious Mr. Dark, the ringmaster, the granter of all wishes.How the boys resist the evil of the carnival and all those lurking in its dark depths, how they temp their fates and struggle to survive makes a wonderful reading experience you won't find anywhere else.Whether you like Gothic fiction or not one thing is sure, you will like this book for its wonderful prose and extraordinary plot.CONCLUSION : A masterpiece.

I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:&quot;Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his find on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds.&quot;Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it. These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Without doubt, this is one of the best American novels ever written! In this poetic-prose masterpiece, two boys, Jim Nightshade (the dark one--hence the name) and William Halloway (the light one--i.e. Hallow=Holy or Halo) encounter an evil carnival inhabiting their small mid-western town (Waukegan, Illinois). Mr. Dark and his prized possessions--the freaks--succeed in luring and deceiving the townfolk into succumbing to their desires and fantasies, thus fueling and giving life to the evil carnival. Beware of the Autumn People! They feed on the lonely, desperate, and weak-hearted. Along with William's father, the two boys try and defeat the approaching evil and in the process they learn more about themselves and their growing and misunderstanding relationships with each other. This novel not only has a great plot and very interesting and in-depth characters, but it is SOOOOOOOOOOOO well written. Also, from the reading, we learn about Bradbury's philosophy on life--ACCEPTANCE! This book should be considered a classic and every middle school and/or high school should make it a mandatory read. Although it has received great reviews, this novel is still very underrated. In my opinion, Something Wicked This Way Comes is far better than Bradbury's more popular-- Fahrenheit 451. Hollywood--NOT DISNEY--should make a major motion movie about this masterpiece. This book--along with The Martian Chronicles, Dandelion Wine, and Death Is A Lonely Business--are definite must reads. One day, I predict Something Wicked This Way Comes will become an American classic. BEWARE OF THE AUTUMN PEOPLE! Who knows, we could be next."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I love this novel -- its whole is truly greater than its parts -- but some of it's seriously flawed. (I even heard Bradbury himself complain about it.) You get the feeling that Bradbury's a true believer of artistic inspiration, of a kind of unrestrained, no-metaphors-barred kind of poetics; but that he's not too keen on rewriting. He re-wrote this novel, in a sense, when he wrote the screenplay for the movie. It is the movie version, not the novel, in which Bradbury entirely overhauls the story and really polishes things up, i.e. fully fleshes out the characters, gives the plot a kind of emotional complexity and horror that never really exists in the novel, and really focuses in on the book's major theme -- the loss of youth and the acceptance of old age and death. Next to the novel, the movie shines and cuts like a razor. (Bradbury, incidentally, also wrote the screenplay for Moby Dick.) I love Bradbury, he's one of America's greatest national resources, and his works have even influenced such writers as Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez. But like I said, it's Bradbury's movie, which he wrote himself, that's the real masterpiece. If anyone doesn't agree with me or doesn't understand, then I would urge him to watch his cinematic adaptation. I promise you, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I don't get it. This book is supposed to be a classic of the horror genre. Just about everyone agrees on that point. The negative reviews stick out like sore thumbs. Well, here's another sore thumb. The premise is great. An evil carnival comes to town and preys on the emotional and spiritual weaknesses of the residents. The problem is that the story gets lost in the enigmatic writing style that Bradbury chose for this book. Half the time, I didn't really know what was going on. Maybe I'm missing something. If I am, I'm missing it by a mile."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I read this entire book in one day, even though I had more important things to do. It was like I couldn't put it down. The only way a book can do that to me is if it addresses a burning question that I have. A story can take hold of your curiosity and not let go. Something Wicked This Way Comes does exactly that. Moreover, it is also a great story.This book addresses the question of evil. I realize that's saying a lot because the question of evil is really many questions: what is it? where does it come from? what is it for? And for me, most importantly, how do you deal with it? I won't give away the books answer to this question, which I will say was very surprising. Just as surprisingly, it will make sense once you think about it.Even if, in the end, the bad guy gets away, you deal with him the same way when he comes around again because he won't really have any new tricks. He only has old tricks and old ways that he can't give up."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes was a very interesting read for me. I don't think I've ever read a book quite like this before (this is my first Bradbury novel).The novel itself it beautifully written--at times, almost magical. Bradbury's prose is more along the lines of poetry at many points. This is a positive and also a negative. On the positive side, I think it adds an eeriness to the story. On the negative side, if you aren't used to reading this style of storytelling, it could very well hinder the story and cause disinterest. At first, I was put off by the poetic style. However, the more I read the more I began to enjoy it.I love the \\"evil carnival comes to town\\" theme. I liked the main characters, two kids named Will and Jim. I loved the relationship Will has with his father.As much as I liked this book, I couldn't give it 5 stars. I thought the ending was a bit, well, cheesy (for lack of a better word).

I am now at a point between the two extremes that Bradbury dissects in this timeless (pun) merry-go-round (pun) of an a-fair (pun). OK, three puns in a row deserves a bad rating for this review, but what else can I do? The book is a classic, and will live as long as men and women look forward or backwards through their lives and reflect on what could be.I could chirp about how Bradbury has such eloquence and how he can construct a phrase with more spirit and humanity than should be possible, but if you want all that just read the jacket cover - greater readers and writers than I have said it all before.All I can do is verify that the story still holds true, and still stirs both boyish and manly emotions, even as I begin to see the shape of middle age forming in the mist of my future."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes(1962).Ray Bradbury, author of such renound classics as The Martian Chronicles and Farenheit 451, took a stab at the horror genre in 1962. Much like Mary Shelley(Frankenstein) and Bram Stoker(Dracula), Ray Bradbury helped in the shaping of the Horror genre, now ruled by such authors as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Combining Horror and Classical Literature, with a plot of Greed and Deception, Bradbury created what today would be known as a Horror Classic, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and also one of the most recognizeable novels in his catalog. Bradbury was the first Horror author to use children, the most unlikely heroes, that Stephen King later used in his commercial smash IT and his short story \\"The Body\\", and have been used by numerous other authors and directors of popular culture. Based on a famous quote of Shakespeare, Something Wicked This Way spawned a popular movie of its own, and Modern Day Metal Artist Iced Earth even used it for the title of their popular album. In the next paragraphs, you will read just what made Something Wicked This Way Comes such a timeless classic, and one of the very few classics I can stand!Plot-During the time before Halloween, in the cold Autumn of October, a Train seemingly spawned out of hell comes into town, a dark omen of the days ahead. As a calliope crackles mysterious doomy tunes, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, a carnival of sorts, unloads their dark materials, tents, animals, and sideshow freaks of equal gruesomeness. Jim Nightshade and Will Holloway, two young curious 12 Year old boys, seemingly are the only ones to hear the hellish calliope(FYI, an organ) music at Three in the Morning, so they set out to see where all the noise is coming from. Soon they find out, and flee back to their homes to await the coming storm. The next day, The Carnival is out in full force, and most of the entire town is there, to view such rides and shows as A Mirror Maze, a Ferris Wheel, seeing Skeleton Men, Dwarfs, Fortune Tellers, Mr. Electro, and Mr. Dark, the Amazing Illustrated Man. Their is also a Merry-Go-Round, but it is strangely Out of Order. After the crowd leaves and the carnival shuts down, the crowds subsided totally and all is quiet, Jim and Will stay behind, hiding, waiting to learn the mystery of the carnival. Soon they are thrusted into a world where their wildest dreams are imaginable, and their worst nightmares are staring them right in the face, and they are the only ones who can subside the Growing Storm...Writing-Since this is my first Ray Bradbury novel I've read(And probably not the last), I won't compare Something Wicked This Way Comes to his other works, but instead rate his writings as my observations as a reader. The most memorable part of Bradbury's writing, is his descriptive writing, which, even such a simple act as running, Bradbury lets you Feel, Hear, See, Taste, and almost makes you think you can reach out and touch what isn't there. Although many times his descriptions run-on for too long, other times he hits the right notes in the right amount of space, and his genuine talent for writing and descriptions bring the story and the characters alive. Something Wicked This Way Comes, along with Stoker's Dracular, is one of the few classics I can stand, because too much emphasis in other classics is placed on descriptions rather than plot, but Bradbury's plot is deftly place Center-Stage here, and the Reader never feels bored or let down.Many times his ideas may seem unreasonable, but against the other material it doesn't take too much away from the book to me.Overall, Something Wicked This Way Comes left a strong impression on me for Bradbury, and this won't be the last book I read by him. If you noticed the 4 star rating, it's mostly because of the things that plague classics so much for me. Overlong descriptions. I must emphasize though Bradbury isn't nearly as inconsistent as many authors, so this is just minor. Also some of his plot ideas seem odd and leave the reader thinking \\"Huh?\\", but most of the time the plot is easy to follow.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

This man puts a spell on the two boys. Many things are happening to the boys all through out the story. At certain parts of the book, they are chased by a storm. This storm continues to bring many bad things to the boys. There was a special day for Jim's dad; he could not wait until his son had come home. However, the surprise that he was expecting was not what Jim had brought to him. Jim and Will had been arrested by the police. They would not tell His father where they were. At that point, of the story, I thought to my self, \\"What could the father be thinking of his son?\\" At that point, I could only feel sorrow for how he felt. This story goes on to more details and to more problems to the two boys. The story ends in a surprising ending. For more details on the book, you have to get it and read it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"utterly comprehensable and delightful entertainment from the workings of Ray Bradbury. Another incredibly fun, yet absolutely terrifying thrillers that will leave you wanting more. After reading Something Wicked This Way Comes you will have to read the Illustrated Man, a sort of prolouge to this wonderful story of the mind. While reading this book you will find a place inside you where dreams are realized and nightmares just begin. From the title to the ending, Ray Bradbury has successfully surpassed his limits once again, twisting reality for his readers."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"&quot;By the Pricking of my Thumbs, Something Wicked This Way comes.&quot; This Shakespearean couplet sums up one of Ray Bradbury's literary masterpieces in only two lines. Ray Bradbury is a dream worker as he writes a destined classic about one of the oldest force; good versus bad, right versus wrong. His book, Something Wicked This Way Comes, is compelling and entertaining, but more importantly leaves a lasting impact on the reader. This book is about two young boys and ones father in a war against the Autumn people, Dark and the freaks and their carnival and mirror maze, and carousel. I will never go on another Carousel as long as I live."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This is a hard book to review, because for each thing great in this book, there is something terrible to off set it. A book like this, I will give 3 stars because its somewhere in the middle, which is where I kept finding myself as I read. Lets start with the good, because then, if you choose, you can stop reading after that. The plot is great, the theme is really fun, the pacing is nice, and the ending is exciting. Of the main characters I loved the Dad (who I consider the main protagonist and The Tattooed Man, who is the antagonist). In fact, if you want to read a truely great piece of writing, read chapters 39-41. The dad gives a great monologue about good vs. evil and has a really good match up against the forces of evil in this book. I reread these chapters over and over and couldn't get enough of it.Now, the bad, unfortunately, the great characters stop at the two main ones, and all the supporting characters are all just fluffy paper cut outs with little or no impact on the story, and the WORST characters are the two boys Jim and Will, and unfortunately, you will be stuck with them throughout the story. They have terrible dialogue, stupid sayings, and they don't act, talk, or do anything kid-like in the book. In fact, I would say, that these two characters are among the worst written characters ever in a book I have read. The other big con in this book is Bradbury's style of description. Bradbury is just one of those writers that you either love or hate, because his style is so peculiar, you either embrace it, or you just can't stomach it. I am in the latter circle, and have a hard time making it through his books.All in all, I think whether you like this novel or not, you will find yourself doing a fair amount of skimming, and for a book that is barely 300 pages long, that's not a good sign."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes is chilling, intense tale of two teenaged friends, Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, and a mysterious carnival. They are the only two people in the town, initially, that can see that something is not right with Mr. Dark and the sideshow freaks.Bradbury gives such life to his main characters, Jim and Will and Will's Dad. It is with horror and total understanding that the reader watches as Jim is nearly seduced by the carnival's promises. As an older reader, it was easy to feel the sadness and sense of loss being experienced by Mr. Halloway. Will, so likable, so naive, is the least believable only because he is so true in his goodness; and yet, I truly couldn't find fault with Will's character as such because his emotions were portrayed so well. Emotions were captured with wonderful clarity in this book, and are it's strongest feature.The language used by Bradbury in this book borders on poetry. I was continually struck by the beauty of a phrase, by an unusually accurate description or by a passage that simply begged to be read aloud. I was amazed at how beautifully he used the words, and how the words themselves added to the surreal feel of the story.As a story, this was a tense, spine chilling fairy tale, or urban fantasy (if I can use that term to describe a country story). I found I needed breaks after a few chapters, so suspenseful was the experience for me. It's not necessarily horrifying or frightening, but the level of anxiety that the characters were undergoing expressed itself to me as reader. The evil was sometimes over the top evil, again in a fairy tale way, and the actions and reactions didn't necessarily make sense, but one doesn't look for normal everyday reactions in such a surreal dark fantasy. The message of good triumphing over evil, while not particularly heavy handed, is rather painfully obvious, which was off-putting at times.I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending, with the particular way that good triumphed evil. It just didn't fit the build up and felt a bit forced, as if Mr. Bradbury didn't have the ended planned out and had to come up with one in a hurry. While still surreal, and still requiring serious decisions by the characters, it fell too neatly into place and at the same time left several unresolved issues.Despite any complaints I have, it is certainly a good read, and I can see it's influence on many other authors I read, but it's not as strong of a book as is, say Fahrenheit 451"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I had only read Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and I wasn't sold on the genius of Ray Bradbury. It is hailed as a literary classic and there is merit to this, but quite a few literary classics don't really hold up as a pleasurable read...but then folks have different tastes and perspectives. Then I came across Something Wicked This Way Comes, and honestly it was half title and have Bradbury that made me pick it up. I love the title of the book, and the back of the mass market paperback has to be one of the single best book descriptions to hook a reader. The book jacket read like a carnival barker trying to convince you of the wonders you will find inside the tent, or within these pages. A carnival is exactly what has come to Green Town, Illinois. Two eleven year old boys, Will and Jim, were born minutes apart. Will was born a minute before midnight on October 30, Jim a minute after, October 31. Light and Dark. They are best friends and in the middle of the night, two weeks before Halloween, they hear a train whistle blow and music in the air. They sneak out of their homes and discover a carnival being set up, except there is something dark and dangerous about this carnival coming in at three in the morning. By daylight things look better, friendlier, but there is a darkness and a creepiness hiding behind every tree and every carnival ride. Something is wrong. How wrong? I couldn't say without spoiling the surprise, but while there is the sense of the innocent to this book there is something truly wicked on the horizon.Had I read Something Wicked This Way Comes when I was around the age of the boys, or even a few years older, I would have absolutely loved this book. It has that creepy vibe that works better when you are young and reading a scary story alone in a mostly dark room. I have no doubt about this. When I have children and if they want to read a creepy book when they are a little older, I'll recommend this one. It is not at all filled with gore or excessive violence, but the imagery and what is occuring is the stuff of bad dreams. Ray Bradbury is very effective in telling this story, building tension, and capturing the tone and perhaps essence of young boys. This novel seems geared more to a younger (early teens, maybe pre-teen), but it is written with skill and craft, it isn't a low budget campy movie, it's a quality prestige piece that is accessible to a range of audiences.Still, I had difficulty being truly engaged all the way through. It's a great campfire story, but reading it in the daylight and fifteen years later than I should have, Something Wicked This Way Comes just didn't completely click with me. I can admire Bradbury's craft and imagination here, but I didn't love it like I would have fifteen years ago. It's a very well written book for a younger reader, though readers of all ages can certainly still enjoy. I certainly did.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I admit i thought this book seemed strange and somewhat corny from first reading the synopsis. But after begining to read i was imediately swept into Bradbury's vision. I could clearly see every detail and believe in the fantastic events. This book also provides a wonderful discourse on good and evil and the nature of each. As all good literature should it does not provide answers but asks deep questions."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury is a very interesting book. It is a fictionstory about two boys and their adventures at a carnival. If you like adventure and things that are out of this world, then you will like this book. Jim and Will (the two main characters) are very different. Will is very cautious and always thinks things through before doing them. Jim on the other hand just likes to go for things no matter what the consequences may be. The two boys go to a carnival and witness wicked stuff happening there. The book is pretty, long because of so many things that are happening at the carnival. It is fifty-four chapters long. If you are looking for something to read during your long, boring summer then read Something Wicked This Way Comes. The adventure never ends in this surprising, fiction story."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Two 13-year old boys are the centre of this book, but this is not really a children's book. In fact, I suspect that the modern 13-year-old would find the philosophising tedious and the action trite. However, to the older reader (say, high school and up), there is much to recommend the book. The plot: a carnival arrives in town, unusually late in the season, and a few townspeople disappear. The two boys investigate and learn that the people who were thought to have disappeared still exist, but in altered form: one has become a wizened dwarf while another has become a little girl. They discover a carousel that can turn the clock - make you older or younger. The carnival operators become alarmed by the boys and try to buy them off (by making them \\"grownups\\") or kidnap them.Of course, the plot isn't as important as the atmosphere, which is truly creepy. Carnivals and freak side-shows are creepy at the best of times, but Bradbury manages to instill dread and darkness into every scene. The boys eventually enlist one of their fathers, who works at the local library, and who supplies the philosophy in the book. Naturally it focusses on death and aging, which the carnival's carousel can reverse.The supernatural elements are a nice touch, and unique (I don't think they've been copied). Especially well-designed is the blind \\"witch\\" that can smell souls - she is essentially the bloodhound that tracks the boys for the carnival's master.The only drawbacks are that the philosophy is a little simplistic (mostly because the father is simplistic) and the notion of a carnival is outdated. It sounds quaint to modern ears that 13-year-old boys would be this excited about a carnival and its acts. However, I enjoyed the book, and recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The beauty of reading this classic and many other earlier great sci-fi/horror novels is the ability of author to clearly convey a compelling and fascinating story by using brevity. Unlike today's mega author's who feel the need to prove their prowess by writing 1,000 page tomes, or stories with trilogies ( with amusingly more than three books), the early pioneers could tell a story using a third of the words but with three times the impact. If you've ever read a Stephen King book (and I enjoy King) then read this book, You'll be amazed at how much Stephen King owes to Bradbury. Take a step back and enjoy the writing, not just the story. You almost feel like you are reading a long poem. There are many excellent horror and sci-fi writers today, but it's refreshing to go back and read this Bradbury classic and remind oneself why he is considered to be one of the masters. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I thought this book was a little off target, and kind of boring in some places. If you havn't read anything by Bradbury, you might want to try the Martian Chronicles or Farenheit 451 first."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes - Ray BradburyI am grateful to Stephen King for having brought this novel to notice in his horror fiction chronicle-critique \`Danse Macabre' (which I will recommend to anybody who is even remotely interested in horror/fantasy media).The main protagonists of this supernatural adventure are the sunny Will Halloway and his companion and counterpart, the wild Jim Nightshade. The plot centers on how their lives are turned upside-down with the arrival of that very unusual sideshow carnival, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show (God, this has such a Heavy Metal feel to it).If it were to be judged by its start-up this would undoubtedly be one of the best books ever. Bradbury in his element comes up with the literary equivalent of a Rick Wakeman solo. The words fly fast and furious, magically arranging themselves into such dizzyingly ornate and mellifluous phrases, sentences, paragraphs that almost threaten to drown the reader in their exuberance and beauty. This major portion of this book contains some of Bradbury's finest literary moments and as anyone who has read his work will till you, that is an achievement of no mean order. Characters like the Dust Witch and Mr. Dark aka The Illustrated Man are described in such vivid and astonishing detail as to strongly etch themselves onto readers' minds. You do not merely read, you see, hear, smell, taste, feel whatever the pen of Bradbury commands you to. This book bristles with parts that I will be happily re-reading for many months on.Wherein lies the catch? The plot after one of the best build-ups ever constructed grows somewhat loose with several potentially interesting supporting characters (Mr. Electrico, the Dwarf) given marginal footage. Although lavish description is used to paint what Stephen King describes as the \`Apollonian-Dionysian' divide between Will and Jim, once the action heats up, this is pretty much left by the wayside, the boys rendered almost interchangeable in their personalities. The story, after a point moves IMO almost into the realms of the straight-ahead thriller format, although Bradbury's writing alleviates a lot of the conventionality and it is perhaps only the cynical bastard in me that finds it difficult to swallow the \`Love Conquers All' driven denouement."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"In this book, Bradbury's writing is so infused with his style that if you don't like his style, the book is unreadable; whereas if you do like his style, then you are almost certain to love the book. I don't like his style, but many people do. Here's a sample which illustrates the style to which I refer. It is the fourth paragraph in chapter 3:\\"What's the answer, he wondered, walking through the library, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, is it all in the whorls on our thumbs and fingers? Why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves? They stoke a furnace all their lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes and start it all in the crib. Caesar's lean and hungry friends. They eat in the dark, who only stand and breathe.\\"If you like that style of writing, or at least don't consider it pretentious, self-indulgent gibberish, then you will probably be able to find a decent read in this book. I was able to make only about one-sixth of the way through before my annoyance with the style overcame my desire to read a good story."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I've always considered this book to be the dark companion to Bradbury's _Dandelion Wine_. Will Halloway is Douglas Spaulding is...young Ray Bradbury. However, where _Dandelion Wine_ dwells primarily on the innocent and uncorrupted side of small-town America in its golden age, this volume dwells with its shadow side. You see, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show doesn't bring darkness to town, so much as it cultivates what's already there. Like all portrayers of vice, if there weren't already a potentially willing market, they would have no success.Yet, every generation the black train steams into town- always on the cusp of the seasons- always in a long October, half way between midsummer and Christmas. Every generation they tempt and entrap. Every generation must either resist or succumb to their dark tricks. These October people are still out there, still making their infernal rounds....This book bears rereading. First of all, like much of Bradbury's earlier work it is as much poem as prose. I know that I myself didn't really appreciate poetry, the right brain side of seeing things, until I found his work. Also, as one grows older, one identifies less with Will, and Will's potential shadow, Jim, and more with the other characters. For me, Will's father, an old man who has wandered the world and has suffered a thousand petty defeats- and a much lesser number of minor victories- becomes more and more familiar.This book will give you nightmares. It will do so not because of graphic violence, but because of the way it subtly undermines the spirit and spreads doubts through the chinks of the soul. Still, without Dark to contend with, how would Light define, and strengthen, itself?"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Great.Something Wicked This Way Comes is a little gothic masterpiece by Ray Bradbury. The story concerns Will Holloway, his best friend Jim Nightshade, and his father Charles Holloway. One October a carnival comes to town. The carnival is run by a group of freaks who are intent on evil. The entire town, and particularly the two boys, and put in terrible danger. That all leads to a tremendous climax as Will, Jim, and Charles have to try to learn the true nature of good and evil to save themselves and the town.I can't believe that some people have written that this book is dated. I don't think that anyone will be saying that after the events of September 11. As long as fathers and sons still love one another and as long as there is evil to strive againgst, this novel will still be extremely valid. Something Wicked This Way Comes is fairly symbolic, and comments greatly on the nature of good and of evil. The story is fascinating and enlightening. Absolutely any reader can read this wonderful novel, be moved by it, and come away with a better understanding of human nature. I don't think that Ray Bradbury gets the credit he deserves, but any read of one of his novels will prove to the reader that he is a GREAT novelist."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I had to read Ray Bradbury's novel, Something Wicked This Way Comes as an assignment for my english class. I thought it would be just another tedious book to read. So, I started reading it, and discovered that, in all honesty, that it was just what I thought it would be....tedious. Of course, that is what I thought the first couple of pages were. I was about to quit reading the book after page 8 when I discovered that my English grade would plummet if I didn't complete the assignment. So, I plodded on, line after line. It wasn't that the book was impossible to read, it's just that Mr. Bradbury is so descriptive, a person can sometimes get lost in what he's saying unless they pay a lot of attention to the message that he sends across. It wasn't a book that I finished in a couple of hours. It took me a while to read it(and I'm a pretty quick reader)because some passages were so descriptive and flowery that I had to read them twice to fully grasp the meaning. However, upon reading the book in its entirety, I'm very glad that I didn't give up with it. The ending made all the hours of reading worthwhile. I loved the theme of goodness versus evil. I liked it because the ending made the whole book sort of come together and intertwine. It definately makes you think and take a long look at your own soul."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I'm really torn over this one. On the one hand, it's great to have this classic book in a Kindle edition. On the other, whoever proofread this should find another line of work.The font formatting (italics, etc) is completely absent. The paragraphs are almost all mashed together. For every ten paragraphs in the original, this version gives us maybe one.If you've read this book many times, you can, perhaps, get something out of this version if you remember the book well. (Of course, you may find this version as heartbreaking as I did.) If you've never read the book, this will be a hard slog, and without Bradbury's carefully chosen pacing, a lot is lost.The story is easily five stars. The formatting for this version is one. Hence, three stars. Three stars which weep in a black velver sky, while circus tents grow, like mushrooms, in the dark.I hate typing these next four words: skip the Kindle version."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This book was suggested for me to read by a friend of mine. She knew the wicked books that I have read very recently. At first, I did not want to read it, but after I read the cover of the book I was hooked. The opening pages were very interesting, I was going into the book not knowing what to expect and I was very shocked. The scene I most thoroughly enjoyed was the carousel. Most people would think that it is a very wicked part but I really enjoyed it. Most of the book was very disturbing and that they did not know what they had gotten themselves into. I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"A mildly paced, philosophical novel by author Ray Bradbury (author of \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"). Bringing out his very wordy and verbose style of writing, Bradbury tells a tale of dream-like, or even better, nightmare-like proportions. Jim and Will, a week under fourteen, are searching for some excitement in their quaint town in Illinois, but what they get is the place they call home suddenly turned upside down. Late one night, the boys discover a night-train coming down the shore. It's carrying what will shortly become a carnival of mystery. The boys can hardly believe their eyes. The carnival filled with sideshows and ghastly dark tents, harbors a cast of evil-natured freaks that have a certain humane charm, winning the hearts of the town folk. Inside the carnival, they find an insane, powerful, mirror maze that casts a spell on the boys' teacher, who later falls victim to the magically twisted carousel with powers to add or extract years from it's riders. The boys find this out, and are soon on the freaks hit list. Nothing is what it seems, friends are being disguised by new ages, and nobody knows who these freaks are or where they came from. But one thing is clear. Jim and Will are next, if they don't find out how to stop them."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I had to write to say do NOT listen to the many reviews of this book describing it as empty, dated, lacking creativity, etc. If you're familiar with Bradbury at all, this book will live up to your expectations of his typical high quality of writing. If you are not familiar with Bradbury, I'd personally say start with something closer to F451, Martian Chronicles, or some short stories to get a feel for Bradbury, but regardless of when you read this book, you'll be impressed. Bradbury creates suspense throughout the book, in fact, the only reason I read this book so quickly was because I simply could not put it down! There's no way to describe the magic bradbury creates, please, do yourself a favor and read this and every other Bradbury story you can get your hands on!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This book was an interoggative inquisition of the brain. Everytime you thought something, Bradbury made it into the last think your mind would allow you to think. My brain twisted and turned. Honestly I had to read a lot of it over to fully understand the signifigance of what he was saying."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Or should we scratch out that &quot;horror&quot;? &quot;Something wicked&quot; is, by all means, Bradbury's best. It has an authentic way of describing the feelings of children, and the horror lies in that surreal point of view. A glamorous and terrorizing carnival arrives in town and steals the lives of people, with its secrets visible only to the unfettered eye of children. In my opinion, S.King was inspired much by this book when writing his masterpiece &quot;It&quot;. Recommended for everybody, double recommended for people who are looking for serious horror, albeit in a fairy-tale clothing."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury is more than just a sci-fiction writer. In Something Wicked this Way Comes, Bradbury uses vivid metaphors, and details to illustrate the story of two young boys coming to age. The underlying theme of this book is the battle between the good and evil on earth, and also the battle inside of all of us. This is a must read!!!!!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I read the book for a school project. One night while reading it I read over 100 pages in one sitting just because of the suspense at the end of each chapter. Great read, buy it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury is an intriguing and insightful author. In this novel, which revolves around the life of two young boys that are attached at the hip, the fantastical plotline is only a small portion of what the book has to offer. The novel opens and the reader is introduced to the two young boys, each with very different backgrounds. One resents his lack of a father, and the other resents the advanced age of his father. One wants to forever cling to his boyhood, and the other can't wait to turn around and spit on his youth. When a dark and strange carnival comes to town, it seems that it holds solutions for everyone within its billowing tents. The one boy can grow older, and the other boy can make his father younger. Through the progression of the novel, many characters are lost to the somber carnival, and many of its previous members are introduced. If the reader can only cling on through the intense twists and turns this novel takes, he will be rewarded greatly at the end. Insight into human nature, and the true colors of good, found in the age-bent body of the father, and evil, found in many of the carnival members (essentially the owner, Mr. Black), will all be received by the faithful reader. The two boys triumph over the evil strangers, and they escape with scars gained only from their loss of innocence. In essence, it's the not quite average story of two boys reaching the brink of manhood."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"This was a great book, no questions asked! I dislike some of Bradbury's book, like &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, but this was a great book. I liked the way it kept you reading, making it hard to put the book down. At the end of every chapter, there was that constant overhanging feeling of suspense,forcing you to dive even further into this ocean of a book. The characterization was great, and the way Bradbury would switch from one scene to another to keep you updated was wonderful. The characters from the book acted like your worst nightmares would actually act, making the book seem all the more real. Even the beginning was exciting, unlike most books. This horror book skips the hassle of blood and guts, and just gets right down to the real thing: an evil group of people only you realize aren't what they appear to be. Not just another horror story with cardboard people and a stupid monster, this book really lets you get INTO the people in the book. It can get confusing at some points, but that's part of the fun. I recommend this book to sci-fi and fantasy lovers. &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; just goes to show, looks can be deceiving."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a novel about mankind's struggle with temptation. The three main character's Will, Jim and Charles (Will's father) live a relatively simple life before an evil carnival comes to their town. Once it rises up in the middle of the night, people in the town start to disappear and everything goes horribly wrong. The carnival offers what every person could ever dream of but the price is too horrible to bear. The boys have to struggle with their friendship while combating the evil that has manifested in their town. Charles also has to confront the greatest challenge he has ever faced and live up to being Will's father. Bradbury goes outside the narrow-minded sphere of reality, challenging our beliefs, and forcing us to confront our deepest desires and fears. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Something wicked this way comes the movie is a mind puzzeling and an abnormal movie, because of the characters and the events that catch your eyes and mind.This story of two boys who encounter the sinister wonders of Cooger and Mr.Dark's pandemonium shadow show.

Also I think that it was kind of odd how Mr. Dark used the diguise of being the lightning rod salesman, and how Jim and Will found out all the secrets of the mirors and the mazes and the fariswheel. All that Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger were trying to do were to take the peoples souls and trade them for what they (the people) wished for the most as in their sins. To all that haven't read this book should really read it because it will make you interested in it more and more...page after page. This book is one of the best ever written and it will make you more interested in it because of all what happens it makes you wander whats going to happen to Jim and Will next, so it keeps you gessing, and it makes you wander if Will and Jim will make it out alive or dead!!

I think this book is the most clear case of an author's vanity that I have ever seen. Do you ever get the feeling (when you're reading a novel) that the author is so very proud of the colorful language he has just scattered across the page that he can scarcely help himself from trying to top his last success at articulation? That is the way this book reads, like a perfect example of an author's vanity getting away from him.I grew up with this movie (and loved it!). This is one instance where I can honestly say that the movie was way better than the book. The book took too long to get anywhere, tried to introduce motives for characters' actions that never seemed to make any sense (to any normal person anyway), and was generally boring.So, whatever you do, stay clear of this book. Jump, skip, skidattle-crack your way on down the road to another book (yes this is my attempt to imitate Bradbury's annoying descriptive style in this book). You will not find anything that you liked about Farenheit 451 (another book by this author) in here."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Haven't read it yet, but I am looking forward to it. It came in an excellent condition and I met someone who visits Ray Bradbury as a friend. Had lots to talk about."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I have taken two stars off my rating because I felt the ending was very rushed. I would have liked to know more about the Illustrated Man, aka Mr. Dark, who was the most fascinating character in the novel. Also, I don't know if I liked Mr. Bradbury's style of writing for this novel - there were sections where I couldn't follow the imagery and wasn't connecting to what he was talking about. Otherwise, a very enjoyable, fast paced, thriller/horror story from Mr. Bradbury."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Long recognized as the master of the short story and science fiction, Ray Bradbury is most at home in the October country, the land where beauty and terror walk side by side. He ushers us into this land in his novel,\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", and almost poetic rendering of two boys coming of age and a man dealing with his own mortality.It is October, the season between warm summer and the chill of winter, and a carnival is coming to town, blown in by the same winds that make two young boys wake in the morning hours and gaze out their windows, full of unspoken longings. A handbill flies across the street promising a thousand and one wonders on its way to the quiet country town and a library's janitor feels the stirring of the boy he was fifty four years ago as the sound of a calliope comes closer.Too late in the year for a carnival,\\"Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show\\" arrives with something for everyone, the sweetness of cotton candy and the fascination of the freak shows, mirror mazes and merry go rounds and, master of it all is the Illustrated Man, who just might have your picture tattooed in the pal of his hand.Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are fascinated by the secrets the carnival hides and are drawn steadily deeper into it's dark secrets and fantastic promises, but the line between the wonderful and the terrible is a thin one and it is up to Will's father to make sense of the wonders the carnival has really brought and to try to save the two boys from its' lies.Although I am not a fan of the horror genre and did not believe I would like this book, I soon became fascinated with this novel and it's beautiful imagery. I often found myself re-reading Ray Bradbury's expertly crafted phrases which propel the reader from this world to Bradbury's own like the magic he loves to write about. He touches on our past experiences of sound and taste, memory and desires, hopes and fears and wraps them into a fantastic story that appeals to all ages. This is more than a \\"horror\\" novel.,it is a life-affirming story of foolishness and bravery, wisdom and the miracles of love between a father and son, and between two friends. Though \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" has been made into a movie, there is no substiture of Ray Bradbury's genius for description and his mastery of the English language. He reminds us of the children we were and reassures us of the future when he writes. This book will leave you smiling and looking at the world with eyes more attuned to the wonders around us.Oddly enough, this book has been dedicated to actor/dancer Gene Kelly whose artistry, says Bradbury, \\"changed my life\\". This book and its sweet message will also touch lives and leave them changed. I highly recommend the experience."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The best book ever. Granted, that's only an opinion, yet I would not just say that about any book. What I enjoy so much about this book is great portrayal of the common battle of good vs. evil. That's an old story, but this book is that storyline in its purest form. Additionally, the imagery is amazing. True, it can seem purple at times, but I still enjoyed it immensely. It really keeps everything interesting. Just wait until you get to the &quot;smiling bullet.&quot; Oh yeah, and don't forget to rent the movie, the SCARIEST DISNEY MOVIE EVER."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Many high schools cover this book in english classes, and though I hadn't read it in school, I've always been fond of Bradbury's short stories, so I figured I'd give it a read. I was fairly disappointed. It doesn't match his short fiction. I found the plot and characters dry and predictable. Maybe I just don't like carnies..."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Do not waste your time listening to this radio production/audio version of this book. Although this \\"radio production\\" was apparently done with Bradbury's own blessings and collaboration, it is terrible. The \\"acting\\" is sub-par and often sounds too much like somebody strictly reading their script, without any emotion or connection to the other parties in the scene. I have not read the book, and this was my first exposure to Bradbury. I knew nothing about the plot, and figured since Bradbury has been hailed as a \\"must-read\\", this would be good, but I was sadly disappointed. Perhaps it is because this is a radio production, however there seems to be far too much missing from the plot and at times it is difficult to fill in the many blanks that are left for the listener to try imagine what is happening. Too many times there is just creepy calipoe music, where, I suppose, they figured the listener would know something awful was happening, but it is never described. The plot jumps around too much without explanation- changing scenes, locations, characters, etc without much sense. The characters are shallow and there is no connection from the listener to them at all. Overall just a terrible production! As I was listening I couldnt wait for it to be over, and I kept hoping that something marvelous would come along to justify the reason that Bradbury is considered a classic- but that just never happened. No suspense, no emotion, no acting, no plot development, no resolution (what happened to the teacher? the mother? the carnival?) I can't put in to words how disappointed I was with this production. Again, do not waste your time with it!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I can't tell you how much this book has influenced my imagination.

How can you go wrong at $0.00 + shipping and handling. Only issue was that someone had highlighted the book in pink.

Since options for used books in my area are limited, this was the best choice."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"I adore Ray Bradbury, but Something Wicked This Way Comes, though it carries magic, is, after all, not one of his best. It comes nowhere near comparing to Dandelion Wine or Leviathan '99 or Fahrenheit 451. It is more along the lines of Somewhere A Band Is Playing... not exactly mediocre, but not exactly executed properly. I loathe saying these things about a true master that is perhaps my greatest inspiration, but I have read enough of him to suggest that he has far better works than this book considered by many to be a classic."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"The condition labeled for this book was accurate. Item delivery date was on time if not earlier. Would definitely buy from this seller again!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Ray Bradbury's book was something that I've wanted to read for quite some time. Unfortunately, I had already seen the film so I had a plot in mind as well as a mood. Bradbury as always strings metaphores together like we do popcorn on the Christmas tree. It's his main setup for atmosphere and that is the books great strength. Unfortunately for me, the characters of Will, Jim and Will's Dad are flat, underdeveloped and dull. Without a back story, I really don't have a sense of caring for the characters and as hard as I tried that didn't change. This was typical of Dickens at times. He created characters and then threw them into the story for development. I never found this technique particularly inviting for me.The story is simple enough -- a carnival comes to town creating strange and bizarre situations that invite temptation. Jim wants to be older -- but we aren't given a good enough reason why. Will's Dad wants to be younger and the idea feels more universal than centered on the character in question and it falls short. The carnival can do this of course but at a price. That alone feels as rundown an idea as I've ever read. Everyone has that statement. The ending feels more of a fable than anything else and perhaps that's what Ray wanted out of the story. Perhaps he would have put 'once upon a time' and 'happily ever after' were it a different time.The message -- don't fall into temptation and don't let misery eat away your soul. I don't know, the book has great mood and atmosphere but had the same feel for me as 'Tale of Two Cities' -- I couldn't want to finish it and move on to something else."},{"Title":"Hebrew-Greek Key Study Bible, The","review":"The edition I am actually reviewing is the 1990 printing with the New American Standard Text, published by AMG Publishers of Chattanooga, TN, 1-800-251-7206.There are literally dozens of so-called study Bibles out there all of which purport to bring the reader into a better appreciation of God's Word. Unfortunately, by using compromise translations and ear-tickling &quot;devotional&quot; notes, these Bibles draw the other direction.The Hebrew Greek Key Study Bible is quite refreshing to discover. It is the rock-solid and easy to read New American Standard translation teamed up with ancient and modern word study tools. Thus, you can learn what the Bible itself actually says rather than having a cute graphic and soundbite version of the truth. As a futher plus, the general editor and author of much of the study material is Spiros Zodhiates, Th.D., who as a learned Bible scholar and native Greek speaker is uniquely qulaified to hold forth on the New Testament of the Lord Jesus Christ.Most highly recommended"},{"Title":"Hebrew-Greek Key Study Bible, The","review":"I wanted the Hebrew-Greek Bible from Zondervon Publisher and they sent it from Baker.

LZ"},{"Title":"Hebrew-Greek Key Study Bible, The","review":"The more time I spend with this particular Bible, the more I'm disappointed with it. I have the KJV (2nd printing). There are numerous typographical errors throughout, and a few instances in which the editor changed words from the traditional KJV text, presumably to make it more &quot;readable.&quot;What really turns me off to it, however, is the commentary. Often very good, it at times however, is just flat wrong, especially when dealing with the subject of election/predestination. Mr. Zodhiates is actually almost self-contradictory at points regarding this subject.Given all that, I must say that the concept is a good one; that is, of having the words indexed to a Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek Lexicon that is included in the back. There have been numerous times I've been able to consult the dictionary in the back, when I did not have the cumbersome Strong's Concordance with me. The only downside to this is that not every word is indexed."},{"Title":"Auschwitz;: A doctor's eyewitness account (A Fawcett crest book)","review":"This book definitely broadened my outlook on life and made me think about how cruel the Nazi regime was.

The exercises are a cut above the ordinary. The explanations are clear, firmly anchored in musical theory without being overwhelming.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to get &quot;there&quot; from &quot;here&quot; elegantly, competently, and happily. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Play Classical Guitar","review":"David Braid's hardcover and spiral bound book is one of the best tutorials I've found for a moderately experienced guitar player who wishes to learn classical style of play. It is definitely a book for self taught adults however, and does present some shortcomings for the absolute beginner.First of all, the book covers a rather broad territory and moves the student into upper positions on the fingerboard in a relatively short period of time and without a great many of the repetitious examples (\\"studies\\") found in most of the other method books. Additionally, the writer is British and uses terminology that is somewhat foreign to American ears (\\"quavers\\", \\"semi-quavers\\", etc.). I would recommend using a supplemental exercise book to insure one develops certain requisite skills. Finally, the CD which accompanies the book and plays ALL of the exercies and examples in the book is not of the highest audio quality and only plays each excercise at \\"concert\\" speed. However, given all the that, I still give the book five stars for what it does well and the overall value it represents.There is no TAB in this book and the author correctly surmises that the student will have to learn to read music as he/she learns the left and right hand techniques necessary for play. The author incorporates effective note recognition into basic studes while allowing the student to play pieces incorporating both bass and treble and, hence, sounding like \\"real\\" music, almost from the very beginning. The exercises are progressive and effective in developing the skills the author is shooting for. Additionally, the overall quality of the package and ease of use, owing to the hardcover and spiral binding, make this an excellent intro to classical guitar.I recommend it second only to the more traditional (Book 1 & 2) series from Noad and Parkening."},{"Title":"Play Classical Guitar","review":"This is a beautifully put together book. It includes a CD with all the exercises pieces. It starts by discussing general posture and body position for playing. It then presents carefully organized studies that incrementally develop playing skills.

It is well organized and clearly presented. It moves the student along at a reasonable pace and keeps the student's interest. I very highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Play Classical Guitar","review":"I have to say when I first bought the book I didn't have a clue that I would be playing as well as I am now. Its like when you hear certain pieces played and you say &quot;One day I may play like that&quot; Well with this book you do. Its a very easy read,and the only true test is finding time to play. For me, I never want to put the book down. You learn to play, to read and to understand music. Well worth the small price."},{"Title":"Play Classical Guitar","review":"The book teaches music theory along with the guitar lessons. The information is given in easily digestible segments.

The book includes a section on buying a guitar. It's nicely illustrated and fun to use."},{"Title":"Play Classical Guitar","review":"Unlike &quot;the Noad book&quot; (which seemed to turn learning guitar into a chore,) Play Classical Guitar starts fast and teaches quickly. After only a few lessons, I already found myself playing pleasant little tunes.Excercises quickly get more difficult, but reward you with songs that you're proud to play for friends. The included CD also helps you compare yourself to &quot;the right way.&quot;I heartily reccomend this outstanding book -- except for the fact that you need a lot of will-power to put it down!"},{"Title":"Play Classical Guitar","review":"This book starts at the beginning covering posture, notation, timing, dynamics, etc. There are exercises in each lesson segment.

The CD can be very misleading since in order to fit all the examples in just one CD forced the author to play everything in an inedequately fast tempo. This by itself can be a real problem when you are starting out. As most of you know (or should know) playing classical guitar is learned not rushing through the notes but SLOWLY and then building up speed. So even when you try to listen to the example in order to understand rests and other issues of musical notation, it is just too fast...On the other hand if you have a professor guiding you along with this and other pieces of study you will find it very amusing."},{"Title":"Play Classical Guitar","review":"This book is one of many classical guitar-teaching books that I own. They are: Solo Guitar Playing (Frederick Noad), Progressive Classical Guitar Method (Jason Waldron), Pumping Nylon (Scott Tennant) and a couple of Mel Bay books just to name a few. Each one approaches teaching and how to play the classical guitar differently. This book by David Braid was made by an excellent publisher, hard back, spiral bound (stays open easy), full color pictures, top quality paper and a cute brunette model showing you how to hold the guitar between your legs. But as they say &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot; the content of this book for me falls very short. It doesn't seem to follow any logical progression of teaching, example: It has you playing in two voices, chords, doted notes and ties before even teaching you the notes on the base strings. Then it puts nail care at the back of the book, and tells me to memorize the studies so I can watch my left hand (contrary to every other book that I have) This all to me just left me frustrated and confused. I am sure David Braid is amazing classical guitarist but just because you can play well doesn't mean you can teach well. Compared to the exceptional book Solo Guitar Playing and the no thrills but concise Progressive Classical Guitar this one sat and collected dust.P.S. If you really want to give your fingers a work out try Pumping Nylon"},{"Title":"Play Classical Guitar","review":"I suspect that those who can't teach - edited this book.First, an ab-initio student must obtain use of a guitar.\\"A Guide to Buying an Instrument\\" is at the back.The convenient 1st page foldout shows fret enumeration,starting with III, skipping I & II.The 1st page foldout includes notes of frets, but not of the unfretted strings themselves. This is on page 9.The book would do well to include a diagram which correlates paper staff (stave) note positions with guitar fretboard notes: a fingerboard image on the diagonal of one page, with 2 magnified staff images in the other corners, and multi-colored correlation lines tipped with dots with note identification would be helpful. This info is scattered through the text.Right handed fingering - which finger one uses to play a specific note - is written explicitly; sometimes.

Even though the subject of salvation does come up frequently, we just enjoy that day and know our salvation is already secure and we don't need to be resaved. However, it usually touches on situations that are relevant to issues my children will face such as the way to treat other people, integrity, love for God and others, appreciating blessings, etc. I am disturbed by the review below that mentions an October 1 entry and non-associated verses from Matthew. I looked up the days which use Matthew 11:28-30 and looked at each story -- none of them deal with that subject. The October 1 entry deals with the opportunity to cheat on a test and the decision to take the grade earned rather than cheat to make a good grade. The other days were about Jesus being with us when we have a heavy load, and parents setting boundaries to protect their children from tempting situations. I have enjoyed the book as it is hard to find something that will \\"speak\\" to both my grade school son and my middle school daughter. I would recommend it. Of course, nothing beats the Bible.

Dos textos muy bien organizados, un voucher de descuento de $10, y un muy buen precio (comparado con otras guias de CiscoPress), me hacen ahora elegirlo como guia de referencia y estudio en mis clases de Networking Academy."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"First, let me tell you where I'm coming from so you know what kind of spin this review has. I studied for the CCNA about two years ago using Lammle's CCNA book first and then Odom's, but I never got around to taking the exam. Now I'm trying to ramp back up to take the comprehensive CCNA exam (640-801). One thing I can say for certain is the study materials from Odom and Cisco Press have improved over the last two years.In case you didn't pick it up in the description, the \\"CCNA Certification Library (CCNA Self-Study, exam #640-801), Sixth Edition\\" contains two volumes: the \\"CCNA INTRO Exam Certification Guide (CCNA Self-Study, 640-821, 640-801)\\" and the \\"CCNA ICND Exam Certification Guide (CCNA Self-Study, 640-811, 640-801)\\". If you're planning to take the comprehensive 640-801 exam, go ahead and get this Library with the two books - they cover all the material on the 640-801 as well as the material for the two separate exams.First, the good news:- One pleasant side effect of Cisco's decision to split the CCNA into two exams is that the Cisco Press review materials are now split into two volumes. Tell me, how many of you resented having to schlep around that monolith 640-607 Certification Guide? Well, now there are two volumes - one for each exam required for the CCNA. Now you have the option of just taking \\"half a book\\" with you while studying for the comprehensive exam.-The INTRO and ICND books were designed to be used together to prepare for the 640-801. The books include a reading map that shows which sections in each book should be read in what order. This lets you get complete coverage of each major topic before you move on to the next.- Another nice feature of the books is the \\"Do I Know This Already?\\" quiz at the beginning of each chapter. If you've been involved in networking for a while or you've studied for the CCNA before (like me), taking these quizzes can keep you from wasting time reading about things you already know. Taking them also keeps you from possibly missing some arguably odd things that Cisco deem important enough to include in the exam(s).- Odom and Cisco Press definitely do a much better job explaining networking fundamentals. If you're new networking and/or the CCNA, you'll definitely want to start with the INTRO volume. Basic concepts are covered there first and, in my opinion, covered well.- The accompanying CDs include PDFs of the books. Also, the exam and router simulators on the included CDs are a nice bonus, but I already have a couple of 2501's and a 1900 at home I can use for lab scenarios.Now, the bad news:- The bane of all technical exam guides: ERRATA!!! Although the number of errors in these books is way down since the 640-607 Certification Guide (49 vs. 80 at last count), to me, nothing is more obnoxious or problematic than a test preparation book with errors. We use these books to learn and study. Whenever there's an error it undermines the learning and that defeats the purpose of the book. What I'd like to know is how those 49 errors got past the *three* CCIE's who were the Technical Reviewers for the books.- Some of the figures are counter-intuitive. For example, some of the figures in the INTRO book showed data flowing from right to left. We read left to right, so using diagrams that move right to left seemed a little perplexing.- For some inexplicable reason the PDF versions of the books on the CDs are of the 1st printing while the books are 2nd printings. This will drive you nuts when you start finding errors on the PDFs that aren't in the printed versions.Even with these problems, this Library is the best bang for the buck when it comes to preparing for either the comprehensive 640-801 or the INTRO and ICND exams. As a bonus, it's written by Cisco Press, so it's much more likely the material you see on the exams will have been part of your reading. If you do get the library and install the exam simulators, make sure you download the update from the Cisco Press Web site; it takes care of some errata in the test engine.I'm giving this Library 4 stars due to the number of errors in the books and the disparity between the versions of the printed books and the included PDFs. Overall, those may be small quibbles on my part. Regardless, short of attending the Cisco Networking Academy, this Library is the best prep you can get for taking either the comprehensive CCNA exam or the two separate exams."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"Cisco Press' CCNA Self-Study Certification Library by Wendell Odom consists of two books: the ICND guide and the INTRO guide, corresponding to tests 640-811 and 641-821, respectively. Passing each of those tests will make you a CCNA; so will passing combined exam 640-801.I passed exam 640-801 in one try, with no real networking experience and having taken no classes. The ICND and INTRO books comprised my primary training materials.Although it is possible to enroll in official ICND and INTRO courses created by Cisco, the books that make up this \\"library,\\" apparently, are not the books used in those courses. Within the ICND book, Odom refers to \\"the ICND course, on which the exam is partly based,\\" suggesting that what you have in your hands is a reverse-engineered study guide: a study guide for an exam that is based on a course that does not use said book. Odom occasionally presents tables that he claims come from the ICND course. Clearly, some parts of the course are not fair game for the study guide.In other words, don't think that just because you are reading the official Cisco press CCNA study guides, you are dealing with a set of information that is as close as possible to the set of information from which the test was drawn.Studying these books will prepare you for the CCNA in the same way that reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z will prepare you to identify the capital of Nairobi. It goes without saying that a CCNA candidate should not be studying just to pass a test, she should be studying to qualify herself for a job. But in this case, the difference between the material presented and the material actually making up the test is excessive.Odom goes to a lot of effort to make the reader feel like he is being spoken to by a friend. \\"Fun, isn't it?\\" he writes, after presenting an illustration of function groups and access points that I had to re-draw for myself several times in order to understand. Later, he describes Inverse ARP as \\"another case of learning by listening, a great lesson for real life!\\" Gee, thanks. The subtle condescension in the non-humorous asides, the gleeful overuse of exclamation points, and the fable in which Pebbles Flintstone invents networking is compounded by the persistent contextual encapsulation of every single topic in the book. Odom tells you what he's going to tell you, then he tells you, then he tells you what he's told you, much more than necessary.A better way to put the flustered reader at ease might have been to proofread the books. The ICND guide, especially, is so full of typos that it is often embarrassing to read. In some cases, these are nothing more than obvious misspellings that can be passed over without much more than a little annoyance (e.g. ICND p. 472, \\"status enquiry messages\\"). In other cases, the meaning of the sentence is muddled. Worse, the configuration examples have obviously not been proofread either, resulting in, for example, the prompt \\"R1(config)#\\" when the appropriate prompt is \\"R1(config-if).\\" The difference may seem trivial, but understanding its significance is the kind of stuff the CCNA is all about.Each book comes with a CD containing a practice test engine and a router simulator (both from Boson). The mistakes in the ICND book pale in comparison to those in the CD test engines. In fact, an argument could be made that studying with those practice tests will hinder more than help the CCNA candidate who has not read the books thoroughly enough to recognize the mistakes. Many multiple-choice questions count correct answers wrong and vice versa (and some of these are taken directly from the books, which usually give the correct answer). A configuration entered into the CLI on a simulator question will be graded as wrong, and the user will then be presented with an identical configuration as an example of the correct way to solve the problem.None of these problems change the fact that these books will, if used correctly, absolutely help you pass the CCNA. But do it this way: Read the INTRO book. Take the exam right away. If you don't pass, flip through the ICND book and find the areas that you actually need to work on. You'll save months of study time that could be better spent working on your CCNP."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"I have used the books to learn for the 640-801, and even if I passed it with flying colours 3 years ago, I didn't pass it this time, as the exam is much more comprehensive than in 2001.These books were the only material I have used to prepare, and I guess that was my mistake, as the content of the books doesn't cover 100% the material you actually have to know for the real exam.Apart from the standard questions, there were few tricky ones about routing protocols, mainly EIGRP and OSPF, and one question was about DR and BDR (designated router and backup designated router), and I didn't even know what the terms mean, so I guessed wrong...Needless to say, the terms are not even mentioned in these books. I have quicly checked (with special thanks to Amazon for the very helpful 'Look inside' feature) the index of Sybex's CCNA book and 'designated router' is mentioned on three different pages. You guessed right: I checked that after the exam... :0So, even it's been said many times before, maybe someone will listen: never rely on a single source of preparation for the exam... :)"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"These two books helped me pass the test (640-801) on the first try after about two months of self-study. I also used and recommend Boson Netsim, even if you have access to a live Cisco network for the hands-on lessons. I also used and less enthusiastically recommend the CCNA Flash Cards and Exam Practice Pack which is worth the price, but is incomplete in its coverage and annoyingly produced.Building on what some of the other reviews have written, I thought these books are very well structured and clearly written. Each chapter is framed by a \\"Do I know This Already?\\" Quiz at the beginning and a Q& A section at the end which I found to be well done and useful. Frequently, I found I didn't know enough detail and depth about things that I thought I knew. And several times that level of detail was crucial to answering questions on the actual exam. Also Odom provides some nice tips for quickly solving subnetting problems; which is one of the things that I knew but needed to know better. And the CD with the practice questions was very useful and, I thought, very true to the actual exam.There are a few typos in the book and a few things that perhaps could have been better explained, but these are really minor problems for such a substantial work that has so much right about it. Frankly, more often I was wrong when I thought I'd come across a typo, and nailing it down really fixed whatever detail it was in my mind. Do print out the errata and keep it handy. You'll probably also want to fill out your studying by looking at some Cisco papers on the web; I found myself reading more at Cisco about EIGRP, configuring NAT and zero subnets the night before the test. I recommend avoiding most other free study sources on the web because they are rife with errors.Having now taken and passed the test and reflecting on where I was weakest; I'd have to say the only major weakness from my book and netsim studies was with troubleshooting. Here more experience with a production or real test network would have come in handy. You need to know which show and debug commands to use for particular problems, where to look for errors across multiple routers in your configuration or to see problems in your route tables, and such. And you need to do this all quickly. These books cover the commands but don't give you problems where you need to apply them.One final comment about why I liked and recommend these books is that while they are focused on the test and giving you tips about passing the test; they also do a really good job of teaching you about the topics and not just what you nee d to answer the questions. There was enough theory and history to help contextualize why these technologies developed in the way they did; what their strengths and weaknesses are, what problems they solved and created and so on."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"Let me first say that I took the CCNA exam last week (March 2005) and passed with a 933 (849 needed for pass). I have networking experience with Cisco equipment on an enterprise network, but it had been several years. I used these two books and the Boson Netsim for CCNA exclusively as study resources. I studied full time for two weeks, beginning the day after receiving the books, and at the end of two weeks took the exam.I thought Odom did a wonderful job explaining concepts and teaching you how to implement and troubleshoot them. Frankly, when I read the negative comments in these reviews, I don't understand them. For example, one reviewer commented that in an OSPF section of the exam he didn't know what the terms DR and BDR meant so he guessed. I'm not quite sure what he was reading because this volume covered those areas well. My advice for going through the material is to take the \\"Do I Know This Already\\" quizzes at the beginning of each chapter, and then reading the chapter anyway, even if scoring a (near-)perfect score. You may be able to skim through sections if you already know the material well, but be sure to at least skim through it.The included practice tests were a great resource. I used them well to find gaps in my knowledge and get used to the testing process, including managing my time. There were some annoying errors in the program but I was able to work around them with a little experience.There were a few questions on the exam that I guessed on, so today I went back into the books and found the answers. They were just areas I hadn't covered as deeply as others. But the topics were covered.Overall, I strongly recommend these two books if you want to be well-prepared."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"When I was studying for my CCNA, many years ago, I didn't have a two part option. Now that Cisco has made available the option to take the CCNA certification exam in two parts, this is the set of books to use for studying. The first book in the library is CCNA Intro which is the exam prep for test 640-821. The other book in the set is CCNA ICND which prepares the reader for the 640-811 test. Each book also comes with a CD containing practice questions using the Boson test engine. It also has a customized copy of the Boson NetSim LE network simulation software.The CCNA Intro gives an overview of a broad range of topics, from the OSI model, fundamentals of TCP/IP and IP addressing. I was very impressed with the way the material was covered in this volume. It presents IP Fundamentals in a very easy to understand way. I really liked the \\"Do I Know This Already\\" quizzes presented at the beginning of each chapter. These pre-quizzes help the student gauge their knowledge of the subject matter and home in on where they need to study more.The CCNA ICND has the same layout and features of the Intro book but it covers more of the core Cisco technology with particular emphasis on routing and switching. This book progresses from LAN Switching thorough advanced IP Routing protocols and access lists. I was amazed at the depth the author went into concerning the routing protocols. As I remember, I wasn't required to know a whole lot about OSPF or EIGRP; I had to wait until I started preparing for my CCNP to delve into these subjects.The CD that comes with each volume was outstanding. The practice questions use the Boson test engine and were a very good representation of the actual CCNA exam. The test engine has multiple choice questions, fill in the blanks, and router simulation exercises. I know that the full version couldn't have been included, but the NetSim LE network simulator, that was included, was quite adequate.Personally I preferred the CCNA Certification Library over the study guide I used to prepare for my CCNA exam. To me it presented the information in a much easier to understand format and covered the topics in more depth. If this library had been available when I was studying for the CCNA, it would have made my studies much easier. This is a great study aid for those new to networking and those pursuing the CCNA."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"For what it is for, this book is great. And it is also one of the easiest to follow technical books I have ever read.INTRO gives you a great overview of OSI layer 1-4 and 7. Session and Presentation layer were not covered as much as other layers. Mostly used protocols on each layer were explained well though some of the protocols need more work such as SNMP. Cabling is also covered in the intro book which is good.ICND starts to pick up pace. STP, routing protocols, advanced routing, advanced tcp/ip, and wan technologies are covered in this book which could get you a little frustrated if you are a beginner. Keep at it and you will be fine. Do not give up.There are some typos (honestly not that many) so go to book's website and get a list of erratas. I agree with some other reviews that the book does not cover everthing that could be on the exam but you should pass the exam with only these 2 books if you thorougly understand everything. For example, OSPF DR BDR and neighboring relationship are not covered very well.For sim questions, make sure you remember VLAN, RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, NAT, and dynamic NAT configurations cold. These will be on the exam. At the mean time, you could spend less time on frame relay and ISDN configs because I think the chances of those showing up as your sim question is almost 0.Good luck on your exam"},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"I have all three versions of Wendell Odom's Cisco Press CCNA books. This latest set, the CCNA Certification Library is by far his best work.His first two books were great, if not a little overwhelming. I find myself constantly returning to them as a reference in the field.But these latest 2 books, &quot;Intro to CCNA&quot; and &quot;ICND&quot; (included in the library) are right on target.Beginners will find the Intro book a great place to start learning the technology.The ICND book gets a little deeper but builds upon the foundation laid by the Intro book.I found the questions in the beginning of each chapter helpful as they let me assess my knowledge of a subject and it gave me an idea if needed to go over a chapter again.I loaded the CD that comes with Books and it had practice questions. I did find a couple of questions that seemed incorrect, but over all a huge improvement over the Cisco Press CD's of the past that were full of errors.All in all, I believe that the Certification Library set is the best CCNA title from Cisco Press yet. I found them highly informative, easy to read, and the \\"Wow this is a thick book&quot; factor has been toned down considerably. Plus the 2 book approach makes it easier for a non-technical person to ease into the CCNA at their own pace.I think if you are pursuing the new CCNA 640-801,811,821 or for those looking for a great reference book. This set is a good buy."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"Even if you know nothing about networking, these books would be a great place to start.

The questions at the beginning and end of each chapter are also good. The NetSim software provided with the library is actually better than the test engine used during the actual INTRO exam. Having said that, relying on just this source to get thru the exam on the 1st try may not get you there. I took the INTRO exam on 3/7/05 and scored 815 with a minimum Pass of 825 required. This book tends to make you over confident. It is very good on a lot topics especially subnetting, but there were just too many questions that I got wrong. I am looking for another source of material before I try again sometime this year. This is an excellent source, but the questions in (at least the INTRO) give you a false sense of confidence. If you are expecting to see any of them again on the exam, you will be disappointed.

However, if I had to find flaws, it wouldn't be that hard:There are significant errors here and there; E.G. the section on Classful vs Classless routing uses the wrong term in one of the sentences. If you were paying attention in the earlier parts of the section, the error will cause you to stumble enough to where it should catch your eye. There are probably one or two other errors of this type elsewhere in the book. Nothing fatal for those studying to get their CCNA, though.The only other complaint I've had so far is that I'm making my own flash cards while I read, and were I to arrange the books myself, I'd do it somewhat differently. As an example, early in your reading (if you switch between books using the suggestions in the introductions, *if* you're taking the single exam), you'll hit Chapter 4 (Fundamentals of WANS) in the INTRO book fairly early in your reading, and then see much of the same information later on in Chapter 9 of the ICND book (Point-to-Point Leased Line Implementation). So if you're making your own flash cards, you'll either end up duplicating information a bit or you'll end up reordering your flash cards here and there.Don't get me wrong: Odom is a good writer, and there's a lot of material that an editor would have to go through, so a misprint or two can be forgiven. And the best way to get something straight is to hear it multiple times. I can see how these books would be useful as both study guides and references. If you're going to read these books at a quick or even moderate pace, though, you will experience some deja-vu. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"This two-book set is extremely well-written, concise, with very few discrepancies (although there really shouldn't be any), and provides comprehensive enough information to be used as a sole study guide for the Intro and ICND exams (although I did go through the Cisco CCNA Academy as well). I only have two complaints about this set: first, the chapter on subnetting is really only useful for the questions at the beginning and end of the chapter (the author provides a convoluted way of doing subnetting, but given the time contraints of the exam(s), you're much better off just getting proficient at binary-to-decimal math (and vice-versa) -- you only have to deal with 8 bits at a time, folks -- and working with individual network/subnet/host bits to solve problems -- in fact, if you do this enough, you're likely to be able to do most, if not all, of the work for these types of problems in your head). Second, the test engine on the CD-ROM included with the set has limited utility (it only partially prepares you for the environment -- i.e. question type/format --of the actual exam, its question base does not cover all the material in the book evenly, and has several scoring errors -- the simulation questions seem especially prone to this)."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"Listen Guys;First I want to say that I have successfully completed the CCNA 640-801 Exam and I WOULD NOT have been able to pass my CCNA Exam if it was not for Wendal Odom's Self Study Library.It is absolutley amazing, from begining to end.

The CCIE author is very knowledgeable and thorough. This book also includes a CCNA exam discount voucher and network simulator software. I'm impressed by the list of technical reviewers who are all CCIE certified.What I found helpful within this book is the information presented in an easy to read, digestible format. Nothing is more frustrating than spending hours wading through printed or online documentation attempting to locate the answer to the simplest of questions! This book offers very useful \\"Do I Know This Already Quizzes\\" at the beginning of each chapter. Each chapter also includes questions and answers for reinforcement--there are two CDs with more practice questions, and Boson's NetSim LE network simulator software allowing you to practice for the simulator-based questions on the real exams! Most of the time, the author's words are clear and concise--the book's layout is comprehensive and flows from cover to cover.This certification library is split into to two books. This allows you to study for the single 640-821 or 640-811 exam in a digestible format. You can also use both books in combination to prepare to pass the single CCNA exam 640-801. The author's technical background and knowledge are impressive. He must have had a difficult time working within the constraints of 1200 pages. It's also very impressive that the publisher was able to find three other CCIEs to participate in the technical review of this book. Could there possibly be any more technically correct book on the shelf?I was only able to locate a few small technical inaccuracies in this book. I have never found a technical book without errors! The few errors I found were in defined acronyms and may have been a result of the book's copy edit process. Refreshingly, this book focuses not only on preparing you to pass the CCNA exams but really helps you to understand the technology involved! This book's author and technical reviewers have years of real world experience, and are probably more concerned with the reader's ability to understand the material more than anything else.For the self-study candidate on a limited budget, who really wants to understand what's required to be a successful CCNA, this book offers a well readable format.

This book is the latest edition, and the recommended book to use in review in the last weeks before the current CCNA Exam.I would advise all Exam hopefuls to take the wealth of material seriously! That means 'No Single Text' can take you through all 4 semesters-worth of the curriculum. What this book, and many others in the Cisco series do well is remind and focus you in on what Cisco (they publish the book and the test) expect you to know for the exam. So, if there is deep coverage of a subject you didn't consider important, you'd better bone up on that chapter. If there is scant coverage or no coverage of a subject, then maybe you should just review what the book shows, and spend the bulk of your time on other chapters.What the book does not do is take you from novice to CCNA level. THAT'S NOT IT'S PURPOSE. The writer expects you to be either:- in the industry with significant experience, and knowledgeable of the concepts and Cisco IOS, with access to Cisco equipment, needing a text to review, or- a Cisco Network Academy student, with access to Cisco equipment, and successful with the Academy curriculum, or- a student with other Networking knowledge that has access to Cisco equipment (or simulator) who wants to get Cisco's spin on what they believe they already know.In other words, don't think you can walk in from the street, pick up this book, and suddenly know all that you need to pass the test.

This review is made from the perspective of a CCNA Candidate with little to no knowledge or experience of Internetworking in a Cisco environment.The CCNA INTRO volume tries to prepare the reader for the CCNA ICND volume while addressing the content of the INTRO exam 640-821. With such a methodology, this textbook ends up raising more questions than answers in the mind of a candidate that will have to wait for the CCNA ICND volume to get clarifications on a great number of topics.This new edition of the CCNA Certification Library has the following characteristics:Pros:- Odom makes the text accessible from the perspective of a CCNA candidate. Generally, topics are presented according to a progressive line of thought laid out in the introduction of any chapter. This plan usually presents what will be covered and what will not.- The textbook is written in a conversational format and emphasizes on four things:1. exam format2. exam content3. real world tasks. Odom presents not just how to configure network equipment but how to make effective configurations.4. Practice, with the addition of the NETSIM LE simulator on the accompanying CD-Rom, along with a to-the-point guide about this software in Appendix C of the book.The author also presents:- An excellent comparative analysis of routing protocols.- Some key sample configurations with interesting considerations about \\"real world\\" behavior of the Cisco equipment they run on- An excellent coverage of Frame Relay, ISDN and IP Access Control Lists.- Some good Design Principles- A good collection of web links and RFC referencesCons:Some chapters including \\"IP Addressing and Subnetting\\" and \\"RIP, IGRP, and Static Route Concepts and Configuration\\" (ICND volume) contain too many non technical illustrations and lack a precise conceptual framework. This makes it difficult for a CCNA candidate to find and retain key points.Overall, in this new edition of the CCNA self-study kit, a conscientious effort has been put forth by the author to make the content of the CCNA exam more accessible while still trying to provide a solid understanding of some key networking concepts and technologies. However, the degree to which the two volumes overlap along with the methodology adopted, sometimes make it very challenging for a CCNA candidate to get a clear and precise understanding of the technologies covered on the exam."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"CCNA Certification Library (ISBN: 1-58720-095-3)I was reading these books in order to recertify my CCNA.

I assumed correctly.I chose the Cisco Press books because I'd learned that if you want to get the right material weighting for a Cisco exam, it's best to pick your apples right off of the tree. In my previous experience, Cisco Press books had a tendency to be somewhat dry but I quickly learned that this misconception is no longer true. I found that the author, Wendell Odom, brings a friendly approach to the material that makes it quite readable. His examples are handled very well and his explanations are good. He doesn't write in the \\"just-the-facts-ma'am\\" way that tends to be the norm in technical books, so I will definitely be looking for titles by him in the future.The books are intended for someone fairly new to networking, so I experienced a bit of the \\"duh\\" factor. However, I was still able to learn a few interesting facts and reinforced a lot of what I already knew. The biggest change since I last took the CCNA exam is that Cisco now offers the option of taking it as 2 separate tests or as the single exam. I was pleased to see that, although the CCNA has been split into 2 books, the author has included a reading plan that allows you to read the 2 books in a back-and-forth order that makes it easy to use the same set of books to study for the single test version.Overall, the books are well written and readable. A little more care should have been taken into the spell checking prior to publishing, but that's far from a deal breaker on these books. Overall, I'd give them 4 stars out of 5. Here's the individual run-down on the books...CCNA INTRO (ISBN: 1-58720-094-5)This book can be used by itself to study for exam 640-821(Introduction to Cisco Networking Technologies). The exam covers the basic principles behind basic network topologies, cabling, switching, routing, TCP/IP, IP addressing and WAN technologies. The book approaches this material in a very shallow way. Without going into too much depth on most topics, it covers a very broad range of material. If you are studying for the single CCNA exam, you can bounce back and forth between this book and the ICND book, reading the basics in this book then going to the ICND book for the nitty-gritty details. The one exception to the rule is the topic of IP Addressing, which is covered entirely within this title. Probably the most important topic in this book, it is very well explained and there are plenty of practice IP addressing exercises on the CD. This book covers the material adequately for a beginner who is just learning the networking principals. On it's own, I'd give this book 4 stars out of 5.CCNA ICND (ISBN: 1-58720-083-X)This book can be used to study for exam 640-811 (Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices). The exam covers basic switch configuration, basic IP routing, basic access list configuration and basic remote access configuration. This book takes each topic and explains the details regarding its implementation. The basic configuration commands are presented, explained and then given in the form of an example. The examples are generally pretty clear and the commands are shown in relation to the surrounding commands, so the context of the command is clear. This book is the opposite of the Intro book, as it covers a small amount of material to a deeper level. There are some new topics presented, like route summarization and Link State protocols, which weren't on the old CCNA exam. If you're wanting to recertify, but aren't ready to move on to CCNP, then this is the book to pick up. I'd give it 5 out of 5 stars.ExtrasThe CD's also include a pair of excellent test banks. I found them to be very useful in preparing for the test and working through the book. There were a few answers that were just plain wrong, but I've come to expect a little inaccuracy with my test banks. The questions are not overly easy, but they're also not all that tricky. They're about the right level of difficulty for this exam. One especially cool feature is the \\"Study Saver\\" which makes the question bank your screen saver.Cisco has an affinity for simulation questions on their exams, so it's good that they included the Boson Netsim LE on the CD. The bad news is that all the functions and labs are not unlocked unless you go through the \\"upgrade process\\" which consists of downgrading your wallet to the tune of $125, which is supposed to be a great deal compared to what they usually charge. I didn't want to spend a lot of time with what is essentially a simulator demo, but feel free to give it a try. However, if the interface doesn't really make you comfortable, try something else like the Cisco Interactive Mentor CD's (which I recommend) or one of the many other simulator options out there before shelling out your hard-earned money.In addition to the test banks and Netsim, the CD's also include PDF versions of the books and 25 IP subnetting practice exercises. All in all, I'd give the extras 3 stars out of 5. The test banks are good, but I'd have like to have seen the CIM simulator instead of the Netsim."},{"Title":"CCNA Certification Library: (CCNA Self Study, Exam #640-801)","review":"An electronics technician of 8 years, I have a solid understanding of computers but I am totally new to internetworking and Cisco equipment. In my opinion this book is very poorly written and I do not beleive it was proof-read before it was printed. Since I am not a Cisco pro I cannot detect any of the errors between the information presented and how things really work, but I can detect all the inconsistancies of the information given.Figures and diagrams that do not correlate with the text leave you wondering which is correct. Topic and chapter review quizes that ask things which were not explained in the text. There are answers provided in the back of the book to these quizes but 1 or 2 out of 10 of every 10 answers are incorrect and not ammended in the current errata. This is very frustrating to me because I have spent too much time reviewing material to figure out why I missed a question - only to find that I didn't.When I emailed Ciscopress and explained the ammount of errors I am finding I was refered to a very small errata page. I offered to submit a list of items that I felt should be reviewed for accuracy... but should I be the one proof reading this text?Will the $250 exam also be so flawed?"},{"Title":"A New Model of the Universe (Dover Occult)","review":"A hugely encompassing book on mysticism and the nature of consciousness/reality.The collection of thoughts Ouspesky enclosed therein,are mostly relevant to todays spiritual/metaphysical ponderings.And i would go as far as to say invaluable to anyone with an interest in such things. Although,most of the precepts expounded by him,were more or less 'aquired' from a number of fairly obvious (and he does mention some of them) sources,he has an acute knack of being able to explain (most of the time!),exactly what it is he wants you to understand. i think the most important chapters in this book,deal with spatial/time recognition and interpretation;Namely 'the 4th dimension'(can i point the reader in the direction of 'Flatland',by Edwin A Abbot?An obvious source for his explanation of point and line to plane). He was most certainly a man of grandoise vision.And that can be summarised simply from one chapter;where he tries to explain the fractal nature of the universe.Of course,80 odd years before scientists had formulated the theory of chaos and the fractal complexity of nature,he didnt have any real reference points or terms with which to impart his idea to the reader. But still he manages to outline,and infuse his thoughts with clarity and vibrancy. He presents the esoteric in a very un-esoteric way. I read this book about 30 times when i was a teenager.Even after immersing myself through the Jung and Neitzche etc. I still returned to this book for inspiration. And i'd recommend Ouspensky as the definitive,and most accessable author on this subject (excepting maybe Crowley,who is on the whole,inaccessable,problematic,and riddled with frustratingly curious,but almost inpenetrable dead-ends!). So go Ouspesky :O)"},{"Title":"A New Model of the Universe (Dover Occult)","review":"I really liked this book. It was challenging and revealing with regards to aspects of human thought. What particularly struck me with this book, is the complete honesty that the author adopts when pursuing an area of interest to him. What this means is that there aren't many assumptions, and the author has no following judgment from assumption meaning he is open to all possibilities in circumstance. Because assumption isn't presented, it tends to rub off on you, and you learn with the refreshing vigour of a childs mind. The authors inquisitive nature coupled with this rare gift of being humbled in the face of mystery, and also looking at the way we think and perceive, has made him a receptacle for boundless knowledge. What will be taken from any situation will be maximal from these qualities alone, and his knowledge gained is presented here. Sometimes you hear of the &quot;Human Factor&quot; as a problem in certain environments, well there is no &quot;human factor&quot; here, just a presentation of pursued lines of thought as honestly recorded as can be.

It is to this purpose we have shut our eyes in our fascination with the surrounding world. Our innate purpose is to &quot;be&quot;, in a very different sense than is generally inferred. The attempts of art and of religion to reach man in some new way were attempts to show man this new possibility, to elevate his perspective to see what he may become.But nowadays it cannot be assumed that many forms of art, religion or science are in a state to assist us, because these original attempts to &quot;help&quot; will in time degenerate and no longer act on us with much effect. This is a book from which one can become a bit more discriminating about the valuable aspects of religion and art, and hopefully find a way to truth in some intact form.

That's not hyperbole. There's a reason why it stays in print. Ouspensky was smarter than Einstein (and understood time better) and wiser than the Buddha.

Problem is, while Ouspensky was a well-educated and intelligent man, and may well have been a great teacher, before he met Gurdjieff, he didn't know all that much about mysticism, and he knew it -- which is why he went looking for what he later found in Gurdjieff. After he split with Gurdjieff, Ouspensky may have continued to offer a great deal to his students, but what he offered was his approach to awakening through the system he learned from Gurdjieff, not his own, unrelated musings on how the universe works. The Fourth Way system can be life-changing, but Ouspensky's personal thoughts about Tarot, the number of dimensions that \\"really\\" exist (prove it, buddy), etc., are not of the same inspired level. The book may have been impressive when it was written decades ago, when Theosophy was all the rage, but in the context of what's available in the typical \\"spritual\\" bookstore (any bookstore, for that matter) today, it's very basic, and very incomplete. Not a \\"new\\" model at all, but an antique. Much better to read In Search of the Miraculous, which contains the essence of the teachings he learned from Gurdjieff.

A very good book if one wants to discover where theology went south."},{"Title":"A New Model of the Universe (Dover Occult)","review":"One of the advantages of broadband Internet access is the opportunity to purchase books and to read reviews by other people who have read them. I have recently done this with Ouspensky's \`A New Model of the Universe', a book I originally read over 30 years ago, and which I lent to someone but never had returned.It's 554 pages long. There are 12 chapters, one of which bears the title of the book - New Model of the Universe I and II.Would it surprise you to know that not one of the reviewers actually read the book? Oh to be sure, their eyes all looked at the pages and they saw all the words.But did any of them actually absorb what Ouspensky has written, and did the wisdom, genius and knowledge contained in his writing actually sink into any of their brains?Sadly not! Or if it did, they are keeping it very much to themselves.The first paragraph of page 1 of the Introduction begins:There exist moments in life, separated by long intervals of time, but linked together by their inner content and by a certain singular sensation peculiar to them. Several such moments always recur to my mind together, and I feel then that it is these that have determined the chief trend of my life.Some 20 years later, I wrote an essay \`Moments of Truth' which begins:Moments of truth, or periodic lapses into bouts of ever-greater self delusion? Such is the complexity and mystery surrounding the phenomenon of life, existence and death, that often we are confronted with extreme paradox and dichotomy, especially when our most dearly held convictions and beliefs can seem empty and without substance in the face of hard, stark reality.We can remind ourselves of these moments. We can remember what we were doing, how we were feeling, and the circumstances. We can remember whom we were with, perhaps we were alone. We can remember the events leading up to the moment, and how these moments of truth were revealed to us.Did we see something unique and out of this world? Did we absorb an experience that forever changed our view of the world? Were we persuaded by the thoughts and words of others - ideas that acted as a catalyst, and which crystallised what we may already have believed, but never realised - until now?Perhaps I'd forgotten what Ouspensky wrote; however, the significance of what he said clearly was not lost on me. I just needed to rephrase the idea.The central theme of the book is an exploration of possible answers to three questions:1. What form has the world (universe)?2. Is the world a chaos or a system?3. Did the world come into being accidentally, or was it created according to plan?And strange though it may appear at the first glance, one or another solution of the first question actually determines the possible solutions of both the second and third questions. (Ouspensky's words).Until yesterday, I did not remember that there was a 3rd question. At least I did, but I did not acknowledge its significance.As a non-believer (in God) the very idea that the Universe could have come into being according to a plan is preposterous, and does not even bear consideration.On page 4 of his introduction, Ouspensky puts the question - does death exist?Logically speaking, of course death exists. It exists all around us. My grandparents were once alive, now they are dead. Simple as that.But what about my death? At some time in the future (whatever that means) I will presumably die. But then I ask myself, what does it mean to be alive?The state of being alive is something that suddenly hits us sometime during our childhood. We suddenly become aware of being alive after having in fact been alive for many years.Our consciousness gradually introduces us to the awareness that we are actually alive. Why?Why do we become aware that we are alive, and why does it happen when it does? Why not a year before, or a year later?At some later stage in our life, we become aware that we are not immortal, and is the point at which, for the first time in our lives perhaps, death assumes some kind of future reality, even if it is only tenuous and still far away.There is death from natural causes - old age, and there is premature death - death that occurs earlier than it might otherwise occur were it not for accidents or irresponsible acts of overeating and/or conspicuous consumption of alcohol and cigarettes perhaps.The death of a child is considered to be a far more tragic loss than the death of a grandparent. We might say - \`what a terrible loss, s/he had her whole life before her', for is it not so, that at the back of our minds, we can't help thinking that there are objectives to being alive.Objectives can exist on different levels. On the one hand, survival of the species dictates that some of us at least will bear progeny, so one objective would be to get married and have children.However, when those children are grown up and we are in our 60s, life then appears to provide us with other objectives, objectives that are not so clearly defined, but they would appear to be objectives nonetheless, goals to reach, though what they might be are as yet undetermined.One of the characteristics of being human is that we accumulate a vast storehouse of knowledge, insight and wisdom in our brains.Why?When our responsibilities as parents are done with, we continue to read, to write, to absorb information, to continue to learn about the world we live in, to look for specific information to help us better understand, perhaps to discover some secrets about life that we weren't aware of.Why do we do this?There are two ways of looking at this - in my view.(i) we are dissatisfied with our present way of life and wish to change it in some way. However, this is unsatisfactory for in our hearts we know that nothing we do or say can change anything, except perhaps our own perceptions and opinions.(ii) Perhaps we need to look at life, death and existence from a new perspectiveSince we don't know what death is, or indeed if it does exist as a total finality, can we ask the question, does everything about us die? For example, does all the knowledge that we have accumulated during our life also die?Two things we do know about information from our knowledge of computers. Sophisticated compression techniques means that enormous quantities of information can be packed into databases. Secondly, retrieval of that information is often performed using indirect addressing, i.e. we get the information indirectly via a known location. Suppose the information in our brains is actually located somewhere else outside of us. After all, the source of a radio program is definitely not in the radio, but the radio might be mistaken for thinking that it is (were radios to have a brain)The last 2 chapters in Ouspensky's book are \`Eternal Recurrence' - 48 pages, and \`Sex and Evolution' - in 36 pages.He describes his \`new model of the universe' in 73 pages. Thompson's discovery of the electron in 1894 marked the boundary between the old Euclidean and Newtonian physics, and the new physics of quantum mechanics and special relativity which pretty much destroyed the old physics.Ouspensky sets about destroying the new physics, or as he puts it:I will now try to make a brief survey of the fundamental ideas of old physics which led to the necessity for building \`new physics', which has unexpectedly destroyed old physics; and then I will come to the ideas of new physics which lead us to the possibility of building a \`new model of the universe', which destroys new physics just as new physics destroyed old physics.At some point between 1980 and 2000, I hit upon the concept of \`personal evolution'To hell with evolution of the species or what might happen to the human race in 100 years time. The mystery of the depth of human emotion prompted me to ask the question - if we are capable of experiencing feelings that are so incredibly beautiful, yet we only get permitted to experience them the once, why?The feelings that we undoubtedly must have experienced when we were held in our mother's arms just after we are born, must surely be one of the most profoundly beautiful experiences that humans are capable of feeling.Some of us are perhaps lucky to experience similar feelings in adult life, though we might be hard pressed to connect them with the same feelings we experienced at birth.Logically speaking, this is the one and only life we live, and all that we experience is down purely to luck, upbringing, and who we may or may not happen to come into contact with during our lives.However, Ouspensky draws on what he calls the psychological method as opposed to the logical method, so when it comes to a subject as profound as the meaning of death, looking for the answers from the logical perspective does not help us to understand or to realise what else might or might not be going on.In my writings, I have deduced that consciousness is not an innate property of human brain cells, but is an external phenomenon that humans are capable of connecting with, much like a radio is able to connect with radio waves that form part of the electromagnetic spectrum and extract the signal contained in those waves.In this life, we become aware of the profound depths that human emotion is capable of experiencing. Those experiences may be fleeting and only last for a short time, but they are real nonetheless.Suppose we would like to relive those experiences. In what circumstances could we relive those experiences, and how might we go about preparing the way such that we can make it a reality?Hence, the idea of personal evolution. We hypothesise that, based on all that we have read and learnt and written about, life is a recurring cycle that has as its boundaries our moments of birth and death which are one and the same thing if you understand the true meaning of time. This is where Ouspensky enlightens us in a way that no other philosopher has succeeded in doing.In this life, we get to understand what our objective is, which is to lengthen and to extend the moments of supreme bliss and paradise until ultimately, our lives are nothing but.And the way it will work is this - with each life, the moment when we first become aware that we are alive will creep ever closer towards that moment at birth when we first begin suckling at our mother's breast. The state of awareness means that rather than being driven by unconscious feelings and desires, we can instead use our conscious intelligence to achieve those goals early on in life and thus avoid making so many of the mistakes that we unwittingly end up making (My words, not Ouspensky's)."},{"Title":"A New Model of the Universe (Dover Occult)","review":"Great info from a real genius of the early 20th century... shows why one should not fall for the so-called 'scientific' theory of general evolution.And why most of the greatest thinkers of all ages believe/ed in a higher power!"},{"Title":"A New Model of the Universe (Dover Occult)","review":"In the preface to the 2nd edition, the author has the following to say: \\"The idea of esotericism is chiefly the idea of higher mind. To see clearly what this means we must first of all realise that our ordinary mind (including the mind of a genius) is not the highest possible order of human mind. The human mind can rise to a level almost inconceivable for us, and we can see the results of the work of higher mind, those most accessible to us in the Gospels, and then in Eastern Scriptures: in the Upanishads, in the Mahabharata; in works of art such as the Great Sphinx at Gizeh, and in other memorials though they are few in literature and art. The true valuation of the meaning of these and similar memorials and the realisation of the difference between them and others which have been created by ordinary man, or even by a genius, needs experience, knowledge and a special training of the mind and perception and, perhaps, special faculties not possessed by everyone. In any case nothing can be proven.\\"This \\"higher mind\\" which he refers to is still human. And for that, we are greatful. We can cultivate it.

Is this the Wheel of Reincarnation talked about in Buddhism but not one of being born into a new time in a new body but into the very same ones?If so, then escape is only through recognition of our helpless repetition by agency of increased consciousness as opposed to mechanical unthinking behavior.In this way however history is not changed dramatically, though figures from the past can in some manner \\"disappear\\" from Time, though someone else, a different soul must replace them.Ouspensky extrapolates that there are 6 dimensions, the 6th being \\"All Possibilities\\".Imagine all the missed opportunities we have had, the times when we regret not taking a wiser course.This is Eternity and this glimpse into its meaning is welcoming the reader.In this dimension, the Sixth or Eternity, all of these possibilities STILL exist, the good and the bad.Ouspensky elaborates in his all encompassing way the Platonic view that the Universe is a vaster more mysterious and wondrous place than we can imagine in our current state."},{"Title":"A New Model of the Universe (Dover Occult)","review":"Ouspensky's examination of the fourth dimension and his novel take on \\"reincarnation\\" (that we always come back and repeat our lives exactly the same) are alone worth the price!"},{"Title":"A New Model of the Universe (Dover Occult)","review":"Regrettably, I finished this almost 500 page book and felt my time had been wasted.

I do not usually write reviews but feel it right to offer a counterpoint and a warning.In my view, Ouspensky offers an exotic viewpoint but not an esoteric one, with esoteric meaning \\"interior\\" rather than secretive. He offers that the pyramids and the Sphinx were made by a prior, superior race and merely restored by the ancient Egyptians. He sees value in the Tarot cards. He corrects both Einstein and physicists of both the old and the new on how things really are. He feels that \\"Division into castes represents an ideal social division in accordance with esoteric systems.\\" He equates homosexuality with \\"unnatural inclinations\\".This may have been a valuable book when written in the early part of the 20th century but time has not been friendly to its positions. Better choices are available within this same genre today."},{"Title":"A New Model of the Universe (Dover Occult)","review":"I am appalled. I ordered this book which has 12 chapters.

That's it.If you buy it-- I indeed don't say you must-- you will find yourself amply repayed for sacrificing few lousy dollars. When you die, and the balance will be set up for you-- FOR YOU-- you will be able to say quietly-- put that book on the positive side...Of course, the guy is a little tiring with its constant repetition of how man gets to know that things are otherwise than he imagined and how man begins to see that his mental apparatus and results it gives and is capable of giving are questionable and how man is taught in these Schools to distrust his narrow opinions which he cherished so far etc. etc., comma, deep breath, but you will see yourself refunded for such painstaking advance when you get to the and. Pearls of simple mathematical insight used in what is generally NOT regarded as mathematical region in a way that convinces you that man was a genius, though mediocre writer (though be careful with this mediocrity so called, it is not as mediocre as it seems - just a style of tactful Muscovite who certainly - contrary perhaps to his contemporaries - was not in need to be flayed alive to come to some feelings). I can't promise you that you will spot them, why, I don't know what kind of person you are. But if you make yourself read it despite noticing anything worth reading there it will increase your capability of noticing such gems and it will count just that much more when you die-- and die you will-- to give only two reasons. I must say that the percent of people who WILL notice what I'm pointing out but are on the other side of the scale, recognizing the pearl but not appreciating it in too enthusiastic manner simply because they have already gone further will be considerably lower... but they don't need such reviews."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days","review":"This book is marred by sloppy editing -- the devil is in the details. A casual reading turned up no less than five places where the meaning of illustrative materials or figures thwarted or contradicted the author's intent (and, in some cases, machine logic!) There is one diagram that was slapped onto the pasteboard and scanned to plate in an obvious hurry -- wiping out the top 8 pts of a 10 on 12 pts line of text. Aside from these pitfalls, the book has a chatty, conversational style guaranteed to drive advanced programmers from other disciplines (C, C++, Perl) up the wall. Since only advanced programmers can recognize the many errors, and only newbies will benefit from the chatty style, I can't really give this more than three stars, even though the author is obviously more proficient than SAMS' slapdash editing would indicate."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days","review":"I guess a lot of people come to Ruby with a knowledge of Perl or Java or C++ or some other language, and the other Ruby titles may be better suited for them. My own programming consisted of a smattering of Javascript and Actionscript. Consequently I appreciate this book's careful descriptions and clear and plentiful examples. The book moves fast, has a light tone, and lets the pleasure of Ruby come through. I recommend it, without reservation, as the entryway into Ruby."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days","review":"As of mid '05, this book is a little dated and is a couple of versions behind the current (1.8.2) release of ruby. Regardless, it still covers all of the necessary basics and in a very reader friendly order. The book is said to be written assuming no prior programming experience - however such a book as this is not really an introduction to programming. It does serve as a great introduction for just about anyone with some experience with just about any recent language - such as java, vb, vb.net or c#, and especially perl or python. The writing is clear and applies well towards learning. At times it may go a little too slow for the developer with experience behind them; however they should be able to read the entire book with its exercises in much less than a week with no problems; and be fairly productive in ruby at the end.Like most beginners books, you'll want to follow up with a more thorough book like the Dave Thomas' pickaxe or The Ruby Way - but this is more than enough to get someone started. Just keep in mind that you are only going to learn the basics - if you have several years of practice behind you, especially if you understand the difference between a dynamic language like ruby and static ones like java and c# - then you will be better off skipping this one and going with the pickaxe book (search for Dave Thomas). Otherwise this is a great intro."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days","review":"Ruby is a very cool and powerful language. If you find yourself frustated with old an ugly languages like C or C++ or if you area Perl programmer who thinks that Perl is hard to read (and it is, most of the time) than you should learn Ruby. And this bookis a very good starting point. It assumes no Ruby experience and explains all the basic of the great programming language. I found no erros in the book and the author is really an expert.If you want to learn the more advenced features of Ruby considerbuying &quot;The Ruby Way&quot; and &quot;Ruby Developers Guide&quot; and &quot;Programming Ruby: A Pragmatic Programmer's Guide&quot;"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days","review":"Title says it all. It's a decent book and unlike the other reviewer, I did find quite a few minor errors.This is a good book if you found yourself scared to death of other programming languages. Ruby really takes away the hardest parts of other programming languages, but in turn requires that you memorize literally hundreds of funtions and methods! Because of this it's almost easier to read Ruby then to program it.All told, I learned a great language, but the 4 instead of 5 stars comes from the fact that the exercises at the end of the chapters were no brainers. 15 minutes of typing for the hardest ones! Maybe I should of used a more advanced book, but admittedly, I purchased the book because of the exercises."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days","review":"This book makes it easy to understand difficult topics in Ruby.

But since introduction books for Ruby are limited, I reluctantly decided to give this one a try. I am happy to say I have no regrets about reading it. I am actually surprised how much I learned from it. This book really serves well anyone who is not familar with Object Oriented programming. The author has presented the chapters in good order and provides clear explanations and example code. The only problem I have with the book is the high number of typos."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days","review":"I can't say a lot of good or bad about the book because I didn't get past the lesson where you program a \\"conversation\\" with an old lady. So far, I haven't had good luck learning Ruby or VBA from books or other written materials. If you have the time to spend working through this book, you might want to consider taking classes at a local college. I probably won't buy any more books about programming in general. The format and tone of the book seems very good, so if you've got 21 days with enough time to walk through the whole book, I would say go for it."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days","review":"This book was too dry for me. In fact, I didn't finish it. I like to open a book and look at the code examples before I buy it but, in this case, I bought it online. It seemed to me that the examples weren't very interesting and had a great deal of math in them. When I pick up a book of this type, if a lot of the examples include math examples, I don't purchase it. I am one of those people that is horrible in math and I usually don't get the examples.Since I did not read through the entire book, I will give it 3 stars since I just don't know what is in it (besides math). I went withProgramming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide, Second Editionversion.Again, don't take this to heart that one book is better than another.

The reason for the layoff was not offshoring like many of my friends. It was technology. The company got new technology and all of a sudden I was obselete.I have had other friends and family that went through similar things, mainly because of offshoring and cheaper foreign labor. Job security just does not mean what it used to mean.This book is the first that clued me in on Globalization, downsizing and the business reasons behind it. Frankly, we're all sitting on a ticking bomb and it's somewhat scary. We're in this rat race and like the rats, we don't really stand a chance, unless we change the game. This is what Stop Working taught me how to do.It's empowering because not only do you learn what's happening in the global economy, you also learn what you can do to survive and to even thrive beyond just paying your bills. Because of this book I'm now in the process of starting a business that focuses on the global market and taking back control of my life - business and personal.I'm not afraid anymore."},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"I learned more about business from this book than I expected.

This book is a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"I should have listened to the Bad Reviews of this Book, and not wasted my money.It goes into no depth in explaining how you actually achieve the globalised business that magically creates indefinite cash flow and passive income.The so called case studies that illustrate the concepts are again totally lacking in detail.The Book does not give you anything more fundamental than this vague concept of the \\"Agile Business Structure\\".Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time and money on this Book as I did."},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"This is a truly excellent book. It is a combination of The World is Flat and Rich Dad Poor Dad.

He walks you through all the pieces required and at the end I felt like I had just taken an MBA in Global Entrepreneurship.The world is shrinking (or getting flat) and this book gives an incredible insight on how entrepreneurs can take advantage of this shift in world economics. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"I've always thought of it as a fantasy. To stop working, sit on the beach, travel, get wealthy ... essentially retire while I'm still young enough to enjoy it. I'm not even 30 as yet so another 37 years of working seems very painful. Plus I really, really hate my job (but it pays the bills).I'm impressed with this book because I think it's the future model of business innovation (he calls it Agile Business Modeling). The author has put together a business model (learned from his experience with Fortune 500 clients) that shows entrepreneurs how to operate on a global scale with little or no investment. Much of it is based on developing \\"strategic relationships\\" with other companies. He gives the example of Microsoft strategic relationship with IBM that made Bill Gates the household name that it is today.I found the book very practical because it deals with the various areas of a business as well as financial breakdowns to ensure profitability throughout the business cycle.The book could be called \\"How to Create the American Dream\\" because that's what it promises. The author migrated to the United States at 13 with his parents with no money. Now as an adult he spends \\"only a few minutes per day managing his company\\" with customers from all over the world including various Fortune 500 companies. I want that job!!!Excellent book with a different twist!"},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"Finally, a book that teaches you how to build a cashflow business.

Great reading."},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"The book is focused on entrepreneur-minded individuals that are working and want to stop working while generating passive income.I think this book is very unique because it's focus is how to create long term wealth based on sound business practice. The book covers funding your business, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, research and development. It's not a get wealth overnight book so it does require some thought and effort."},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"The concept is a little overwhelming at the start until you get into the meat of the book. The concept is - why start a small business when it's easier to start a global organization. I thought it was quite ambitious but the author did a good job of breaking thing down in more simple pieces he refers to as business processes (accounting, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, technology etc.). At the end of the book it's hard to not want to just run out and start a business and get your products sold all over the world. Start big, work less, and stop working. Who doesn't want that in their life?"},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"Here's the premise. You can build a business and compete in the global market and beat out brand name products. You can do this from your home and if you do it well, you can build a cashflow generating strategy to allow you to 'Stop Working'.I like the book because the strategy is a bit different. If you read Rich Dad Poor Dad you'll appreciate the Cash flow 'B' and 'I' type focus of the book. It goes beyond Rich Dad because it actually tells you how to do what it claims that you can do.I liked the strategy most of all because I really hate my job and am trying to figure a way out. The idea of selling to a global market is a bit overwhelming but a pretty logical case of presented (using other businesses distibution network).I'm looking at other options, including real estate (somewhat expensive though), but this is one of the best financial strategies I've come across so far that seems practical, logical and do-able."},{"Title":"Stop Working!","review":"I like the focus on global distribution that the book took. It's true that we don't think of better ways to use this global phenemenon towards our own advantage as small business owners.

I was very impressed with the 5 stars reviews which made me eager to buy it. However after I read it I feel this book is a rip off. It has a one good point, that you need to find a larger vendor for \\"your product\\" (which in this author's case this very book - most likely his only product) to produce it, and let them distribute and sell it, and you get part of the profit. The author doesn't give you any advice or instruction on how to actually do it. All he tells you is \\"research\\". This idea was the main point of the book and... actually there aren't any other points, except maybe that it's recommended to buy a computer for your home office with a MICROSOFT software. I still can't believe how he made it into 277 pages book. Good job on that Mr. Hall!

It's the only one I've found that shows how to reach a larger global market. So far we've been primarily selling on ebay and our own website and have been doing OK. This book takes it to another level. I learned how to partner with other large companies; utilize their supply chain network; and manufacture our products cheaper.The book is pretty intense and covers a lot of ground. It starts simply (how to start a business etc) but graduates to selling your products to the global market.

For some time, I have referred to the Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy. This I have found to be particularly helpful. I thought I might find the same with the Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory. But first, what is critical theory? While there are several possible definitions, perhaps the following would make most sense. Scientific theory, in whatever field, uses \\"instrumental reason\\" for the purpose of \\"manipulating the external world\\". Critical theory might be said to be theory which examines the instrumental reason itself.The Dictionary of Critical Theory is strong from the point of view that it is broad in the information it provides. It sketches e.g. both the origins and the outcomes of metaphysics, or both the early and the late work of Jacques Derrida -- and it gives one a good feel for the mood among academics, and for caveats one should be aware of. It is strong from the point of view that it succeeds in reducing vast and complex subject matter to concise and manageable entries -- and it is generally up to date. It also has a very useful bibliography at the back (80 pages).I would consider it weak from the point of view that it is not as comprehensive as it might be. I looked up \\"systems theory\\". Nothing. I looked up \\"axioms\\", \\"coherentism\\", \\"Michael Polanyi\\". There was nothing -- where there might have been, at least, a single-line cross-reference. I would also consider it weak from the point of view that it sometimes seems too technical to be useful. For instance, I looked up \\"metalanguage\\". This, it says, is \\"a technical or second-order language used to describe and analyse a natural or first-order language\\". A dictionary, surely, is intended to be more explicatory than that.The book is useful -- and I would rather have it than not. This is the first impression in paperback, and hopefully future editions would overcome some of the present shortcomings."},{"Title":"Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory Hb (Penguin Reference)","review":"A DICTIONARY OF CRITICAL THEORY by David Macey is one of those books that ought to be held in one hand while the other holds another text on literary theory. It is no easy task to succinctly summarize let alone analyze an imposingly long list of terms, writers, movements, and schools of critical thought, but Macey has come close. Assume that a reader is about to try to plow his way through the denseness that is the thought of Lacan. As a preliminary, that reader would be wise first to read the general background to Lacanian thought before navigating a way between Lacan's distinctions between the Real and the Imaginary stages of infantile growth. Or perhaps that reader feels a lack of understanding of Freud's oedipal issues. Macey is where to begin.Macey's text is arranged alphabetically, as any proper dictionary should be, but this text is more encyclopedia than dictionary. Part of the not-so-obvious problem I have with Macey is the same that I have with any author who seeks to encapsulate all the knowledge of the world on one issue in one book. The question of authorial bias manifests itself not only in what is included or excluded, but also in the even-handedness of its treatment. Macey tends to smooth over any areas of political controversy that arise all too often in a discourse that is fraught with potential conflict. For example, as I was reading the entry on Noam Chomsky, the MIT linguist who has for years been an outspoken critic of both the United States and Israel, hardly anything was written that might cast an aspersion on Chomsky's own biases. What was presented was a rather technical explanation of Chomsky's linguistic theories, a matter of concern only to other linguists. I was surprised by Macey's omission of Frederick Jameson, one of the most outspoken Marxist critics of this century. Still, Macey's text is an indispensable tool for those who wish to learn how words affect ideas."},{"Title":"Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory Hb (Penguin Reference)","review":"For anyone interested in recent intellectual traditions Macey's book is worth keeping on the desktop.

Still, the smaller size does make it even more portable, which is kind of a plus, and for the amount of information that is in here it's totally worth the price."},{"Title":"Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory Hb (Penguin Reference)","review":"I bought this book for my graduate-level course at college named Practical Criticism (renamed to Critical Theory this year actually) and it has been so useful.It has everything in it!

I recommend his writing in both fields to anyone who enjoys reading great literature. The Five Plays included in this volume -- Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard -- are recognized as Chekhov's greatest and most important works as a playwright.The problems I have with the Oxfords World's Classics edition of Chekhov's plays are: (1) the translation; (2) the absence of any shorter plays by Chekhov; (3) the scarcity of supplemental material like notes and commentary. These might seem like minor, nit-picky complaints; however, they become major flaws when we compare the Oxford editions with other available collections of Chekhov plays.In my opinion, the Hingley translation was over-anglicized and thus missing the \\"Russian\\" feel of other translations. Compare it, for instance, with the Selenick: \\"Misha\\" (in Selenick) becomes \\"Michael\\" (in Hingley)\\"Lyubov Andreevna\\" becomes \\"Mrs. Ranevskaya\\"\\"Lent, third week\\" is shortened to \\"before easter\\"\\"peasant\\" is rendered as \\"country bumpkin\\"Here's what I recommend instead. These editions also contain Chekhov's 5 major plays, but all go above and beyond the basic, \\"bare-bones-package\\" of the Oxford edition.Anton Chekhov's Selected Plays (Norton Critical Editions): includes additional short plays: The Bear, The Wedding and The Celebration. Also nearly 100 pages of Chekhov's letters in which he discusses his plays. Also 100-page sections of commentary by literary critics and Directors of theater who have taken part in the production of the plays themselves. Translated and heavily annotated by Laurence Senelick.The Plays of Anton Chekhov: Nine plays total. Acclaimed translated by Chekhovian actor Paul Schmidt.The Complete Plays: Also the Selenick translation. The most complete collection of Chekhov's stage works currently available. 1000+ pages."},{"Title":"Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This translation is a nice effort -- at rewriting the original, extremely subtle text as a modern English drama according to the tastes and limitations of the translator. If you're looking to capture the true genius of Chekhov, try another."},{"Title":"Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I think the truth about Chekhov, if we're going to honest, is that he is just so damn good it's hard to really find anything to critique the bastard. I have enjoyed everything by Chekhov, from his short stories (Lady With The Dog) to his novels and plays. What really stands out to me in this collection is Three Sisters, which I consider to be a masterpiece. Though Hemingway would disagree, I think Chekhov is perfectly capable of depth and fertility of sentiment unlike most Russian authors. Just look at what we have through Carver now, probably because of the influence of Chekhov. One would not regret having this copy of Five Play adorn their bookshelf. I mean, come on, if for no other reason to admire the spine among the other great works of literature."},{"Title":"Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I read The Seagull in high school and decided to pick up my copy again recently. I got part way through Ivanov and stopped because of how inauthentic the translation sounded. Now that I'm an adult and have had many more years of reading works in translation and exposure to the philosophy of language, I see many problems with Roger Hingley's translation.He takes many liberties with phrases and I did not get a feel for the original Russian text, almost erasing all the Russian-ness from it in Ivanov. Do Russians sound like stodgy English geezers? Here's an example from Act III Scene I: \\"French know what they want. They only want to make mincemeat of Brother Fritz, but Germany's another cup of tea, old boy. Germany has other fish to fry besides France.\\" Hingley plays fast and loose with colloquialisms: mincemeat, fish to fry, cup of tea.. I can't imagine Russians in the country side talking like this. In the Seagull, among his many Anglicizations:Pjotr Nikolayevich Sorin as Peter SorinKonstantin Gavrilovich Treplyov as Constantine TreplevNina Mikhailovna Zarechnaya as Nina ZerechnyYevgeny Dorn as Eugene DornSemyon Semyonovich Medvedenko as Simon MedvedenkoLook for another translation instead. This one makes everyone sound like stuffy old Brits (because Hingley himself is British), especially with the copious usage of \\"old boy\\" as a diminutive and phrasing like \\"he's a funny chap\\"."},{"Title":"Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Anton Chekhov was a writer who was able to capture the essence of life and inter-personal relationships in his stories. His writing is simple yet powerful and emotionally affecting. Uncle Vanya deals with envy, male-female relationships, despair, and takes a look at life from a realist perspective."},{"Title":"Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I read Uncle Vanya for an English class at my school and I have to say I enjoyed it immensely. Chekhov is able to capture life and the daily struggle of living in a single stroke. Chekhov explores male and female love relationships, self-realization, opposite sex attraction and more. Chekhov's writing in these five plays focus mainly on dialogue and the interactions that take place between his life-like characters. Anton Chekhov has the rare ability to articulate through his story telling the essence of human existence."},{"Title":"Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Although I only bought this edition because I needed for a class and the School bookstore was sold out, why not write a review? After all, Amazon.com asked me to...Since I only read the \\"Cherry Orchard\\", I'll focus on that. The play concerns an old aristocratic family who is facing the foreclosure of their ancenstrl estate. Their solution? Wait for something random to occur. Neither the matriarch Mrs. Ranevsky or her brother Gayev have any inclination to lift a finger to save the estate, much to the chagrin of Lopahkin and Trofimov, who continually offer advice. It's a quick play, and actually quite funny (according to my professor, Chekov only saw one production of the \\"Cherry Orchard\\" and complained it was too dark, that it should be more comedic).So if you're stuck for something to read this summer and decide you don't have anything to prove in the literary world (unlike me who has decided to read the unabridged version of \\"Les Miserables)...why not read a Chekov play?"},{"Title":"Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"There are only two modern dramatists that are masters one is Peter Shaffer who wrote the maliciously marvelous Amadeus and the plays of Anton Chekhov the best of which is uncle vanya, the best dipiction of real life its tragedy, its joy and its drama.

The fact that many substantial events occur within the short length of this play make The Sea Gull a play that is constantly moving along, and therefore reads very quickly. Because The Sea Gull is so full of dramatic events, however, it is also somewhat confusing when dealing with passing time, and keeping track of when certain events happen. In this play, Treplev is in love with a young woman named Nina who falls in love with a writer, Trigorin, whom his mother, Arkadina, seems to pay more attention to than her own son, making Treplev lose the love of two women in his life to the same man. After Nina leaves Treplev, he gets extremely depressed and when she returns after much time only to leave once more, Treplev commits suicide, ending the play. The events of this play are very sad for Treplev and somewhat depressing to read about. However, because this play does not contain long, dragged-out explanations and descriptions of events and people, making it extremely easy to read, on top of being very well written, I would recommend this play to anyone looking for a fast moving, interesting story."},{"Title":"Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Plays in general have a tendency to be overly-dramatic. Thus the name \\"drama\\". Chekhov definitely used this drama aspect to enhance his plays. He succeeded with some, making them dramatic, awe-inspiring, and amazing. Others? Less so.I enjoyed reading all of these plays, and I won't deny that. Some, however, are harder to read and to understand than others. It's especially difficult to remember what character is which in each play, especially since in Ivanov, all the names are long and complex. While good plays themselves, I constantly had to flip back to the character list just to remember who that is, a problem rarely found in other plays, such as Ibsen's works.The plays themselves are good. Each one has its own charm and interest. They're a pleasant read, but a difficult one. It's not something you can just breeze through. Reading these plays needs time and effort, which may be too much for some. If you're looking for any old Chekhov, settle for his stories, like \\"Ward number six\\", or even his short little stories. If you're looking for plays (not Shakespeare, that is), go for Ibsen. If you think you can handle this, take it on, but be warned that this is not an easy read."},{"Title":"Spey Flies & Dee Flies: Their History & Construction","review":"Shewey clearly explains how to tie these beautiful and effective flies. Prior to this book, most of the information on tying these flies was only available in books by Kelson, Pryce-Tannat, etc. These books are over 100 years old and no longer readily available. Whereas the old books used mostly line drawings for illustrations, Shewey uses copious color photographs, and the close-up photography is excellent.Shewey also discusses the materials used for these flies in great depth, and he gives some very interesting historical background information associated with where and when and how these flies came to be. It is like a trip backwards 150 years in time, and it greatly enhances the enjoyment of fishing and tying these flies. Shewey also covers the modern history of these flies: their introduction into the Pacific Northwest, and many modern patterns that simply would not have been possible 100 or 150 years ago.Now if someone would only write a comparable book covering the Spey casting and Spey fishing techniques, especially how to select or build a double-handed long rod, and the various considerations involved in choosing a reel and line, and a travelogue of places to practice this very old form of fishing, then I would be a happy camper indeed."},{"Title":"Spey Flies & Dee Flies: Their History & Construction","review":"I was reluctant to buy this book at first because I purchased Shewey's \\"Steelhead Flies\\" book some years back. I was afraid that there would be an abundance of repeat material, and too much overlap. I'm happy to say that my fears were unfounded and I have thouroughly enjoyed this book.Shewey does a good job of providing some history of the material used for tying these styles, and I believe it is a nice addition to the fly recipes and techniques he describes (the techniques are one area where there is some overlap with his other book, but they are an essential part of the book). The picture quality is great, and this book (especially in hardcover) could look just as good on a coffee table as on a tying bench. I especially enjoyed seeing different tyers' interprations of the same pattern, and the little variation each one makes.Although Shewey does a good job of explaining the different techniques needed to tie spay and dee flies, to make the most of this book you really need to have some prior tying experience. I don't see that as an issue though, since the complete novice fly tyer typically won't be attempting to tie in this style in the first place.I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get a start on tying these style of flies, or any fly tyer that finds them fascinating as I do."},{"Title":"Spey Flies & Dee Flies: Their History & Construction","review":"This is a wonderful resource because of the info. of the rivers (Spey and Dee) and the organized directions on how to construct the steelhead flies!This book has already been suggested to some of my friends and family!

They deal with not only the changing world, but the movement of Christopher's own powerfully formed opinions and ideas that hem him in an unhappy life into a more, perhaps, pragmatic and fulfilling life. The writing is excellent, and the structure of the story is very well thought out and appropriate. This is one of the very best sets of novels I have read, and upon re-reading, that point is even more forcefully driven home.In addition, Bradbury's introduction is excellent and enlightening, and the whole presentation by Everyman continues to impress. I am glad Bradbury included the fourth novel, though I can understand why Greene did not appreciate it so much.

Here once again we see another Modernist mistaking style for substance, as the potentially interesting character of Christopher Tietjens (&quot;the last Tory,&quot; as Ford described him) gets bogged down in both the plotless narrative and the lengthy, tedious interior monlogues that actually detract from our understanding of the characters &quot;speaking&quot; them. More than a few times did I, a la Samuel Johnson, hurl this book across the room in exasperation. The book is actually a four novel sequence, each one more aimless and insipid than the previous, which means that, at over 700 pages, a more gargantuan waste of time has yet to be found.

The contrast is fantastic."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"Ford Madox Ford is an amazing writer. So talented that he had mutually respectful relationships with Henry James and Joseph Conrad as a young man, his own voice is so strong and clear that he shows no trace of influence by either of these giants.He is also more readable, and while critics speak of his advanced technique, it never gets in the way. His real strong point is dealing with the primal, the basic realities of human life in a way that is very rare, and his characters are unforgettable. Christopher and Sylvia Tietjens are a pair of larger than life monsters, privileged, impeccable, arrogant, and very human. But the range of characters around them is amazing, all rendered with great clarity, and with a humanity that James and Conrad simply do not have. He deals with love and war equally well, along with bureaucracy, stupidity, stoic confidence and rabid irrational rage. For all which Graham Greene paid him the ultimate compliment of one novelist to another:\\"There is no novelist of this century more likely to live than Ford Madox Ford.\\""},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"While this book is about many things, at it's core it is yet another masterpiece about the emotional and spiritual devastion of war. More so than any other conflict, the Great War has produced a number of literary classics in which the war is not treated as an end in itself, but as the pivotal point in the lives of the people it touches. As central as characters Christopher Tietjens and his enstranged and provocative wife are to the success of this novel, it is the striking difference between their lives before and after the Great War intrudes on their affairs that makes for such an interesting read. At first, the war seems almost an afterthought in the plot. The front line action does not appear until nearly half way through the book, and when it does, Teitjens is such a miserable soldier that one gets the feeling Ford just needed the War as a necessary part of the period. But the war experience profoundly changes Tietjens and upon returning home after the war, his relations with both his wife and his supposed mistress change significantly.Love gone wrong, the bucking of social mores, the complex relationship between the sexes- all these topics are addressed with brilliance and subtletly by Ford, who has once again created another classic. While this could rank as one of the great blisteriing Love/Hate Romances in modern literature, it ultimately belongs to that group of insightful and devastating tour-de-forces that so clearly illustrates the horrors of war."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"As one ploughs through this mammoth tetralogy, it becomes clearer and clearer (pace all other reviewers) that all the main characters (Chris Tietjens, Mark Tietjens, Sylvia Tietjens and Valentine Wannop) are completely, irretrievably MAD. Chris, the protagonist, is NOT the \\"last Edwardian gentleman\\". He is, hopefully, the last gentleman who believes himself to be a 17th Century Gentleman, more specifically, the Seventeenth Century poet/gentleman George Herbert.-As he says to himself many times, throughout the work, \\"I have what they call a complex\\"-His complex also includes being an otherworldly (after all, he's living in the 17th Century) martyr who lets himself be taken advantage of time and time again.Sylvia, his wife (at least legally), is a character you'll come to despise more than any other woman I can think of offhand in literature (Maybe Lady MacBeth is in the running.). But she too is mad. As she explains it to herself, all the terrible things she does to Chris, she does so that she will feel on an equal footing with her husband and not feel constantly inferior to his martyrdom and to his code of the 17th Century gentleman as he imagines it.Mark, at first, seems your run-of-the-mill sneak who steals his brother's Chris's brilliant work for the Department of Statistics, and is made a baronet for the work. But, after suffering a stroke which renders him speechless, deteriorates so that by the last chapter in the book, he gives the most muddled prose reverie to be found in it, which is saying rather a lot.Valentine, whom we never really get to know, is, like Chris, a genius, but she too is driven mad by Chris's martyrdom and refusal of money from all sides to work instead selling furniture to uncouth Americans. To her is given the penultimate, mad, muddled chapter in the book.So what is this book about then, save a collection of bedlamites?-It is obvious that, to anyone who knows anything of Ford Madox Ford's life---It is about this life. Chris Tietjens is his alter ego and etc etc-Doubt me?-Read the best biography I know of him, The Saddest Story (1971), and you will be in doubt no longer. Parade's End reads like a roman a clef once you know something of his trials and travails.Still, I can't pretend I agree with the other reviewer's take on this book. There are several dashed good reasons that it was out of print for so long: It is long-winded, the characters don't develop much at all. And one feels, in the end, that one might as well have spent the time reading the poetry of George Herbert to get the feel of what Ford was trying to convey here.Three mad, swirling stars."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"This is arguably the greatest British novel concerning the first world war; the society it changed and killed off forever, and the sheer state of stagnation and disaster of English society and social structure(and that of both her allies and enemies in the great war) that led to millions of needless deaths and the death of Britain (and europe) as dominant world powers; that mantle being handed over to America.From such a simple story of doomed love and repression,Madox Ford is one of only a handful of English writers who can capture the essense of England and push through his message with such force.I expect some readers will find the book a little slow;errudite and jar a little at the couple of anti semite comments made (Disraeli as a loathsome little jew) but in a way that better evokes the era. Europe tried to recapture its lost dominance by using the jew as a scapegoat that culminated in an even bigger tragedy less than a generation later.A true-and criminally forgotten-masterpiece."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"If you care for a truly fine view of an end of an Empire, and what it \\"does\\" to people...you could not do better than Robert Musil's \\"The Man Without qualities\\"Musil handles his character and plot with a disinterested and careful irony. And a not unsympathetic wit. There are several main characters we learn to understand within the confines of their particular (absurd) circumstances. It is just a picture of a time and place. Musil dies before he can finish it.FORD veers from sardonic meanness to hysterical lampooning. Never (seems to me) ever quite catching the right tone. But,then, his characters never grow beyond caricatures. So: What started as an attempt (perhaps)to out-shine Conrad (Joseph)ends up as very inferior Oscar Wilde! (Or Evelyn Waugh) - I was persuaded to work, patiently, through the entire four-novel,novel by other reviews. Ford begins, in the first novel to offer brief sketches, one after another, layer upon layer, often switching perspectives. And without any kind of resolution...gives up and starts the second novel...without ever...And then his third. And never, until two thirds of the way through the entire work, giving up the impressionistic, multi-perspectival sketching, turns to a simple narrative-form summary to launch us into the final splurge. But they are still unformed caricatures.By the last section I found myself scanning, furiously.

It gives a though perspective, not merely a historical one. The characters and the times, their way of looking at a fast-disappearing world are vivid on the page. The literary quality means that you can be transported back into the era without leaving your seat--or searching names and places on your computer. You are a part of the times, and bleed as they bleed. The work is a masterpiece; it reinforces the importance of World War I in our lives. A generation lost, a generation who survive lives in terrible fear. You should not miss this."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"A lot of reviewer before me already talked about how great the book was. I completely agree with them. I also agree it is not such an easy book to follow because of its 'modernist' touch, but not exactly too difficult to lose its readability.Having said that, I feel the kindle version has some problems. I'm not sure if its the author's intention or what, but for times I can find some typos. At some points, I just cannot decide if it is because the word is archaic that I can't find it in the dictionary, or it is the spelling. Morever sometimes when I turned the page, it led to a very strange point in the book, and my progress was lost...Not sure if it was due to Kindle or due to the book."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"I find it very sad that this great novel has again gone out of print, perhaps never to reappear after Everyman had to put it on remainder. Granted, as the reviews below note, it is written in an elliptical manner with time shifts, interior monologues as substitutions for action scenes and other moderist devices which make this book, like the Ulysses of Joyce, for instance, or Woolf's To the Lighthouse, God help us all, a challenge to the reader. And let's face it. Only critics like, or claim to like, a difficult book. Parade's End has never been a best seller; it has never been a modest seller. But behind the challenge is a heroic life given to us fearlessly, without irony or cynicism; a story that simultaneously beats on us and disintegrates before our eyes; and, built accretively, below our consciouness until the final novel, the tapestry of all the dross and glory of our own lives--all this the result in large part, no doubt, of these very modernist devices (while Lighthouse shows us that modernism can be an empty stage too). Tietjens stands with Adam Bede as one of the most memorable and noble characters in English literature. We care about him, which is exactly why the modernist style maddens us here--we need to know what happens to him, to be rushed to the finish. But Ford will not let us. We have to be pulled deep into Tietjens, to experience as our own all of his humiliations, to hold hard and unbending with him in intuitive dignity against the moral folly of others and the emptiness through which they are hurtled. Toward the end our reading slows. He is become our strength, our safe harbor; we cannot let him go. I know of no more powerful multi-volume work after Proust, not Musil, Powell, Durrell, etc., than Ford's Parades's End."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"One of the greatest books EVER written in the English language. Period. (Well, actually, it's four books, but they don't publish them separately anymore.) FMF is a modernist genius in the order of a Faulkner or a Woolf, with a beautiful style, incredibly human characters, and a mind-boggling knowledge of both the human heart and the physical world. FMF seems to be as quasi-omniscient as his noble last Tory, the main character, Christopher Tietjens. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that it's an easy book. Parade's End not a potboiler to read at the beach while you're getting a tan and sipping margaritas. It is a book that challenges the reader to let go of expectation and any hope of conventional structure, and to allow FMF's unique storytelling to settle into your gut slowly. It is a moral novel that doesn't moralize. A book about what it is to be good, to be a human being. FMF's beautiful style is even exceeded by his love for humanity and generosity of spirit. The sheer uncynicalness of the book--especially in this hollow, cynical age--is like a balm on this reader's eyes. This is one of those books, like Sound &amp; The Fury, like Ulysses, like Pride &amp; Prejudice, like Great Expectations, that EVERYONE should read."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"Ford Madox Ford wrote prolifically, with a repertoire which experimented with style, character and narrative across a variety of settings and subject matters. Ford's Parade's End is among the very best of his works. The centerpiece, Christopher Tietjens, seems on the surface to represent a now-commonplace theme in English literature--the &quot;last English gentleman&quot; metaphorically swept away by modernity in the aftermath of the First World War. The first of this set of novels, &quot;Some Do Not&quot;, features an opening passage which is laced with brilliant satire, crystal-clear character development, and a style which is utterly accessible and utterly enchanting. Through the rest of this novel, and well into the next volume, Ford seems to be telling a straightforward &quot;passing of the noble old things&quot; story. But Ford Madox Ford is rarely so straightforward, and these novels are no exception. What seems to begin as a mere bemoaning of a passing age turns into a demonstration of the inevitability, and even the desirability of its passing. Although Ford creates a perfect foil to Tietjens to apparently illustrate the vulgarity and superficiality of the modern age, things are not so simple. Tietjens views his world as irreparably fading, but Ford understands that Tietjens' world may never have existed at all. Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga and CP Snow's Strangers and Brothers novel cycle both try to show the passing of &quot;old England&quot; and the marching in of modernity. Neither Snow nor Galsworthy, though each is wonderful, does as much with narrative style as Ford does here. Ford's novels seem to take a simpler approach to the topic by creating Tietjens, the representative of the &quot;old order&quot;, and his wife Sylvia, the representative of the &quot;new&quot;, but by the time that the plot is worked out, the reader comes to understand that Ford has created a hall of mirrors and metaphors, and nothing is as simple as it seems.This is one of the great must-reads of 20th C. English literature. It's a shame that it's not required Brit lit reading in every college survey."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"How I wish I could urge this enormous, engrossing, and satisfying novel on everyone who, for instance, loved Pat Barker's WWI Trilogy, or Ford's own THE GOOD SOLDIER, or Mary Renault's THE CHARIOTEER, or indeed anyone who cares about intricate characterization, a terrific love story, sweep and intricacy in serious fiction. The love story of Christopher Tietjens and Valentine Wannop, and Tietjens monumental battle with his vicious wife Sylvia and all the British ruling class who prop her up, will enthrall you. Let the Ford Madox Ford revival begin!"},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"Reading &quot;Parade's End&quot; requires courage and patience, and the reader must endure some frustrations. For instance, Ford refuses to dramatize any of the main occurrences in the story, preferring to have them fitfully recalled in the consciousness of one or more of the characters who may be simultaneously thinking of three other things. He is mostly interested in this interiority, and all its accompanying shapnel of thoughts and mental chatter. The reader must endure his disdain of traditional chronology, his vicious portrayal of Americans, and his uncomfortable comments on Jews. The novel is made up of four shorter novels, and parts of &quot;No More Parades&quot; and &quot;A Man Could Stand Up&quot; are insufferable--mainly when he overdoes the interiority and, again, simply refuses to dramatize. The amateur reader may feel crucified on a cross of modernism--for modernism's sake. And when they read some of the high claims made for this novel, they may wonder just what these critics could have been thinking. Yet parts of the book are beautiful and moving, especially sections of &quot;The Last Post,&quot; and you feel throughout that you are in the hands of a brilliant man. Ford also has created some great characters. One could debate the authenticity of Sylvia Tietjens, perhaps--but the cast of Christopher Tietjens, Valentine Wannop, Mark Tietjens, Edith Ethel, and the wonderful Marie Leonie could comprise one of the best collections of characters in all literature. Ford surely thought that the style of this novel embellished its themes, but it also turned it into a fascinating muddle. Despite this, I would urge courageous readers to wade in, and see if they sink or swim."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"Having read Ford's absolutely brilliantly wrought little novel &quot;The good soldier&quot;, and having read the terrible review of Parade's End on Amazon.com, I didn't quite know what to expect when starting on this tetralogy. I am quite sure I wouldn't have liked it at all as a teenager, but as a man of forty years with a wrecked mariage behind me, I find this a deeply moving account of a man's grappling with profound moral issues of love, faithfulness, war and politics. It is set against the dramatic backdrop of WW1, where Ford himself served as an officer in a regiment just like Tietjens'. One may suspect that Ford has incorporated other elements of his own life in the plot, as he himself lived with three women in succession after leaving his wife, whom he never divorced. Ford's style of writing isn't exactly straightforward, and if you are accustomed only to Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum you may find it tedious reading. But my personal opinion is that Ford succeds in doing what his old buddy Conrad tried to do but never quite achieved, if you see what I mean... I do warmly recommend this book to the literate reader who wants to enjoy some truly great literature."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"Essential for anyone trying to understand the birth of the modern world and the destruction of the old aristocratic, agricultural paradigm. Christoper Tietjens is a hero of the old world and is ground down, and nearly destroyed, by the first war and the cataclysmic social adjustments that accompanied it. Ford's style takes some getting used to as does Faulkner's, for example; he works in an impressionistic fashion so the plot line is hard to follow. Stick with it as this is one of the great ones."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"Parade's End isn't the swiftest moving of epics. Comprised of what are supposed to be four seperate novels, it appears unlikely that any of the subsequent chapters in the story could stand alone. It is a powerful book, the story an inevitable tragedy, the results more of an afflication than anything truly humbling. The idea is very precise: tell of what could happen to a brutalized, perhaps incestually based feudal family of the ruling sort when confronted with the Modern Horror of the quick-paced, revolutionized ideas of the roving, buzzing, continually at war world.The Age of the Teitjans is coming to an end--the age of the Old Rich and the Founding Fathers controlling and manipulating everything they come in contact with. The generation of today is gentle and much more soft--Freudian psychology and the threat or embrace of Socialism having done away with the undeniable hope that is the forces of Organized Religion. Women's Liberation, the freedom of serfs and of slaves and the rampant attack of the Colonialists on their governing masters has made a man like Christopher unable to side with anyone other than those most against his past. Parade's End is a story of the future--not just the future in the eyes of the past (this book was published in enstallments from 1924-1928), but the future of any generation of today following the end of a devastating World War. We hear tell of the moral degradation of a nation, of the changing expectations of the populace and the aroused suspicions of everyone, both those who fought in the war and are therefore accustomed to viewing others as hostile and those who remained at home or went abroad to escape the immediate consequences of a world gone mad with rage. Parade's End tells of exactly that: the end of the human celebration and, in the words of Ford's sometime friend and collaborator, seeing \\"even the most justifiable revolutions (being) prepared by personal impulses disguised into screeds.\\" For, as even the elite wealthy must compete with the common man for sustinance, human nature inevitably takes over, with all its crude biases and sexual fixations, giving blood to politics and fostering a climate simply devouring itself for spite and for fun.This book is a grand telling of the doom of empires. It is a story forever of the future as those of any age settling into an accustomed life start seeing the next generation foundering and no longer regret their own mistakes. Now they start to live in the memory of some distant and frequently misremembered past triumph. At the end I found myself struggling to remember my own name . . ."},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"I won't go into details re language, style, structure (see other readers' reviews)--this is simply the best novel I've read since I got through Anthony Powell's \\"A Dance to the Music of Time.\\"Denis JonnesKitakyushu, Japan"},{"Title":"Parade's End","review":"When I purchased this book, I already knew it was a tough go to read, the book is written in the modernist style of the time, a tough style to get used to. Narrative often is not sequential, the plotline seems not to be a plotline, and characters weave in and out, seemingly with no connection.Having said that, there are pages of this book that are so beautifully written that I was moved in a way I often do not experience in current literature reading. Like little teasers, having read such a page, I continued reading hoping to get another glimpse of this fine, fine writer's work.You begin to develop an empathy for Tjietiens right from the start of the book. Ford so completely sets the stage for this character's story that you feel like you know him very well. What he goes through is terrible, his ability and conviction to stay true to himself under the most terrible of circumstances is inspiring.Of course it is a love story, but not the ordinary love story you expect. It is also a fine representation of the real World War I England experienced, and puts you right in the midst of the realities of war in a way that I have only seen done in something like \\"Winds of War\\" by Herman Wouk.I bought the book as a preface to the current Parade's End production by BBC which is just beginning in England. But the book itself is a great treat, well worth reading, I intend to read all of Ford Madox Ford I can find in print.Highly recommend this book to the advanced reader, as I said, not an easy read if you are a lazy reader wanting to be entertained without much mental work...."},{"Title":"Communication, Organization, and Performance (Contemporary Studies in Comm Culture Info)","review":"Dixon's book, while exploring aspects of Organisational Communication in a competent manner, fails to hold the attention of the &quot;lower-academic&quot; reader, also known as Undergraduates or even those below the Doctorate level.

The main characters are Beorn, 12 year old son of a Vikingsea king, and Ness, a young Irish girl who has just witnessed the raiding of her village by the Vikings. Ness is taken captive by Beorn and is forced to go to Denmark with the Vikings. The contrast between the gentle irish farmers and the proud and cruel Vikings is great, but we also see the courage of both races as the two slowly become friends. Ness' christian faith shines amidst the turmoil of constant raiding and plundering. The living conditions of the Irish and the Danes are seen and hints of the influence of Norse history. It is easy to care about Ness, but Madeleine Pollands skillful writing made me start to care about Beorn also. Exciting, inspiring, historical and good literature make this book a good resource for homeschoolers."},{"Title":"BEORN THE PROUD","review":"This is an exciting adventure story that keeps the reader's interest while modeling values without being preachy. My eight-year-old just finished this as part of our Viking studies. He enjoyed it greatly and would read us his favorite passages. I found the historical elements complemented what we had already learned from non-fiction. While this type book is generally what would be considered a &quot;boys' books&quot;, the presence of a strong major female character might make this book more appealing to some of the girls than other stories of this genre. Ness is in the midst of the action, and exhibits courage, intelligence, and compassion. These and other virtues are shown in the characters as traits worthy to develop. Specifically, Beorn learns the dangers of pride and how a Viking chief can be both gentle and strong. A great book - I highly recommend."},{"Title":"BEORN THE PROUD","review":"This adventure is told through the eyes of a 9th century Irish girl, Ness, who is kidnapped by a Viking Sea-Captain's son after the raid of their village. She gradually becomes friends with him after the two struggle to learn of the differences in one another's cultures. Tenacious Ness and prideful Beorn provide entertaining dialogue! While it is not challenging to convince a young man to read exciting Viking adventures, this book was equally enjoyed by my daughter."},{"Title":"BEORN THE PROUD","review":"Another in Bethlehem's series of excellent historical fiction reprints, Beorn the Proud tells a harrowing tale of the 9th century Norsemen. Beorn is the 12-year-old son of the Sea King, Anlaf, a pagan raider who pillages the Christian settlements on the Irish coast. During one of these raids, Beorn captures young Ness, the daughter of an Irish chieftan. Having lost her entire family but little of her combative nature, Ness wins the grudging admiration of Beorn, but the enmity of his rival, the powerful Helge. When Beorn's father dies, Helge usurps Beorn's inheritance and has his eye on an even bigger prize--the throne of all Denmark. Can Beorn reclaim his heritage and warn the ancient King in time?Beorn the Proud is a superb tale of the Dark Ages on the fringe of Europe. The characters are wonderfully drawn--particularly the main characters. Beorn's extreme pride, rooted in pagan conceit, is challenged repeatedly throughout the book and I found his reactions very true to life. Ness, on the other hand, is independent and stubborn, with a sense of humility and Christian piety that is often subsumed by her too-quick tongue.The book is a quick and easy read for kids 12 and up and is deep enough for adults to enjoy as well. The plot is quick paced and the style is tight and flows very well. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"BEORN THE PROUD","review":"I knew NOTHING about this book when I pulled it from our library's bookshelf. We were beginning a unit on Vikings & it looked mildly interesting. Once I started reading it out-loud with my 9 & 12 year old, we truly couldn't put it down. It only took us three days to complete the book. My 9 yr old son had tears in his eyes when we closed the cover for the last time. It was a gripping tale that presented a wonderful \\"hero cycle.\\" The spiritual content added depth and dimension to the story, the antagonist was appropriately threatening, the descriptive elements worthy of modeling, and the historical setting a delightful companion to dry textbook material.Read this book for the simple pleasure of reading or as an historical learning resource. Either way, you're sure to be delighted!"},{"Title":"BEORN THE PROUD","review":"My daughter was required to read this book for her 3rd grade literature course.

The language is so descriptive and eloquent, the plot so engaging- we struggled to put it down! I love the lesson taught as this proud young viking learns where that pride will leave him, and of a God who truly is his help in a time of trouble through the witness of his Irish slave.There is some violence- just to be warned- as it is dealing with the topic of the vikings and they were a brutal people. We love enjoying history with \\"living books\\" and Beorn is at the top of my list! We also enjoyed creating our own viking ship with a card board box and colored it during the read-aloud sessions."},{"Title":"BEORN THE PROUD","review":"Polland, while delving nicely into the setting and background of ninth century Viking Age, lost me entirely with the child-like dialogue and weak story-line. Much of her writing was un-realistic and therefore highly un-appreciated. Her writing definately needs to be brushed up several notches. While she develops her characters personalties nicely enough she then twists them around in odd ways that make the book rather undesirable. The book was rather boring all in all, I would not recommend it for an enjoyable read. If your having your child read this book for school and learning, fine then, It does indeed have valuable information concerning ninth century background, but if you want a nice book to enjoy, this is not the one for you!"},{"Title":"Thunder of the Gods","review":"Having read this as a child back in the 60-70's, I was thrilled to find this gem and share it with my step-son. With the Marvel comic version of the Asgardians (Thor and the \\"gang\\") coming out, he (step-son) knew about the real legends, filling out and giving a wonderful background to the story for him.I recall many times as a child going back and picking this one up to re-read another story and it was adult enough as to not make me feel childish yet still easy to grasp. A definite must have for fans of Norse mythology."},{"Title":"Thunder of the Gods","review":"If you're interested in Norse or \\"Viking\\" myths, this book is a good place to start. It was written for the mid-elementary audience, but the writing is serious and straightforward. Adults can read it quickly and get a decent overview of these great stories without feeling burdened by a \\"children's book\\" atmosphere. For children, there are some very good picture books out there, but this book creates a much fuller literary experience. Its major shortcoming is the omission of the story of the Brising Necklace, which many parents in our culture might hesitate to read to their kids, anyway. Unfortunately out-of-print, this book can still be found used from several sources, usually as discards from school libraries.If this is less than you're looking for, the next step is the Crossley-Holland \\"Norse Myths\\" book."},{"Title":"Kodanshas Essential Kanji Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"This book makes learning and finding Kanji really simple.I've found quite a bit of kanji. The best thing about this dictionary is ALL the compounds. I've found for Kanji for YuGi (from Yu Gi Oh), because i knew the reading for it. I've found the Kanji on Goku's gi in this dictionary because i used the radical look up method. the stroke count look up method would have worked well also because its a really clear kanji.I'd recommend this book over the Kanji Learners Dictionary. Its somehow clearer. Plus you also get the meaning of radicals, which the aforementioned book doesn't do (from what i've seen). This is useful for a chunk of kanji. There are some radicals that have are have meanings that really make sense in the Kanji that use them. These are kinds of radicals are A LOT of Kanji. so you can make better associations in your head.That said, a nice compliment to that would be a book on Chinese character history.

What is your particular situation?1) You are in Japan and you need to decipher the sounds and meanings of signs around you, but aren't really interested in the written language, since all you need is conversational abilities.Then Kodansha's Kanji Lerner's Dictionary (not this one) will be fine fot you, since it writes japanese words in romaji, that is, you don't need to know how to read hiragana or katakana. Also, get a romanized dictionary (for deciphering what other people are saying).2) You are studying Japanese to read manga, or text from the Internet, but not to write.First of all, learn the kana. All manga onomatopeias and a high percent of all japanese script is in kana.Then you might consider either a free electronic dictionary, like Jim Breen's database together with Kanjibrowze, or this one along with Kodansha's furigana Japanese-English dictionary. Anyway, if you really want to become proficient at recognizing/searching kanji, buy Heisig's Remembering the Kanji 1. It can be the most rewarding and entertaining learning experience of your life. Once you know the meaning and correct stroke order of all the general-use kanji (will take you just a couple of months if you're motivated, and one month if you have all day), you can use Microsoft Japanese IME (can be easily installed under XP) facilities to input kanji to an electronic dictionary by means of hand-drawing. This is far swifter than searching by radical or stroke count in a paper dictionary. And with the Japanese IME you can also do these kind of searches. Also, an electronic dictionary is by far more complete than a paper one.3) You want to read/write anything in Japanese and you really want to master the kanji.In that case, get this one + Kodansha's furigana Japanese-English/English-Japanese. An electronic dictionary can't be enjoyed as much as a printed one, and you can't \\"wander\\" over it just for fun. However, get the electronic one for more complete reference. As before, first learn both kana and get Heisig's book along with this dictionary. It will help you a lot in your understanding of kanji composition, and both books complement each other very well.4) You want to understand what you hear, either in anime or real conversation, and want to practice your kana knowledge, but don't feel prepared to start with the Kanji.Get Kodansha's furigana Japanese-English dictionary, not this one.5) You want to read and write Japanese, either on a computer or in paper, and master the kanji.Do everything in point 3. Kanji dictionaries are Japanese-English only, not English-Japanese (at least none I know). Kodansha's furigana dic is phonetically ordered by kana traditional ordering, and it uses no romanization. It also contains useful examples of word usage.CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER ADVICE:Unless you're reading material targeted for Japanese children, you will always need to face kanji in printed Japanese. If you want to read anywhere away from you computer (where you can easily use an electronic dic), you need a printed kanji dic, either one with kana readings (this one) or one with romanji readings (Kanji learner's dic)Kanji dictionaries contain only words written in kanji. In ANY printed or written Japanese text there are words in kana, too, and they're not covered by kanji dictionaries, so you'll need a phonetically-ordered (kana or romanji, depending on learning goals) dictionary along with a kanji dic.Kanji dictionaries are not phonetically-ordered, so if you want to search words you hear, you'll need either a kana-ordered dic (like Kodansha's Furigana dic) or a romanized Japanese dic (depending on your learning goals).-First conclusion: You will always need at least:2 dictionaries if you want to read1 dic if all you need is to understand what is saidIf you're serious about learning Japanese (not just a tourist) and want to develop writing abilities, avoid romanji (Japanese written in English letters) at all costs. Learn the kana.This particular kanji dictionary uses kana readings and has no romanization. This is good but learners who want to develop the ability to write in Japanese, but is unnecessary for those who want to master conversational abilities only and don't want to bother themselves with serious writing/reading.-Second conclusion: This dictionary is better than Kodansha's Kanji learner's dictionary for serious learners of Japanese, because it contains no romanji.This dictionary covers only the 1,945 official kanji. In real Japanese about 2,500-3,000 kanji are actually used. Some publications restrict themselves to the official 1,945 list, but most don't. Then, if you can't afford a more complete dictionary, get yourself a free electronic one to complement this one.A kanji dictionary can't teach you kanji by itself, not even the Kanji learner's dictionary (despite it's name). It must complement a dedicated kanji course. I believe Heisig's is the best way, since I'm using it and It's giving good results.Kanji flashcards, even used with a kanji dic, can't teach you kanji. They're for review only. Same as above.No dictionary can substitute a language course, unless you're an absolute genius and have the ability to decipher completely unknown grammar patterns and verb/adjective inflections. Also take into account that unlike european languages, Japanese usually has no space between words, so you really need to know at least the basics of grammar in order to be able to use any dictionary.-Third conclusion: No matter what you want to read/listen to/learn, no dictionary is sufficient."},{"Title":"Kodanshas Essential Kanji Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"The preface part of the book tells you what all the symbols used in the book mean, and how to read the definitions (e.g., this one [%] is for business terms). It also explains KUN and ON readings (that helps me every time), Jukugo compounds, statistical hints (not a cut and dry formula, because one doesn't exist) about when a kanji is being used for its ON/KUN reading. Furthermore, the terms Gojuon-jun, Joyo kanji, Okurigana, and Ateji are defined. Lastly, it gives a light treatment of radicals, phonetic and non-phonetic compounds, and a kanji learning strategy.Its not a very long preface, though. It is, however, concise, and prepares you for learning Kanji, and becoming literate - not just for using the book. After reading the preface to this book I knew without doubt that i wanted to use this one.The fat part of the book is straight forward. Occasionally I need to read up on a symbol or convention of the book. However, its extremely delightful to use.The dictionary is divided into 14 sections. Section 1 has all the kanji with radicals of 1 stroke, section 2 has all the kanji with radicals of 2 strokes,... and section 14 has kanji whose radicals have a stroke count of 14. Within each radical set in each section the kanji are ordered by increasing stroke count. So section 3 starts off with a radical with a stroke count of 3, then the all the kanji that use that radical are listed under it. The stroke count for the first Kanji can be as low as 3 (or stroke count of the radical) and go as high as 23 (I haven't seen one yet, but it says so in the preface - which i just referred to find out - see how easy it is to use?), then the next radical is introduced (stroke count of 3) and it begins again.All the radicals for a section are listed in a smaller font size down the outer edge of the pages, and the radical whose set (all the kanji that use this radical) you're in has a visible dot next to it. This is a great feature that makes looking up a kanji by radical (or just the radical) much, much faster. Other wise a student (beginner like me) would have to deduce which radical section they're in by looking at a kanji on the page that may contain 2 radicals of equal stroke count. This way also enables an animated like search. If you're in section 4, which is probably the 2nd largest section, you can flick through pages rapidly while following the moving dot down to the radical you know you want.Or if you're at either end of the book you can flick through hundreds of pages until you see the stroke count of the radical your looking for that is listed in the upper outer corner in big bold font and then slow your rate down to comb more carefully. Thats nice.Under the kanji are the readings and, usually, loads of compounds to help you get a grip on the meaning, and exposes you to some common compounds for kanji, plus kanji period. All the pronunciations or readings are written in Kana exclusively. The Kana are listed in the preface without pronunciations. The book requires you know the Kana \\" its a dictionary not a Kana book! You can still use this dictionary if you just want to know the meaning of the kanji in question.However, you may lose one of the most powerful features of the book if you dont know a kanjis reading at least: Kanji look up by reading or pronunciation. If youve seen the pronunciation of a Kanji though (maybe the furigana for it) then youll still get this feature. You can also look up Kanji by stroke count, though honestly, it should be used as a last resort, unless the kanji youre looking for is simple. I dont use it much. Except for when Im trying to find Kanji that Ive seen on my favorite cartoons like YYH, RK, DB/Z. I find all the ones I can decipher correctly from a paused video screen. My favorite feature of the book, though not one I use a whole lot right now, is the Radical table on the back cover.Looking up Hard KanjiIf you see a kanji whose strokes are hard to count (so you cant look it up that way) guess what the radical may be for it, then look in the Radical Appendix. If what you guessed wasnt a radical, use another piece of the Kanji as the radical you look for. Say you found one thats listed (there are 214 radicals in this table and the book). Underneath it will be a list of all the kanji that use it AS THE RADICAL (not just a part of the kanji). Look for you kanji in this list. If youre guess wasnt right you may still see it there because there are plenty of kanji listed under a radical section that it is commonly mistaken for. In this case, the correct radical is note to the right of the kanji. If youre not so luck, then pick a different part as the radical and start again. In your search though, youll likely see an interesting looking kanji that youll want to read \\" youve just learned a new Kanji!"},{"Title":"Kodanshas Essential Kanji Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"This is possibly the most useful Japanese dictionary. It allows lookup of Kanji by Radical, on/kun readings (kana), or total stroke number. It gives numerous compounds for each kanji, and includes rarely used kana readings. It shows the stroke order. It also has Business usage for each character. There is no romanji, so that is definitely a plus. And since it contains the Jouyou Kanji, most Kanji that you encounter will be in this dictionary.

It's learning kanji that's the hard part."},{"Title":"Kodanshas Essential Kanji Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"Some time ago, I recommended this book in place of Tuttle's _Guide to Reading and Writing Japanese_, but now I offer a word of caution: as of 2009, the Joyo (daily use) Kanji list is expected to be revised to include an additional 191 characters and have 5 characters removed, for a total of 2131 characters. Obviously that means that this book will soon be out of date. However, if you nonetheless insist on buying this book, you will still have a very solid, comprehensive reference that is complete with ON-yomi (Sino-Japanese readings) and kun-yomi (native Japanese readings), definitions, stroke orders, example compounds, radicals with their readings and definitions, indices by both radicals and readings, as well as a useful introductory chapter for beginners. The 1,945 characters are grouped by radical and the readings are in kana. There are a few typos here and there as well as an omitted reading, but it's no big deal.As it is, the book is a terrific resource and has served me well for over 1-2 years. However, since it will be outdated by the end of 2009, I recommend that you either wait for an updated Joyo Kanji dictionary or look for a more comprehensive dictionary that already exists, such as _The Kanji Dictionary_ by Mark Spahn and Wolfgang Hadamitzky, which boasts over 7,500 characters."},{"Title":"Kodanshas Essential Kanji Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"Perfect book.

However, you will need to learn kana, because there is no romaji, but kana are very easy to learn and you can find a chart anywhere and learn them in 2-3 weeks easily.Beginning through advanced readers will find this astronomically helpful, especially those with a focus on becoming literate."},{"Title":"Kodanshas Essential Kanji Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"This dictionary focuses on the Radical method, which is the traditional method in Japan. You can locate a Kanji character by referring to 1) a table which classifies the characters according to the number of strokes of the radical, 2) the ON (Chinese reading), or KUN (Japanese reading) of the character, 3) according to the number of strokes of the Kanji character, or 4) by referring to a radical chart in the back cover of the book. I personally prefer to use the radical chart, which is the traditional method and it will help me to use Japanese-Japanese dictionaries in the future. Other than that it is more fun and rewarding than the other methods, like the SKIP. However, you can still go to the other tables if you are in a hurry. The content for the characters is right to the point and not cluttered with unnecessary information, like different classifications, and character numbers. The stroke is also presented more clearly than other dictionaries, and the explanation is given in an orderly manner.This is one source which sets off one on the right track, right at the beginning. It is specially commensurate with the japanese way of communicating messages. 'Japanese for Busy People', is quite appropriate to describe the textbook, breifly, yet comprehensively. It satisfies the needs of the beginner, who might be completely new to the strain of the language as such, differentiated from the common ones, as well as the culture, which is so very necessary and helpful to communicate. The dictionary is structured in a single definite manner, obviating the need to refer to some key to look for words, having sufficiently mastered the basic process. It is needlessly mentioned, that the introduction is indispensible in use of the text, which normally is left behind, in most cases. Overgoing this process, makes the difference of learning smoothly and wholy, and otherwise. If not here, the reader should read and know these principles, before imposing oneself to such a mission. There, one would find amazingly all the foundation of japanese, which is indispensible to build further courses of study on it. All the nuances of the language are explained in clear words, without putting the reader under unnecessar burden, along the way exposing the reader, briefly to the historical aspect. One could find more detailed explanation, but this, as a minimum, is required to pave the way for more elaborate overtakings in the future. Words, that is Kanji characters, can be located in a few manners, each one suitable for a particular stage of learning. The two-page Radical list, at the backcover, is specially helpful to locate quickly Kanji in the body of the dictionary. For each character, the stroke is given, which along the way, enable the reader to learn how to write. The Chinese reading in introduced first, next followed by the Japanese one, and lastly one of commercial nature of the word. The most prevalent compunds are listed and definitions given in one or two words in English, along with the pronunciation of the compound, in Katakana. For Japanese compounds, the Kana reading is given, that is Hiragana. The dictionary is not comprehensive, by no means can it be, the Kanji directory encompassing an astronomical number of characters approaching four figures. A native japanese knowledgable in a few thousands, a novice one can safely get away with close to one thousand. The dictionary adequately satisfies the immediate need of the beginner, in many ways, remote from finding definitions. After a few hardship exercised for a few weeks, looking up words becomes a natural experience, as well as exciting and without exaggeration, addictive."},{"Title":"Kodanshas Essential Kanji Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)","review":"This dictionary is great.

But if you are a student who knows 15 - 1500 kanji, and you can read hiragana and katakana, this is the best choice for a dictionary.Just to correct one thing that Nihongoohanaseru said:The dictionary does list the readings. After they list the kanji, first they list the onyomi, then the compounds, and then the kunyomi (each set is seperated by a marker on the left hand side). For those who don't know kanji too well, the onyomi is the reading used when the kanji is used in a compound.

Kuttner, taking advantage of the G.I. Bill, graduated in 1954, while Catherine Lucille, paying her own way, took things slower and finished up by 1956. And the following year, she capped off a glorious writing career with a solo novel, her last, \\"Doomsday Morning.\\" A companion piece in title only to Moore's 1943 novel \\"Judgment Night,\\" this is a very fine tale indeed. It is a bit unusual for the author in that its setting is not Venus, or deep space, or the distant future, or some unusually named fantasy world, but rather America--New York City and rural California, to be precise--of only 50 years in the future; in other words, around 2007, or right now! The America of Moore's early 21st century has become a quasi-totalitarian regime run by a far-reaching entity known as Comus (short for Communications of the United States). This government department in essence controls not only all the communications in the country, but also the schools, transportation network, the hospitals, the entertainment industry, the military divisions, et al. Howard Rohan, a washed-up alcoholic wreck who had once been one of Broadway's greatest stars, is pressured by Comus into putting on a traveling, open-air play called \\"Crossroads,\\" along with a troupe of five other actors, to entertain in California. That state, it seems, had been rebelling openly against Comus, and activists there had been purportedly hard at work perfecting some kind of \\"Anti-Com\\" device that might miraculously bring about Comus' downfall. The story of how Rohan becomes a whole man again, after three years of grieving for his late wife, and how he becomes involved in nothing less than a second Revolutionary War of sorts, is the story of \\"Doomsday Morning.\\" Moore peoples her novel with interesting characters (all the actors in Rohan's troupe are at some kind of personal crossroads in their own lives), and although the sci-fi elements are kept to a minimum (indeed, without Comus' tear-shaped Prowler cars, the spindly \\"hedgehoppers,\\" a weapon called a \\"scatter gun\\" and, of course, the Anti-Com itself, the book would hardly be science fiction at all, but rather a dystopian action tale), there are numerous thrilling sequences. Thus, Rohan's participation in a Comus raid, his stealing of a hedgehopper, the nighttime fight against some seedy renegades, and a remarkably suspenseful denouement, with the fate of the country--and the very existence of California itself--hanging in the balance. The author even manages to work some nice surprises into her story, as we discover the real reason for the existence of \\"Crossroads,\\" what the Anti-Com actually is, and the reasons for Howard's unusual dreams and psychological promptings. Rohan himself is a very interesting character, it must be said, whose motivations and loyalties seem to be in a constant state of evolution as he sobers up and sorts things out.It need hardly be mentioned at this late date what a gloriously fine writer Moore was; from her very first story, the classic \\"Shambleau\\" in the November '33 issue of \\"Weird Tales,\\" to this, her final book, she combined elegant yet colorful prose with a distinctive emotional flair and one helluva imagination. Her 20-year collaboration with Henry Kuttner resulted in over a dozen remarkable novels and hundreds of short stories, and the team was surely one of the sturdiest pillars of science fiction's so-called Golden Age. What a terrible loss to the genre was Kuttner's early death in 1958, at the age of 44. Moore never returned to the field of sci-fi after his passing, instead writing scripts for such television programs as \\"77 Sunset Strip\\" and \\"Maverick.\\" \\"Doomsday Morning,\\" thus, was her last sci-fi hurrah, but what a fine note to go out on! Like all the other works from this remarkable team, I mo(o)re than highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Morning","review":"Doomsday Morning is brilliant. It's the story of a near-future America that has become a de facto dictatorship under a permanent &quot;President&quot; - who is now getting old, with no clear successor. It's also the story of Rohan, who was once a major movie star but lost everything with his wife's betrayal - and now has a chance to get it all back. It's the story of a revolution against tyranny. And it's the story of the production of a live touring play.The characters are sympathetic and three-dimensional, the plot is very exciting, and the writing...Moore clearly transcended the sometimes juvenile writing of her contemporaries. Although this is a true science fiction novel, it has the emotional complexity and depth of the best mainstream novels - a quality which was her specialty. It's also extremely readable. Doomsday Morning is one of the few books I re-read yearly, for sheer pleasure.Incidentally, it's clear that Moore must have done theatre because the stagecraft rings very true. Her portrayal of the future dictatorship of America through control of the media and communication is also quite prescient.Highly recommended. I only wish there was a sequel, or more books like this in any case."},{"Title":"Doomsday Morning","review":"Born into a world where the USA is ruled by a benvolent dictator, the main character, Howard Rohan, made and lost fame and fortune as an actor in movies created by the official communications organization, COMUS (short for COMmunications of the United States).On the surface, the movies seem to be pure entertainment, modern romances and action films, to help the people fill their leisure hours. But something more sinister is behind the films and the new acting troupes Comus has sent into rebellious California (of course). Why are the troupes touring the state? Why are the actors required to perform the play exactly as written with no missed words or ad libbing? What is the purpose of the giant sound truck that accompanies the troupe, even though all performances are open-air and without microphones? Why does he have a weird dream about the President committing suicide with a device called an Antic?In its historical context, this is actually a very good book. Written in 1957 amidst all sorts of communist plots and fears of communist plots, this book explores some behind the scenes workings of totalitarian governments from the perspective of one person who cooperates not out of idealism but out of expectation of personal gain. It is interesting to watch Howard as he intentionally blinds himself to things that should alarm him and as he rationalizes mocking a loyalty he doesn't feel or believe in. C.L. Moore plays into all the fears prevalent in the middle of the 20th century and shows us that all totalitarian regimes eventually run out of steam as people begin to realize you can't really trade freedom for security because in the end you lose both.It's also a sort of testament to the longing of the human heart to be free and of the resourcefulness of those who listen to that call.I give it two smilie faces."},{"Title":"Doomsday Morning","review":"A couple of common themes in 1950's sci-fi was post-apocalyptic America, and the rise of scientific marketing driving ever-greater consumerism. In Doomsday Morning, C.L. Moore combines those threads with shadowy Government power - which is not quite totalitarian, and certainly not \\"Red Scare\\" stuff - to weave an enthralling tapestry which is just as relevant now as it was 50-plus years ago.The protagonist here is Howard Rohan (\\"How I'd Run\\"?) a former star Broadway actor turned \\"cropper\\" with a sideline in alcoholism, after the loss of his wife in a car accident, which is also how Rohan found out his wife was having an affair. All of that is relevant, and it makes him a pretty complex character at times. Rohan is living in a USA where \\"Comus\\" is now an arm of the government, with the 6-term President Raleigh who saved the country in the aftermath of the \\"5-day war\\" now on his deathbed. That makes for turbulent times, with a government trying to keep control of an unruly populace, and Rohan now a central position to affect events.Everything here is well done: Rohan is probably something of an unreliable narrator, and there are always hints that things may not be as they seem. Comus is not a simple totalitarian \\"evil empire\\": in fact its probably not a lot more corrupt than most governments today, even those of a democratic variety. Sure, Raleigh has been President (or \\"benevolent dictator\\") for a long time: but he was elected to those 6 terms, maybe fairly, maybe not - and don't forget too, that it was only a little more than a decade before the novel was written that Roosevelt decided to ignore the two-term tradition which had been a feature of US politics for 150 years. So there are plenty of shades of grey here, and a lot to think about.There is a lot of scene-setting - both figuratively and literally, since Rohan's job is to run a specially designed play in the hotbeds of Californian unrest - before some poignant reveals and an all-action ending. The whole story is a look at how propaganda and brainwashing, and power and ambition, collide.As you can tell from the title of the review, this was C.L. Moore's last novel: shortly after writing this her husband and often-collaborator Henry Kuttner died suddenly at 42. She never wrote again, and this is perhaps the high-water mark of her long fiction: but what tales could she have spun if she had kept writing for another 20 years, perhaps getting better all the while. But for what it is, this is a capstone a superb quarter-century of fiction writing, and you cant ask for more than that."},{"Title":"Doomsday Morning","review":"A couple of common themes in 1950's sci-fi was post-apocalyptic America, and the rise of scientific marketing driving ever-greater consumerism.

By building up your Adversity Quotient, Stoltz shows that adversity doesn't have to intrude into all areas of your life; nor do you have to believe that your problems have to last forever. By increasing your AQ, you can rebound almost instantly. Everyone stumbles and falls, but now you can learn how to pick yourself up, renew your spirit, and face any problems by taking action that eliminate and prevent the same adverse situation from ever occurring again. This is a remarkably well written and useful book. It is helpful in improving the quality of every aspect of your life, including your private life, career, etc. Given today's challenges and stress levels, it should be required reading for everyone. Even big challenges and adversities - losing a job, getting a divorse, being reprimanded, etc. - will be reduced to little ones once you know how to deal with them effectively and easily. A great book!"},{"Title":"Adversity Quotient: Turning Obstacles into Opportunities","review":"In today's environment of mega changes, it's easy to forget about the most important differentiators of success. Attitude and motivation still transcend knowledge, skill, and technology as the most important contributors to success.Dr. Stoltz makes tremendous sense, and breaks down what is obvious to some (think positive and positive things will happen) and provides the tools to understand and develop ownership and accountability for a much richer personal and professional life.I don't know how many times I've participated in rah rah training sessions where everyone went away positive, but without lasting impact. AQ provides practical tools to move foprward.While others tell us we need to be motivated and have a positive attitude, Dr. Stoltz shows us how to break it down, measure it and understand its impact on us and on organizations. But even more important he shows us how to develop the attitude and personal motivation required to pick yourself up and go at it again, with renewed if not relentless vigor, to learn, and fight again.In today's highly complex and competitive markets the only significant differentiators are an organization's people. AQ is the tool to develop within individuals and groups the power to make choices consistent with personal and organizational goals.Empowerment does not fail because people are not given power. It fails because people do not have the tools to exercise their power of choice. AQ gives individuals and organizations that power."},{"Title":"Adversity Quotient: Turning Obstacles into Opportunities","review":"I ordered this book from Thrift Books.

This is not a score: it is an Opera Guide, one of a series published in association with the two principal London opera companies (Royal Opera and ENO). These books are intended to prepare audiences to evaluate and enjoy opera performances. Each book contains a complete libretto with a parallel translation into English (in this case, the singing translation by Andrew Porter).There are five articles in Opera Guide no.34, as follows:'A Very Human Epic' by Mike Ashman: a distinguished opera director, best known for his Wagner productions; these have included the WNO 'Ring' and 'Parsifal', the Norwegian Opera's 'Ring' and productions at Covent Garden. This essay provides an excellent introduction to Wagner's 'Parsifal'. It does however contain a few factual errors; in particular, Ashman is clearly out of his depth when he discusses Wagner's sources such as the 'Poetic Edda' (for the 'Ring') and Chretien de Troyes (for 'Parsifal').This Guide was completed in 1986, and therefore it is understandable that the controversy that blew up around 'Parsifal' in the mid-1980's does not receive an adequate treatment here. The criticisms of Hartmut Zelinsky and Robert Gutman are mentioned, briefly, in a footnote at the end of Ashman's article.'Recapitulation of a Lifetime' by Dieter Borchmeyer. I found this rather an eccentric take on 'Parsifal'. The author erroneously believes that the genesis of the work began in 1865; whereas Wagner recorded that the initial inspiration came in Marienbad in 1845 and the first sketch was written soon after Good Friday 1857. Borchmeyer also seems to be under the impression that Amfortas is meant to die at the end of 'Parsifal'; although this is a variant seen in many productions, it was not Wagner's idea. Etc.'Experiencing Music and Imagery in Parsifal' by Robin Holloway: composer and professor of music in the University of Cambridge. In this fascinating article, Holloway identifies a &quot;sonorous image cluster&quot; at the core of the work. When so many articles about Wagner are leitmotif-fixated, it is refreshing to read an analysis of a Wagner score in which it is seen as an organic whole in which harmonic and melodic elements are inseparable.'Parsifal: Words and Music' by Carolyn Abbate. An eccentric article (or is it an undergraduate essay?). The reader should refer to his score when Abbate does so, since she often misreads her score.'Discursions into the Dramaturgy of Parsifal' by Gerd Rien&auml;cker. I have no idea what this purple prose might be about! Rien&auml;cker tells us that, at the end of act 2, Parsifal 'sets off into the wilderness with no idea where he is going'. On the contrary, Parsifal knows *exactly* where he is going; he just does not know how to get there.There is also a useful 'Thematic Guide' by Lionel Friend, which contains 69 musical examples, some of which might be called 'leitmotiven'. He omits at least one of importance: Newman's 'Atonement'. Both the libretto and some of the articles refer to these musical examples by their numbers.On balance, I can recommend this book as an introduction to 'Parsifal'. Even though I would have preferred it without a couple of the essays."},{"Title":"Parsifal,","review":"This book is a full score of the opera, printed in Hungary. The paper and paperback binding are good quality, and the book lies open easily. There is, however, no index of acts or scenes, and all the stage directions and dialogue are in German with no translation. The price of $7.98 is a bargain."},{"Title":"Parsifal,","review":"For ISBN 963-8303-06-9, the title is correct. This is a facsimile reprint edition of the full score for Wagner's music drama Parsifal. The back page states, \\"This is an unabridged reprint of the first Schott edition (s.d.), the first print of the full score. The copy reproduced here is preserved in the Liszt Ferenc Memorial Museum and Research Center, Budapest...\\" This book would be appropriate for anyone who wishes a copy of the full score for study or performance purposes; look elsewhere if you want plot summaries or interpretations or critical reviews because that is not the purpose of this work."},{"Title":"Parsifal,","review":"The ENO Guides are well known for their superb translations and, in most cases, the articlea about the opera. This in an exception. Mike Ashman's article is nonsense and is best ignored. He goes out of his way to \\"prove\\" that PARSIFAL isn not a Christian opera bu citing that some aspects are cited in \\"other religions\\". Since when did Ashman become an expert on religion (or anything else for that matter aside from in his own mind)? Maybe he doesn't believe in Wagner's statements but his diatribe is unworthy of this series and is a wonder someone was stupid enough to include it. I own the series and this is one that I can urge buyers to avoid until some edition with intelligence prevails and omits Ashman's nonsense."},{"Title":"Maine Lingo: Boiled Owls, Billdads, & Wazzats","review":"A compendium of the terminologies of lobstermen, seafarers, farmers and lumbermen of Maine.

The story is about an orphaned leopard princess adopted by another tribe of big cats...I won't say which species, because that would be a spoiler. She grows up, goes through the identity crisis thing, more stuff happens. It's a very pretty coming-of-age story."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"One of the better books I have read in a while. Sonny Barger is a real American legend. I love it when you read a book and there is honesty in the writing, this book delivers that. After reading this book I felt nostalgic for the fact that in todays overly litigious world, there are so few men left like Sonny Barger. Men who are willing to stand in the middle of town at high noon to fight for what they believe in. Having just read Michael Tenaglia's &quot;Anti-Hero&quot;, I couldn't help but feel that Sonny Barger has unknowingly influenced, young writers like Tenaglia in so far as their ethical reasons for living outside of the law. In todays world, we need more Sonny Bargers, and less politicians. I recomend this book to all."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"This collection of stories from the most famous 1%'er is a must read!!! Everyone who rides for the sense of freedom and escape it provides, will enjoy each and every chapter in this book. Simple stories speak columes of what riding free is all about. For those who are dreaming of riding, make sure this is your first stop in researching the idea. From the hilarious to the humbling, this book is meaningful and well written. Thanks Sonny for another great contribution!"},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"I was excited when this came out, as I was going through a bit of hero worship regarding bikers. Of course, now years later and a motorcyclist myself, my awe of this life-style has paled.Barger has to be given credit for where it is due. He's managed to make money of the Hell's Angels for fifty years now. That's pretty impressive. And to be willing to openly discuss portions of his life in that society takes guts. However, this book falls short in many areas.One, the few stories that relate to the Hell's Angels are over-the-top. It's just too hard to believe these exploits.Two, the non-Hell's Angels stories aren't any better. The picture painted of bikers throughout this book is that they are greasy, dirty, smelly and disgusting. Even the women profiled here are portrayed as little more than tramps.Three, we're subjected to Barger's attempt at fiction. Atleast it's only boring, unlike his actual fiction book (DEAD IN FIVE HEARTBEATS), which is a fictionalization of his autobiography with some preposterous action sequences thrown in.So, if you're really into juvenille biker stories, this is up your alley. If not, but you want to explore this genre, there are plenty of better books available."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"Throughout the book, Sonny talks about one of the Oakland Chapters members, who he referrs to as Cincinatti. Now, whether this person is himself or not, I think that this person has imbibed in way too many foreign substances. There's multiple stories of running around and talking to ghosts, taking ghosts for rides on their motorcycles, then hooking the ghost up with ol' ladies in the ghost world, etc. There were other typical Sonny Barger hidden slams about other clubs selling their old ladies in houses of ill repute, when in reality, it's much more believable were it to have been a confession. Either way, I really like the quote from Freewheelin Frank in his own book (a 60's paperback, now out of print) where he Quotes Sonny as saying: &quot;When I make money from the patches on my back, I will no longer be a Hell's Angel&quot;. Bravo. And to think, ghosts riding on your motorcycle, eh?"},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"Was expecting to read something interesting about the self-proclaimed \\"legend,\\" but it was a collection of stories whose truth was always questioned, EVEN BY THE BOOK ITSELF. The foreword warned that not all the stories were true. Then, after a more-interesting story, the next story sharted with \\"Now this story is true, I swear it...\\" Lame.There are much more interesting motorcycle stories (and better writing) on the 'Net. This book was filled with swear words thrown in the oddest places, there was no flow between the stories, the characters were confusing, maybe they needed the money and hurried the book to market, I dunno.The Zimmermans' first book on Sonny was much better, in spite of Sonny coming across as narcissistic as he did."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"I agree 100% with the review questioning whether Sonny ran out of material; sure looks that way. The major problem with the book is that, except for a few very good passages (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one) it is just not interesting (then again, I almost dropped it back to 1 after reading one completely disgusting story about a biker's first success with the girl of his dreams; did they really have to include this?).In his ongoing attempt to clean up the biker 1%er image, portraying them as basically good guys who raise a little hell once in a while rather than real outlaws, Barger is forced to abandon what I'm sure would be infinitely more interesting stories. Overall really not worth the time or money."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"Let's face it.... Most of us ride a motorcycle for a variety of reasons. One of them being to live out the fantasy of the outlaw biker. Sonny is the real deal and so are these stories. After you read each of them, you can close your eyes and just for a moment be transported in time to another place. This book is about all of us who seek the freedom of the road. It will give you a sense of just how special our little fraternity of &quot;The Biker Life&quot; is. You will come to know and identify with all of these characters and their lives.I bought this at a book signing out here in Westwood Village, CA. What a thrill to meet Sonny and have him sign my book. The big surprise to me was that he actually talked with me for some time. We talked about his books, his life and his regrets.When you hear him talk, it creates a mixture of fear and fascination with in your own mind. Although most of us will probably never become an official HA, this book brings the experience right into your own living room.&quot;Ridin' High and Livin' Free&quot; It's a beautiful thing."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"Zimmerman's easy read of Barger's memories is a bit of history. One begins quite quickly to realize this history lacks credibility. Barger has reinvented the story of the gang-beating of Hunter Thompson. Skip Workman himself admitted in a 1967 television interview that women once in a while needed to be beaten like a rug. A woman's beating is the reason Thompson expressed his disapproval and was subsequently beaten (Workman's comments were specific to the Thompson beating). Barger softens the story in the book, as part of his overall attempt to change the reputation of the club and make them appear to be heroes. Barger further hopes to canonize himself through this self-fashioning. Once this credibility is broken, one cannot help but question the account of Barger's wife's accidental death while attempting to self abort. Barger freely admits he did not want children. As long as you are ready to indulge the over 60 Barger's attempt to use this quick read to convince you he is an American hero (he supported the Vietnam war), take a peek, it won't take much of your time."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"What a blast! Some of the stories are a little long in the tooth, but, like the preface says, who cares??? As long as they're entertaining, which most of them are. A few are outright boring, but the gems more than make up for them. Nice short stories, so you can leave it and pick it up as you wish. Well recommended!"},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"Although this book was entertaining, it is hardly the best book out there for tales of 'cyclers. I did enjoy the tale of the poor girl who got [...] on a Panhead that was trash. And the story about the guy who picked up a ghost was entertaining, even if it was hardly believable. Many of the stories were just too short and seemed to have no point. I point here in example the story about the kid who saw a bunch of 'cyclers going to a funeral. Big whoop. Keeping to stories of adventure would have been better, but many of these stories do't even fit the subtitle \\"Hell-Raising\\".

It's one damn good read!!"},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"This isn't really a biography, but more of a collection of stories from Sonny Barger. A lot of them are very funny, and some of them are tales from the road that would make anyone want to hop on a motorcycle. The problem with this book is the introduction when Sonny Barger tells you that some of the stories may be true, and some of them may not be true. He leaves it up to you as you read, but either way the stories are fun to read, and some of them will have you laughing for quite awhile. He even goes outside of the Hell's Angels into other clubs he's aware of and other people he knows sharing stores from them, one of them was on the Dragons leader who was about to buy a Honda until his club members knocked on his door and asked him if it was true."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"Jeez, aside from about 30 pages of goodness about Steve Mcqueen and a few old-time H/A stories-which are told using lame-o aliases and seem to be recalled through a certain haze...this is just a steamin' pile of crap. Crap I could hear if I went to the gaywad leather bar in my town. What can I say, I have all the respect in the world for Barger, the H/A's, whatever, but I didn't pay money to read about a yuppie's BMW road trip. Seriously.I just expected better from somebody who has better stories than this (really, he's gotta have better stories...Son-come on, you don't have better than this??). I just kept thinking that Barger just really didn't want to be doing this, and it came down to these two nutsucker ghost-writers grasping at straws."},{"Title":"Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories","review":"This is one of the best books I have read on the biker lifestyle.

Behind the well-designed pulp-ish cover of \\"Ridin' High, Livin' Free,\\" rebels rule, Barger's book calls out, like drag pipes tearing through town, custom painted gas tanks a glint in your girlfriend's eye. Here's the raw, street-wise tone Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett made famous, from tattoos and tears to biceps and the poetry of the search, American style, like Route 66 it never ends. Anecdotal ironies abound, the mystique, the myth, the clubhouse fish tales, stories of life, the other side of life, just trying to get though life, hang on to your life, get out and ride to save your lifea little sympathy is ok, but don't complain. Don't be afraid to pick up this book, mainstream middle class sensibilities need to be stomped. Professors, assign it for your Literature of the Deviant class. These tales are for and about those who can still think for themselves. And if you like documentary photography, some of these photos helped create the archetype.

I was wrong; really wrong.This book is a loose string of stories--some interesting, some boring. The thing that really impacted me as a reader is the poor prose. Even with two \\"with\\" writers/editors, it reads like a series of remedial essays. Mix in the justifications, sexism, and plain hostility and it's just sad and a waste of time and money.There's no way I'd read the other book (Hell's Angels) now.

It's not a &quot;Dictionary of Religion&quot;, however--each entry is about 100 pages long. Nevertheless I recommend it to those whose interests in religion are at that point where vague encyclopedia entries etc. give too little information, and detailed, focused studies give too much."},{"Title":"A New Handbook of Living Religions: Revised Edition (Penguin Reference)","review":"This book gives very good articles on all the world's main religions and they are usually written by practitioner's of these religions who also tend to be scholars. Encyclopaedic, imbued with rigour, candour and a dash of faith which is essential in avoiding an all too objective and critical approach.The article on Buddhism in this book is one of the best if not the best I've encountered. It does not repeat the date of the Buddha as earlier than the 5th century BC (making Buddhism 2400 years old rather than the oft quoted 2500 years old), and does not begin to talk about Buddhism by describing the 4 noble truths, like lesser books would.This article should be read, by those who want to have the low down on Buddhism including beginners and those with a deeper interest, and it captures the essence of Buddhism in a hard to beat nutshell.The author, Mr Lance Cousins was due to write a whole book on Buddhism for Penguin, but this project was scrapped as he was too busy, and had to do an Abhidhamma translation. This is probably the next best thing. His students, Peter Harvey and Rupert Gethin have turned out introductory books on Buddhism which are pretty good, and these testify to the depth of Mr Cousins knowledge on the subject."},{"Title":"Unifying the Universe: the Physics of Heaven and Earth","review":"Science, literature, art, history are all combined in this wonderful, easily read, book.

The pictures are well-chosen and add greatly."},{"Title":"The Wizard King: & Other Spellbinding Tales","review":"This book contains nine folk and fairy tales from nine different cultures. The stories are printed in a medium size type and with simple, yet bright and inviting fantasy pictures, it is an open invitation to children to expand their reading skills while being pleasantly entertained. These stories are sufficiently obscure to seem brand new to young readers and so provide a wonderful sense of discovery as well as a fun journey through the realm of make-believe. The tales come from the British Isles, Europe and Russia, the Mediterranean and also two from the treasure-house of North American Indian lore. John and Caitlin Matthews are brilliant scholars of folk history and of magical lore and their choices of these nine stories provide a beautiful opportunity to experience lesser known folk tales that are filled with magic and wisdom. Having been fortunate enough to visit the ancient stone circle in England called the Rollright Stones, my personal favorite story in this collection is &quot;The Witch of Rollright&quot; that tells how the ring of stones came to be standing where it is now located. The illustrations for this story include fairies dancing at the feet of the beautiful witch who kept the land safe from a would-be conquerer. The text contains tidbits of folklore concerning the offering of milk to the fey and the significance of the elder tree in pagan lore. All the stories have similar indigenous imagery. This is not your average fairy tale book but instead the Matthews have faithfully delivered gems of wisdom and whimsy from the simple people who lived with and understood these concepts as part of their daily lives.

The non-fiction ones. They come with DK's expected usual style and excellent photography. The story is told in a simple narrative style making it interesting and informative. There are occasional fact boxes with extra bits of information about a topic mentioned on that page. Though my son refuses to read these, saying they are my part perhaps because of the slightly smaller text size. This book examines the different type of animals a vet may see as two boys take a duck with a hurt wing to the local vet, who fortunately finds it hasn't been broken. The boys also see other animals taken care of: a rabbit, 5 kittens, a goose, a snake, a horse and witness a dog brought in who was hit by a car and the vet has to go straight to surgery to fix his broken leg. Quite a lot of activity and probably a wider variety of animals than the normal town vet sees but certainly educational on small animal complaints.

They include: the novel as literature, reaction to the novel in California, in Oklahoma, war-torn Europe, and throughout the USA; the author's dedication to the plight of the Okies that preceded and followed The Grapes of Wrath, local, state &amp; federal government reaction, the movie, Hollywood's reaction to the movie, natural history of Dust Bowl from perspective of geologic time (did you know, the Dust Bowl was NOT caused by overfarming: there's a geologic record that the Dust Bowl phenomenon is a regular occurance.

This book's goal is not to teach you how to totally design and program a database from scratch. Its purpose is to familiarize readers with the various methods of designing and interacting with databases. The coverage of SQL is well done. Yes, there is more to it than what the book covers, but most of those details vary from DBMS to DBMS. Also, the ER diagram is covered well, although I would have appreciated a few more problems and examples that give the student practice in constructing a diagram from scratch. The much-maligned SOM was for me a good alternative perspective. Maybe it isn't used as much in industry, so what? It still helps the introductory student grasp the underlying concepts and think outside of the box. The later chapters are not extensive in their coverage of xml, asp, and the like but they don't have to be. Remember, this is NOT a book about any specific language.

The course lasts only eight nights. Therefore, many chapters could not be covered. The use of MS Access 2003 or 2007, is crucial for success. Students did excellent jobs.Database is not easy to learn. The percentage of US workers that know MS Access, is less than 1 percent.

It teaches you things you might have missed if taught informally, such as database normalization and the use of various keys.For what it claims to be, it suits the job quite well, and is very detailed in how it describes database design and common pitfalls.Again, this is not a dedicated programming book, and only teaches design concepts and standards."},{"Title":"Database Processing (Fundamentals, Design, and Implementation)","review":"Ridiculously overpriced, even for a textbook.

This book is a nightmare! I'm currently using this book for class.The author contradicts himself not only from chapter to chapter but within individual paragraphs.He spends entirely too much time on simple ideas and breezes through complex ones.I find myself reading through paragraphs thinking, \\"Oh, he's still talking about that? Why is he still taking about that?\\"Then the next paragraph, \\"What the hell is he talking about!?\\"His sentences are wordy and complicated. He has forgotten the basic structure of the English sentence. That being: Stick to one subject per each, please. Throughout these verbose outbursts, he combines terms that are so similar they cause confusion. As an example:\\"The physical description of a semantic object domain is just a reference to the semantic object description.\\"This gem of a sentence is halfway through Chapter Four. However, since this book is so poorly thought out and written, I still don't know what any of those terms mean or refer to.If I knew what he was talking about, I would rewrite that sentence. However, I don't. So I've given up reading and am now writing a scathing review. What does that tell you?Thankfully, there are many figures scattered throughout the book to attempt to clarify what the author can't seem to. Unfortunately, none of the figures being refered to are ever on the same page. The student must read the sentence, flip the page, try to remember what the author was rambling about, flip back, ... you get the point.All in all, this is the most miserable textbook I have ever read.

Whew! But Kroenke's text is comparable in price (when purchased new) with its major competitor, Hoffer, Prescott, and McFadden's 7th edition (HPM), with which I will compare Kroenke's text below. (HPM is by the same publisher; eventually all textbooks will be sold by only one publisher!) To help with the price, I will not ask my students to buy a supplementary text for the database we choose to use, but will provide a few on library reserve.Kroenke's text is geared more to the computer science major than to the business information systems major. For example, Kroenke recognizes that mySQL is now industrial strength, and so includes a discussion of it. For example, HPM is 700 pages of fine print, busy diagrams, and wordy explanations some of which talk down to the student (\\"A 'term' is a word or phrase that has a specific meaning for the business\\"). Kroenke's is 675 open, clearly written, succinct pages. At my college there is a sequence of courses for databases, another sequence for software engineering, and a third sequence for system analysis. HPM tries to do some of all of three of these topics, thereby diffusing a database focus. Kroenke's text by contrast is focused. In fact, the apparently comparable length to HPM is misleading, because which end chapters you read in Kroenke depends on the database you choose.As the publisher's blurb says, Kroenke made a wise decision to introduce (easy) SQL early. And I add that Kroenke continues to introduce hard SQL later, such as nested EXISTS for the computer science major. HPM introduces SQL later, and only the easy parts.XML is becoming increasingly important to database users. Kroenke's treatment of XML is adequate; HPM's treatment is cursory.The chief advantage of HPM over Kroenke is the consistent use of a really excellent Mountain View Community Hospital project from beginning to end, providing continuity and depth.I have been using Kroenke since the first edition. (I missed only the second and ninth editions.) So this is a biased review, in which it is hard for me to shake my history of good experience with previous editions.I am among those sad to see that Kroenke's Semantic Object model didn't catch on, but given that it didn't, I'm glad that he finally relegated it to an appendix.I am glad that Kroenke's text can be purchased for only $8 more with a CD containing Oracle or SQL Server, although I will use mySQL.In short, I'm still a member of the Kroenke fan club.--Gene Chase"},{"Title":"Database Processing (Fundamentals, Design, and Implementation)","review":"This is really not a critique of the material in the text since I consider it adequate as a beginners guide to database concepts. Due to my limited experience with database texts I cannot comment more on the actual material, but having read many other technical texts, I can say that the material and the examples provided are laid out poorly. The text will explain a concept, but if you are truly new to this subject, you will find yourself repeatedly flipping back and forth by a few pages to the examples and diagrams that they refer to.

I bought it because it discusses a plantation that was in our family back in the 1800's. The entire book is very interesting to read."},{"Title":"Old Louisiana","review":"I have no particular gripe with Lyle Saxon -- I only encountered this book for some quick lexicographic research -- but readers should be cautioned that, in the lengthy excerpt I read, his is a thoroughly untroubled view of the legacy of slavery, and the black characters are presented largely as happy, childlike simpletons absolutely deferential to and enamored of their benevolent white superiors, albeit with dangerous impulses toward inexplicable violence among themselves.Those who have encountered the \\"Happy Darky\\" stereotype before will likely cringe, for instance, when reading about the impoverished, uneducated black characters, including adults and an elderly man, gleefully falling over one another in the \\"hunting Santa\\" episode, in which a white woman of the plantation house has strewn sprigs of mistletoe for which the black characters hunt, many making hound-dog noises, in pursuit of \\"Santa\\" (a white woman in disguise). When they see her, many of them wail and scurry away in terror, until eventually one grown woman tentatively approaches for her stocking of fruit, nuts, &c.; -- which are cast as evidence of the absolute beneficence and humaneness of the wealthy white dwellers of the manor house.The nostalgia for slavery and the Jim-Crow world that prevailed for almost a century thereafter is unmitigated and ultimately creepy, made more so by the second-person narration, which places the reader among the good-hearted privileged white folks being served hand-and-foot by the black characters. For some reason I feel I should point out defensively that I am from the rural South, but it really shouldn't matter.Ultimately, Saxon's portrayal of race relations doesn't appear hateful, but the miasma of nostalgia seems to make him thoroughly unreflective on the subject, not altogether unlike William F. Buckley's reveries about his childhood of wealth and privilege, and how he grew up dreading and resenting changes to his lovely and pleasant way of life, never much interested in reflecting, so far as I've read, on how his inherited privilege was predicated on the disadvantages of folks not of the yacht-and-ponies set.It's largely unfair to compare Saxon with more important white Southern authors such as his contempraries Faulkner, Welty, Caldwell, and later O'Connor, but a moment's reflection on their more serious and conflicted engagement with the South's racial heritage will show how the sweet, elegiac nostalgia of Saxon's book is missing some key ingredients."},{"Title":"Old Louisiana","review":"I'm pleased to find this book has been reprinted. I have found it to be most interesting and helpful to coincide with dates and history of Louisiana and compare those to my own geneology at the time my ancestors lived there. Mr. Saxon's love for this historical and diversed state and its people is very evident."},{"Title":"Empty saddles, forgotten names: Outlaws of the Black Hills and Wyoming","review":"For approximately a decade, the western was a mainstay of the commercial television networks and the western novel is still a very popular form of light reading. However, neither really presents the west as the way it was, or when it does, is not taken seriously. For years, I have been astounded at the public perception of Kitty Russell on \\"Gunsmoke.\\" From the first episode, we see the girls working in the Longbranch escorting men up and down the stairs. It should be obvious to any sensible adult that they are prostitutes and Kitty is a madam of the sex industry. Nevertheless, she was always perceived favorably by the viewing public, which collectively wished that the series would end with Matt and Kitty getting married.This book is an attempt to present some of the outlaws of the American west as they truly were. Due to the presence of the gold fields, one of the wildest regions of the west was centered on the Black Hills of South Dakota. Outlaws converged on the region, trying their hands at robbing the stagecoaches that transported money and gold. Engebretson digs deep into the records of that time in an effort to present an account of the battles between the law and the outlaws that is factually correct.The most striking thing that repeatedly occurs is the outlaw breaking jail without major consequences. Nearly every single one was arrested and placed in confinement, only to break out and continue their criminal careers. The trials of the men often concluded with an acquittal, even when the evidence against them was strong. From the newspaper clippings of their escapades, you can see some of the aspects of the public fascination with those who robbed from the rich. If you read them carefully, it is possible to discern the seeds of what has become the modern perception of what life was like in the west. Some of the outlaws were lynched, many were killed in their line of work and others became respectable and started normal lives.The most bizarre end came to an outlaw known as \\"Big Nose George.\\" After he was lynched in 1881, the top of his skull was cut off and a death mask made. Even more grotesque was the removal of some of his skin by a Dr. Osborne, who had it tanned and turned into trim for his medicine bag and a pair of shoes. The death mask and the shoes are on display in a Wyoming museum. The top of his skull ended up in the hands of Dr. Lillian Heath, who used it as a doorstop and the infamous Dr. Osborne was elected governor of Wyoming in 1893. If this is not a case of the truth being much better than the fiction, then I have never seen one.I personally prefer the historical accounts of the American west to those where poetic license has turned them into distortions of what really happened. This is one of the best accounts of one of the wildest places in the west and I commend Engebretson for making what was clearly an enormous effort to get his facts and stories right."},{"Title":"Empty saddles, forgotten names: Outlaws of the Black Hills and Wyoming","review":"This book is full of great details about outlaws of the Black Hills and Wyoming. Great read. Doug has done a lot of research and it is very informative. I got my book from the Booktrader & More & it was autographed, too. (This is not the cover that was on the printing of my book.)"},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"This book's cover says it all: when two type-A personalities meet, sparks fly! These characters were so real they could have been people I knew. Andrea is feisty and refuses to be bested by Ian, no matter how sexy and good-looking he is! And the story is crazy and cute. Well worth the small price tag. If you like boy-meets-girl comedies, I recommend this book for a few hours of fabulous fun. I'll be looking to see what else Donna Fasano wrote. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"The romance genre isn't one I've read much. Chick-lit is another matter. I've been willingly reading it for years. Six months ago I couldn't have told you the difference except for the \\"romance\\" books I read - yes, I thought chick-lit and romance were the same - I would sometimes find among the non-genre specific titles in my local supermarket's paperback section. Those I didn't read (the actual romance books) were in their own section. By the time I'd noticed the publisher's imprint was \\"one of those\\" the description would already have me hooked.Lately I've read a few of the romance genre and those I've read have not been what I had pictured. I thought I'd find cardboard characters, completely implausible or simplistic plots, and, if I was lucky, a bit of titillation. I haven't, at least not the first two.I'm still getting used to the conventions and terminology of the genre. Let's tackle my preconceptions as they pertain to \\"Taking Love in Stride.\\"We'll start with characterization. Andrea, the Heroine (\\"female lead\\" in the romance genre) is what you might expect of a female track coach. Feisty, prone to snap judgments, and cleans up nice. That works so far. Ian, the Hero (I think you can figure this one out) is attractive, used to being in control, and a single father. A book needs conflict and I'll bet that from my thumbnail descriptions you can see it coming already. Then we throw in Ian's dad, who lives with him and watches his granddaughter during Ian's frequent business trips and we have the major players. Each has a distinct personality and idiosyncrasies that work well moving the plot forward. This is the third book of Clayton/Fasano's I've read and, in my estimation, characterization is a strong suit. She seems to have an insight into what makes different people tick that translates well to her characters.The plot isn't complex like a good mystery or many suspense novels if for no other reason than this book is much shorter - I'm guessing genre conventions for romance dictate a length around half that of many genres. However, the plot is not simplistic. The story is realistic. (We've all had bosses like Andrea's principal and had people we were attracted to and infuriated by, haven't we?) It's fun, at least for those of us who are voyeurs - I might feel different living it. The results, however, are worth it for Andrea and Ian. The \\"happily ever after\\" ending is, from what I understand, another genre convention. Letting that slip isn't a spoiler.As for titillation, not so much. It turns out that romance novels run from relatively innocent (suitable for teens) all the way to borderline erotica. This one is more warm than hot. However, for a relatively quick read and a chance to laugh at other people's foibles (possibly much like our own) this book does the trick.**Originally written for \\"Books and Pals\\" book blog.**"},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"Put on your running shoes for a fun run with Andrea and Ian as they jog down Lover's Lane. Of course, Andrea spurns the word \\"jog,\\" being a serious runner and high school coach. Her first impression of single-dad Ian isn't very favorable. He reminds her too much of her own work-driven father. But circumstances bring these two together as she coaches him for a marathon. Soon, they're both wondering if it's more than running that makes their hearts race. Donna Fasano proves again that she is a solid romance author, delivering a well-paced story with appealing lead characters and a true-to-life supporting cast. In the end, everybody is better off for the lessons they've learned and the love they've discovered. You'll want to dash for this one!"},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"Very cute story about a women who shuns loving a certain kind of man becuse of her father and what do you know she falls for his type anyway. Cute interaction between Andrea and Ian, as well as Andrea and Ian's daughter Denise. Cute romance read."},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"Every now and again I like to have a couple of squares of really good dark chocolate or a split of Asti Spumante. Some women like to go shopping for a new scarf or a purse. I guess it is just one of those \\"chick\\" things. Sometimes, I like to curl up with a good romance.A good romance to me is one where I can become emotionally invested with the characters. It isn't about erotica but some sexual tension is always good.Taking Love in Strideis the perfect little treat I was looking for. I look forward to reading more from Donna Fasano. Now I just need to go out and get some chocolate and Asti."},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"I enjoy Donna Fasano's writing and this book met the high standards that I have come to expect. I particularly enjoyed this book because of the running theme. I am a runner and have participated in 1/2 marathons. I was impressed that the author was able to capture all the aspects of running and able to add humor in as well. Donna Fasano's characters in this book were believable and at times down right funny. I would recommend this quick read for anybody that is looking for a bright spot in their day!"},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"I received this book free in a drawing. I normally read dystopian or paranormal YA books. I am definitely happy to be introduced to this story and author. I will love to read her other books.

I'm happy to say that this one is no exception in the enjoyment department! It's a great read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"I just finished reading this book, which I purchased from Amazon for my Kindle. Andrea is a track coach at high school. She's dedicated to her runners so right there, the author has me. I am a huge fan of Friday Night Lights, so I couldn't help but compare Andrea to Coach Taylor. Like him, she's not just their coach, but their mentor, and if something is going on in their personal lives that affects their running, she's ready to help and give advice. It gives the character a depth that goes beyond the ordinary romance book heroine.The father of one of her runners, Ian, is a very successful businessman. As a single parent, he's doing the best he can and in his eyes, being a good provider is what a father does. He wants to give his daughter, Denise, everything, but what he doesn't realize is that what she really wants and needs is his time. He's a flawed character, but very likable because it's always apparent that he loves his daughter.When Andrea confronts him with her concerns about his daughter, sparks fly! That's just how it should be in a romance book and Ms. Fasano accomplishes that quite well, as the chemistry between the characters is always just sizzling under the surface ready to react.Denise is the catalyst that brings them together, but what I like is that she's not one of those bratty teens who then resents any attention their parent has in the opposite sex. She's not perfect and there are other conflicts, but the way they are worked out is a nice subplot.The writing is tight. Formatting was great on my Kindle and on my Android phone app, and I saw not a single typo.All in all, this is a great light romance with believable characters who come to life on the page. A perfect summer read so take this one to the beach with you! Five stars."},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"Andrea, a high school track coach, has trust issues when it comes to men, especially dominant, assertive men who remind her of her father. And Ian appears to be one of those men. They meet when Ian goes over her head to her boss, demanding that his daughter Denise be reinstated on the track team. What Ian doesn't know is that his daughter doesn't want to be on the team. She would rather work on her art, but her father spends so much time away on business he isn't aware of her wants or needs. What Ian is aware of is Andrea, and she feels the same strong attraction to him, but she plans to keep things purely business-like. She will not be hurt by this man, so clearly like her father. Both Andrea and Ian have lessons to learn. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. The characters are easy to like and I felt close to each one. I finished the book with a contented smile on my face. Thank you, Donna, for such an engaging read!"},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"This is a witty, smart and enjoyable book! The two strong personalities clash at first but that clash causes a fire! I loved the story and could see it really happening. A high powered executive running his family like a business, what's not to believe there? A strong female gym teacher secure in her own abilities as a person and willing to stand up for what she believes is true. Everyone needs a teacher like that! I loved the sparks that flew and the story that followed. I will definitely check out Donna Fasano's other books! I love the cover and I will recommend to friends."},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"Romance novels are not something I usually read, but I was quickly hooked on Taking Love in Stride. Donna Fasano kicks off the book with conflict between two strong characters who feel mutual physical attraction. Good fodder for a romance novel.Feisty Andrea reprimands recalcitrant track team member, Denise O'Connor. Andrea discovers Denise's artistic talent and encourages it. Meanwhile, Ian, Denise's father, demands his daughter be reinstated on the team. Does Andrea comply and let Denise run on the team or does she teach this pushy, coercive father some lessons of her own? Further complications arise when Ian insists Andrea train him to run a marathon. She trains him, but not in the way he expects. A bit of sexual heat spices up the action. The character development of Harry, Denise's wheelchair-bound grandfather, is realistic and touching.Authors don't often enough weave all five senses into a book. By page three of Taking Love in Stride, we've been treated to touch, sight, smell, and sound. It's one example of the care Ms. Fasano brings to her writing. Taking Love in Stride is a fun, quickly-paced read where sparks of all kinds fly in directions you won't guess until you've finished the book."},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"I will start off by saying that although I have listed Romance of one of my least favorite, that does not mean that I don't love some of them and Taking Love in Stride is one of those I love.The two main characters, Andrea and Ian are both written beautifully and both grow a lot in the book. Andrea is a teacher/track coach that has past issues with her father that she has let cloud her judgment on just about everyone. In taking the steps to help one of her students, she comes face to face with Ian.Ian is a business man through and through, but he's also a dad and son. Which he tends to forget about in giving his daughter, Denise a life where she can have whatever she needs and mostly wants. Although what his daughter wants most is to have more time to spend with her father.Andrea and Ian come together and connected from the start, but to Andrea he's just like her father. To him, she's bullheaded and jumps to the wrong conclusions too quickly. They end up helping each other in a lot of ways. I am really trying to keep it as vague as possible because this is definitely a book worth reading! I don't want to include any spoilers but this is a story that shows how hard AND rewarding it can be to go with your heart and come to terms with your past."},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"Hah! Val2's review opens the way I was going to open mine: \\"The cover says it all.\\" I love good contemporary romance, and boy, do I wish there were more books like this one out there.

However rules were rules and Denise had been consistently late to practice, sometimes missing altogether. Then Andrea learns that Denise never wanted to be on the team that she'd been competing because it was what her father wanted. Denise's interests were art, she wanted to paint, not run around on a track.Ian Powers if furious when he hears about Denise's dismissal from the team and he goes to the principal, demanding his daughter be put back on the team, the principal agrees, but Andrea does not. She proves to Ian that Denise was only on the team to please him and this is news to Ian, because he hadn't forced his daughter to run.Then Ian finds out it was his wheelchair bound father, Denise's grandfather, who had been behind it all. It seems the old man had been quite a runner in his day and he wanted his granddaughter to compete in a marathon where he was to hand out the trophy. Since his daughter doesn't want to run anymore, Ian decides to put his business on hold and compete himself.However he needs a trainer. He asks Andrea. She refuses. He goes to the principal again and offers to pay for the schools sporting equipment if he can get Andrea to change her mind about coaching him. But can he get Andrea to change her mind about him?I found \\"Taking Love in Stride\\" to be a fun filled read and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in a taking a few hours out of their schedule.

An idea that Andrea is not open to as Ian reminds her of her always absent and overbearing father. Andrea has some unresolved issues in this areas. Misunderstandings occur and eventually a relationship blooms.I struggled with this book. The protagonist was so wrapped up in her own daddy issues, that the plot became tiresome (and I just wanted to slap her). As a woman who was raised by a father who was always working, I thought that on some level I would identify with the protagonist. This did not occur, the character thought too much of herself and thought too little of the intentions of the other people around her. I think it was the intention of the author to present a woman who was smart and strong willed, instead she came off self centred and lacking in emotional IQ. The book spent too much time describing cliche wholesome family interactions. G rated romance suitable for a young girl, not suitable for the adult market."},{"Title":"Taking love in Stride","review":"The writing in this book is amateurish, the characters flat, and the plot utterly predictable. It was a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"It is worthwhile remembering that this is a novel and while it relates to her life, it is highly fictionalized. If you read her Wartime Notebooks, there is a section about her life at this time. It bears little resemblance to the novel, especially with regard to a passionate affair. In the notebooks there is none of this. In fact she describes the first time he kisses her in some detail. She was horrified and disgusted with the kiss. She felt almost as if she had been raped. Little else of an intimate nature is discussed.So enjoy the book as a novel, a very good one, but do not read it as if it were autobiographical."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"Almost stream-of-consciousness.

Like other works of Marguerite Duras, \\"The Lover\\" conflates a vivid and deeply sensuous literary imagination with thinly-veiled autobiographical elements and a non-linear, ever shifting perspective. The result is a short, powerful novel of memory and erotic yearning. a novel which lingers in the reader's mind long after the last page.Neither the girl nor her Chinese lover has a name. The girl meets the Chinese lover on a ferry, seeing him in a limousine while she is returning to boarding school in Saigon. She is wearing a flat brimmed fedora hat, a silk dress turned sepia-toned with age, and gold lame high heels. She is a girl who is accustomed to people looking at her. \\"People do look at white women in the colonies; at twelve-year-old white girls too. For the past three years white men, too, have been looking at me in the streets, and my mother's men friends have been kindly asking me to have tea with them while their wives are out playing tennis.\\"Each is a starkly drawn character acting in ways that seem predestined. The Chinese lover does not intend to marry her, only to be her lover. The girl surrenders to what seems her fate. \\"She agreed to come as soon as he asked her the previous evening. She's where she has to be, placed here. She feels a tinge of fear. It's as if this must be not only what she expects, but also what had to happen especially to her. She says, I'd rather you didn't love me. But if you do, I'd like you to do as you usually do with women.\\"It is a deeply moving erotic tale. It is also a tale of the girl's troubled life, of her strained relationships with her mother and her two brothers, and the way those relationships color her affair. Her mother speaks of \\"blatant prostitution and laughs at the scandal.\\" And in her elder brother's presence, the Chinese man \\"ceases to be [her] lover.\\" \\"He doesn't cease to exist, but he's no longer anything to me. He becomes a burnt-out shell.\\"Written in one short paragraph after another, moving back and forth in time, ever changing its narrative locus, \\"The Lover\\" paints a fictional world of eroticism, longing and memory. The result is a compelling work of fiction, nothing less than a minor masterpiece of Twentieth century French literature."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I guess I'm writing this in response to some other reviews. I don't find &quot;The Lover&quot; &quot;difficult to read,&quot; &quot;totally orgasmic,&quot; or &quot;completely lacking in plot.&quot; I read this incredible, lyrical book as if the narrator were sitting across from me in a quiet room, late at night, telling me softly about something beautiful that happened to her earlier in her life and has imbued her life hauntingly ever since. True, the novel doesn't follow ordinary chronological plot patterns. Nor would you, if you were to sit down with me, and tell me something beautiful and powerful from out of your childhood, because memory isn't constructed that way. You might talk to me for ten minutes about something from when you were 12, pause, find your own discussion taking you to something from when you were 10, and two minutes later, you might have to explain something slightly off-track again about a character you've just mentioned for the first time. So you see, it is the traditional chronological plot narrative that is unnatural. Duras' method is not only more natural, it is more personal and intimate, and helps give that feeling that her narrator is sitting across from you, sharing some beautiful memory with you. Nor is the book &quot;orgasmic.&quot; Duras' writing is erotically charged as much from its misty veils of restraint as from that French way of thinking philosophically about love and sex. Please don't read this for a quick thrill. You will start out with the wrong frame of mind, will grow impatient, and will miss the overwhelming beauty of this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I first saw the movie for this book. One of my all time favorites, I highly recommend seeing it. I was drawn into this book, into the life the girl lived. The sensuality, the loss, and then the memories.Still one of my favorite books to read, after reading it over and over again.I wonder if Marguerite Duras lover still thinks of her, i wonder if losing him, is what made her life so hard.I wonder..........I wonder............."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I have read this book 126 times. Every time I read it I learn something new. A lot has been said about the power of its content, the story of passion and longing and the mysteries of love and death. But its true brilliance comes from its form, the WAY in which the story is told. A single image is unfolded and within it we find all the mysteries of life opening and closing, coming clear for a brief moment, then vanishing. I do not think any other book has the same form as this one. This is why it is brilliant. Duras created something utterly unique. All the 'rules' of structure are tossed away. Passages flow one into the next and the connection between them is both seamless and invisible. It may seem random, or intuitive, at first, but as you look deeper you will find there is a deliberate order whose subtlety is unsurpassed, a work of power.Another interesting point for writers comes from comparing this book with Duras' earlier book, 'The North China Lover'. This other book tells the same story, without any of the depth or power of 'The Lover'. I believe it was a first draft, and 'The Lover' is what became of that first story after years and years of editing and distillation. The contrast between the two is a good lesson in how and why to edit what you write."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"The only way I can describe this book is to say that it is haunting. Today, it would not be published, for obvious reasons, but it is one of those books that transcend reality, to put it mildly. I have to say that the story of the young girl and her lover, the older man, was one in which the reader is drawn and can't seem to let go after the last word is read. It's a keeper, defintely. Also, check out the movie, which is just as good as the book, imho:The Lover."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"The novel, L'Amant, by Marguerite Duras written in the 50's was translated into English. The Lover, and became the basis for the movie The Lover starring Tony Leung. A great movie which stimulated me to read the book in English which then stimulated me to read the original. The English version is a literal translation of the French and possesses the flow and passion of the original. The movie is one of the best renditions of a book I have seen. In Netflix, the movie gets mixed reviews ranging from brilliant to those who get emotionally upset by the theme of the movie, which is an older (32 year old) Chinese man who has an affair with a very mature 15 year old French girl in Vietnam. But who is seducing or using who? Beautifully written (the books) and directed (movie)."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"A curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book. I really like &quot;the Lover&quot;, it's one of my favorite book to recommand others, even though I don't like much Duras.The writing is so short, like pieces of puzzle, there is no order to explain. Duras wrote what she felt, thought spontaneously in a paragragh after another. This book is descriptive and the flow of feelings is so delicate. Especially, the reflections about the life that Duras explained in this story, are truly profound and even sorrowful for me.There is no tension, no exposed conflict, the story moves so still like the calm ocean. The tranquility in rich thoughtful description, that's why I like this novel."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"This controversial book presents a beautiful coming of age story in which a young French girl and a Chinese aristrocrat have an affair in French Indochina. Beyond a story of love and sex, this tale exquisitely depicts the development of a teenage girl during the most formative time of her life.As Duras usually does in her novels, the story presented is semi-autobiographical, focusing on all of the conflicts of the character's life - from family drama with her brothers to being an outcast at school.What touched me most about this book was not the love the girl had for her Chinese lover, but the capicity she had to love others in her life - specifically her younger brother and best schoolfriend. Even more touching is that Duras held these memories close to her throughout her life, and as an old woman was still deeply effected by eventually losing those she loved - both emotionally and physically.Any review of this book that does not mention the talent Duras has for prose would do it a great injustice. Although a small amount of the beauty is lost in the translation into English, much of Duras' poetic yet succinct word play remains in tact."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I bought this book based upon a brief written interview with an author in the Financial Times. This author mentioned that her very favorite author was Marguerite Dumas and her ultimate favorite book was The Lover. This book is translated from French. At first I thought it was not such a good translation but as I read more, this is the author's style. The book is brief but has alot to say. There are not many words on each page but the story is intense. Marguerite is a 15 year old growing up in Vietnam at the time it was a French colony. She attracts the affection of a Chinese man 27 years old. It tells a story (autobiographical) of a young girl and her family, love, despair, survival in a culture foreign from the France her parents came from. The author has an uncanny way of bringing you into her life, even though she writes in the first person then quickly switching to third person. You feel her every thoughts, her tension and anxiety. This story is a MUST READ! I have loaned this book to a friend that I hope to get back. An amazing story to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"The Lover is DROP DEAD GORGEAUS. This novel is an emotional masterpiece that is a true story. The North China Lover is another book by Marguerite Duras and is also based on that ravishing affair. There was a dazzling motion picture of this novel that is masterful and I have never seen a film in my life that adapted a novel so well because in the exact same words and what the characters did were just outstanding on the silver screen. In the film the characters were the young Marguerite profoundly played by Jane March (who looks exactly like Marguerite Duras) and the man from cholon china passionately played by Tony Leung. The Lover is the best book ever, The best film ever, and the best soundtrack ever by Gabriel Yared which is beautiful and is outstanding for the book and the movie. This SUPERIOR MASTERPIECE by Marguerite Duras is about the intense,the passionate,the unforgettable, the haunting,and deeply forbidden affair between a poor fifteen year old french girl with serious problems back at her home in Sadec Vietnam and a wealthy engaged older chinese man in prewar Indochina. Duras' writing is so deep she paints the pictures of the intense, perfectly (and passionately) explicit and torridly scandelous experiances of the real lovers that are like nothing you've ever seen or experienced. This is a stunningly touching achievement that captures and embraces the incredible essence in sexual awakenning,human love, and the deepest passion we all have inside. The Lover is like our deepest most intense fantasy put into words and it makes you feel much better because this happened. Anyone who is looking for a deep melodramatic,amazing, and gripping story of mature love it will surely blow you away. I completely reccomend this breathtaking masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"There is such a deficit of good modern European novels written by women. Marguerite Duras stands out as one of the best. This short, autobiographical novel tells the story of a girl living in French Indochina and her affair with a wealthy Chinese man. However, what makes this novel so great is not the story but the way it is told. Duras' prose is lyrical and shifts from the first to the third person, moving in and out of her childhood years to her adult self reflecting on the past. Many passages made me shiver with their poetic beauty, and the end is profoundly sad.Duras meditates on love, death, and her complex relationship with her mother and brothers. Her tangled and often brutally ugly familial relationships should strike a chord with any reader. What I found perhaps most thought-provoking were the passages on being a writer; Duras writes, &quot;Sometimes I realize that if writing isn't, all things, all contraries confounded, a quest for vanity and void, it's nothing. That if it's not, each time, all things confounded inot one thorugh some inexpressible essence, then writing is nothing by advertisement.&quot; If this is indeed the definition of writing, than Duras is certainly a true writer."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"Duras' writing style is undisputably one of the world's finest in this century. Just simple words with creative construction, usage and presentation of sentences. They are so simple, yet layered with so much invisible and indescribable feelings, no words as of today could describe what you'd feel as you're going through the book. Never was there any other writer who could describe and emote with so much sensitivity and beauty. Though &quot;The Lover&quot; is morbid, the struggling innocence of life is so heartbreaking, you can't help but weep without tears as you turn the pages, especially the last few. She has created characters and written a story very unique in emotions and thoughts. She has capably used the characters of the girl and her family as well as the Chinese, to enter deep into our souls, bring out our most hidden feelings, unknown to ourselves, and open us to an entirely different perspective. Such soul-searching is probably something we could never have t! he ability to do, perhaps not even in this lifetime."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I don't care for the author's abuse of the time line. Duras' character development is firm, but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing. Duras' message of using the women's body as a form of control and yet making the main character seem separated from her body doesn't seem to really say anything."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"Set in more than half a century before. It's arduous to understand the situation for that time being. But through the describtion of Marguerite Duras, I do feel the contradictory circumstances for a white girl in a place with entirely different cultures from her home country. Being tied with poverty, living in a strange countries, and having only one trustworthy friend are already painful enough. Worse still, she's receive no true love from her family, but violence. Though it may sound fruitless, jarring or even disgusting for her to be with the Chinese guy, it seems to be forgivable. It's a good book showing how one may be influenced alongside with the political, social as well as family situations and backgrounds."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"Unless it was the translator's wish to remain anonymous, it's strange, and actually inconsiderate, that his or her name doesn't appear on the cover or even the copyright page. Let's not pretend that Duras wrote in English."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"A beautiful and tersely written story of the love affair between a teenage French girl and a Chinese man in Indochina."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"This is an ok book, it tells the story about Duras affair as a young teenager, with an older Chinese man. During the account Duras changes between past and present tense. She also sometimes write about herself as \\"I\\" and sometimes in third person, I haven't really figured out why she makes these changes. The matarial of this book one supposes could actually be developed into a real moving novel, I don't know why Duras kept the story in this short form. Perhaps she was lazy? As it stand now it somewhat has a sketchy form, which perhaps is ok? But I think I would have prefered if she had made a longer and more elaborated novel out of the material. And those inconsistencies I mentioned in the start (about past and present tense and I account and third person) Well maybe the book would have been better without those litterary experiments?"},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I loved the film version of this book. I had not read the book at that time. This book is wonderful, erotic, sensual and so real to the time and place. Be prepared for a wonderful journey."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I've read this book at least two dozen times....I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes poetic writing.There are lines and paragraphs in this book that are verging on sublime."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I had heard so much about this book that characterized it as an erotic masterpiece, an ode to passion and the story of a doomed cross-cultural romance--but in fact most of the book is about the author's hatred of her mother and her older brother. And while the sexual aspect of her love affair is central to the story, the descriptions are muted and very understated. Indeed, the romance is profoundly one-sided and the narrator only belatedly wonders if in fact she loved him at all.Most of the book's energy derives from her vicious attacks on her manic-depressive mother and her morally corrupt monster of an elder brother, whom she describes as a killer, a hunter and a murderer--blaming him for the death of her younger brother, although how he was responsible is never made clear. So vivid and fierce is her bitterness and hatred for her mother and brother that it largely eclipses the more vaguely articulated love affair and indeed relegates the lover as a secondary character in a dim side-story.The writing varies from marvelous, haunting prose to muddled and awkward philosophizing on life and death, frequently incomprehensible and repetitive. As a backdrop, French Indochina of the 1930s is portrayed both lovingly and with contempt, and the French colonial apartheid treated as a normal way of life. Marguerite Duras' own self-disdain is evident on every page.I'm baffled that this book was such a grand success, even given the different tastes prevalent in 1984, or that it was made into such a fine film, which correctly ignored the negativity and focused on the passion. For me it was a monumental disappointment."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"A curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book. I really like &quot;the Lover&quot;, it's one of my favorite book to recommand others, even though I don't like much Duras.The writing is so short, like pieces of puzzle, there is no order to explain. Duras wrote what she felt, thought spontaneously in a paragragh after another. This book is descriptive and the flow of feelings is so delicate. Especially, the reflections about the life that Duras explained in this story, are truly profound and even sorrowful for me.There is no tension, no exposed conflict, the story moves so still like the calm ocean. The tranquility in rich thoughtful description, that's why I like this novel."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I have read this book 126 times. Every time I read it I learn something new. A lot has been said about the power of its content, the story of passion and longing and the mysteries of love and death. But its true brilliance comes from its form, the WAY in which the story is told. A single image is unfolded and within it we find all the mysteries of life opening and closing, coming clear for a brief moment, then vanishing. I do not think any other book has the same form as this one. This is why it is brilliant. Duras created something utterly unique. All the 'rules' of structure are tossed away. Passages flow one into the next and the connection between them is both seamless and invisible. It may seem random, or intuitive, at first, but as you look deeper you will find there is a deliberate order whose subtlety is unsurpassed, a work of power.Another interesting point for writers comes from comparing this book with Duras' earlier book, 'The North China Lover'. This other book tells the same story, without any of the depth or power of 'The Lover'. I believe it was a first draft, and 'The Lover' is what became of that first story after years and years of editing and distillation. The contrast between the two is a good lesson in how and why to edit what you write."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I read this book almost 10 years ago, but it remains very vivid in my mind because of the strong imagery, the simple language, and the beautiful but sad story. All I can think of is how so short and simple a book can pack so much human drama in it. To this day, it still gives me materials to think about. I didn't know that the story was semi-autobiographical until later, but I thought so just from reading it because it so intimately describes the young girl's feelings that it would be impossible to make it all up. The description of the crossing of the Mekong River in the beginning will always remain in my mind. So simple, so elegant, and so strong an image. The book was like a beautiful, impressionist painting. There is also a movie by the same title that comes close to capturing the beauty of the book, but of course, nothing can compare to the actual words of Marguerite Duras, a beautiful and mysterious woman shaped by the events of this book. To get to the truth of her life, one must read and interpret this book on their own."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"Winner of France's most prestigious literary award, the Prix Goncourt, in 1984, \\"The Lover\\" is a tautly written, first person narrative of a fifteen year old French girl's affair with a Chinese man nearly twice her age in Vietnam circa 1930. Like other works of Marguerite Duras, \\"The Lover\\" conflates a vivid and deeply sensuous literary imagination with thinly-veiled autobiographical elements and a non-linear, ever shifting perspective. The result is a short, powerful novel of memory and erotic yearning. a novel which lingers in the reader's mind long after the last page.Neither the girl nor her Chinese lover has a name. The girl meets the Chinese lover on a ferry, seeing him in a limousine while she is returning to boarding school in Saigon. She is wearing a flat brimmed fedora hat, a silk dress turned sepia-toned with age, and gold lame high heels. She is a girl who is accustomed to people looking at her. \\"People do look at white women in the colonies; at twelve-year-old white girls too. For the past three years white men, too, have been looking at me in the streets, and my mother's men friends have been kindly asking me to have tea with them while their wives are out playing tennis.\\"Each is a starkly drawn character acting in ways that seem predestined. The Chinese lover does not intend to marry her, only to be her lover. The girl surrenders to what seems her fate. \\"She agreed to come as soon as he asked her the previous evening. She's where she has to be, placed here. She feels a tinge of fear. It's as if this must be not only what she expects, but also what had to happen especially to her. She says, I'd rather you didn't love me. But if you do, I'd like you to do as you usually do with women.\\"It is a deeply moving erotic tale. It is also a tale of the girl's troubled life, of her strained relationships with her mother and her two brothers, and the way those relationships color her affair. Her mother speaks of \\"blatant prostitution and laughs at the scandal.\\" And in her elder brother's presence, the Chinese man \\"ceases to be [her] lover.\\" \\"He doesn't cease to exist, but he's no longer anything to me. He becomes a burnt-out shell.\\"Written in one short paragraph after another, moving back and forth in time, ever changing its narrative locus, \\"The Lover\\" paints a fictional world of eroticism, longing and memory. The result is a compelling work of fiction, nothing less than a minor masterpiece of Twentieth century French literature."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"The present review discusses the French girl's transgressive body which deconstructs and undermines the patriarchal machination in Marguerite Duras&iexcl; The Lover and The North China Lover. In these two complementary autobiographical novels, Marguerite Duras relates her first sexual experience when she was only fifteen years old. In the novels, the French girl expresses her so-called first erotic orgasm experience with a Chinese lover. Her sexual drive does not come from love but from a woman&iexcl;s awakening. In the patriarchal society, women&iexcl;s sexuality has always been well controlled by men; the French girl&iexcl;s eagerness to get excessive sexual jouissance poses a threat to the patriarchal machination. The patriarchal ideology is omnipresent. We can find this male-centered ideology exists in the education, principle, rules, works, media, arts, literature, activities, and religion. Not only men, but also women internalize the masculine opinion that women are inferior to men in the androcentric society and have become conspirators of the patriarchal structurality; however, women still live according to the patriarchal rules without doubt. So far as the European colonialist is concerned, the biblical theology and ethics which are developed under the conditions of patriarchy have been the products of males. Many people read the Bible, learn of the biblical miracles, and act according to biblical rules without questioning the adequacy of its content. In fact, if we analyze the Bible and compare and contrast the biblical stories and commandments, we will find that the Bible is not such a righteous Gospel as we think. Especially, there are too many conflicts, taboos, and unfair rules which have constrained women and caused a dilemma for females for the past two thousand years. In The Lover and The North China Lover, the French girl uses her sexuality to express and exalt her own transcendent power. Her transgressive body totally betrays a nostalgia for a female Eden and breaks the norms of the biblical sexual limits. We can say the French girl is an advocate avant garde of the modern feminists who defies this patriarchal machination successfully."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I love this book. It's not written from the movie THE LOVER 1992 but from the author's own view of her life in Indochina as a young teen and her family and her Chinese lover. It's a beautiful love story but sad in the end. If you have a love who you could not be with in life, then you could relate to this book. It's also great to watch the movie THE LOVER which the movie was based on. Not for children or young teen because of subject matter."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"...well, not literally, but there certainly are parallels. This novella is set in Indochina, in the \`30's, and is told, via fragments of the memory of an older woman now living in France, of her life as a precocious 15 year old, and her first sexual experiences, and perhaps, with the emphasis on the uncertainty, despite the title, of her first love. The book is light on eroticism; it is far more about the female use of sex for, if you will, \\"empowerment,\\" which, in part, involves escape from an unhappy childhood situation. In gold lame high-heels and a foppish male hat, she meets her lover (or victim?), a 27 year old son of a Chinese millionaire, on a ferry as they cross the Mekong.Marguerite Duras wrote the screenplay for the movie, \\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour,\\" released 50 years ago. Far more so, the movie IS about love; like \\"The Lover,\\" the love is trans-cultural, and each individual has experienced a significant trauma: the Japanese male was near Hiroshima, and lost family members there when the A-Bomb was dropped; she is French, and had a German officer as a lover in the village of Nevers, known for its \\"calme,\\" and after the war she was ostracized as a \\"collabo,\\" including having her hair shorn. \\"The Lover\\" also concerns West-East love, again, between a French woman (girl) and an Oriental male. The \\"trauma\\" each has experienced is more internalized, relating to their family. He can never be his \\"own man,\\" living under the shadow of a domineering father. She lives in a very dysfunctional family, with a worthless elder brother, who keeps the family mired in poverty through his drug and gambling addictions, and a mother, from her Picardy farm, who worships him, largely neglecting the other two siblings.For a novella, Duras has more insights than many a 600 page novel. Her style is rich and dense, and I do NOT feel that she is projecting the wisdom of a middle age woman back onto a 15-year old. Consider: \\"I know it's not clothes that make women beautiful or otherwise, nor beauty care, nor expensive creams, nor the distinction or costliness of their finery. I know the problem lies elsewhere. I don't know where. I only know it isn't where women think.\\" Or, \\"You didn't have to attract desire. Either it was in the woman who aroused it or it didn't exist. Either it was there at first glance or else it had never been. It was instant knowledge of sexual relationships, or it was nothing. That too I knew before I experienced it.\\"The book is also about the \\"expat\\" existence, that transcends the 40,000 French \\"colons,\\" who were the raison d'etre for drawing both France, and later, the United States, into seemingly endless war, first for their \\"lifestyles,\\" but later, for the \\"glory,\\" \\"honor\\", and eventually, \\"saving face,\\" of their respective countries. But this particular expat story did not involve riches, and a fancy lifestyle, but poverty, the \\"barely getting by,\\" that was rather surprising, even though they too had servants. Consider: \\"... from the frightful loneliness of serving in out-posts up-country, stranded amid checkered stretches of rice, fear, madness, fever and oblivion.\\" They lived primarily in Sadec, a small town in the Mekong delta, which alas, I had never heard of. They did have a large house, with the veranda, and could see the \\"mountains of Siam,\\" in the evening, which was the only puzzling part of the book, since clearly you couldn't.That quibble aside, Marguerite Duras has written a rich, beautiful novel, concerning the time when we thought we were fresh, and awaking into one of the most fundamental aspects of human existence, and as will happen all too frequently, it was tawdry."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"A little book, barely 100 pages, packed with so much emotion and imagery i don't even know how to describe it. It is intense, in a way i haven't read in a while. Technically it is a story of a very poor French teenager, in Vietnam in the 1920's, who takes as her lover a wealthy Chinese man. Character-wise, he doesn't seem much more than a boy himself, though he is in his late 20's. But we get so much more information about the girl's life than we do about her affair. We hear about her mother, essentially a crazy woman, about both her brothers and their lives and deaths. The girl, who never gives her name, is weirdly detached from everyone but seems to be able to understand people deeply. The descriptions are lush and exotic. It seems to be a novel full of yearning and need."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"The prose is stark at times, making this classic all the more intriguing. The narrator seems at once affected and numb, young but not naive. It is said to be a slice of the actual author's life, and certainly it seems to have been written from a place of truth and pain. The movie differs greatly from the book and is enjoyable as its own entity, but if you liked the film, read the original -- much more affecting."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"After watching the movie, I just had to read the book. Some say, the book is always better than the movie, in this case though both book and movie are beautiful, but each in their own way.The book draws so much more depth and power (which is of course only hinted in the movie). It is written with a foreign musicality to it. Sentences are structured in ways that communicate the main character's unusual background--a French girl living in prewar Indochina. The way it's structured takes the reader into the poetic, romantic and exotic mind of the narrator.This is more literary, experimental (sure) and if you're looking for a romance novel, this ain't it. This one's artistic."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"This is a novel about two lonely people - but obviously it's autobiographical, about an intense love affair between a quietly assertive 15 year-old and a Chinese man twice her age. The characters are weary, weeping, exhausted by the heat, by the failure of their dreams. The lovers are beautiful and erotic, but to me the most powerful and intense character is the girl's mother - determined, sad, loving and fiercely loved. I also loved the descriptions of the river, flowing on uncaring. The oppressive heat overwhelms and weakens the characters. The story has the atmosphere of a Graham Greene novel, without the politics. I have never seen the movie, but fear it may be soft porn."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"A curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book.

This novel is an emotional masterpiece that is a true story. The North China Lover is another book by Marguerite Duras and is also based on that ravishing affair. There was a dazzling motion picture of this novel that is masterful and I have never seen a film in my life that adapted a novel so well because in the exact same words and what the characters did were just outstanding on the silver screen. In the film the characters were the young Marguerite profoundly played by Jane March (who looks exactly like Marguerite Duras) and the man from cholon china passionately played by Tony Leung. The Lover is the best book ever, The best film ever, and the best soundtrack ever by Gabriel Yared which is beautiful and is outstanding for the book and the movie. This SUPERIOR MASTERPIECE by Marguerite Duras is about the intense,the passionate,the unforgettable, the haunting,and deeply forbidden affair between a poor fifteen year old french girl with serious problems back at her home in Sadec Vietnam and a wealthy engaged older chinese man in prewar Indochina. Duras' writing is so deep she paints the pictures of the intense, perfectly (and passionately) explicit and torridly scandelous experiances of the real lovers that are like nothing you've ever seen or experienced. This is a stunningly touching achievement that captures and embraces the incredible essence in sexual awakening,human love, and the deepest passion we all have inside. The Lover is like our deepest most intense fantasy put into words and it makes you feel much better because this happened. Anyone who is looking for a deeply erotic, melodramatic,amazing,sensously mesmerizing, and gripping story of mature love and sensual desire combined with continuously over the top writing it will surely blow you away. I completely reccomend this breathtaking masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I first saw the movie which was based on this book. I absolutely adored the movie and I couldn't wait to read the book. This book is one of the best books I ever read (and I read a lot). It's absolutely amazing. The story is about a fifteen-year-old girl who falls in love with a wealthy twenty-nine-year-old China man in 1930's Indochina. But the greatness of this book doesn't come from the story line, it lays in the way Marguerite Duras tells the story. From the first page you can feel that this is her story. Her prose is so poetic and hauntig, somewhat obsessive. This book is so intimate and personal. It felt like Marguerite was sitting right across me and telling me the story of her first real love and sexual experience. But the relationship between her and China man is not like a normal relationship between two people in love. At one point her lover gives her the money for sleeping with him. There is also an interesting relationship between Marguerite and her best friend, a beautiful girl named Helen Lagonelle. There is even a passage when the two kiss and when Marguerite finds out she's going back to France, she offers her lover to take Helen so he could forget her easier. This book is unforgettable. It's fantastic, hauntig and somewhat dark. It explores the human passion. I had an opportunity to read this book in french (the original)and I never knew before that french can be so beautiful. In short, this book is more than perfect and I recommend it to everyone who is looking for some twisted and unforgettable true story."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"A success on many levels this is by far the best of Duras. A novel that tackles the ways and wheres of our self construction and the role of memory and event in relation to each other...how do we use one relationship in our life to express our feelings about other unresolved relationships (here I am referring to the protaganists position in her family and society). Where do we find ourselves, can we find ourselves...and what is the role of stories/authors and the memories that all of us carry with us."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I am presently caught up in a fast-paced setting that breathes logic. One day, I came across &quot;The Lover&quot; by Marguerite Duras. And suddenly I had to pause, as the past I buried (tried to bury) all came so alive. Marguerite Duras lived that love in a different historical setting. Hers, the colonial period - ours, the computer age; 70 years difference - but funny how the essentials never change. The more you deny it, the more it intensifies. Love unto death. Death is the bridge to the eternal. Love is eternal. Although one could never have his/her first love, it is a gift to be given a glimpse of the eternal."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"\\"The Lover\\" is a brief account of a poor 15-year-old French girl's mismatched relationship with a wealthy older Chinese man. The story takes place in Southeast Asia during the 1930s. The two lovers meet on a ferry boat crossing the Mekong River. He offers to drive her to her boarding school in Saigon; she accepts; and their troubled affair follows shortly after, pitted with social obstacles over race, class, and age.The book is very sparely written with just over 100 pages and virtually no dialogue. The story jumps around quite a bit too. On one page, the young narrator will be describing the future of her family; in the next, she will be reminiscing over her Chinese lover. Her writing style is best suited for readers who like short, free-floating stories.I read \\"The Lover\\" in my sophomore year of high school, and it's still one of my favorite books. I saw the movie several years later, and that too has become one of my favorites. I highly recommend watching it after reading the book. It's absolutely beautiful."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"It was interesting to see the parallels between Duras' life and the life of the narrator. The style (nouveau roman) might be difficult for some readers to follow, but the recalling of memories comes across as bittersweet and ultimately painful...makes for an interesting study."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I enjoyed the work. I'm glad I read it before I saw the cheesy, softcore movie, which doesn't do justice to the writing. The narrative is interesting in it's refusal to be pinned down to first or second person. We move in and out of Marguerite's frame of reference frequently, as she refers to her self both as a person, and as a possession, and struggles to define herself as one or the other.It's this role of self versus other that I found most interesting. The writing takes on many points of view at once, and it does so unapologetically. Through Duras's family it shows us the scorn and the contempt that the French had for the Vietnamese, (and Asians in general,) and her effeminization of her Chinese lover does likewise. And yet this structure is in decay, and Duras' own family is next to poverty. While this structure falls apart, we sense an impending power vacuum, that must (and will) be filled with turmoil. Likewise, we are shown the view of the young girl transitioning to womanhood, and her acute awareness of her identity and her ability to wield, and her desire to relent to sexual power. In this midst fo this, her male lover (who is never named) is shown as soft, inable to resist his domineering father, yeilding... a slave to love, and the idea of love. Everything a traditional woman should be, while Marguerite is the one who is cold, calculating, and seemingly, remorseless. It's this play with expectations, done so openly and with such frankness, as if it were the only natural thing to do, that makes this work so very powerful, and in my opinion, a wonderful read.Oddly, I could not help but make comparisons to Hwang's marvelous play M. Butterfly... Not only for it's role reversals, but also for it's treatment of society, and the clash of Eastern and Western cultures, specifically in the realtionship between France and China."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"Duras must be a complicated character if we are to believe that this a real reflection of her childhood. It is disturbing and original, almost unbelievable, confronting racism,paedophilia and incest.Yet the lateness of arrival of this piece in relation to Duras's career and life, contradicts her audacious and honest manner of conveying these subversive issues in the text, does her exotic past embarass or pain her more than she wants the reader to think? And is this why she chooses to be so vague with time, date , order of events and place. The dysfunctionality of her upbringing is parodied by the lack of structure and disjointed writing style of this novel, this makes it both convincing and unconvincing as an autobiography, a genre which relies heavily on the correctness of facts and chronological order. Do not attempt to read this book without being prepared for an insight into a mind, not a life."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"This book of Duras, is very hard to read, especially when you don't read it in your native language, but in French. Duras is associated with the movement of the Nouveau Roman. This movement didn't want to write realistic novelles anymore. Duras even left the plot and the character out of her books. That's why, in this book, you have no idea, where the story is playing and and how the story is going to succeed. Just when you finally understood the Chinese-story, she starts writing about her life in Paris. For someone, who likes mystery this is a prefect book, but for someone like me, who likes it when the story points some sort of message, reading Duras is just a waste of time. I like realistic romans better. This book jumps around from story to story, using the same elements she uses in other books namely; Love (her younger brother) against Madness(her elder brother), Life and Death, Reality and Appearance, Word and Silence. In all her books Duras has constantly adapted her story, telling the same in other words. The result of this we see in C'est tout(That's all)her final work. What is left of a productional life, is left in this book. My final conclusion: If you're a good reader and you like to make out your own story, instead of reading it, you can read this book. In all other cases, you can better left this book in the library or at Amazon.com"},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I didn't love The Lover, but as a fan of things Vietnamese I'm glad I read this semi-autobiographical story of Duras growing up in French Indochina. The loose, episodic narrative--about a teenage girl, her unstable family, and her older Chinese lover--requires some comfort with ambiguity as well as patience to put the pieces of the plot together. The narrator somehow manages to be emotionally overwrought and indifferent at the same time; an American reader is likely to find her exceptionally French. But to Duras' credit, The Lover is knowingly brief and often poetic; it feels something like an experimental but successful prose poem."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"This is one of the most beautifully written pieces of art!

Very unique writing style."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"The Lover by Marguerite Duras is the tale of a young girl's first lover but it is also the tale of her distraught, insane mother and overbearing older broter.

This book, written in lyrical, poetic, dreamy prose manages to capture all of the tragedy and yearning of a love that from the first can never be and thus from the first will always be perfect in memory and desire.Duras reveals her adolescent self in French Indochina, part of a colonial family enduring genteel poverty and the monstrous behavior of a greedy eldest son and the weak mother who indulges him. The middle daughter and the younger son are abused by the elder brother and neglected by the weak-willed mother. One day, on the ferry crossing back to school, the bizarrely and provacatively dressed young woman meets the son of a Chinese millionaire and nothing is ever the same for either of them again. These two lost souls find a solace in their passion for each other. The fact that the mother and brother willingly if obscurely prostitute their daughter and sister to alleviate the family's poverty is more than alluded to as is the heartbreak in the family and the intense longing for love that leads the girl into such a tragic passion.Despite its lean and evocative prose, this is more than a love story in an exotic locale. It is a story of how we are broken and how the broken parts are never entirely whole. It is the story of our secret hearts and our secret loves, the kind we yearn for unto death in Duras's phrase but that those closest to us would be surprised to discover. Duras went over and over this ground in her work and it is a gift, not only for those who harbor a secret passion, but for those who harbor a secret life and heart which no one else knows. Others do too and we are not alone. An outstanding piece of literature."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"This is the story of a French teenager growing up in Vietnam in the colonial era (1950's perhaps). Her father has died and the family (mother, older brother and younger brother) has sunk into poverty. Contributing to this state is the eldest brother's behavior: gambling, drinking, fighting, which the mother condones and finances. It is a very disfunctional family, a broken one, with the mother a bitter, indifferent, and hostile person, and the older brother simply a disgrace and a delinquent. The girl, without any guidance or education, living in a boarding school, starts to have a nightlife and be provocative. One day she meets a very rich Chinese man, twelve years older than her, and they start a relationship, probably illegal due to her age (15). The relationship is very sexual and tormented. The first time they have sex, it is he who cries, not her. He goes on crying when they make love, and she of course develops into a hardened, experienced woman, in spite of her young age. For her family, the relationship is a disgrace (due to his race), and they criticize her ferociously, but every time they can they eat and drink, courtesy of the despicable guy.Although the novel was published in 1984, it is written in the \\"Nouveau Roman\\" style fashionable in the 50's and 60's, and exemplified by Robbe-Grillet or Sarraute. And, in spite of Duras being more famous, and this book better known than those of the others, it is clearly inferior. It is a cold and sordid story, with repulsive characters, and no tone, neither epic nor intimate."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"What a delicious little book full of perfect sentences.(Outstanding begining) Impresive lirisms impregnates de hole of the book as much as a hang over.

Duras plays with events non-chronologically, telling you things early on which would best be saved for the end of the novel. If you're looking for something different, this book might be for you. If not, leave it alone. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"Learn to read them properly. They are sacred.-Marguerite Duras speaking of her own writingThey say masturbation makes morons of children. It wasn't the case with me. On the contrary, it brought me reason, revolt and joy.-Marguerite Duras speaking of herselfThese two quotations, which the critic Robert Fulford cites in his review of a biography of Ms Duras, provide us with some perspective on how we're supposedto react to this semi-autobiographical novel. For the novel is itself masturbatory, an act of self-love. And only someone who considers themself to be a kind ofdivine could possibly imagine that readers would find beautiful and moving the story of her own childhood whoredom.Ms Duras seems to have been a profoundly despicable person, a collaborator with the Nazis in Vichy France, then switching to the Communists just in time tosave her skin, disliked by even her \\"friends\\", and apparently filled with well-deserved self-loathing. Here she tells the altogether unpleasant tale of a 15 yearold French girl in Indochina who, her family having fallen on hard times, seduces a rich Chinese man twice her age in order to become his kept woman. It is alove story that is devoid of love, a piece of erotica that is singularly unerotic, a coming of age tale by an author who seems to have spent in life trapped in theself-centeredness of childhood. It. like its author, is simply appalling.GRADE : F"},{"Title":"Lover","review":"This internationally acclaimed book, which was also made into a movie, is about a young white girl in Saigon who initially sells herself into prostitution. A Chinese man, whose father is a millionaire, is the only taker and loves her obsessively, though because of the race issues in the 1930's, marriage is impossible from the start.The book is written as a memoir of her disturbing and dysfunctional life amidst a family that you fail to grow attached to. There is minimal use of names, which keeps the characters distant to the reader. The mesmerizing prose invites you along in a haunting way, but the story leaves much to be desired. At times it goes off on tangents like a rambling mind and leaves you wondering where you have been taken.I know Duras has been hailed as an award-winning author but I can honestly say it was a chore to finish this book. Perhaps this book is for a certain kind of reader, to be read when one is in the mood for something other than a good story.Kelsana 6/14/01"},{"Title":"Lover","review":"ok. i'm lost. i just read the book, THE LOVER, and i can't figure it out. mind you, i read a lot. at the same time i read THE LOVER i am reading pearl s. buck IMPERIAL WOMAN, and a book by barbara samuel. i am studying A COURSE IN MIRACLES and i like to study anything off the beaten track.....i read, and study, extensively. and you know what? i don't get THE LOVER. first love. ok. i had a couple of those, but i still don't relate....i am lost by the tenses...what is happening and when? then i don't understand indo-china. sorry. i don't know much more about this area of the world than what pearl is telling me in IMPERIAL WOMAN circa mid 1800's.

The book is short, a little over a 100 pages, and is written in short impressionistic paragraphs that move from present to various days in the past.A French family in Indochina is reduced to working-poor status due to the death of the father and the mother's attempts to maintain the family while working as a school administrator. Yet this family if full of tensions since the mother favors the worthless older brother at the expense of the middle-child sister and younger brother. This mother barely can keep food on the table while trying to rescue the older son from debts, fights, and other problems. This allows the daughter to grow up too fast, acting as the mother for the emotionally neglected younger brother. The young woman sometimes is the narrarator and sometimes the story is told in third person. Duras pulls this off with ease.What happens to girls that are forced to grow up too fast? This is really the theme of this wonderful book. For girls that are put in this position make bad choices and are exposed to too much adult pain too soon. Living in a boarding school with little supervision, she wears make-up too soon and dresses provocatively too soon. Duras hints that the young woman, though still a virgin, is contemplating prostitution. Wearing her mother's tight rust colored silk dress, with gold lame high heels, and a floppy man's hat, she is spotted by the son of a Chinese millionare. This man is 12 years older than she, making her 15 and thus making him 27. Their affair begins with her first act of intercourse. She is so nieve that she is surprised that she bleeds when penetrated. Yet she is so matter of fact about her body, throughout the novel, it is her instrument that she gradually learns to play.In the early stages of the affair, her Chinese lover trembles and shakes as he seduces her and makes love to her. He is transparent in his obsession with her. Being still a child, she is not yet ready for the full release of Eros in the body, so she attends to the power she seems to have over this adult male. Gradually, with daily love making, she moves from the manipulative child -struggling to survive to an adult woman, learning to make love and all the vast range of variations and powers and secrets that this involves. Her boarding school teachers are outraged that she returns at night in the early hours, but her mother is her ally here, allowing her to grow up fast, so that she is released from being another burden to this incredibly weak mother.She learns the power of being the desired one and she learns desire. Here desire growns with her emotional experience. He totally indulges his role as the one totally lost in love for the cooler, more detached partner, suffering because his love is not totally matched, and desiring her to the point of obsession.This book is a wonderful dreamlike reflection on the awakening of love and all its powers (in her) and the exquisite pain of sexual obsession and becoming lost in the beloved (in him). I recommend the book and invite the reader to approach the text as if reviewing memories and dreams and reflections, allow the emotions to make sense of the book, don't try to make it chornologically fit together, since like your own past, it is a scattering of passions and sensations."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I read this book in one day. This was my first introduction to Duras. What an incredible story! Her writing is like poetry, like a song, filled with lyrical descriptions of her surroundings as well as her feelings, filled with gorgeous imagery and constant forshadowing towards the demise of her own family.The story itself would be totally unacceptable by today's (or the entire 20th century's) standards, being that of an illicit love affair, set in prewar Indochina (today's Vietnam) between a 15-year-old French girl and a 27-year-old Chinese son of a millionaire. However, it is what it is, it happened, and the way the story is told is beautiful and impassioned.What's most amazing here is the evolution of the girl's psyche. In many ways, she was obviously mature way beyond her years, fatalistic and dark, all brought on by the loneliness and frustration of life with her mother and brothers. At the same time, she was naive in the sense that she thought she was strong enough to handle this affair without falling in love. The girl tried to convince herself that money was the only objective in this affair (when in fact, money was the only reason why her mother(!) allowed her to continue see her lover--ouch!).Duras' writing reminds me of that of Maxine Hong Kingston's (or is it vice versa?). Many thoughts are repeated throughout the pages, like refrains or choruses. She switches the narrative from first to third person. She switches time frames from past to present and back again. It's as if the whole novel was written completely stream-of-consciousness, or possibly a parallel to the unpredictable horrors of her own mother's madness.The young girl grew up in a sad, unloving and erratic home, with an unstable mother, whose unhealthy allegience to her devious and abusive older brother created an almost intolerable environment for the author and her younger brother. Additionally, the time frame was such that a relationship between a white woman and a Chinese man, (let's face it: An adolescent and a grown man) was completely reprehensible. In the face of all these obstacles, it was clear that the author sought refuge with this young man, and that for her, this first taste of sexual passion would be the standard in which all of her future loves would be measured. She never sugar-coated the various facets to this affair, the degrading moments, the moments where the love and passion was so infinite, or when the roles of power and possession were reversed from time to time. Yet, it's clear that this affair, which lasted a year-and-a-half, was very deep and meaningful to both parties, a tragic and impossible love that would haunt them both for the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"THE LOVER by Marguerite Duras, which was an international best seller and winner of the Prix Goncourt in France, tells the story of a young French girl growing up in Indochina in the 1930s and her affair with the son of a Chinese millionaire. She does not love him and his father refuses to allow them to stay together because she is white, but, to me, the love story, while serving as the reason for the story, is not the central focus. More riveting, I found was the emotional violence of the narrator's family life and the style in which it is written.The book is written expertly and experimentally in a way that moves like a recollecting mind among ideas, images and themes. At first this is disorienting to the reader, but it begins to feel very natural very quickly, because I think the style effectively mimics the way the mind flows back over our past. Duras wrote the reputedly semi-autobiographical book over four months in 1984 when she was nearly seventy years old.The passages on the life of her family are tragic and, as I said, emotionally very violent. The nameless French narrator grows up with a poor mother who is a school mistress in Indochina and her two brothers. The elder brother seems to be incredibly self involved and coddled by their mother, but the younger siblings are afraid of him. Duras recounts his actions with a distance that makes his behaviors more frightening, and he emerges as a central force of the book.The small book, a little over 100 pages, is hard to forget. It so well mimics the process of the mind, it begins to feel as if it is one's own memories, mined from all the connections thoughts seek to make when we look back to a time long past that won't let us go."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"Marguerite Duras has written, in retrospect, the hypnotic story of her odd relationship with the adult son of a Chinese millionnaire at least 15 yrs her senior. Written as a novel, there's no doubt it's Duras' own tale of her love affair when she was just a 15yo in Indochina in the 30s, one of three children of a disturbed and impoverished English widow who was trying to make ends meet as a teacher. Her daughter, Duras, was left mostly to fend for herself at a boarding school that was unusually permissive with the odd comings and goings of this precocious child-woman.Duras tells this story from the distance of years, through a technique of oblique references, forgettings, reiteration, repetition (the straw hat, the dress, the shoes...), fractured images, and readers get the sense of coming at what happened reluctantly, as tho the author is a little unwilling to share everything with us.It's a mesmerizing, seductive, atmospheric, overlapping, strangely detached story - one that readers will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I first saw the movie which was based on this book. I absolutely adored the movie and I couldn't wait to read the book. This book is one of the best books I ever read (and I read a lot). It's absolutely amazing. The story is about a fifteen-year-old girl who falls in love with a wealthy twenty-nine-year-old China man in 1930's Indochina. But the greatness of this book doesn't come from the story line, it lays in the way Marguerite Duras tells the story. From the first page you can feel that this is her story. Her prose is so poetic and hauntig, somewhat obsessive. This book is so intimate and personal. It felt like Marguerite was sitting right across me and telling me the story of her first real love and ... experience. But the relationship between her and China man is not like a normal relationship between two people in love. At one point her lover gives her the money for sleeping with him. There is also an interesting relationship between Marguerite and her best friend, a beautiful girl named Helen Lagonelle. There is even a passage when the two kiss and when Marguerite finds out she's going back to France, she offers her lover to take Helen so he could forget her easier. This book is unforgettable. It's fantastic, hauntig and somewhat dark. It explores the human passion. I had an opportunity to read this book in french (the original)and I never knew before that french can be so beautiful. In short, this book is more than perfect and I recommend it to everyone who is looking for some twisted and unforgettable true story."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"L'Amant is an amazing book, full of sorrow and muted passion. It swept me away, and into my own sorrow about love. I read it several times. I've read about 5 novels by Duras, out of her huge catalogue of books (40 or so?). This one is definitely my favorite.Languid language, erotic yet not pornographic, sensual. Fully emotional yet emotionally distant at the same time.Also, the novel is \\"semi-autobiographical\\". It chronicles the first person narrator's love affair with an older chinese man when she was just a poor young teenager. The story has been romanticized heavily from the real life story of Duras, who (I am told by a friend who studied her in depth) was prostituted by her mother to this rich chinese man in her youth. I regret I don't remember the differences between real-life and the book well now. But knowing this opened a further sadness to the story. But I suppose it was the author's way of beautifying a terrible experience she had had.[Technically I haven't read this book, I read the original French version. But if I write this review for that edition no one will see it.]"},{"Title":"Lover","review":"The Lover is, first and formost, a tragedy of two lovers destined to part. Marguerite Duras has created a world in which love, in many forms, is still found (if only briefly) in the face of ever-present impossibilty. While arguably semi-autobiographical, the real charm of this book is its grittiness and willingness to present a world in which people can and do make choices that they know will only lead to ruin and disappointment, and still live with the consequences.Duras' narrator, an unnamed woman reflecting back on her coming of age in Saigon, shares her life in a frank yet touching way. The depth of thought and feeling the character portrays lends a sense of reality. Does she love the man from Chalong? Is this just prostitution? Is she driven by poverty and desperation, or is she seeking an escape from the horrors at home? I suspect even Duras was unsure, and this fallability of her narrator is what makes her so real and engaging.The passion of the lovers, featured so prominently in the erotic loves scenes of the film adaptation, are far more subtle in the novel. There are no cheap thrills here, and those looking for wild descriptions of who does what to whom are bound to be disappointed. This is no Harliquin romance. Perhaps the most sexually explicit description is not of the heroine's time with the man from Cholong but of her fantasies about her friend Helen. These fantasies inform us of the nature of her sexual relationship with her Chinese lover more than any other memory. they also highlight the young girl's search for compassion and love that has been missing from her life to this point.The life of Duras' lovers offers an interesting allegory to the decline of the French Indochinoise colonies. Its clear that the best days of the empire have past, the power of the 'natives' and the Chinese in Saigon is increasing, and the Second World War looms large on the horizon. Like Duras' young girl, the French relationship with 'exotic' Asia is doomed to failure. The descriptions of Cholong, the Mekong Delta and Cambodia are clear and recognizable even to modern visitors, and will surely interest those who have been there themselves.Some readers may be disappointed that there is no happy ending for this book. Love stories are most often about hope. These lovers, however, have other things to share with us. This is a wonderful book and a refreshingly honest portrayal of love."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"This book, written in a sparse style, is a recollection of Ms. Duras, her affair, her family, her environs in French Indochina during the late '20's and early '30's.

I encourage you to give this a read (get it at a good price) and see for yourself. It seems that the best stories are our own...Ms. Duras had quite a story to tell! Five stars!P.S., If you haven't seen the movie, get a copy!

This novel is an emotional masterpiece that is a true story. The North China Lover is another book by Marguerite Duras and is also based on that ravishing affair. There was a dazzling motion picture of this novel that is masterful and I have never seen a film in my life that adapted a novel so well because in the exact same words and what the characters did were just outstanding on the silver screen. In the film the characters were the young Marguerite profoundly played by Jane March (who looks exactly like Marguerite Duras) and the man from cholon china passionately played by Tony Leung. The Lover is the best book ever, The best film ever, and the best soundtrack ever by Gabriel Yared which is beautiful and is outstanding for the book and the movie. This SUPERIOR MASTERPIECE by Marguerite Duras is about the intense,the passionate,the unforgettable, the haunting,and deeply forbidden affair between a poor fifteen year old french girl with serious problems back at her home in Sadec Vietnam and a wealthy engaged older chinese man in prewar Indochina. Duras' writing is so deep she paints the pictures of the intense, perfectly (and passionately) explicit and torridly scandelous experiances of the real lovers that are like nothing you've ever seen or experienced. This is a stunningly touching achievement that captures and embraces the incredible essence in sexual awakening,human love, and the deepest passion we all have inside. The Lover is like our deepest most intense fantasy put into words and it makes you feel much better because this happened. Anyone who is looking for a deeply erotic, melodramatic,amazing,sensously mesmerizing, and gripping story of mature love and sensual desire combined with continuously over the top erotica it will surely blow you away.

The fact that it's somewhat biographical is what I found most intriguing. Duras is a wonderful writer. This is not easy reading, as her words are like poetry, but the book is a quick read. It's absolutely amazing what she gives the reader in a little over 100 pages. It's one of those stories you can't wait to get back to, but are afraid to read too quickly because you really don't want it to end. Now I'm ready to pack my bags, cross the river, and see the night skies of Saigon. I might even wear a man's hat and gold lame shoes while doing so.

The girl, Marguerite, develops a sexual relationship with a Chinese man, referred to only as the man from Chinon. This book is a commentary on the racism of the period in French Indochina, but it is also a commentary on love in the modern era, despite taking place in the colonial period.Marguerite's experiences, beginning this sexual relationship, lustful in nature and not based on true love, presents \\"love\\" as an object of desire. It is a story of childhood development but also of the pressures of rising adulthood. Marguerite is shaped by this experience, as her memories dictated at a later point reveal, transforming how the man from Chinon is presented as well as how she relates with her family. This book is cold and tragic, yet it is a coherent, believable case study of love in the modern era."},{"Title":"Lover","review":"I had been watching this movie over and over for years, ever since it came out, and finally noticed the book here on Amazon.

In general, this book was easy (and interesting) to read, and it erased all of my exam worries."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"I used this book to prep for my NCE exam and read it from cover to cover, focusing specifically on those areas that I didn't spend much time with in grad school (career counseling, statistics, reasearch methods, etc.). I took my exam and scored above the 90th percentile on the first try. This book was the only study or review that I used.Rosethal's conversational tone and constant use of repition was very helpful to me. Also, this book is FUNNY. It would almost be a worthwhile read on it's own."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"This is the only test prep I used and passed with a high score. The book is designed just like the test itself. All of the material covered in the book was relevent to the content of the test and Rosenthal's explanations were clear and concise. I can't say enough good things about this book. If you're anxious about sitting for the NCE, get this book and read it cover to cover and you'll have nothing to worry about. Good Luck!!!"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"Rosenthal's Encyclopedia of Counseling is an excellent review for those taking the National Counselor Exam or state exams. In my case I am preparing for my University Comprehensive Exams for my Master's program. The book covers all the major areas which will be covered in the exam. A unique feature is the programmed text-like nature of the questions. Not only is the correct answer listed and why, but also the rationale why the other possible selections were not correct. Rosenthal also refers back to previous questions to aid in comprehension. A nice feature are some memory devices to aid in recall of commonly missed questions or concepts. (The Independent Variable-who controls it? Remember the \\"I\\"-I control it)This text is well worth the price. It won't take the place of reviewing your own material, but will help prepare you to take a multiple choice exam."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"I found this book quite helpful for the exam. It was my only substantive study material, I studied hard for a couple weeks, and passed the exam by a fair margin - thus the title of my review, \\"Got the Job Done\\". At times his writing style is irritating (kind of condescending) as is the repetition, but pushing through that is worth it because it worked. The area of the exam that I struggled most with was Career Counseling. If your formal training has been light in that area as was mine, I'd recommend studying that section of Rosenthal's book very carefully - not just conceptually, but memorizing lots and lots of names and the specific theories associated with them. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"Provides a good explanation of answers to possible questions and subjects on the NCE and State Exams.

Helwig. Although I've worked in the counseling field for many years, I hadn't taken a \\"real\\" test in 19 years (ouch!). My studying methods may not work for everyone, but this book is a must. It gives a great comprehensive review of most of the areas covered on the NCE, and definitely shortened the length of time I needed to study as well as guided the areas I needed to focus on. I followed this one by Helwig's study guide and did much better on the exam than I thought I would. Whatever resources one uses, this should be the first one to read. My only suggestion for improvement is to update the career counseling sections with the more recent theories that have come out since publication."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"I thought this book is very helpful. It covers a great deal of info.....the only thing I suggest is make sure you research other study guides before choosing just one. I brought this one and found out that there was a better study guide out there.This book covers a lot of good stuff that will be on the LPC exam but...... The 5th edition of the Study Guide for the National Counselor Examination is what ever one that I know used to prepare themselves for the exam. They never heard of Encyclopedia of Counseling.I did order the study guide...hope to get it soon.I will post again once I take my test and let Amazon know if I passed:)"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"Howard Rosenthal really covers the territory well.

Excellent source of information."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"I bought it all -- the expensive review books, the large set of CDs, the flash cards, online practice exams -- and paid a fortune for it all. This book is the best tool available. (Sorry I bought it last!) It is the most useful tool because it provides 1,000 practice questions with complete explanations as to why the correct answer is correct, and why the other answers are incorrect. The net effect is that you review a lot of material, and you review it multiple times. Easy book to read. Also, the author provides a bunch of memorization tips for critical information. This is the book to buy, forget the other stuff."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"This is an amazing book to review for the NCE exam. I loved the fact that it had explanations for the wrong and right answer and it was set in a way that you were forced (in a good way) to review all of the material until you got it.

Much better with theories than your regular theories book."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"I will recommend this book to all of my fellow graduate students. The book provides 1000 questions to help you prepare for the exam, and although the answers tended to be lengthy, it was worth it to read them fully.

Perhaps it was the version of the test I took, but out of the 200 questions, maybe 30 were covered in this study guide. This guide is chock full of names that you don't need to know (for the test) and it covers none of the DSM. The career section and the appraisal and research sections are not enough to be prepared for what's on the NCE. The other sections were fine though.\\""},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"I passed the counselor's exam by studying primarily the information in this book.

This book is the best when it comes to preparing you for this exam. I purchased this for my husband in March based on the information & reviews I read about this book. I know it was God who led me to find it for him! He was at the end of his rope studying from a huge review notebook he received when he attended a very expensive, well-known workshop review. The more he used this notebook & did the tests from the included CD, the worse he did. He said the information was too confusing & hard to understand. When he received \\"The Encyclopedia of Counseling\\", he was amazed at how well thought out the questions & answers were. This study guide helps you to understand the questions & why the expected answers are what they are. Well he took the test at the beginning of June & HE PASSED IT!! I'm so proud of him, but more importantly, he wanted me to be sure to write a great review for this God-sent, invaluable book.

After comparing several sections, it appears this $50 book is more valuable than the others. One of my professors used it, and blew the test away. The head of our department states that you WON'T know all of the material anyway. Your best bet is to practice answering these types of questions. By the time you go through this book twice, major points are driven home. I plan to spend my last two weeks with this source only."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"I used this book as my primary study resource and passed the exam on the first try. It's very comprehensive, and though the author recommends reading the book from cover to cover, be sure to give yourself ample time to study the chapters at the end of the book.

I, like many others, thought that I had failed. However, after receiving my scores, I passed with flying colors in every section! Thus, I recommend this book, along with Rosenthal's CDs. I had not even had my class in Appraisal yet, and still passed the section. With that said, buy the book, READ the entire book (not merely the questions), and give yourself plenty of time to prepare! Good Luck!!"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams","review":"I graduated in 1996, and I have been practicing as a mental health pratitioner for three years.

There were actually a couple of questions in the book that the author got wrong or that were disputable. On the whole, however, this book is all you will need to study and pass.

It's my own fault for not researching those subjects more than relying on the book but I assumed that the book had covered what I would need to know and I think I was wrong. In 6-8 weeks I will find out if I passed or not, and if I didn't, I will be purchasing the nce review that has been mentioned here by others.

After 7 years away from the field I scored in the top 2% of those using the same form of the test. I like the conversational style, makes it easier to read or listen to. They're not perfect, could probably use another run through by an editor to catch some moments where he misstates things, switches the names of a theorist or theory he's comparing, and it doesn't (nor could it) cover every question you'll see on the exam.

For example in explaining an answer to the practice questions the author goes into a ton of detail about the wrong answers. It would be easier to remember if He just stuck with an explanation for the correct answer. Other than that its a GREAT book to review for the NCE.

I found the writing turgid and I never quite got the organization of the book. He was handicapped by directly quoting so many different authors, whose individual styles (or writing and talking) presented a cacophony of different, clashing sounds.

The author loves his ideas and goes on and on. If you don't have to buy it for a class, don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"This book has a very nice cover--really, a very cool design. I'm a little more equivocal about its insides. I was excited enough by the advance blurbs I read for this book to purchase it in hardcover a week or so after it was published--an extravagance that would shock those who know me well. But this topic appeals to me, and I like to throw a little support behind this sort of publishing enterprise once in a while.The book is interesting enough, and Yagoda does a good job of keeping things moving with lots of examples of and chatter about style from practicing writers. My problem is with one of the book's enabling conventions: The idea that Strunk & White's The Elements Of Style presents an outmoded and \\"soul-deadening\\" idea of style and that only books such as Yagoda's truly plumb the subject to its core.I've seen this sort of thing before, most notably in Clear and Simple as The Truth, by Thomas and Turner--a book weirdly bent on defying its own title and premise. The idea is to construct a straw man out of the immensely popular The Elements Of Style and then throw eggs at it. But it's an approach that anyone who knows Strunk & White well will recognize as a canard.It's largely a made-up polemic, probably caused by the fact that writers are constantly being prodded to find and exploit \\"the angle\\" of the story. Magazines prod this way, so do agents and book publishers. It's not good enough to present a solid proposal for an article or book that simply discusses an interesting subject; there must be an angle, and the more controversial the better. And though it's hardly Watergate, smearing The Elements of Style is what passes for provocative in this crowd.Yagoda states that Strunk & White's goal is prose that offers \\"...no trace of the author--no mannerisms, no voice, no individual style....\\" And then, in refutation of this fabricated Strunk & White \\"ideal,\\" he fills his book with examples of writers who write with identifiable styles--ranging from subtle to sledgehammer. The examples are fun--these are really good writers--but he's wrong about The Elements of Style.The first four fifths of The Elements of Style are largely about style in the sense of mechanics and word usage. No trouble there--that's not the kind of style we're talking about in the Yagoda book. In section five of The Elements, though--the section titled \\"An Approach to Style\\"--E. B. White takes a stab at offering beginning writers some simple, sound advice for clearing their prose of dross and deadwood so that they can begin the project of developing their own voice and personality on the page.White's project, then, is to help a writer clear the decks so that the \\"self\\" can escape \\"into the open.\\" Yagoda's mistake (and Harold Bloom's, on page xxi of Yagoda) is in thinking that White wants writers to stop once they've swept their prose free of clutter--to end with complete, bland transparency. But he doesn't; transparency, in White's view, is simply the necessary precondition for achieving one's individual voice as a writer--just as an empty canvas is the necessary precondition for painting a picture. \\"As he becomes proficient in the use of language,\\" White says, \\"his style will emerge, because he himself will emerge.\\" Does that sound like a recipe for \\"no mannerisms, no voice, no individual style\\"?I am an editor who has worked with nonfiction writers for sixteen years. I press The Elements of Style on many of them--particularly those having trouble organizing their thoughts or getting their words out in a clear, compelling way--and it usually helps. It is only after mastering the fundamental tools of clear expression (the craft of bringing thought to page relatively intact) that a writer's personality, his \\"voice\\" or style, can begin to permeate his prose.I have to believe it's been a long time since either Yagoda or Bloom spent an evening grading undergraduate essays (if indeed undergraduates are still required to write essays). The usefulness of The Elements of Style for such writers (if they study the book and apply its lessons) is incontrovertible.Yagoda and Bloom, in fact, recognize the validity of White's approach, in spite of their trendy protestations. Bloom, page 159: \\"I have made the conscious effort to write in a more straightforward and accessible way.\\" (Thank you, Harold.) Yagoda, page 236: \\"...the clearing of brush to create a walkable path, is never-ending for a writer.\\" (That as near a restatement of White's thesis in \\"An Approach to Style\\" as you're likely to find.)As for whether or not a writer can learn to write with \\"style\\" by reading this book, as Alex Beam's blurb on the back cover promises, the answer is no. A book such as this, while providing fun examples of style at work, is really no more or less instructive than the rest of a writer's (preferably wide) reading, from which he will sift and sort (consciously or not) the possibilities of voice, tone, and style in the ongoing effort to develop his own sound on the page."},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"With this engaging, entertaining and thought-provoking book, Ben Yagoda continues the discussion of what constitutes good writing that he initiated in &quot;About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made.&quot; Well researched, considered and reasoned, the book opens with a fascinating cultural history of the concept of style. Arguments over whether it is best to write like Hemingway or Faulkner (or the middle-of-the-road Fitzgerald) date back, Yagoda notes, to the Greeks. In &quot;On Rhetoric,&quot; for example, Aristotle emphasized clarity, transparency and decorum with an approach that presages some of the modern -- albeit, as Yagoda demonstrates, far from universally accepted -- message of Strunk &amp; White's touchstone, &quot;The Elements of Style.&quot; Yagoda then takes us on a journey across two hemispheres to discuss, with 40 different writers as diverse as Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and best-selling humorist Bill Bryson, how they got their grooves. In short thematically arranged snippets and later, in extended monologues, they talk freely about: the writers who influenced them; how they arrived at their style, or styles; even the nuts-and-bolts question of how their writing implements (pen, typewriter, computer) and methods of revision affect the sound that we hear when we read their works. If you're like me, you'll find yourself endeavoring to read for the first time, or re-read, some of Yagoda's interview subjects and those they cite as seminal influences, such as the grand dame of essayists, Joan Didion.For any reader or writer who gives a damn about the written word, this is a richly rewarding book."},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"Yagoda's thesis of this highly intelligent, generous book is that the dogma, championed by Strunk and White's Elements of Style, which shames us for having our own writing style, contradicts the joys and pleasures of writing, namely, that writers have their own individual finger-print style or voice. A writer's voice, his or her style, is the sensibility or personality giving life to the page. Yogada interviews several writers, including humorist David Barry, for the subject. Yagoda's own voice is smart and lively but never adademic. I should emphasize that the lack of academic-speak is one of the book's greatest virtues and triumphs. Here Yagoda has taken a book about the style of writing, a topic that could have easily been hijacked by some stuffy pretentious academic, but keeps the passion and accessibility on the level of a delicious pop book. Anyone interested in writing and style and literature in general should love this book."},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"Think you know what \\"style\\" is in writing? This book looks at every angle till you are humbled. Style is ... voice...rhythm...\\"the man\\"...conjunction of speech and written word...a response... Hemingway said his awkwardness in writing was called his style. Yagoda's book is an intelligent and erudite look at style, and raises questions rather than hammers down an answer. It's like the blind men touching the elephant and describing (\\"limning\\") what they feel. Based on this book, I've ordered Cyril Connelly's \\"Enemies of Promise.\\""},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"This is a tremendous book, a must-read for anyone who wants to improve their writing skills. I've read many writing instruction books, from Zinsser's \\"On Writing Well\\" to Stein on Writing to Strunk and White, and this volume stands with the best of them.The book demystifies (partially, at least) the various tics, choices, and talents that underlie many writers' styles. It's in-depth and intelligent. Extra bonus: it's highly readable. Yagoda's own style is engaging and keeps the educational material far above the standard-issue text. I found it encouraging."},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"As nearly as I can recall, I began consciously trying to write sometime in junior high. I had found an enormous old bound, lined ledger book and all those empty pages demanded I try to fill them. I wrote execrable short stories, I wrote self-conscious essays of opinion, I wrote terrible verse. If I thought about \\"style\\" and \\"voice\\" at all, I suppose I thought such things were intuitive. They would appear on their own; all I had to do was keep writing. I took a couple of creative writing classes in high school and I wrote dozens of feature articles for the school paper, which taught me discipline and how to think about what I was doing, and (most important) how to rewrite and revise. I ended up becoming an historian instead of a novelist or a journalist, and making a career in library science and archives management, but I've never ceased to write. The difference now is, I know full well there's very little that's \\"intuitive\\" about the process of getting thoughts and inventions down on paper, and so I've read quite a few how-to books on writing. Ben Yagoda made his own reputation at THE NEW YORKER and is a noted critic and historian of \\"literary journalism,\\" as well as an academic teacher of writing, so what he has to say about his field automatically deserves some attention. While this is not a how-to manual for wannabes, he does an excellent job on those mysterious authorial qualities of style and voice, from the use of self-conscious idiom (like \\"Black English\\") and a fondness for certain parts of speech (adverbs are painfully popular) to the influence of writers on other writers and even the impact of word processors and computers on the development of style. (I know I write quite differently on a yellow pad with a pen than I do in Word.) He depends heavily on dozens of interviews with working writers, some well-known, some not so much. (Though you shouldn't miss Andrei Codrescu, New Orleans NPR's very own S. J. Perelman.) The result is a mix of Yagoda's own thoughts and his commentary on the observations of those who make a living at this stuff. The style is easy and flows nicely, as you would expect from a top non-news journalist. Highly recommended to anyone who thinks they want to be a writer."},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"A lot of space on this page has been devoted to defendingThe Elements of Style Illustratedagainst Yagoda's abrupt dismissal. Fair enough. Anyone who's ever read undergraduate prose in the days before the kids just copied it all from the 'net has to acknowledge that clarity and simplicity are the foundations of expression. If it ain't clear, it ain't stylish.But Yagoda doesn't seem to be denying this obvious truth. He is simply saying that obeying the rigors of S&W; is not the same as style in the sense that the word applies to our best writers.*S&W; talk about what makes style possible for any writer.*Yagoda talks about the nature of style itself after the brush has been cleared, the foundation laid and all the unnecessary metaphors put away.That said, this is a delightful and provocative book. It suffers, as any book on literary style must, from the necessity of using its subject matter as the means of its own discussion. That is, the style of a book about style is bound to be a little strained. (See Insights and Illusions of Philosophy for both explanation and evidence.)The best use for this charming book is in forcing the reader's attention to words and style. The most horrific part is that it forces a writer's attention to his own words and style. It's nourishment for the former, medicine for the latter who would be well-advised to take small doses and continue writing.--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The andthe slightly stylish bang BANG: A Novel"},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"I had this book for one of my writing classes. The idea behind seemed interesting and helpful. However, half the time I really had no idea what the author was talking about, and on top of that he rambles about the same thing FOREVER. I ended up skimming the chapters just to get the reading over with. I almost feel like he was more interested in wowing readers with his vocabulary than trying to explain other writers' ideas about style. Things that could take about 10 pages to say, it takes him 30. And by the end of the chapter, you still don't really have any idea what the point was because he never actually tells you. The only good thing about this book was the quotes. So, if you are required to take a class, and this book is what you need for the class, just don't take the class. This book is that bad. Or if you are just buying it because it seems interesting, you've been warned."},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"I am just a beginner, having fun, trying to learn how to write fiction. I have another book that is better on the fundamentals of the craft, but THE SOUND ON THE PAGE is filled with useful ideas about an elusive subject. Mr. Yagoda examines three kinds of style: the spare (Hemingway), the ornate (Henry James), and the middle style. What I found most useful was his suggestion that the writer should try to approximate his speaking voice in his writing. Included in the book are many interviews with current writers. Some of these are more helpful than others, but all were worth reading, even if they didn't seem to apply to me. As a beginner, I was hoping for advice that fit into formulas that I could easily carry over into my writing, but this book does not have that. Style is a hard subject to write about so the reader must take the time and go through the entire book, more than once."},{"Title":"The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk about Style and Voice in Writing","review":"As a writer and teacher of writing for over thirty years, I have read hundreds (thousands?) of books, articles, and conference presentations on style and how to teach it.

It could easily replace all the stuffy anthologies usually required in college classes."},{"Title":"New International Business English: Student's Book","review":"This book [and separate tape are] essential for ESL/EFL teachers who teach intermediate or advanced communications courses. Each chapter focuses on a business theme such as negotiation, business meetings, telephoning. The tapes are slow for learners above an intermediate level; however, the speaking activities can easily be used by both intermediate and advanced learners. One good aspect of the tapes is the British Accents which makes a nice contrast to my North American accent for learners in EFL situations. You can even stretch certain exercises into writing exercises. However, the book lacks any structured grammar lessons. At an intermediate level in some contexts you might find the book a bit thin because of this.The teachers guide is unfortunately essential because you often can't complete exercises without having the companioned instructions. Which means more of a cost outlay for some teachers.This book absolutely cannot be used for self-study or one-on-ones. Nevertheless, it is the best resource I've had for these types of courses so far.

They spend a lot of time on interpersonal communication and psychological mindsets, which sounds good, but if you're targeting USA, then you're spending 100% of the communication in British English and Euro-centric issues. With all the materials, there's a lot. My feeling is another book was cheaper, included the audio and covered more concrete business topics. The audio price is plainly overpriced compared to other publications. This book has you steeped in psychological analysis and nuances. But it's got more material for a whole year of course work. My feeling is this is a good comprehensive textbook, but if you're on a tight budget, then you can probably get more value out of some other textbooks, though it's sketchy exactly which ones."},{"Title":"New International Business English: Student's Book","review":"I ordered this book and it was supposed to came with a CD-Room, but I did not reiceived it.

Our heroine, the widowed Lady Eleanor, is indeed a woman with a past. Stifled in an arranged marriage,she dared to take a chance at love and was abandoned by the father of her child.She fled to a small town outside Cambridge and even though her husband claimed the child as his own, she has lived a secluded life with her son trying to live downher notorious past.John Caldwell is a sweet Beta guy. He's puzzled as to why this Lady is socold towards him initially but since he's not a member of the ton, he doesn't knowof her past. As John is a self made man and has to watch his step in TrinityCollege society, he soon learns that his growing friendship with the reclusivewidow and her son could cost him dearly.Catherine Blair has written a sweet, gentle character centered love story.Since it's set outside of London and the Season, we get a refreshinglydifferent look at regency society and a reminder that those who fell fromgrace did indeed have to worry about \\"what society would say.\\"The main characters are people I felt happy spending more time withand for whom I rooted all the way. Especially nice is the relationshipbetween John and Eleanor's son William who truly does act like aneight year old boy. The pace of the romance is slow and steadyand never gave me the feeling I was watching 21st century peopleplaying at dress-up.If I have a qualm, it is in how Eleanor is suddenly accepted bya large section of the female society around Cambridge and inher small village after having spent eight years there feeling as ifshe would be shunned if she dared poke her head outside. Theresolution of the outside conflict also felt a bit fairy tale like, evenif it was nice to see the minor villain get his comeuppance."},{"Title":"A Notorious Lady (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"This was the first book I read by Blair and I loved it. She is very creative and keeps the story interesting. I loved the personalities of both Lady Eleanor and John Caldwell. I always like it when a child is involved too. This was another one I could not put down and handed around to a lot of friends to read. They loved it too!"},{"Title":"A Notorious Lady (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Catherine Blair's latest Regency-era is not your usual fare: it features a nobly born heroine with a scandalous past and a humbly born hero who also happens to have a chip on his shoulders. Tied to a previous novel \\"A Scholarly Gentleman,\\" \\"A Notorious Lady\\" focuses on the story of the scandalous Lady Eleanor Whitcombe, whose painful and colourful past, affected the lives of both the hero and heroine of \\"A Scholarly Gentleman.\\" This is Lady Eleanor's tale.After her \\"fall from grace,\\" beautiful Lady Eleanor Whitcombe retired to Potton (a small village near Cambridge University) in order to raise her son, William. In Potton, Lady Eleanor hoped to live down her notorious reputation and to be left in peace. She has only one friend, Jordan Blakley DeVaux, who knows the most intimate details of her past, but who, nevertheless, has stood a friend, helping her move to Potton and helping her raise William. And for years, he has been urging Lady Eleanor to shed her quiet life and to socialize more; and for years Lady Eleanor has turned a deaf ear to his pleas, until now. A chance meeting with a colleague of DeVaux's raises all kinds of feelings in Lady Eleanor that she had thought dead: anger, disdain and attraction. Professor John Caldwell, Lady Eleanor discovers, just happens to be a totally aggravating, judgemental and sinfully attractive man, whom she quickly realizes, is attracted to her in spite of himself. Should she unbend and allow the man to become a friend? Years of being judged, insulted, cut and propositioned has taught Lady Eleanor caution. But would any harm come from allowing John Caldwell to become a friend, especially since William likes him so? And what to do about her conflicting feelings for John Caldwell? Will he be satisfied with a respectable friendship? Would she? Suddenly Lady Eleanor is confronted with decisions and choices long closed to her...\\"A Notorious Lady\\" was a very well written book, that made for some sobering reading. Catherine Blair did a magnificent and unsentimental job of painting Lady Eleanor's plight. Not many Regency-era romance novels possess heroines who are fallen women, and the author's stark rendering of what Lady Eleanor's life has been like since her move from London, raised the level of this particular novel above most others, I thought. It was truly easy to empathize and sympathize with Lady Eleanor. John Caldwell, on the other hand, was a little more difficult to relate to, mainly because he keeps failing to come up to snuff when he's obviously supposed to! But even that quibble fades away since he behaves satisfactorily in the end, when it really counts. However, while this is a well written, nicely pace, out-of-the-ordinary novel, I did feel that more could have been made of the romance between Lady Eleanor and John. Somehow the story of Lady Eleanor's sobering circumstances somewhat eclipsed the romance angle of the story. However, this quibble aside, \\"A Notorious Lady\\" is still worth recommending as a good, worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Notorious Lady (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"John Caldwell, now a professor at Cambridge, is a man of humble beginnings. He grew up in Cheapside, and he has little tolerance for London gentry. When he meets Eleanor Whitcombe (\\"Lady\\" Whitcombe, a widow), he expects her to radiant and uppity. However, she is not what he expected. She aloof, not flashy, and overprotective of her son. Professor Caldwell is intrigued. The more he gets to know her, the more he wants to unravel her mystery. Why would any lady of society choose to tuck herself away in a small town?Wherever Eleanor goes, her scandalous past seems to follow her. She made bad judgements in the past, and she desperately seeks a new beginning. Her long-time friend, Lord De Vaux, introduces her to Professor Caldwell, whose endless questions are sometimes infuriating. Lady Whitcombe didn't want to let any man into her life... but Mr. Caldwell makes it difficult.Bottom line? Catherine Blair delivers another enjoyable story. It is bold and romantic, and very easy to read. While the characters were not always loveable (they have their faults--especially Eleanor), you find yourself rooting for them in the end. As Caldwell unravels the mystery, so does the reader. There are little surprises the whole way through.

This book is a nice addition to the bookshelf of the enterprising cook."},{"Title":"Slim Rails Through the Sand: A Graphic Presentation of the Carson & Colorado- Southern Pacific Narrow Gauge","review":"Only half of this book is what the title and cover present. The 2nd half is titled \\"Modeler's Portfolio\\" and contains some general information about model railroading along with pictures and measurements of different pieces of rolling stock and buildings. On one hand I was happy to have that info as it's relevant to me. On the other hand this is more like a 50 page book with a 60 page appendix if you know what I mean.The books text is somewhat simplistic. It breezes over some topics and I found it hard to follow the actual history of this railroad as sometimes the text jumps in time periods -- it was a bit confusing in that regard. The cover notes that there are 200 photos in the book, which is accurate. Many of these photos however I've already seen online or in other resources. The actual text content of the book is rather slim. I read the history portion in about an hour.Overall this book is \\"OK\\". It's not one of the best railroad books I've ever read but it's not bad either. Considering Mallory Ferrell's book of this railroad sells for $175+ this is a much more affordable choice if this line is your interest."},{"Title":"Self-help","review":"This is classic, but everyone needs to read it.

Probably amazon made a mistake."},{"Title":"Self-help","review":"The following review is based on the Oxford World's Classics edition, edited bby Peter W. Sinnema.'Self-Help' was published in 1859 in England, and became the instant bestseller, with 20,000 copied sold within the year after publication, making Samuel Smiles a household name. It is hard to categorize this book into any genre, but basically 'Self-Help' is a statement on the virtues of hard working, or in Smiles's favorite word, 'perseverance,' amply illustrated by many examples of biographical records collected by Smiles.The chapter names would show the contents -- 'Self-Help: National and Individual'; 'Leaders of Industry: Inventors and Producers'; 'Three Great Potters'; 'Application and Perseverance'; 'Helps and Opportunities'; 'Workers in Art'; 'Industry and the Peerage'; 'Energy and Courage'; 'Men on Business'; 'Money: It's Use and Abuse'; 'Self-Culture: Facilities and Difficulties'; 'Example: Models'; 'Character: The True Gentleman.'Each chapter tells you the examples of hard work and its eventual triumph, and with many biographical episodes, Smiles argues the importance of being earnest, no matter where the supposed readers belong to the social ladder of England. For example, in the Chapter 'Three Great Potters' you can see the life of three potters -- Palissy, Bottgher, and Wedgwood -- and how they. in spite of the numerous obstacles rushing to them, succeeded in their art, with which their names were recorded in the history.Like this, Smiles' book has a pattern -- it states its point first, championing the virtue of hard work, then he supports his statement with mini-biographies about many people, which include that of mechanics, philanthropists, scientist, musicians, soldiers, politicians, merchants, and many others. But as this is written in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, many pages are devoted to the inventors of new machines, or their privation, suffering, and final victory.Often his styles are preachy, and Smiles didn't include many remarkable women who should have been included (if he does, those women's roles are often as men's 'help-mates'), and it has been pointed out since the publication that the cases Smiles cites as examples are all successful ones. But as it was written long time ago, we should take the book as it is now.Oxford editon included concise introduction by Peter W. Sinnema, and helpful notes and glossary of the names the book deals with.This is not a so-called 'how-to' book (if you want to read that way, of course you can), but a good proof as to how Victorian working class and lower-middle class thought about being 'viruous' and 'respectable.' If you want to see the glimpse of Victorian ideas among ordinary people, and how such ideas greatly influenced the writers like Dickens who created Mr. Bounderby in 'Hard Times,' you should read this book."},{"Title":"Self-help","review":"Because of this book the Japanese learned to be servants instead of masters. \\"Self Help\\" Totally Changed History of Japan. STRANGE BUT TRUE! The now almost unknown book in English 'Self Help' published in England in 1859 and then translated into the Japanese language, dramatically changed the history of Japan (and even the history of the world) as much as 'Mein Kompf' changed Germany or the \\"Communist Manifesto' changed the history of Russia or China.How could this be? Self help was a series of lectures given by a physician named Samuel Smiles to a group of boys in England who came out of the mines, mills, and factories that wanted an education. They met together in an abandoned cholera hospital to try and educate each other. Those who knew a little taught those who knew less. They called themselves the 'mutual improvement youths'.Smiles accepted an invitation to \\"talk to them a bit\\" and told them the stories of the men that gave England the Industrial Revolution. The lectures then became the book 'Self Help'. Smiles said the stories were \\"almost gospels\\" because they embodied the principle of service. The highest and best you could be was to to become a servant by inventing something for the betterment of mankind.Admiral Perry opened the doors of the Japan in a steamship that the Japanese never knew existed. He then built for the Japanese to see, a model locomotive railroad with tracks. Then Perry installed and demonstrated a telegraph line. The Japanese saw technology they never knew existed and wanted to catch up with a world that was in the midst of an industrial revolution. Using as a guide to do this, they translated the book 'Self Help' into the Japanese language.A missionary to Japan told me there were nine million copies of 'Self Help' translated into Japanese. I have no way of confirming these numbers but it was enough to completely saturate the nation. 'Self help' became the pattern for the industrial development of Japan with the overriding principle of, \\"He that is greatest among you shall be your servant\\". From the book 'Self Help' Japan became a whole nation of servants. You see an expression of the belief (that every person should be a servant) in the bowing the Japanese do when greeting someone or saying goodbye, wherein each person bows again and again trying to go lower than the other person, as if to say, \\"I am lower than you. I am your servant\\".Student executives for a major Japanese corporation have to go to the companies employees and clean their toilets. Because of 'Self Help' the guiding principle of Japanese corporations is TOP DOWN SERVICE. This made Japan the second most productive nation on earth.

In contrast, BOTTOM UP COMPULSORY SERVICE MAKES MEN SLAVES.There was \\"bottom up compulsory service\\" in Communist China under Communism and the people were slaves. Since the Cultural Revolution, we have witnessed the effects of 'Self Help' and service in Modern China with the introduction of the same principles that made Japan prosperous.The miracle of modern China repeats the story of a nation moving from poverty and slavery to wealth and prosperity based on WHO SERVES WHO. Fifty years ago in China under a Communist government of slavery with \\"bottom up compulsory service\\", there were thirty million people starving to death.Today (because of the miracle of service) China has become one of the most powerful nations on earth. There is an abundance of food and almost no one is starving. What made the difference? One simple act: China gave the land in the collective farms back to the peasants.

It never has and it never will.Planned economies have never been able to produce enough food to feed their own people.

The works of Sam Smiles are often attributed as the inspiration for many later works on the subject as well as plenty of successful individuals; and for good reason. Smiles is a very talented writer and proved to offer insights of a timeless quality.Self Help provides a fantastic overview of the importance of developing yourself, not just for your own needs, but for the betterment of society. Smiles focuses on the core attributes such as attention, persistence, imagination, and patience. He also deals in depth with character, thrift, and humility. Although these topics have been handled countless times by many successful authors, few have done as much justice to them nor have many matched Smiles' ability to express why these attributes are so important.Smiles manner of writing is eloquent and flowing. He provides an incredible amount of examples to support his points. Although he acknowledges the equal importance of studying those who failed as well as those who succeeded, he justifies a focus on the latter merely by matter of interest and intrigue. The book is an impressive collection of stories about those who lifted themselves from small beginnings to great successes using the principals outlined in the book.Although there is no secret recipe for success, Smiles work is a testament to the importance of maintaining the right attitude in various areas to at least greatly increase the probability of success. Without question, if all you do is read this book to gain the some of the knowledge Smiles has to offer, you will be a better person for having read the book. Beyond that, the sky is the limit."},{"Title":"Self-help","review":"This is an excellent book, written in 1859. I was delighted at its relevance to today.
