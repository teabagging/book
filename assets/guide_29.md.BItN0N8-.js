In 99 pages, we read a variety of quotations from Mother Teresa. Recurring themes include nature, prayer, and love. We learn that the attention she got from the media was a burden to her, endured willingly because publicity for her work drew attention to the poor. She found speaking in public torture, saying it was easier for her to bathe a leper than to answer a journalist's questions.The content of these brief passages is complemented by Mother Teresa's gift for language, for example, \\"I am only God's pencil, one that he uses to sketch whatever he wants,\\" and \\"love's garment has a hem that reaches into the dust, and brushes it away.\\" Every page has a message with the power to inspire."},{"Title":"Final Curtain: Deaths of Noted Movie and Television Personalities, 1912-1998","review":"This is the ultimate book of celebrity death.

I have also purchased the book as gifts for many friends who have the same interests. One of the critics wrote &quot;causes of death are generic or missing&quot;. Until recently doctors could list heart attack, seizure,tumor, etc in a generic manner. Some states may still allow this but in California all underlying causes of death must be totally explained with a clinical type diagnosis on one to four lines on the death certificate. Although a public record it's not that easy to attain one. You do have to have some kind of need to know. I love the idea of listing the status of the person such as star, character actor, bit player, etc. Photos would be divine but probably cost prohibitive.

Victoria was no exception through her long reign, but the sort of people with whom she surrounded herself changed as she aged -- and especially after the death of the Prince Consort, when the Queen went into near-seclusion. Some of those who had her ear were, naturally, aristocrats, and some of those were politicians, especially Lord Melbourne during her earlier reign. Others came from the upper middle class, like Disraeli (whom she admired) and Gladstone (whom she disliked almost to paranoia). Still others were household staff and servants, including Sir Henry Ponsonby, her tactful private secretary, her doctor, Sir William Jenner (who was completely under her thumb), and John Brown, her rough-hewn \\"gillie\\" and personal servant whom both the court and her own children despised. And as her children grew up and married into European royal and noble families, Victoria began an intense correspondence, especially with her eldest daughter, Victoria, mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who also tried to influence British affairs through his grandmother in her last years. The author brings his attention to detail and sense of style to this first-rate study of the \\"off the record\\" side of a monarch's existence."},{"Title":"The Elements of Reasoning, 2nd Edition (The Elements of Composition Series)","review":"&quot;The Elements of Reasoning&quot; offers a good introduction to using logic as a basis for making arguments.

A made for movie suspense story, if I ever saw one."},{"Title":"Desert Runner","review":"DESERT RUNNER is an entertaining read from start to finish. The escape of Reece from a prison in Mexico is mixed with the brutality of being a prisoner there and the softness of yearning to see and meet his daughter for the first time.

As a former librarian, I am especially impressed by the extensive research and descriptive detail evident in the writing of this first novel. The author engages the reader In chapter after chapter of Reece's agonizing progress through the harsh conditions of the Mexican Sierra's and gives meaning to the expression '! feel your pain'.

As other reviewers have stated, the scope of the book is rather broad, so there is surface coverage of lots of issues.However, there is a hidden gem in this book, Chapter 8. This chapter delves into the theory of wireless application development and presents some good foundational strategy for dealing with packet loss, discontinuous service, security holes, and so on. It also provides a good overview of the proper use of caching, compression, and reducing overhead.

The value of this book is it provides a solid foundation that needs to be in place before coding starts.It begins with basic concepts of how wireless infrastructure works. Developers can safely ignore this section of the book. I liked it because it sorted out the &quot;moving parts&quot; as well as the technological underpinnings. It also answered a lot of questions I had regarding where standards and the industry as a whole were headed, and the strengths and weaknesses of existing technologies and why 3G is so important. As an aside, I learned one trivial fact that had been bothering me: where did the name &quot;Bluetooth&quot; come from? Answer: It was named after a Danish king, Harald Blatand who brought unity among different groups of people. Blatand means Bluetooth in English. Not only does the name capture the spirit of Bluetooth as a technology, but this piece of trivia might gain you &quot;Alpha Geek&quot; status at a seminar or convention :-)From chapter 3 on, however, is of paramount interest to architects and developers because it gets into lower level details of GPRS, 3G and Bluetooth. The author provides all of the key characteristics of each technology from which a design and development strategy can be derived. Chapter 6 is where both developers and architects will gain information for performance aspects of their products. The author is meticulous in describing the issues and factors that will arise with protocols (the realities of TCP/IP over wireless in chapter 6 is priceless), and is supported with graphs and diagrams that a developer should carefully go over before writing a single line of code.Because of my focus in QA and SQA I thought chapter 14 on testing was particularly strong. Again, this is something that developers need to fully understand (as well as the rest of a project team), and the information provided in this chapter fills a large gap in the testing body of knowledge.In response to previous comments about this book: (1) Although the content on the CD ROM is out of date, the author's web site contains up-to-date artifacts and URLs. (2) I contacted the author directly (contact information is provided in the book) about the missing test documents cited on the cover of the book and found out that last minute copyright issues prevented their inclusion on the CD ROM. He sent me to where these documents could be obtained (for free) and they were well worth the effort. (3) The book is anything but basic - it gets into some low-level details such as timing and state diagrams that are essential for *properly* developing wireless applications.The author has a talent for packing an incredible amount of information into a paragraph and still holding your interest. He also comes across as authoritative and manages to cover a wide spectrum of issues and facts without compromising on details needed by developers and architects (or anyone who wants to update their knowledge on the latest wireless technologies)."},{"Title":"GPRS and 3G Wireless Applications: Professional Developer's Guide","review":"Andersson states that the book is \\"ideal for those who know a bit about software/Web development and who want to get into the wireless field.\\" As a member of that group, I found the book to be exactly what I needed: a comprehensive guide into the vast and technical world of GPRS and 3G. The chapters are far reaching in breadth and depth so that the reader walks away with a solid understanding and technical base, as well as clarity into the GPRS and 3G technology arena from an application development and deployment perspective. The three sections are divided up so that the reader is led step by step through the history, applications, relationships, and components of GPRS and 3G.

I thought it would be a good idea to have a collection of tools compiled in one CD for me. Let me tell you before you get frustrated like me. The whole 650 MB capacity CD contain the Nokia WAP Toolkit (an old version), and a WAP Toolkit of Ericsson plus Ericsson R380 emulator and that's it! No editors, no GPRS simulators.

I recommend the book highly, not only as an example of literary clarity and beauty, but also as an example of a strong personality balanced with the tenderness of love for the craft."},{"Title":"Elements","review":"Laura Johnson's work is truly outstanding.

In fact, it is a history of weaving, written by a man who spent his life in the mills, with special emphasis on the developments in weaving provided by the company he worked for, Craftex.If you are new to the world of commercial textiles and don't need anything more recent than 1973, this book may be a good place to start. Knowing the subsequent destruction of the American textile industry gives some of the chapters a bittersweet aftertaste.The book provides interesting coverage of the development and naming of rayon.Mostly, the book is a paean to the development of the power Craftex Jacquard loom, up to the early 70s. It is not directly useful to handweavers, except as additional background. The Craftex company is still in production, making fabrics for the commercial market."},{"Title":"The loom has a brain;: The wonderful world of the weaver's art","review":"the loom has a brainthe wonderful world of the weaver's artby herman blum1966limited, handmade copy signed by the authorcontents include\\"the g-ds sell everything for toil\\"the magic of yesterdays textilesgobbledygook ~ minissimo! simplified textile definitionstextile fiber and fabric definitionsfederal trade commission trade rules and regulationsrayon - the word coolidge couldn't find in the dictionarylet us use the wonders of the past and be grateful for which we have inheritedthe metamorphosis of the ancient tapissier's artsource material: a study of superlative tenacity and its reflection on textile historynature, the master coloristthe antiquity of textiles and how it was recorded by pre-historic artists and their modern successors, the cartoonistsfabrics reveal man's thinking more than the hallucinogenic history of his warsweaving specifications and technical descriptions of incan and coptic fabric samples in blumhaven libraryour american indians: the parentage of their weaving artportrait weaving masterpieceautomotive fabricspassport to elegancetapestrythe development of power loomsand even more! contains many photosthis is an extraordinary book!"},{"Title":"All about begonias","review":"This book has been my first source of information about Begonias since I first found it on the shelves of the library back in my high school years. Later, when I started my Garden library, it was one of the first books I sought out and, after forty years, I still refer to it often.Other books have since been written, but few give such a complete guide to the care and propagation of begonias, as well as a good outline of the varieties of begonias available at the time of writing. Although thousands of hybrid varieties and hundreds of new species have been introduced since, many of the varieties she describes are still available.She starts by telling us what a begonia is and gives us a picture of the many types of plants in the genus and the range of habitats. The opening paragraphs of this introduction include what I consider some of the most poetic images I have ever read in a non-fiction book. It left me with an appetite to learn more about the genus Begonia that has never been sated. There is always more to learn and it is usually fascinating.she then follows with an excellent section on how to care for the plants, (One statement has stood out in my mind for forty years. Speaking about light, she says that if you can read the pages of a phone book, there is enough light for most Begonias. The book is filled with such simple, common sense pieces of advice.) followed by an even better section on propagation. This is followed by a section on common pests and problems. It is interesting to note that most of the insecticides she mentions are now outlawed. It is a wonder that so many gardeners from that era survived since some of those chemicals were a hundred times worse than agent orange. It is also interesting that most of the problems she describes are easily solved by changes in culture rather than by chemical treatment.But the meat of the book is the sections devoted to the many varieties available and how to care for them. This is a major work in itself since there are presently 1,600 species of begonia and more being discovered every year, and they come from every part of the tropical world.She handles this problem by dividing the genus by growth habit, with an outline of the cultural requirements of each type. she then divides each group into easy, intermediate and difficult to grow varieties. Of course, there is not enough room in the book for all of the varieties available at that time, but she does quite a good job of covering the most important ones. A greenhouse containing only the plants she mentions in the book would have to cover several city blocks and contain at least three different climate zones.The whole tone of the book is basically practical, commonsense advice, She deliberately avoided the technical in favor of simple,everyday language. As a high school sophomore with little knowledge of scientific and biological language, I had no trouble following her comments and descriptions.For those with who want a more technical coverage of the Genus, there are more complete books available, but for a beginner who just wants a overall picture of the genus and some excellent advice on how to grow them, this is just about the best book ever written on the subject."},{"Title":"All about begonias","review":"The information in this book is good if you can slug through the boring format.

Kurt Vonengut filled each page with detail and imagery (honestly, I felt the cold and damp that Howard Campbell was physically feeling - it was that vivid to me). But I never knew WHAT Howard Campbell REALLY was - Nazi sympathizer or spy - sending secret messages through a hate-filled radio broadcast?? Did he become so good at what he was pretending to be that he really started to feel that way? Hmmm...I guess that was the purpose of the story - to leave you guessing.

He starts to cooperate with the US army but not out of any moral ground. He doesn't hate the Nazis, he doesn't love them either. All he cares about is his writing and his wife. And that's enough for him. But his skills are demanded by both sides. The Nazis want him for the Propaganda, and the US as a spy. So he starts to work for both. And he is loyal to both.When the war is over his world doesn't exist anymore. The only remaining thing is his secret tie with the victorious US army.

Here is the best book I have read so far this year. American Howard W. Campbell Jr. winds up living in Germany in the pre-world war years, due to family circumstances. When war breaks out there, he is an unassuming playwright. He is recruited as an American spy agent, and agrees, without much conviction, to give it a try. He is wildly successful, not only for the Americans, but for the Germans as well. His role there as a radio propagandist earns him legions of devout young followers, and he quickly rises in prestige among the German Reich. And his own identity, if he ever really had one, becomes murky in the life that has taken shape for him. The story follows him as decades go by after the war, and he is living an unassuming life in America again, except for his status as a Nazi war criminal. He has seemingly been abandonded by his Amercian government.The book is short, and is packed with powerful moments. It is impressive how the imagery and moods are so effectively laid out with each short scene. Every few pages evokes emotion that should have taken many chapters to achieve. Campbell is a brutally honest character when it comes to his analysis of his own nature, feelings, actions and intentions. The story is told in the format of a journal he is writing about his experiences, while awaiting his war trial. Verdicts are left to the reader, as to what his responsibility truly was. I found him to be a very tragic figure, all in all, perhaps unable to sort out for himself what his true identity and nature was.Broken down, this could be another case to support the \\"war is hell\\" theme. But it is, at its heart, a study of human character. It is, I believe, a celebration of the written word. Vonnegut throws that party like few I have read."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I love this book. I think it is an excellent and somewhat terrifying examination of the concept of moral responsibility. The narrator is conscious of the harm he can cause if he manipulates the truth so he consciously realizes that he is even more guilty of atrocities than those who truly believe in their cause and commit evil out of ignorance or some kind of deep psychological disturbance (or blind faith). Wow."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"It's hard to overdo the superlatives when reviewing Kurt Vonnegut, so when describing the classic \\"Mother Night,\\" \\"unparalleled\\" comes pretty easily. This is an extraordinary novel that will smack you like a two-by-four between the eyes on many levels. There's man's inhumanity to man in the unthinkable atrocities of Hitler's Germany, told unvarnished yet without the more typically requisite hand-wringing. And then there's the deeply emotional love story told, I thought, with a passion uncommon in Vonnegut's scalpel-edged cynicism and black humor. But most extraordinary in this masterpiece is the dissection of moral dilemma, told from the viewpoint of protagonist Howard W. Campbell. Campbell was born in America but lived in Germany since childhood, rising to become Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbel's chief radio voice of The Third Reich - an American spewing hate for America and for Jews while heaping praise upon his jack-booted Nazi masters. A man justifiably despised by Israel and the west as a traitor and monster, except for one cruel Vonnegutian twist: Campbell is a deep - very deep - undercover agent for the US, who throughout the war infused his hate-speech with coded messages greatly aiding the war effort of the ally forces.Campbell tells his story in 1961 while in an Israeli prison cell awaiting trail as a Nazi war criminal. From his days in Germany treading a dangerous path between the fascists and the shadowy spy master who pulls his strings to a cloistered secret life in New York City following the war, Vonnegut spins a tale that is wholly immersive - a haunting story of a man who has played both on poles for so long that his morale compass can no longer distinguish north from south. And if Campbell's life and head wasn't already muddled enough, Vonnegut delivers one final mean twist via the Soviet Union that is as ironic as it is unexpected.A few years back, the talented Martin Cruz Smith wrote a scorching soul-searcher, \\"December 6\\" of an American ex-pat in Tokyo immediately prior to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. Looking back, and taking nothing away from Smith's extraordinary effort, it seems clear that \\"Mother Night\\" influenced and inspired Smith in crafting his own treatise of the kind of moral vs. patriotic conflict that war can produce. \\"Mother Night\\" is that kind of book - one that you'll remember, one that will haunt you - one of those rare books you'll want to keep handy to refer back to from time to time. A milepost of American fiction from a 20th Century master - a classic that is long overdue in replacing Charles Dickens or Willa Cather in the fiction our kids are fed in high school English classes."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"What an extraordinary book! Out of countless layers of irony and a keen perception of human motivations and human foibles, Vonnegut has created a work simple in its narrative layout but almost infinitely complex in its implications. This is the sort of book in which is enjoyed the most when thinking about it months or years afterwards. Extraordinary."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Most people claim Slaughterhouse Five or Breakfast of Champions as his greatest, but I must say, Iput Mother Night right up there. The plot, loaded through and through with flashbacks to the main character's past life as a secret agent for the American Government while working as &quot;the last true American&quot; for the Nazi propaganda machine, he's hunted down by neo-Nazi idol-worshippers, communist spies, and an Israeli government desperate to put him on trial for his crimes against humanity. It is an eye-opening excercise into the human mind, loaded with Vonnegut's omnipresent wit and sarcasm. Definitely a must read for any Vonnegut fan."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"All I can say is, this book changed my life. I read it in the mid 70's, and have never forgotten it's message: You are who you pretend to be. So, you had better be very careful who you pretend to be."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is one of my favorite Vonnegut novels. The overall story is somewhat sad, frustrating, and depressing, but, Vonnegut still somehow finds ways to insert humor, beauty, etc....so that ultimately, Mother Night in no way bogs down the reader, or puts you in a sour mood. I'm amazed at how Vonnegut can, at times, find gems of beauty in ugly situations. His unique description of the dream-like stairway to a roofless night sky in a ravaged, war-torn land stands out in my mind vividly to this day.Excellent writing throughout... highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Here is the fictional autobiography of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., as given by the awesome Vonnegut.Without giving away key plot points, I'll recommend this book right off the bat. Here is Vonnegut, yes if you can believe it, decrying the state of humanity, witfully and ironically too. There is a given moral sense to Mother Night, which Vonnegut states in the Introduction: \\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be.\\"And Mother Night is a story of how Howard W. Campbell, Jr. and his associates must and do and will deal with said moral.Mother Night is quite moving, in the way that so much Vonnegut is; in that here is a hero or anti-hero, a lead if you will, who is shaped rather than shapes his or her time. And how that shaping baffles, sparkles, crushes, devoures, stimulates and paralyzes.Given an opportunity to be someone else, and taken to the fullest, for a good cause (or not), where are you then? You only have yourself....in the end....to blame....Again, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I've been on a Vonnegut binge as of late, reading a novel a week in what has become a sort of obsession. Mother Night is by far his most compasionate novel. It's a bittersweet tale of a misunderstood American Nazi Propagandist spy (working for the U.S., only nobody can know this) named Howard W. Campbell (Jr.) After the war, he is forced to live in solitude in any place he wishes. He chooses New York City, where his hopes of being lost in the crowd go unfulfilled. He lives the rest of his days in peace and solitude. That is untill he gets a knock on the door from some old war buddies. Now, one would imagine that living with the pain and anguish of causing millions of deaths would get to a person after a while. Only this is not the case for Howard W. Campbell (Jr.). He seeks solace in a love lost. In some of the most heartbreaking scenes ever written on a piece of dead tree. Mother Night is a must read for anyone looking for insight into the human condition (as are all Vonnegut novels!).Pick up Mother Night, and prepare to become a die hard Vonnegut fan all over again."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I generally get around to reading this book once a year. I also tend to buy it once a year as I seem to hand it out like a Jehovas Witness with a copy of WatchTower.All in all, it's not the biggest waste of my money. This is perhaps the finest literature penned in English. Read it. You will laugh when you really think you should be crying."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Though this is the most humorless of the Vonnegut novels I've read, I also believe it makes a rather profound statement about the true meanings of good and evil. Though this is only my interpretation, I believe this novel is a statement against those who would put the nature of right and wrong in rigid, unnegotiable divisions. It encourages the reader to take a moment and think before judging a situation solely on personal biases. A quote from this book that particularly struck me, and I believe reflects the theme of the novel is this:&quot;Say what you want about the sweet miracle of unquestioning faith, I consider a capacity for it terrifying and absolutely vile!&quot;I hesitate to give this book five stars only because I reserve that rating only for books that leave me with the feeling that I won't read something that good for quite awhile. Nonetheless, an excellent book that has my recomendation."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Authors have long had a great flaw in portraing good and evil in humans. The characters portrayed in art almost always seem to be either good or evil. Vonnegut, one of the best observers of human nature manages in this book to portray we humans as we really are, a composite of many things.Our hero, Howard, is a American spy in Germany during WWII. A profession that would be the most nobel and great characters in anything but a Vonnegut work. Here he faces a delema, his cover is that of a Nazi propagandist. He is in fact the finist most convincing Nazi propagandist. The question is which side did he help more.On the other side of the coin is a absurdly insane American Nazi dentist/embalmer. Yet oddly enough this character has gaps his his racist record. He never writes his insane essays about the inferior teeth of jews and blacks while he's married and loved.There is an American war hero turned alcoholic who's drivin to take what little joy in Howards life away from him.A Jew who survives Hitler by forging papers and joining the SS.A camp survivor who wishes nothing more then forget the whole bloody thing and get on with his life and his mother who gains wisdom through her suffering.Vonnegut turns the world inside out in what I consider the best literary treatment of human morality ever written"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is a wonderful tale with the adage \\"damned if you don't, damned if you do\\". In this witty and sarcastic novel, we see an American/German agent Howard Campbell Jr. in the (then present) 1960s in prison in Israel. He is penning his autobiography (a common writing style that Vonnegut was fond of), and reminisces back to the pre-war times as well as a large chunk of the book about the time after the war and up to his capture. He was recruited by the US to serve as a spy, broadcasting his messages during his anti-semite and anti-American German broadcast. While Germans praised his radio broadcasts, Americans and Jews despised and reviled him. What makes the situation worse is that nobody really covers for Campbell after the war. He is more or less cut loose to just deal with the aftermath on his own.Campbell is an odd duck. He seems so lost at times, that it appears he almost wants to get caught. When he goes into hiding in New York, he doesn't even change his name. What is different about this novel compared to others is that Campbell is really the main focus and there isn't much fleshing out of tangent characters. Instead tangent characters appear as archetypes that Vonnegut is quick to deconstruct. In fact, this is one of his signature styles, used more in this novel than in others such as Bluebeard and Sirens of Titan. Despite the lack of characterization of supporting characters, the character Campbell is complex enough to satisfy many Vonnegut fans.The story moves forward, explaining the reasons behind his acceptance of such a self destructive espionage assignment, and the reason for his capture. The novel works towards an ending that is among the best in my opinion of any Vonnegut novel. The final two lines are worth reading the entire novel just to get there. Please don't look ahead and spoil it!I would say this is a very good Vonnegut work. I would NOT recommend this as an introduction to his work for any first timer. Instead try Player Piano, Bluebeard, or even Sirens of Titan (one of my favorites) or Slaughterhouse Five. This doesn't quite grip one as much as the main body of his work, but it is definitely among his best. I did read it over two days, picking it up every chance I got. But it didn't cause me to skip real life in favor of reading as did Slaughterhouse Five or Cat's Cradle.I highly recommend this for anyone who has read another Vonnegut novel. Even if this is your first Vonnegut, it's not the toughest to get into and absorb. That would be Cat's Cradle. Which is probably the most rewarding of any of his works.PS: Howard Campbell Jr. appeared in Slaughterhouse Five, years before Mother Night was written."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"&quot;Mother Night&quot; is one of those books that is hard to put down. The main character and his life as a playwrite is excellently done by Vonnegut, with his usual twists, turns, and sudden revelations. This book is a must to read!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Howard Campbell's &quot;contributions&quot; to World War II are put under a moral microscope that is unable to yield a verdict of good or bad. With a set of characters that epitomizes the term &quot;black humor,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut examines the motives of the U.S. and German governments as well as the limits of the human conscience. Vonnegut creates darkly humorous characters, such as the Black Fuhrer, to surround Campbell in his struggle to reconcile his past and the consequences of his actions. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been interested in the moral complications of the World War II ideologies of the western world. It is fascinating and disturbing and will make any reader study his/her own conscience."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"What can I say about this book? I loved it! Hell, I wish I wrote it!!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I have only read about 4 other Vonnegut books and this one is hands down my favorite.

If you have never read any Vonnegut, this is a good place to start"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"When I first read this novel, directly after readingCat's Cradle, I was disappointed. There was something there that I felt that it lacked. The normal Vonnegut wit and humor only surfaced momentarily. But after much recollection about this, I feel that it is indeed a truly tremendous and well thought out story about a man discovering his own inhumanity. I highly recommend this novel to the experienced Vonnegut reader, others should be weary. (Also see the movie! A great adaptation."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I once heard this wonderful little quote:\\"Valor is to do unwitnessed what we would like to do in front of the whole world.\\"I think this quote applies very aptly to the main character of this book--he traded his wife, his career, and his sanity for a hidden role in a noble cause. At this point many (possibly including the author) would disagree with me. After all, was he not a Nazi? If Germany had won the war, would he not have continued to rant on in his propanganda-filled shows?Unlikely. Considering how even Russia found out about his status as an American spy, I dare say that his secret would not have remained one for long in the mirror scenario.The ultimate result of his choice would have been ignominious death no matter what the outcome of the war.Finally, what about \\"you could never have served the enemy as well as you served us?\\" The veracity of that statement is moot to debate because we are not given exact information on the nature of messages he sent. Even if the statement *was* true, the fault would lie with his recruitor and FDR, not himself. The path of being a Nazi propagandist was paved by those two--Campbell could have easily been a neutral playwright through the war, and emerged unscathed in either outcome of the war.Thus, my contention is that Campbell was a true hero."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The story of Howard Campbell is compelling. All of the differing supporting characters are interesting. Since most of the other reviews are so good, I'll just say that this is a book that is a joy to read and is easy to read. It is relatively short and Vonnegut writes in a style that makes you want to finish the book in one night. Also of interest is the movie Mother Night starring Nick Nolte which stays very close to the book and features a cameo by Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"MOTHER NIGHT was first published in 1961. It's amazing how little things have changed.Howard W. Campbell, Jr., Vonnegut's major character, is an American who has lived in Germany since his father was transferred there when he was eleven. As an adult he is making a good living as a playwright when he is approached by a man named Frank Wirtanen who recruits him to spy for America. Wirtanen warns him that America will never admit they recruited him as a spy. Campbell becomes one of the most famous propagandists in the Nazi party, but during his broadcasts, his coughs and verbal pauses and other mannerisms send important messages to the Allies.At the end of the war he is captured by Bernard B. O'Hare as a war criminal, but Wirtanen comes to his rescue and helps him escape to America where he is living in a run-down attic.At the beginning of the novel Campbell is about to stand trial in Israel, having been outed by a Russian spy named Kraft-Potapov. Prior to his arrest, he is reunited with his wife Helga who he thought was dead. He is also celebrated by a collection of weird American neo-Nazis led by a crazy dentist named Lionel J.D. Jones, who thinks he can prove Jewish and negro inferiority using their teeth. Jones also publishes a newspaper called The White Christian Minuteman.When Campbell's address is revealed in The White Christian Minuteman, all kinds of so-called patriots come looking for him, the foremost of whom is Bernard B. O'Hare, now a failed businessman who has devoted his life to the recapture of hero/war criminal Campbell.Irony runs rampant. No one is who he/she seems to be. For me the climax of the book was when O'Hare confronts Campbell. Campbell says to O'Hare, \\"There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate without reservation, to imagine that God almighty Himself hates with you, too. Where's evil? It's that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit, that wants to hate with God on its side.\\"Here we are in 2007, forty-six years later, and we've still got politicians and commentators reviling \\"evil-doers,\\" and Swift boaters portraying silver star winners as unpatriotic. It seems like we should've learned something in all that time."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is the sixth novel that I have read by Kurt Vonnegut, and like I expected, it did not fall short of the high expectations that I have had for all of his works.Howard Campbell is an American agent in Nazi Germany during World War II, and he has been assigned the job of being a propagandist on the radio and getting to know the people behind the Nazi government. Supposedly, he's sending secret codes to the U.S. military over the airwaves, although he is unaware what exactly he is sending.After the war he is protected by the U.S. government from trial despite the fact that he became very infamous during the war for his hate speech and propaganda. He isolates himself for several years in New York, where he is discovered by a Russian agent in disguise, who in turn tells the Israeli government about Campbell living in New York. The rest of the book is basically about Campbell dealing with this threat and the lessons he learns about putting on a mask and being someone that you are not.&quot;We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.&quot;In my opinion, this is not Vonnegut's best novel (Sirens of Titans is), and neither is it his worst (the worst that I have read so far is Breakfast of Champions). What makes the other novels a tad bit better are the messages given in them; I wish the theme in this book was a little stronger. However, it was a very enjoyable read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"As an avid Vonnegut reader, I found \\"Mother Night\\" to be particularly frightening and questionable...but in a good way. He points out the weaknesses of a government while also causing us to question morality. Howard Campbell was a Nazi, but a United States Government spy. Unfortunately, his actions caused a chain of events, leading to the death of many Jew's and causing a rise in nationalism for Germany. Only one other person knew he was legitamate in his actions, the man who recruited him. His life in radio propaganda used secret codes in his script. But then how do we consider a man who helped in the war effort by becoming the enemy? It's like answering the question, \\"Is it alright to steal a loaf of bread if your family is starving?\\""},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Prerequisite for Mother night is Palm Sunday, where Vonnegut bemoans the lost of his family's ties to German culture. Motehr night, like Speer's biography (and Arendt's interview with Eichman) is about how easily a seemingly ordinary person, this time Vonnegut imagining himself as an American in Germany before and during WWII, can fall into fascism out of opportunism. Sister book to this one (complementary) is Slaughterhouse Five, which Vonnegut did not have to invent because he was there for the show."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"A classic! Easily one of the best books ever written, and possibly Vonnegut's greatest work. The story of Campbell was so compelling, the first time I read it I finished it in one sitting. I am now reading it again for the fourth time, and it still enraptures me. Vonnegut's style is superb, and the skill with which he weaves this tale is astounding. The ending shocked me, and it still haunts me every time I read it. The only regret I have is that I can only give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"It's been some time since I finished reading Mother Night, so all I am left with is a smoldering memory of what I thought of the book at the time. Since that's what I have to work with, bear that in mind as you read this review. Like most Vonnegut books, this takes on a different level of writing than many of the books out there. As such, they're generally better than most anything you'll pull off the shelves of your local bookstore.Mother Night is no different, despite the fact it's not one of his best works. In his own words, Vonnegut describes this book as sub-par, or at best, average. For him, maybe I agree. But the book on its own merits is still quite good. Vonnegut has a way of writing that few can attain. He is both deep yet easy to read, a feat accomplished by few writers.In brief, the book is about an ex-Nazi radio host who is long removed from the war and generally trying to stay below the radar of modern times in America. His guilt or innocence is up to the reader to decide. There is more to the story than I suggest here. Readers of Vonnegut know that nothing is ever that simple in his books. Maybe that's because nothing is ever that simple in life to begin with. Vonnegut captures that in his works.The book is good, but not vintage Vonnegut. It moves well enough, but can be a tad slow at times. Overall, this is probably a 3.5 star book. Since there is no 3.5 rating, I am left to give it 4, since it's probably only fair to compare it with other fiction, and not only against his other works. Overall, for Vonnegut, I would say this is a solid 3: average, solid, enjoyable.Overall, not his best work, but worth the read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"So easy to read.....so deep.....so perfect a tale of pretending and its potential consequences. I wish I could add something new to the many excellent reviews here. Can't!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I give this book a 4 stars...It is great.The wonderful dry humor that is so true is matchless. It is really perfect.The story is about Campbell an allied agent who was a sort of a double agent Tokyo Rose of Nazi Germany broadcasting propaganda and at the same time relaying coded messages to the allies.Guess what happened to him after the war... read the book."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I began reading Vonnegut on the suggestion of one of my English teachers. Thus, far I have read six of his novels. Mother Night is the first one I've read which has any possibility of actually occuring (it's not science fiction).An American living in Germany becomes a spy for the Allies, loses everything that matters, thinks he regains it, then is crushed once more! Dark humor. check. Odd love scenes. check. great style. uncheck.The novels that made Vonnegut a name for himself such as Cat's Cradle and Slaughter-House Five are certaintly amiss here. His anthropologist side even faded a little bit. In fact, some of the plot was so cheesy it was strange to remind myself that one of my favorite authors wrote it.If you love Vonnegut pick this book up. It won't take long to read and you can decide for yourself. The book does deserve a 4/5 which is what I'm awarding it. It wins this due to just the right amount of cheek. However, I rather re-read Galapagos or Slapstick."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is one of Vonnegut's best and especially after reading Breakfast of Champions, this one surprised me. Vonnegut has best range of a writer that I have ever seen( or read in this case). In Breakfast Of Champions, he throws you into the modern day world and doesn't expect you to really take any of this seriously. In Mother Night he takes you on the journey of Howard W. Cambell Jr., through his time as a playwrite and author before the war, through his happy times with his wife,Helga, through his recruit ment by a dissapearing american soldier,and so on.Anyway I thought it was going to be hard to take this into heart, but I ended up beleiving every word. Mother Night is not only a great Vonnegut book, but a great read in itself, pick it up you won't be dissapointed.Hiho."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is almost insanely profound, and equally insanely easy to read. Never before have I read a book so packed with material for thought in such an easy to digest package...imagine eating cotton candy and getting the same satisfaction (and nutritional content!) as you would had you eaten a five-course meal. I just finished re-reading it, and am still somewhat in awe. The harried musings of a man who obviously has seen much, and is disappointed in what he sees, but with a shrug of the shoulders. This book made me stop to ponder until it hurt, and supplied me with my new favorite quote...&quot;It's a hard world to be ludicrous in.&quot;You can read this easily in one sitting, and puzzle over it for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Man, if any of his books really reflects his views on war, government, and patriotism, this one leads the pack. He lays the satire on pretty thick. Unlike _Bluebeard_, he handles the fictional biography idea well. The book is structured very nicely. Like _Bluebeard_ though, he provides one of the more satisfying conclusions to his story. Many of his books are weak when the end hits."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is an excellently written book by Vonnegut. These memoirs of a Nazi propagandist will force you to question the way you live your life. Are we who we pretend to be? Could doing evil thing for a good cause possibly make you an evil person? Is there anyting worth living for other than love. If these questions interest you, please read this book. The themes of this book will make you think."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This book started a bit slowly compared to other Vonnegut novels, and I suspect that is because the tone is a bit more muted, the humour more subtle. This is to be expected in a novel that positions the Holocaust as one of its central devices, and once I understood how the story was being approached I appreciated the difference to other Vonnegut efforts. It does pack all of the outrageous turns of fate and plot that you might expect, but they don't hit you with a laugh out loud momentum. Instead they hit you with a deep insight to the ambiguity of the characters, their lives and situations that carry forward the very profound central theme. Vonnegut states that the moral of the novel is that we are what we pretend, so we should be very careful about what we pretend to be. His tale illustrates this to perfection."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"The twists in this book blew me away. Never have I gasped while reading a book before. Perhaps my second favorite Vonnegut book behind bluebeard."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Initial Thoughts:I read this book for my Literature and War class.I've never read any of Kurt Vonnegut's other works but after this book I'm sure I will. After reading the description on the back, it was hard to imagine how an author could include humor in a situation where an American spy ends up in an Israeli prison, but Kurt Vonnegut had me laughing out loud. It was one of those laughs were you weren't sure if it was appropriate or politically correct, but it was so darn funny you just couldn't help it.Spoilers!Howard W. Campbell, our main character, was an American spy posing as a German Nazi. Throughout the book we get a lot of insight about what he did as a Nazi and why he was so effective. Howard really struggles with comprehending whether he was acting as an American or if he really had crossed the line into Nazi territory. This is where the \`chilling shade of gray' phrase comes from.Howard discusses his life before, during, and after the war up to the present time. The chapters weave together through the past and the present in such a fluid way, it was unlike anything I've ever read before. There are twists and turns I honestly did NOT see coming which kept the book exciting and turned it into a really fast read.I may have a weird or awkward sense of humor because I found most of this book hilarious. I'm not sure if anyone would agree with me so I've been trying to justify why I found it so funny and my conclusion is this: the Nazi view is so unlike my own, and their ideals are so ridiculous, I just couldn't help but laugh.Don't get the wrong idea though, this book did have its funny parts, but the war and the death is still a very present aspect. From Howard's point of view we see the deaths of Jews and Germans, something that to my knowledge hasn't been explored before in the same book. On one page you're learning about Howard's experience in a Jewish camp and in the next you're hearing about how a German he knew is killed. It was a wild experience to have these two events relayed so closely together and it puts this war into a new perspective.Conclusion:For whatever reason I loved this book. I was shocked by the ending, but I know I'll read it again. I'm definitely going to look into more of Vonnegut's work and I can't believe I haven't read more of him already!I also wanted to mention that the drawings on the front and back cover were made by Kurt Vonnegut, which I think is super cool! I also really enjoyed the Introduction and the Editor's Note and the names of the chapters. I think I just really like Kurt Vonnegut.Anyways, I'd recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in WWII, or an interest in spies. This book was a super fast read, I think it only took me five or so hours.Rating:4/5 stars"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut is tied as my favorite author along with Philip k Dick, however that doesn't mean I have loved all his books. But I must place this one under the \\"love\\" column. It has Vonnegut's trademark sarcasm and satiric voice going in full force along with his mastery of subtle humor. I would strongly recommend reading this book along with others of his; more specifically Breakfast of Champions, Cat's Cradle, and Slaughterhouse Five."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Poignant, satirical exploration of war, politics, love and society. The ease and enjoyment of reading these pages belies the breadth of life's mysteries which are touched in this sardonic tale."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"What I took away from this book was the idea that you'd better be meticulous with the maintenance of your own character, because you have very little control over anything else. While the protagonist was impacted by events not of his own making, it also was true that anything that he built turned against him, and every petty crime or minor indiscretion that he committed was granted a life of its own, grew to immense proportions, and returned to wreak havoc upon him. In the midst of all that, he maintained a great equanimity.I enjoyed the book immensely. It was humorous, farcical, and had a lot of plot twists. It was episodic, with each chapter/episode being a few pages long, so it moved along quite quickly. I haven't read much Vonnegut, but this is the one I enjoyed most, and would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is a short read but loved every page. I was skeptical at first, at first it seems like it's going to be regular book about the confessions of a Nazi war criminal.This is a book about serving evil too openly and good too secretly, and what it can do to a man pretending to be someone he's not."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut cracks me up. But after reading most of his novels, I think Mother Night is my favorite. Unlike some of his other works, it appears to be the most focused and clean. It zones in on Vonnegut's strengths: historically based (WWII) characters that give us social commentary and a main character with so many flaws that he becomes both sad and hilarious. I especially appreciated the point of view: 1st person narration from a jail cell, telling the back story to explain to the reader why this guy's in prison in Israel. It's also a daring perspective to take: that of a Nazi propagandist. How do you sympathize?-- but you do! Also, I laughed out loud at the dialogue in the final showdown between the narrator and the man who'd dedicated his life to killing him. It is ridiculous and thoughtful at the same time. How does Vonnegut do it? He was a master humorist and storyteller."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"one of his best books; a great read as is most of his work. Too bad he had to leave us."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is Slaughterhouse Five without time travel nor aliens. It's hysterical and puzzling. A great book for any fan of Kurt Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Another reviewer of this book titled his review &quot;Vonnegut: You can't read just one!&quot; Might I add that should you choose only one - This is it! In legendary Vonnengut style this book is humerous but dark. But compared to most of his other writings, the storyline of this book is very tight. And the fate of life, to which, the main character Howard W. Campbell Jr. is entitled, is almost too cruel to bear. This theme appear to be one of Vonnengut's favorites - the cruelty and irony of life. And as always he makes the point in humourous style. But in this novel much more is at play. It leaves one wondering about evilness as such. Are there such things in life for which no regrets are valid? Vonnengut tends to answer yes. But what is there of life, when you're left back with that? There is the sarchastic humor in which Vonnengut is a true master, covering up the fact that even good things gives you no pleasure when you've got the &quot;evil-mark&quot; upon you for life.This is probably one of the darkest novels I've ever come across, but also one of the very best. It forcefully presses some very important questions in a dark but nevertheless very humerous way. I really can't recommend it too much. I don't think anyone can read it without being deeply moved. But it ain't a book to make the sun start to shine. It's more like Monty Python signing &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; to cheer up Jesus during his crucifiction. It'll never turn too bad for a good laugh. But that's excactly how bad it turns out for Howard W. Campbell Jr in this book. Read it for yourselves!!!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut was a brilliant satirist, and much of this book is hilariously funny. Yet it has also something important to say about the moral questions raised by World War Two. Published in 1961 (Vonnegut's third novel), this anticipates his more famous war novelSLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVEby eight years, but it is no less unconventional in its view of the issues. Towards the end of his introduction to the 1966 edition, Vonnegut writes: \\"If I'd been born in Germany, I suppose I would have been a Nazi, bopping Jews and gypsies and Poles around, leaving boots sticking out of snowbanks, warming myself with my secretly virtuous insides. So it goes.\\" This is offensive, certainly -- but because it is flippant or because it is true? I can imagine few other authors who would have had the courage to say this; but I also know that although, with the self-canonization of hindsight, we might like to portray ourselves as heroic resisters, the reality in most cases would probably have been quite different.The book is presented as the confessions of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., written in an Israeli jail while awaiting trial for war crimes. Living in Germany during the interwar years, Campbell achieved some success as a playwright, mainly vehicles for his actress wife Helga. [He also kept a journal, entitled MEMOIRS OF A MONOGAMOUS CASANOVA, in which he told of his \\"conquests of all the hundreds of women my wife, my Helga, had been.\\" In this, at least, he was a romantic.] Just before war breaks out, he is recruited by an American spy master to offer his services to the Nazi hierarchy as a propagandist. So he spends the war making daily broadcasts whose content is virulently racist, but whose pattern of hesitations and speech mannerisms contains coded information for his own people. He is all too successful. At the end of the war, his father-in-law, now the chief of police in Berlin, says to him: \\"I realized that almost all the ideas that I hold now, that make me unashamed of anything I may have felt or done as a Nazi, come not from Hitler, not from Goebbels, not from Himmler -- but from you. You alone kept me for concluding that Germany had gone insane.\\" He succeeds so well that although the American authorities save him from hanging and enable him to go to ground in Greenwich Village, they can make no public acknowledgement of such a vilified figure.Campbell describes the next fifteen years as a purgatory worse than hell. But most of the novel focuses on the events that bring this to an end, as his address becomes known both to Israeli agents and to a neo-fascist group determined to exalt him as a hero. Although hilariously over the top, Vonnegut's satire of these American racial and religious extremists strikes quite a few targets even today. But Vonnegut uses the extremism to contrast with the much more reasonable morality growing within Campbell himself. Facing down a freelance assassin determined to rid the world of Evil, he says: \\"There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate without reservation, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too. Where's evil? It's that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit, that wants to hate with God on his side.\\"No, Vonnegut is not a Nazi, and though writing with humor, he does not condone. But he condemns extremism on ALL sides, and sees human beings as a lot closer together than their ideologies might proclaim them."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut plays with shades of gray throughout this novel. Roughly it's about an American spy who during WWII was an excellent propaganda machine for Germany. There's excellent tension within the character of Campbell, and throughout the novel I found myself torn between if he was guilty or innocent. All of the characters exist in gray, and for the main supporting characters their good and/or evil title is rather ambiguous. There are a few haunting phrases that pop up multiple times, usually in German, that tie the story together beautifully. Vonnegut's language is, as usual, gripping and very difficult to put down, even after you've finished. On top of that the ideas he shoves in your head are hard to let go of. If someone's pretending to be evil for a good cause, how much better is that than just being evil? Especially if they have the same exact negative effects?The only other Vonnegut novel I would put immediately above this one is Cat's Cradle.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to rethink the definitions of good and evil, in disjunction and conjunction.Nibble: \\"It was typical of his schizophrenia as a spy that he should use an institution he so admired for purposes of espionage.\\""},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"It is rare that I consider a book unimpeachable--that also has the dubious horror of being anointed as a sacred cow or a platitude in the making. But there is a reason that Vonnegut's work is acknowledged as ageless and incomparable. He really is just that. MOTHER NIGHT is his third book, written in 1961, and the first book written in the first person, which allows the reader to descend deeper and deeper into the protagonist's mind. Vonnegut's past history of surviving the 1945 bombing of Dresden while underground in an abattoir has provided a lot of meat for several of his novels, and this one is a riveting example. This isn't one of Vonnegut's shaggy dog or science fiction stories. It has more of a reality-based feel to it. Every sentence is necessary and carefully wrought. His satire is on full display, but love and humanity are intertwined. His ability to embrace the skeptic with the sentimentalist seems effortless.The primary theme is penned in Vonnegut's introduction, written five years after the hardback was released.\\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\\"After the editor's note written by the (fictional) editor of this confessional story, we are introduced to Howard W. Campbell, Jr., the protagonist and narrator of his story as an American spy and former playwright and poet living in Germany during WW II. He is imprisoned in Israel for war crimes of treason and crimes against humanity; he was so good at his job that no one presently believes his patriotism and service to America. Campbell gave impassioned radio broadcasts, delivering prolific anti-Semitic messages to all of Nazi Germany. His \\"code\\" to the Americans was conveyed in mannerisms, emphases, coughs, and verbal stumbles. He became a minor celebrity to the Nazis.He loved and adored his German wife, Helga; together they were a \\"nation of two.\\" As a playwright, he understood \\"lies told for the sake of artistic effect\\" and that lies, in art, can be \\"the most beguiling forms of truth.\\" He never told Helga that he was a spy. He was separated from her, and she was presumed dead, and he later emerged in Greenwich Village to attempt to live in anonymity, although he kept his name. Helga--or someone like Helga--re-emerged, also. And a variety of white supremacists found him and wanted to herald him and protect him from harm. Only Vonnegut can combine slapstick with white supremacy and hold your heart in his teeth.This book had me in thrall from the first to last page. I paced periodically while reading--re-reading sentences, phrases, paragraphs. I was captivated by Vonnegut's ability to turn every truth upside down and every lie inside out. The revelations of truth were in every contradiction and the fullness of humanity in every insanity and evil act. This book will make you question what is right and what is true about the things we think we believe and believe in.Vonnegut was a prescient writer in his day, and his work is still ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut was treated by psychiatrists but, since I'm a veteran, too, I believe his troubles might have been entirely PTSD. Vonnegut was obsessed with Europe in WWII and wrote much about it. One of his finest novels -- the only one that wasn't sci fi or fantasy -- is MOTHER NIGHT, made into a 1990s movie starring Nick Nolte. It's worth seeing, although Nolte was miscast.But, as usual, the book is much better. MOTHER NIGHT is the story of Howard Campbell, an American who is in Germany, married to a German woman, when WWII breaks out. Under Army Intelligence orders Howard acts as a \\"Lord HawHaw\\" in Germany during WWII and sends code signals to the Allies during his broadcasts. His apolitical (and much loved) wife is the daughter of a fanatic Nazi, and Howard is pulled this way and that until he doesn't understand his own loyalties, becoming bewildered and confused. After losing his wife in the war Howard wants to die and turns himself in to the Israelis as a war criminal, but ironically, is released when the US Army vouches for him. He returns to the US for the first time since about 1920. You should not expect a happy ending.Now and then Vonnegut throws in comic relief to lighten an essentially bleak story, especially his lampoons of white supremacists in America and the hilarious name of a Nazi, \\"Kraptauer\\".DON'T MISS THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT. Superb psychology, and in a way it's Vonnegut's own story, because of his ultra-German upbringing in a German neighborhood in Indianapolis, where every block had a string quartet and someone who could recite Schiller's poems and direct Lessing's plays in German. Although he hated Hiler he was raised to be proud of being a cultural German, as every child should be of his/her own heritage. How conflicted Kurt Vonnegut must have been! Why didn't the Army send German Americans to the Pacific, as they sent Japanese Americans to Europe?"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut tells the reader at the beginning of this book that it is one of his only books for which he knows the moral of the story - you are what you pretend to be.In Mother Night, Vonnegut tells the story of Howard W. Campbell Jr., an American who lives in Germany prior to WWII and is recruited by the United States to act as a spy in Nazi Germany. Campbell becomes one of the most valuable Allied spies of the war, but acts as a Nazi radio propagandist during the war, serving the Nazis as well, or maybe even better, than he does the Allies.The novel covers the fallout in Campbell's life from his decisions. It is a dark story, but it is told in a manner typical of Vonnegut, using humor and a free-form style to lighten the mood. You get to witness many characters' judgements of Campbell, but none are decisive. You are left to decide for yourself what you think of Campbell.Fantastic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This early work is quite uncharacteristic for Kurt Vonnegut, far more conventional than almost any other Vonnegut novel. It's unfortunate and surprising that he didn't write like this more often, because this relatively obscure novel just might be the best Kurt Vonnegut ever wrote.Unlike most of his work, it has no elements of SF or the fantastic: no aliens, no synopses of novels by Kilgore Trout,no silly drawings thrown in for the hell of it, and no narration from a ghost as in Galapagos, although the narrator is about as near a ghost as a living man can be.What it lacks in these areas is more than compensated by characters, often an afterthought in Vonnegut, but in this story rich and fully realized.Howard Campbell is a marginally successful American playwright who became to the world world a notorious and legendary Nazi propagandist while secretly being an agent of the OSS (the predecessor of the CIA) whose broadcasts were filled with vital intelligence eagerly decrypted by American agents. After the war, Campbell was secretly repatriated to the US, but, for reasons that are never made clear, the truth was never revealed, so when Campbell's life of obscure retirement is interrupted by the exposure of his identity, he is treated as a traitor by most while being hailed as a hero by a small group of crackpot Nazi sympathizers.Ultimately, he is abducted by Israeli agents and put on trial as a war criminal. The novel is presented as his memoirs written from an Israeli prison cell; memoirs which focus on his life as a spy and the loss of the great love of his life, an actress named Helga who was killed on the German equivalent of a USO tour.The question at the book's heart is whether a mask, presented to the world long enough, becomes a reality rather than a mask. Campbell is told by a friend that, even if he were a spy, his broadcasts couldn't possibly have been more valuable as intelligence than they were as propaganda that kept German spirits up. Vonnegut himself seems to answer the question, saying in a brief foreword that the moral is, &quot;You are what you pretend to be, so be careful what you pretend to be.&quot; But is that what the novel really says? Campbell perhaps has ultimately done more evil than good, but he is not an evil man. At one point he meets a character who is willing, even eager, to pretend to be something she is not; Campbell is unwilling to accept the imposture.Some amusing comic relief is provided by the neo-Nazis Campbell finds himself unwillingly thrown in with, who are treated as more ridiculous than sinister."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut did an excellent job in this story. There wasn't any science fiction in this book like many of his others, but the character Howard Campbell was great. The story has great twists to it and it makes for quick reading. I had a hard trying to put this one down, and I think it is a must read for any Vonnegut fan."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I just finished re-reading this book, and it was even better the second time around. This book is mostly about plot and morales, and less about charcters, although our main charcter is quite interesting. Jaded by the war, he has nothing to do with the rest of his life but hide. I dont want to give away any plot points, but the moral of the story is clear and brilliant &quot;We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be&quot; But towards the end of the book, as Campbell is giving to the man who hate him, he says &quot;Where's evil? Its the large part of very man that wants to hate without limit, that wants to hate with God on its side&quot;. Thats why i read Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut is one of those writers whom everybody either loves or hates--there's very little middle ground. He's like vanilla Coke.&quot;Mother Night&quot; is situated right on that narrow little line. It's a book that just about anyone can enjoy, even the most ardent foes of Indiana's favorite son. It was his third novel and, as such, represents the sort of pre-caricature phase that ended with the breakaway success of &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; two years later. Here you see Vonnegut at his most human and, in some ways, his most vulnerable as he switches off the bombastic humor and lets his reader see the man behind the curtain.Of course, the characteristic Vonnegut still shines through, but it's muted by a disarming candor about love lost and the stagnation it breeds. If you don't know anything about Vonnegut, this is a great place to start. If you love him, this book will make you melt. If you hate him, well, it might at least give you pause."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Signiture Vonnegut in this great work about Howard W.

The main character has an uncanny ability to recount events without passing judgment on their morality. I liken the narrator of this book to a third party candidate for political office.

I finished it and reread the introduction and then it became clear to me why this was unlike any Vonnegut book that I had ever read. It's subtitled &quot;The Confessions of Howard W.

I was actually convinced that his character was a real person to the extent that I attempted to research any existing records pertaining to him.

Innocence and guilt, irrationality and rationalization, the horrible and the mundane...all in one."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"No sci-fi makes it even more thought provoking."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is the second book I've read by Vonnegut(after the exceptional Cat's Cradle) and Vonnegut proves his superior ability to create complicated characters. After finishing the book, I still have no Idea if Cambell was a real person or not. (I don't think so, but the author made him feel like a real person.) My only complaint is that the plot was never clearly defined and it constantly shifted in time. But other than slight lack of focus(which works in a way since it is the last written words of a probably soon to be convicted war criminal possibly about to be hanged, making the story all the more realistic.) Overall this was a great book with all issues such as morality and responsibility. In fact, I loved the idea that a man working as a spy could serve the side he is spying on far more than he could ever serve the ones he is spying for... all unintentionally. Vonnegut loads the story with humorous ironies also."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I love KV. I bought this book because it received 5 stars where books I truely love like Blue Beard, did not. I felt there was less circular nature to the writing, the story was thready, the message less than inspiring. Definately not a keeper, I put it right back on e-bay. In contrast to 4 copies of Blue Beard I have bought over the years, I can't quote a single passage from Mother Night, nothing really excited me."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"The book came in after just a few days and it was in great condition."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Good shipping but the pages were screwed up!

Campbell is an American playwright and poet who lives a quiet and secluded life in Greenwich Village. It is many years after the end of World War II. Campbell's cover is finally blown: he is uncovered as an evil, pro-Nazi radio propagandist. The truth is that Campbell really worked as an American spy in Germany during the war. Campbell's mailbox becomes innundated by pamplets from modern day krypto-Nazis and Campbell becomes a much hated man. What can Campbell do but turn himself over to Israeli agents and be tried for his war crimes and crimes against humanity?Campbell, himself, suffered personal tragedy during the war. He fell in love with and married a German woman named Helga who had died during the war. All Campbell wants is to be reunited with his beloved Helga (obviously impossible). This a very powerful and sad, yet comic, novel. Vonnegut analyzes the guilt that people often feel when they become so involved and overly identified with an evil cause. That person may actually come to believe that he really did and said horrible things (and Campbell did just that) and forget that he was really working for the other side. Vonnegut tells his tale in a poignant, frightening, and often comic way, for which the author has been justly celebrated."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"A brilliant book that examines the evil that humans are so easily capable of doing to their fellow humans.

It is a much more traditional narrative than most of his works.This is not to say that it inspires less thought, though. I felt that it was a beautiful story that kept me thinking about it's lessons long after I finished.If you like Vonnegut but are looking for something more traditional, this is the book you want! It invoked emotion and thought equally as I read it.Incidentally the movie it inspired is worth watching after you enjoy the book (in contrast to the others based on his novels...)"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut's intriguing writing style continues in Mother Night. Very fat and interesting characters coupled with a precise probing of issues of conventional morality lead to a short, easy, and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Intellectuals don't always resonate with intellect and occasionally the wisdom from the common man or woman far exceeds that of those who profess to be oh-so-educated and learned.Kurt Vonnegut was a soldier and American P.O.W. during World War II and the horrors and absurdities he experienced in the fire bombed city of Dresden, Germany (as he helped collect the dead) as well as a sense of humanity generated by it resonate in his many stories and books. MOTHER NIGHT is a very good book, a fast read that carries a tone of conscience, compassion, humor, and a profound need for decency throughout. It tells of just and unjust causes with just and unjust results, of a need for the humane with an underlying appeal for hope.I came to find Vonnegut's work in the late 60s and being of the era enjoyed them then and smile whenever I leaf through one now. Was I naive then? Probably. Did I come away satisfied from reading his work? Definitely.Vonnegut was a national treasure then. Still is, under th dust.If you're new to his work start with Slaughterhouse Five and work your way through his books when you have the time or inclination.You'll be entertained and might even be moved, two benefits that academics seldom achieve with their own tomes.I'll take a readable story everytime."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"The great thing about Vonnegut is that he makes it very easy to read his books, with or without an education. It may appear to some that he over simplifies or is self indulgent in his tales, which may be true, but we live in a generation of oversimplification. And a lot of people's minds are simple as well, so it only seems fitting, to keep it within our reach.The times may have changed since his war, but not by much. And it is sad that few are able to identify with a man of his age and experience. For me, there is no war as great as Vietnam or the Holocaust. Just an invisible war on terror, which is just as meaningless as any other war.So what he says is as important today as any other day.the novel is a good one, has a great plot and ends well. It doesn't leave you feeling like you don't know what happens at the end. I will probably read it again someday. But I will never understand it the way he did when he wrote it, because I have not experienced the misery that is war."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"If you've never read a Vonnegut book before, then just go ahead and put this into your cart. Also add his other titles because you'll want to pick up another one after you've finished reading Mother Night. Yes, these books were written many decades ago, but the critics are correct in saying they still have relevance in today's time. Enjoy the read and reflection into today's environment."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"it was quick read, and i enjoyed it very much. it's gives an interesting perspective on a lot of issues of world war II and human nature."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"An interesting--almost crazy--ride through the later years of Howard Campbell, American-born, German playwright-turned-Nazi-broadcast propogandist, then-re-turned-American-spy.Vonnegut once said, humbly, his writing was just 8 to 10-line jokes strung together. There is slapstick and farce here; great fun and entertainiment. What saves this from craziness is Vonnegut's ability to write so well about noble things such as love and kindness, friendship and decency. So one laughs and one thinks and one feels as he reads here. . .and in almost everything else Kurt Vonnegut wrote."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"While Slaughterhouse-V may be Vonnegut's most famous and enduring work, Mother Night is my personal favorite. It describes the story of Nazi Propaganda broadcaster who is on trial in Israel for war crimes. Protagonist Howard J Campbell is forced to decipher what is real and what is merely appearance as he tells his story while awaiting the verdict in his jail cell. The majority of the book consists of flashbacks to earlier times that allow the reader to see all sides of Howard's story; the good and the bad. Vonnegut's voice is a little bit different than his ordinary satirical voice in his other notable works of literature. He tries to be more real, and there is nothing more real than a man awaiting his destiny on trial while also trying to decide if he can live with himself after all that he has done, weather it was out of fear, love, loyalty, or some combination of the three. The book is gripping, profound, and suspenseful until the very last page. It is truly Vonnegut's most underrated classic."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I have read all but one of Kurt Vonnegut's novels, and the ones I own are falling to pieces from the number of times I have read them. They all are very powerful pieces of work. This one in particular changed my life and outlook in such a splendid way.The novel centers around the idea of the difference between who you are and the perception of yourself unto others. However, despite how powerful a book this is for that particular issue, I love it for a different reason.Kurt Vonnegut's novels do not deal often with Love. There are characters that love each other in many of his books, but a real love story and in depth look at people in this respect are missing. The story and look at Howard Campbell's feelings about Love are so beautiful to me.I never could put into words exactly what it was I wanted out of love, though I knew it was different than what those around me seemed to want. Kurt Vonnegut puts it into the exact words I have used since reading this so many years ago. \\"A country of two\\".To me this novel should be noted not just for the stunning show of perception creating reality, but also as a masterful and meaningful look at how important love can be to a person who doesn't find meaning in much else."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Each of Vonnegut's books draws me in more and more than the last, and of the half-dozen I've read, this is the best in an outstanding group. There is a point--questions of morality that apply globally and personally and strangely--that does not get in the way of a story, which is told with such excellent craft that you may appreciate it for its sheer art and structure...though there is more to love than that achievement alone. I laughed. I should have cried and wish I had. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and more--I was deeply affected by it. If you want a plot synopsis, read the jacket cover...but it should be a crime to spoil any of the twists and turns in this book that doesn't need them, though employs them deftly nonetheless."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is one of Kurt Vonnegut's greatest pieces of literature that offers the reader a look into what happens when you pretend to be something you are not. Whether you make a new face for yourself believing it to be for the right reasons or not, there are always consequences. Having agreed to become a spy within Nazi Germany, our protagonist is so effective at spewing propaganda that when the time comes no one believes the actual truth of the matter regarding Howard Campbell Jr.His life after the war in a cramped New York apartment is both terrifying for him and depressing, if not boring at times. The real poignancy of this story comes from the interactions between what our main character is supposed to be (a brutal Nazi supporter), truly is (one of the greatest spies of WWII), wants to be, and what happens because of the choices he has made in his not-so-real life."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"They talk about the banality of evil, but what about the banality of good? What if the only way you can do good is by being so perfectly evil that nobody would ever expect you to be otherwise? And furthermore, what if you find that after submerging yourself in the evil for so long, that you just don't care? That some stains don't ever come out, even if your intentions are just?The only Kurt Vonnegut novel I had left to read (that I know of), I'm not sure why I avoided this one for years, unless my weird phobia about buying books with movie covers on them took a ridiculous hold on me and wouldn't allow me to get it. Reading it now, though, what strikes me is how bleak it is, unlike a lot of his other books. While Vonnegut never totally wrote about happy smiley topics, his novels were generally sprinkled with bits of dark humor that allowed you to laugh at least and made the darkness that much less oppressive. The coating on the spikes so it doesn't hurt as much when you breath in.That's not really the case here. Tackling WWII again from a different, less personal angle (instead of \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" and it's man on the spot point of view), it feels slightly more detached and sort of numb. Howard Campbell is an American that winds up living in Germany in the days before the war, writing plays and the like. He eventually winds up writing a lot of anti-Semetic poems and radio broadcasts and is considered one of the prime war criminals to have ever made it out of the war alive. The only thing is: all his anti-Semetic outbursts and writing were actually code, as he was spying for the American government and they were handing him what to say, with clues and orders embedded in the phrasing so that anyone listening would be able to discern the actual meaning. However, the government refuses to acknowledge that he worked for them and when the authorities of the world want to arrest him, he's got no one to stand by and back him up. Thing is, he's not quite sure if he wants to be let off the hook.This is an odd one. While its still funny in parts, it's a depressing kind of fun or the kind where you find yourself wincing because you're glad it's not happening to you. Like watching someone getting punched in the face and the other guy breaks his hand in the process. It lacks the focused anger of \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" but there's still a simmering sense of futility underneath the whole thing. Campbell technically made the right decision, or did he? He helped the war but because of what he did millions of people died in the process and the book deliberately doesn't take a stand.Campbell as a voice is very matter of fact about everything, alternating between a dry recounting and a bemused acceptance of his fate. Every single character in the book either has something terrible happen to them or is a terrible person (or both) and as usual with most Vonnegut books, what happens to you really doesn't depend on whether you're a good person or not, but simply on the whims of life. Campbell is constantly reminded of what he did, by the resurgence of his writings, by white supremicists, by Israelis coming after him, by all the memories that keep following him and won't allow him to forget.It's a strangely flat novel but the flatness only underscores the horror of the morally mixed times, how you can allow evil by doing good or how good may not matter if the evil is great enough. Campbell wanders through life letting things happen or allowing people to do things to him and whether or not that contributes to his ultimate fate is up to the reader to decide. It lays the questions out there without giving any kind of answers or hints of answers, and unlike most of Vonnegut's novels there's no hope at all, just a clenched fist closing in on nothing. And the hand is getting tired.Worth reading if you're a Vonnegut fan but it's definitely a bit different in tone from the others. How you feel about that is up to you."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Is Howard W. Campbell's conscience clear? Should it be? Can Campbell function as an allied agent while spewing hateful propaganda over German radio? Is the good he does spying greater than the harm he does supporting Nazi power and by extension the Holocost and WWII itself?This is Vonnegut's most conventional novel (though none of them is sci-fi really) and Campbell's eventual exile and self-doubt is beautifully and convincingly rendered. Among other things, we are asked if Campbell's attitude--having no politics but a \\"nation of two\\" with wife Helga--is sufficient in a time of war. To what extent is he responsible for his actions regardless of his intentions? And what is he to do about it, both during the war and after? Could he have done anything differently or better? Would doing nothing have been better?Aside from the moral conundrums there is a strongly realized and written novel here that holds its own with any other writer's work, with rich characters and scenes that might surprise the reader of other Vonnegut novels with its conventionality. In particular, Campbell's long exile in New York mourning Helga (and to a lesser extent himself) is often poignant. His nearly domestic relationship with George Kraft during this time is charming. Of course Kurt Vonnegut also puts Campbell in conversation with fellow Haifa prisoner Adolf Eichman, as only K.V. would do. One of Vonnegut's best."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Although I must maintain that this is not Kurt Vonnegut's best book, it is a very good and certainly enjoyable one, with a biting moral to boot. It also marked a departure for Vonnegut from the science fiction mold that he cast his first two books in. This is also the first time that he dealt with what was perhaps the central experience of his life in his fiction (his experiences in World War II.) The premise of the book is this: a man purporting to be a Nazi radio propagander is actually an American spy. However, after the war is over, the American government refuses to admit that he worked for them, and he is charged as a war criminal. This begs the question: which one was he, really? This is a central question to keep in mind throughout the book, and the ending is startling. It also raises one of Vonnegut's best questions:We are who we pretend to be, so we better be darn careful who we pretend to be."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Howard W.

Very good story, very insightful writing; Vonnegut shows mastery."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I have tried to read Vonnegut's books on many occasions, and have never been able to finish them. I found _Mother Night_ to be very readable...First, it is a short book. The author's style adds to this by the wonder of the 1-2 page chapter.Next, I found myself much more interested in the story he tells here than in others I have attempted.So, what's this book all about? It tells the tale of a man who served the Nazis in his heart and in his very being as a radio propagandist. However, this man was an American by birth and was solicited by the American government to serve as a spy, sending coded messages through the very same radio broadcasts in which he mocked and criticized American actions (especially Franklin Delano Rosenfeld). We read his \\"memoirs\\" as he sits in a Jerusalem jail in 1961. We discover what he has lost over the course of the war and the afterwar era.As I said, I enjoyed this book, both for its story and for the writing used. It's an enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Though it doesn't often get mentioned alongside Vonnegut's other masterpieces, I've always felt that Mother Night may actually be my favorite Vonnegut work, even if I can't explain why. Certainly, the central concept - in which an American becomes a prominent propagandist for the Nazis as a front for spy work which he himself doesn't understand or have any proof of - is a fascinating one, and the moral complexity of the situation is never lost on Vonnegut. And undoubtedly, the pain and emotion of the book is as strong as any of his works, if not somewhat more so, as he deals even more directly with the horrors of World War II than he did in Slaughterhouse Five, confronting head-on the world of the Nazis and attempting to understand exactly how these events could have happened. And sure, there's Vonnegut's wonderful motto to the story - \\"We must be careful what we pretend to be, lest we become it\\" - but there's so much other good writing, including what may be one of my favorite passages the man ever wrote:\\"There are plenty of good reasons for fighting,\\" I said, \\"but no good reason ever to hate without reservation, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too. Where's evil? It's that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit, that wants to hate with God on its side. It's that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive.\\"It's that part of an imbecile,\\" I said, \\"that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly.\\"In the end, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is I love so much about Mother Night, simply because there's so much to get lost in here, from a tragic romance to a bizarre (and funny) satire of racism, from a study of evil to a lament for humanity. Mother Night depicts a man who has done horrible actions, and even though he may have done them for what seemed like good reasons, that doesn't make it any easier to live with. Add to that Vonnegut's typically wonderful, off-kilter world, his gallows humor, his sweet hopeful cynicism, and you have an unrivaled and sadly overlooked work by a man who was one of the world's great writers."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"If you've never read any of Vonnegut's books, this is a great place to start. This is a well paced story of an American posing as a Nazi sympathizer in WWII Germany. Working as a spy for the US Government, Howard Campbell broadcasts Nazi Propaganda, filled with coded messages for Allied forces.His choices leave his life in ruins, and make him a 'war criminal', years later.As a side note, this was also made into a pretty \\"true to the original book\\" movie."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I thought this book was powerful. Perception is reality and you are what you pretend to be, as far as everyone else is concerned. There are important lessons in this book. This is not the usual comical Vonnegut. Of Vonneut's serious books I feel that this one's his best. &quot;Galapagos&quot; is probably my favorite Vonnegut book, all things considered."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Howard Campell, Jr., is an american spy in Nazi Germany. To hide this fact he takes the job of broadcasting english-language nazi propaganda to american troops as &quot;the last free american&quot; (and uses coughs and hiccups in the antisemitic rants he broadcasts as a way to transmit secret info to american intelligence services.) The result? The most important american spy of the war is universally despised as a traitor and lives his life hiding from vengence-seeking victims of the Nazis... from soviet spies who want to prove the US &quot;harbors nazis&quot;... and even worse, from neo-nazi nutcases who want to crown him as a new Fuehrer. Who will catch him first? And then what?Hunted by all the wrong people for all the wrong reasons, condemned as evil for doing the right thing, Howard Campell, Jr., is in an excellent situation to reflect on the absurdity and irony of life, and on how much evil is done by those who think they are doing good. Dark, disturbing, and at the same time extremely funny, Vonnegut had rarely done better."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is one of my favorite Vonnegut books, along with The Sirens of Titan and Hocus Pocus. It is different than the majority of his works, as Vonnegut does not rely on obvious comedy, or space travel. In this account of an accused Nazi war criminal, Vonnegut lets the reader deep within Campbell's mind, in order to allow the verdict to waver back and forth between guilty and not guilty. This is a brilliant novel, and it deals with issues deeper than Vonnegut lets on. A must for Vonnegut fans..."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This deserves to be a modern classic, right up there with Slaughterhouse Five, The Naked and the Dead, Catch-22 and 1984. It is a disturbing and relentlessly insightful book about the human condition. A man agrees to act as a Nazi propagandist during WWII in order to be able to transmit coded messages to the Allies. But when we look beyond the good intentions, there is still the question of which side he aids most - the side he proclaims to profess to, or the side he secretly tries to aid? As mr Vonnegut writes himself in the introduction: &quot;We are what we pretend to be, and therefore we must be very carful of what we pretend to be.&quot; Read it - don't see the film."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Once again, Kurt Vonnegut has managed to capture the true irony, the true vitality,and dare I say it, the true silliness of the human condition. In &quot;Mother Night&quot;, Vonnegut displays Howard W. Campbell Jr., an German-American playwright living in Germany during WW II, who heads the Nazi propaganda machine while acting as a double agent for the Americans, slipping haphazard information into his propaganda broadcasts. The irony is that Campbell has no interest whatsoever in States, but finds the center of his existence in his marriage to Helga, a German actress who stars in his plays. The story is narrated by Campbell from an Israeli Jailhouse in Jerusalem, and one cannot but feel for this foppish romantic clown, who has committed the greatest crime known to humanity; he has loved with abandon"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"For quite a while I had been planning on reading some of Vonnegut's books, but I kept forgetting and grabbing other things from my TBR list. But when a month back I saw the author interviewed in two of my favorite shows regarding his new book \\"A man without a country\\", I was once more enticed to follow-up on the idea of reading his works.It seemed to me that \\"Mother Night\\" was a good place to start as any, even though most people's starting point would probably be \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\", which I will hopefully get around to reading soon. In \\"Mother Night\\", Vonnegut presents us with an extremely interesting setting, which contains a whole array of \\"gray situations\\", since Howard W. Campbell, Jr. tells his story as an American spy working in the German publicity machine during World War II. What makes the case even more interesting is that the narrator is not really clear regarding the events that developed during that period. Logically, one would expect Howard to say he hated what he had to do in order to support the US, but in fact we are faced with a scenario that allows for a lot more ambiguity than that. And even though, I have only read this novel by this author so far, I believe that this is one of his most salient characteristics.Besides the interesting storyline, I was pleasantly impressed by the author's writing style, using short chapters that are somewhat linked in their main topics, but that are not completely linear. This reminds me of the work of one of my favorite Latin American authors, Eduardo Galeano, who uses a similar approach to writing. If you are interested in reading about the history Latin America and like Vonnegut's style, I highly recommend Galeano's non-fiction book \\"The Open Veins of Latin America\\".Coming back to Vonnegut, I recommend \\"Mother Night\\" to all those that enjoy stories in which ethics and the concept of what is wrong and what is right play a central role. As to me, I am already looking forward to my next Vonnegut read."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut begins Mother Night with an introduction stating that this is the only story of his that he knows the moral, which happens to be: \\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\\" For an author whose novels often read like a Jacob's Ladder toy, amusing in their seeming lack of logic, it seems odd that he would write a novel with a clear and straightforward moral. However, what Vonnegut accomplishes in Mother Night is to rescue post-modernism from its more nihilistic tendencies, and makes it clear that our unreal selves can sometimes have real consequences.Mother Night is apparently the diary of Howard W. Campbell Jr., written while he was awaiting a war crime trial in Israel. Of course Vonnegut is using the theme of a found text while claiming he only edited the manuscript. Much like the characters in his books, the authenticity of the novel itself is amorphous.Through the course of the novel Campbell informs us that he was once a playwright turned Nazi propagandist who transmitted broadcasts espousing the Aryan philosophy across Europe. Similar to Reifenstahl's claims, Campbell states that his own politics are nonexistent, and that he was merely doing his job. In fact, he purposefully makes these broadcasts so over-the-top that no one could possibly see them as anything but ridiculous, but in a world where people like Hitler and Himmler somehow took over an entire country, Campbell's melodramatic broadcasts are viewed as genius. Soon he is contacted by an undercover U.S. agent who he affectionately calls his \\"Blue Fairy Godmother.\\" This agent forcibly recruit's Campbell as a double agent, and using Campbell's broadcasts the Blue Fairy Godmother is able to transmit secret codes to the allied forces.Vonnegut states in the book that the reason people are able to commit atrocities and still see themselves as a good person is the modern condition of schizophrenia. This leads to the question of whether or not Campbell is making up the Blue Fairy Godmother. Could the Blue Fairy Godmother be Campbell's own form of schizophrenia?By the end of the book Campbell turns himself into the Israeli authorities so he can stand trial for war crimes. In a sense, it doesn't really matter whether or not Campbell was a double agent because his actions had very real and harmful consequences regardless. He stoked the coals of the Nazi propaganda machine, and regardless of whether he is guilty under the law, Vonnegut uses Campbell's own admission of guilt to show that he is morally guilty. Whether or not Campbell was a double agent he is guilty of pretending to be a Nazi sympathizer. For a post-modern novel this is a very hard edged morality tale. Oftentimes post-modernism is criticized for moral relativity (interestingly enough, those who I've heard use moral relativity the most are conservative historians who wish to defend historical figures who have done questionable acts, slavery being a prime example). What Vonnegut accomplishes in Mother Night is to make it clear that while the \\"self\\" is amorphous and changing, our actual actions have a clear impact on others and cannot be fortified from morality."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"All I need to say is that this is the only book that I have EVER read twice! I'm sure I'll read it a few more times in my life. I never ever read anything twice or even think about it. I also watch the movie here and there just to refresh my memory, but it doesn't do justice to the book."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"One of Vonnegut's best-layed out novels, &quot;Mother Night&quot; was a world apart from what he had written before. Not to say that &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot; wasn't fantastic; it is probably, in the end, the better book. But here Vonnegut went beyond his substantial imagination to begin to broach two subjects which have haunted him throughout the rest of his career: the horrors of war and the fakeness of most people. Here, his hero spends time as an German immigrant spying for America by reading Nazi propaganda over the radio. His pre-inserted stutters and coughs are really secret messages, but nobody knows that. Indeed, after the war he finds himself a fugitive, and the book asks us to decide which is more important: His helping the Americans or making the Nazis believe in their cause. A fascinating book with lots of surprises, it began a cycle for Vonnegut which would combine harsh reality with an other-wordly imagination, all topped off with black humor. A fantastic recipe"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"To the best of my knowledge, there really is no other writer quite like Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Mother Night appears to be a rather straightforward, albeit quirky, novel at first glance, but as one delves down into the heart of Vonnegut's prose one finds grounds for contemplation of some of life's most serious issues. This novel is the first-hand account of Howard Campbell, Jr., a most remarkable character. Campbell is an American-born citizen who moved to Germany as a child and became the English-speaking radio mouthpiece for Nazi Germany during World War II. In the fifteen years since the end of the war, he has been living an almost invisible life in a New York City attic apartment. He misses his German wife Helga who died in the war, sometimes thinks about his pre-war life as a successful writer of plays and poems, and perhaps just waits for history to find him once again. As we begin the novel, he has been found and is writing this account from a jail cell in Israel, awaiting trial for his crimes against humanity. While he is reviled by almost everyone on earth as an American Nazi traitor, the truth is that he was actually an agent working for the American government during the war; this is a truth he cannot prove, though. Thus, in this 1961 novel, the hero is ostensibly a Nazi war criminal.The primary moral of Mother Night, Vonnegut tells us in his introduction, is that \\"we are what we pretend to be\\" and should thus be pretty darned careful about what we are pretending to be (a secondary moral being the less enlightening statement \\"when you're dead, you're dead\\"). In the eyes of the entire world, Campbell is exactly what he pretended to be during the war, a traitorous Nazi purveyor of propaganda who mocked and demoralized allied troops as well as regular citizens. Internally, Campbell hardly knows what he is anymore; he claims no country, no political values, wanting only to live in a \\"nation of two\\" with his beloved wife Helga once again. A series of significant events forces Campbell out of the cocoon of his past fifteen years, and his thoughts and actions along the way provide big juicy morsels of food for thought: taking personal responsibility for one's actions, the harsh truths of war and peace, the sometimes vast differences between truth and fact, individual redemption before self and society, finding direction and a purpose in a world gone mad, etc. Vonnegut's scythe-like dark humor cuts deeper than mere satire, aiming directly at some of the darker sections of the human heart, areas which most individuals too often ignore or refuse to acknowledge. The gallows humor can be quite funny on the surface, but it is in actuality a scalpel which Vonnegut wields to open up the heart and soul of the reader for self-examination. Mother's Night, the title of which is taken from Goethe's Faust, is a relatively short but very powerful novel."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"\\"My name is Howard W. Campbell, Jr. I am an American by birth, a Nazi by reputation, and a nationless person by inclination\\" are the opening words to Kurt Vonnegut's tale of an American playwright living in Germany who, once World War II begins, becomes a Nazi radio propagandist. He becomes infamous for his disgustingly brutal radio shows which distributed wicked Nazi propaganda. He was thoroughly hated by the Americans, and loved by the Nazis. But there is one thing that you should know about Howard W. Campbell. He is an American spy. His radio shows are the medium for transmitting secret codes out of Germany to aid the American cause in the war. He was one of the most effective spies of World War II, and one of the only ones to survive the war. But after the war, he is simply discarded in a small New York attic apartment, with enough money to live the rest of his days there, but with no more direction to his life. He lives his life simply there, away from civilization and anyone who might recognize him as a war criminal, until a white supremacist discovers where he is located, and he once again must face his past. Mother Night is not a traditional war book, for rather than concentrating on the brutal aspects of combat, it focuses heavily on the equally gruesome subject of hate. Vonnegut also dissects the schizophrenic mind of a spy after the war has ended who has not only lost the trust of everyone he loves, but most importantly, his identity altogether, as he realizes he is a \\"nationless\\" person. The narrator is constantly questioning his identity, which has been muddled by his spy experiences. Vonnegut also discusses the minds of the Nazis, how ordinary and often intelligent men and women could be prompted to become the vicious killing machines that they were during World War IIMother Night is a sharp, funny book thats humor is both satiric and farcical. It is a very entertaining read with twists and turns at every corner, including a surprise ending that is sure to catch the reader off-guard. Although Kurt Vonnegut is more well-known for his novels such as Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle, Mother Night is truly an overlooked classic that offers an entertaining read for not just fans of war books, but any reader looking for a hilariously addictive and heart-breakingly poignant book."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"&quot;Mother Night&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut is a probing tale (a parable perhaps) about the difference between appearances and reality.&quot;Mother Night&quot; is actually one of three books I have recently read (or reread) that deal with the dichotomy between appearance and truth. &quot;Mother Night&quot; is clearly the least subtle book as far as advancing an argument...yet it is far and away the most powerful. Vonnegut navigates this ethical minefield in an entertaining, yet sobering manner.&quot;Mother Night&quot; tells the story of an American playwright who is enlisted to be a spy within World War II Germany. The playwright becomes part of the upper crust of Nazi society. Working as a talk-radio personality, he encodes top secret information in his pro-Nazi broadcasts. In so doing, he helps to bring about the eventual victory of the Allies.The war-time story-line of &quot;Mother Night&quot; is told in retrospect by the playwright who is living a secluded life in 1960's New York City. The reason he must live in hiding is that his Allied contact person during the war disappeared. He has no one left to testify to the fact that he worked for the Allies.The story takes off in grand Vonnegutian style as the &quot;protagonist&quot; of the story is discovered simultaneously by Nazi-hunters, Soviet agents, white supremacists, and a woman claiming to be his ex wife.Through it all, Vonnegut asks hard questions about what action, motivation, intent, and reality have to do with reality.I found this book to be eye-opening. It is engagingly told; containing passages of great beauty, sorrow, and even humor. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is perhaps the darkest of Kurt Vonnegut's novels in terms of it's storyline and sense of humor. Most of the humor within the book comes from Vonnegut's use of situational irony. The main character, Howard Campbell Jr., spent WWII as a double agent. He was a fairly famous German radio personality (dispensing all sort of pro-Nazi propoganda), and did his best to raise German morale during the war. At the same time, he was sending out coded messages for the allied troops over the radio. When the end of the war came, the US wouldn't aknowledge his part as an agent. Thus, Campbell became a war criminal. The novel, in large part, deals with Campbell's treatment after the war. This is where the irony comes into play. I won't go into what happens to Campbell (so as not to give away crucial elements of the plot. However, when reading, it is as Vonnegut states earlier in the book: be careful what you pretend to be [sic], for what you pretend to be is what you are. This story sticks out amonst Vonnegut's works as one of the most original, and suprising of his books. It is also a good introduction to the philosophies that are embodied in most of Vonnegut's other books. I believe that this particular novel is a good starting point for anyone interested in Vonnegut. (aside: do you ever feel like one of those little kids from Reading Rainbow when you're doing a book review?)"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"... With this simple thesis that Vonnegut lays out in the introduction to his stellar \\"Mother Night,\\" we are entered into the morally complex world of Howard W. Campbell, Jr. You see, Campbell acted as a spy for the U.S. during WWII, but he was so deep under cover that even the American government has no evidence that he was actually working for them, that the broadcasts he was making on Nazi radio contained coded messages for American intelligence. There is only one man who can save Campbell from his trial, and he has no idea who he really is or how to contact him. Now, looking back on his life, Campbell begins to understand how morally suspect he is, no matter what his intentions were. In posing as a Nazi Campbell was party to some terrible atrocities that he, as well as the reader, must come to terms with and decide if he is a hero or just as bad as the villains he was ostensibly helping us fight. Is his plight tragic or deserved? Vonnegut, in top form, weaves together a compelling tale with his typical blend of dark humor and drama in what is, in my most humble opinion, his best novel ever -- and with a canon that includes \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" \\"Breakfast of Champions,\\" and \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,\\" that is really saying something. An absolute must read."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I don't see much point in describing the plot, because no plot summary can give you any adequate idea of what this amazingly powerful book is really all about. But then it's also hard to describe what it's all about, except to say that it encompasses themes of good and evil, responsibility and innocence, remorse and redemption, and the all-important question of whether our intentions can truly justify our actions. It's difficult for me to describe the effect this book had on me--perhaps I can convey some idea of its impact by saying that I frequently found myself raising my head from its pages with the words &quot;oh, _man_&quot; upon my lips and subsequently staring into space for several minutes while allowing the sentence I had just read to work its way through my system. At times I felt as though I'd been kicked in the gut...but it was well worth it. Few books I've read have been as profound or as thought-provoking. Don't expect it to make you happy--but expect it to make you think very seriously about the human condition and about the actions that even the best of us benighted beings are capable of."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut must be the most deceptive author in history. His books have such a lithe and jocular style to them they feel like beach-reads, but you always finish them with a knot in the pit of your stomach.There's a great deal of well crafted sugar to make the medicine go down, but you still always taste it.Mother Night is by far the darkest of the Vonnegut novels I've read. Even more so then Slaughterhouse-Five. But where Slaughterhouse dealt with the hell that is war, Mother Night traces the purgatory that follows it and the lost wandering of one man that did both the greatest of good and the fiercest of evil.In each chapeter he gives you the set up for a joke, but intead of a punchline, he tells you the dog just died. It's dark, but always told with that knowing grin and that understated sleight of hand that makes all of his work so easy to overlook, but impossible to ever forget."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I recently read \\"Mother Night\\" for the second or third time. In the first readings I saw the novel for what it pretended to be--a story about a World War II spy, perhaps too dedicated and what happened to him after the war.In the last reading I recognized a story more representative of the today's world where the consequences of being dedicated--to both good and bad policy can have disastrous effects. Just a casual look at the economic problems of the last few years and the behavior of people on both sides of every issue leads one to question blind dedication that is often accompanied by a failure to see the big picture.Leaders today seem to be all too anxious to align themselves with certain causes, policies, and constituents. In some cases, it is doubtful they even believe strongly in them but there is personal gain to be gotten and so they believe. Vonnegut's warning: Be careful what you pretend to be.\\"Mother Night\\" can be read as an interesting piece of historical fiction or it can be seen as social commentary about taking positions that might grant immediate rewards or even make sense in the short run but that will later lead to problems. We are all being asked to lend our support to causes, to take a bigger role in politics, to become more active in the world around us. Vonnegut didn't tell us not to do these things but he did warn us to be careful.I recommend \\"Mother Night\\" because of the novel approach it takes to bringing these situations to life. It is an interesting story and a compelling problem that we should all be aware of, whether we are the ones doing the pretending or just following a pretender."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Vonnegut starts out this book with a warning : \\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\\" This story follows the life of an American playwright, Howard W. Campbell Jr., who happens to live in Germany during the Nazi regime. He is confronted by the Americans to work as a spy, sending secret messages through a radio broadcast. He agrees to this but at the same time his broadcasts are filled with propaganda, all in favor of Hitler and his actions. True to Vonnegut's style, the plot gets more and more twisted as the story goes on, ending with Campbell in an Israeli prison. This was a wonderfully well written novel with action and intrigue that made it hard to put down! Each time I finish one of Vonnegut's novels, I find myself longing to head back to the library to find another one."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This may be one of the most difficult to read of Vonnegut's novels. The themes of absurdity and fatalism are presented in a dark manner. Although the narration itself flows easily like a natural conversation and Vonnegut presents his themes in no uncertain terms (pages 224-225, 251), the characters are difficult to warm up to because each is traced with evil. The protagonist, Howard W. Campbell, Jr, was a \\"beacon\\" for Nazi propaganda and associated with the most notorious of the Nazi anti-heroes. The story goes back and forth between skittish encounters and tragic events that depict the illusion of an individual's purpose on earth. Entertaining, enlightening, but heavy.A key in interpreting this convoluted and dark novel is Vonnegut's dedication \\"to Mata Hari.\\" Some brief research into the life of Mata Hari reveals some obvious parallels with the confessions of Howard W. Campbell, Jr. Mata Hari's haunting legacy is whether she was guilty of espionage or not. Mother Night starts with the same question regarding Campbell. Similar to Hari, Campbell had been generally viewed as an artist, a free-spirited bohemian prior to his war experience. Also, similar to Mata, Campbell's relationships and liaisons with powerful men took him across international borders frequently, which eventually would lead to his downfall.In both cases, it is pointless to speculate whether or not Campbell or Hari were spies. Both were not only helpless in the face of the war machine (\\"gear teeth\\" in the \\"cuckoo clock of hell\\"), but also navely ignorant of the gravity of their respective situations after their arrests by the military. Hence the behaviors of both seem unfathomable, considering that each had actively determined the course of their life and constructed their own legendary persona, but also seemed pre-determined to be pawns in the immense storm of war.Mother Night is a two-fold investigation of self-deception and fatalism. Fatalism seems to be a product of the funny mind games we play with ourselves when we rationalize that what we are doing not only right, but our only choice. Possibly, fatalism is a product of learned helplessness, where we no longer feel our actions can make a difference. Therefore, we tell ourselves lies to make our actions seem justified and we are lulled into inaction. In the end, the damage is done and the lesson is that our lies may be more influential than our truths."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Whenever I am between books, like if I have just finished one and am waiting for another one to come in the mail or just taking a week or two break from heavier reading, I will read this book. It's a quick read as are most of his books. I have read it a dozen times and I always enjoy it. I think that anyone who reads this book will enjoy it just as I did. I've read all of Vonnegut's books and enjoyed them all, but this one gets pulled off of my book shelf more than anything else. To borrow a quote from the book itself \\"We are what we pretent to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\\""},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"The usual Vonnegut: brilliant and iconoclastic. Very easy to read because of the short sentences and short chapters, but one needs to be alert to what is going on, who is who. The ending may leave you a bit up in the air. It would be worthwhile to see the excellent movie with Nick Nolte as Howard Campbell, Jr. The movie dialog is basically straight from the novel, but a few key scenes are left out. Look for Vonnegut in a scene."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is my third endeavor through the works of Kurt Vonnegut and it seems that 'Mother Night' plays out as a more conventional novel in terms of structure and theme. It's sheer brilliance is evident straight from the introduction; where Vonnegut asks that we be good at what we pretend to be, because that's who we will become. He also sets up the dark humor presented in the book by inplicating a second moral, simply stated: &quot;When you're dead you're dead.&quot; 'Mother Night' follows the narrative of Howard Campbell, war criminal, throughout his years following the time when he was an agent of the United States in Germany during WWII. Vonnegut, as commonplace in most of his novels, satirizes war and it's absurdity, love, race, and the meaning that we attribute to our lives in a meaningless world where there is essentially no escape. However, the book, unlike typical Vonnegut, focuses on one primary theme; that of the significance of truth. For the characters in 'Mother Night' becoming spies has left them with no country and no hope. What essentially keeps them (among them Campbell) is curiousity. However, as will be revealed during the course of the novel, even this will be crushed as lies become lies and then become truths, and Campbell will remain frozen in his tracks, a victim of the country that he helped and separated from his nation of two, the only nation that had any significance.A well-written narrative, funny and thought provoking. We laugh, but only a bit tentatively, as we watch the 'truth' unfold and wonder if it was worth knowing at all."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"One of the many wonderful angles of this book is the way Vonnegut is able to raise questions worth answering. One that's been talked about quite a bit is whether or not people can serve evil and still be considered good, even to themselves. As the narrator, Howard W. Campbell Jr. raises this question quite often by being ruthlessly honest with himself concerning his vitriolic radio addresses and other actions, and how they might have impacted the genocide that was occurring around him. In this way, Campbell seems to me a pretty reliable narrator, earning our trust by not trying to shift blame for his actions as an American agent. But I think Vonnegut also means for us to question some of Campbell's other actions that set up his future misery. In particular, Campbell seemed to be guilty of too much \\"uncritical love,\\" the term he gave the love that his wife, Helga, showed him.Campbell doesn't detail much of his thought process or how he wrangled with his decision to become a spy. Major Wirtanen, his recruiter, thinks he should because Campbell loves good, hates evil and believes in romance. That's true, but Campbell also says the best reason of all was that he would \\"have an opportunity for some pretty grand acting. I would fool everyone with my brilliant interpretation of a Nazi, inside and out.\\" And that's it. Next thing you know, he's a spy. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of introspection there, just uncritical love for himself and his own acting ability, finally getting to act out his own play instead of just writing it.Also, there's the uncritical love he returns to Helga. Although Vonnegut closes his introduction by saying, \\"make love when you can. It's good for you,\\" he seemed to show through his portrayal of the romance between Campbell and Helga (and later Campbell and Resi) that uncritical love, while it can be intensely gratifying, can lead to trouble later on. Campbell notes how \\"mindlessly\\" the two clung to each other, and the scant evidence he provides of the relationship outside of the bedroom seems to back that up. He says that the two only heard \\"the melodies in our voices. The things we listened for carried no more intelligence than the purrs and growls of big cats.\\" Helga actually believed everything Campbell said on the radio -- and this actually made Campbell happy. He had no problem with his wife seeing him as a Jew-baiting Nazi, even though he was completely different on the inside. If he had told Helga that he was a spy, perhaps she would've been able to keep him grounded when away from his work as an agent, reassuring him that he was only performing a duty, an act, that he really was a different person. Likewise, although he doesn't present any evidence (perhaps because he didn't want to), Helga appeared to be just as patriotic toward the Nazi cause as Campbell pretended to be. Apparently, this didn't bother Campbell either. In reality, neither of the two cared what the other did or said -- they were star-struck lovers, and Campbell's uncritical love of Helga came back to haunt him (for the rest of his life) when she was killed in Crimea. His desperation manifested itself in his easy acceptance of Resi as Helga later on in the book. Campell was so eager to give his love away that he couldn't (or maybe didn't want to) distinguish betweent the sisters. This, too, came back to haunt him through Resi's betrayal and death, making Campbell more despondent -- despondent enough to set up the conclusion of the novel."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Mother Night is one of those books I pick up during idle time. It's one of those books that calls to be read multiple times. It reads much smoother than Slaughterhouse, which is perhaps why I am more drawn to it. For those who have yet to pick up a Vonnegut book, I would recommend Mother Night as the first to be read. I feel this way because it is, as far as I'm concerned, Vonnegut's &quot;easiest read.&quot; (After Mother Night, I would recommend Galapagos as the next to be read on the way to Slaughterhouse. Vonnegut declared Galapagos his best novel I might add)My copy of Mother Night is filled with doggy ears marking witty, vivid, and droll language used by Vonnegut. I find myself peeking into my copy when I need a laugh or two.In conclusion, I might say that if I were forced to choose one book to read for an eternity, Mother Night would not be it. But if I were allowed 5 books, it would easily make the cut."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's novels are famous for their commentary on society, and their examination of morality, and ethics. Mother Night is no different; placing the reader into the mind of an ex-playwright turned propagandist, and a former nazi.The story is told from the point of view of Howard W. Campbell Jr., now living in seclusion in 1960 Manhattan. Campbell lived in Germany during WWII and is approached by an undercover American spy, who instructs Campbell to infiltrate the Nazis, and act as a propagandist. He is told that his broadcasts will provide the US with intelligence, depending on his enunciation, and the nuances in the speech. Campbell does as he is told, and when WWII ends, his contact disappears and he is wanted for war crimes. He flees from authorities and hides in America.Throughout the novel, Campbell seems to be the only character who feels remorse for his actions, although he did nothing wrong. Campbell's deep-seated feelings of remorse and guilt despite his innocence increase as the novel progresses, and when his innocence is finally proved, he makes a surprising choice."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"This is not a classic KV book in the sense that there is no science fiction element, but everything else one has come to expect from KV can be found. Even in such a serious book Vonnegut finds a way to add his dark humor without disrespecting his message. And as usual Vonnegut offers an original perspective on a topic that is commonly used. Any Vonnegut lover should make sure that this book gets entered into their library. This may not be Vonnegut's best (my opinion it is Cats Cradle) but it is still an incredible read. My only problem is the same problem with most of his books; they are too short. It always feels like he has so much else to say, but I guess we cannot get greedy. This is a book for everybody."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Wow....I just finished Mother Night yesterday. It was very interesting and well written, as Vonnegut's novels seem to be.

We never find out why the Nazi's decided to give Campbell his own show or why the OSS decided to use Campbell as a spy.Despite this the book is a very fun read.

He does a good job of putting the book in a realistic historical perspective and makes some great statements about war, espionage, the human soul, and misguided racism and politics.

His answer was that Hesse tells them the things they want to hear, like bad is bad. He forgot to also stress, if I remember correctly, that Hesse writes in simple sentences with few words. You can read it on a bus or a treadmill at the gym. Complexity and intellectual challenge aren't the main things here.Vonnegut himself was a lot like that, and Mother Night is maybe the clearest example of this. It is a morality tale with all the ambiguity and subtlety of a topless bar. He starts with a conventional, but interesting, dilemma, that of the undercover agent who is two things at once, and the question is whether the inner is more real than the outer simply because it is inner. Vonnegut as usual attempts to cut this Gordian knot of the demands of duty with the sword of his 1960s hippy morality. And it's not such a bad approach--do no evil, don't think about the big picture, we are what we pretend to be.So the protagonist willingly accepts his punishment as a traitor despite having the exonerating evidence at hand because he realizes he was what he pretended to be--that his pretend acts had real results. That works great--a \\"good\\" person pretended to be \\"bad\\" and so did \\"bad\\" things and hence was really bad once we use Vonnegut's miracle quotation-point-removing morality.But if \\"we are what we pretend to be,\\" is a bad person who pretends to be good actually good? If my hypocritically simulated sacrifice inspires others to sacrifice themselves for values they believe in, am I really good? Is the coward general who roars \\"come on brave boys, follow me!\\" and then doubles back once they start running a hero?I wish it were so. But I don't think it is that simple. Although it wasn't my principal aim, I ended up being lauded as some sort of hero sacrificing myself for the truth. And that led others to make real sacrifices--and the funny thing is, this ended up wrecking my whole plan in the first place!--for things that I also believe in. Even if I set this in motion, I can't say that this makes my acts \\"good.\\" I don't think Vonnegut was really up to thinking through the actual complexities of moral action in this world. It isn't simply about your \\"effects\\" it is about your self-hood, your authenticity. Campbell had that. Vonnegut didn't know how to deal with that.One last thing--the new cover looks exactly like the logo for the Victor mousetrap. Is that intentional? Did they see Campbell as being trapped like a mouse in a larger plan he didn't understand? [42]"},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"Kurt Vonnegut views concerning wars.

I found it easy to read and did not find myself forcing my way through any part of it.Kindle App - I love that I can press a word and the definition will appear (after it downloads the dictionary). I'd say my vocabulary is only average, so having the instant definitions was incredible. I would never bother in the past looking up words, but now that it's right there I can't resist. I highly recommend reading this on the Kindle Android App (and probably device)."},{"Title":"Mother Night","review":"I read many of Kurt Vonnegut's books back in the 70's, but I never read \\"Mother Night.\\" I look forward to rectifying that situation.

Some of it is humorous. Some of it is scary. And all of it shows the workings of the author's rather strange mind. It's refreshing to read a novel like this and it is also frustrating. It is so exaggerated, absurd and satirical that there were parts of it that made me laugh out loud. Often, all I could think of is how the author's mind worked in such a deranged way. I found that refreshing.Yes, this was a satire. It's not supposed to ring true. It's supposed to make me think. And, yes, it did that. And yes, the author is a bit of a genius.

I also thought that is was scary at parts and made you think about what was going to happen next. I liked it because it was like a horror book, the monster kills lots of people and hurts people, and it was also cool how it took over people when it bits them.I didn't like that the monster was invincible and could't be killed that easily.

I didn't like the plot of the story and how the story ran to gather so quickly.OUt of all i give it a 2 out of 5 because it was a good story, and i liked it. I would probably read it once again but never 2 to 3 more times. It was ok but not the best book i ever read. Why i didn't give it a very high rating is because Im not into knowing what a story about Stonehenge really. I never really wondered what kind of powers it has or any of that stuff.

You will find sections devoted to philatelic terms, how and where to find stamps, the technical aspects of collecting, how to safely store your collection, equipment and tools that collectors use, how to value your stamps, stamps as an investment, societies and publications, stamp production processes, etc. Because the book was published in 1992, it lacks any information related to the Internet.

However, Gluck has a knack for finding even the most oblique poet's most direct and elegant pieces, even unearthing an unusually tender gem from Dean Young. This is a great anthology to teach from, filled as it is with compelling pieces and fascinating behind-the-poem anecdotes by the poets."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"Very nice book to give as a gift. Arrived very quickly and in perfect condition."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize, Pulitzer) and \\"Travels With Charley\\" is a wonderful book. It is not in this collection however. I find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary (read Dickens for instance). In comparison, E.B. White had a gracious side to his writing, a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the English language. I like them both but prefer White. I mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time. They were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"He wrote about real people in real life situations. His characters show us the human condition without pretense or hyperbole. To me, Steinbeck is the Literary version of Rembrandt,the seventeenth-century Dutch painter, one of history's greatest painters, who's work, with its strong light and deep shadow, make his paintings intense. Rembrandt's subjects were mostly common folk as were Steinbeck's characters, who were often simple yet intense. Intense enough to hold our interest from start to finish. Examples: George and Lennie - Of Mice and Men and Jody the ranch boy in The Red Pony. The list goes on, but you should check them out for yourself.Reading Steinbeck, one gets a fascinating look into lives of people we never would have met, yet we feel we know them,and are there as they live through their story, often ending in sadness or tragedy we feel as though it happened to us."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"I did not appreciate the paperback layout of the book. In addition, I did not like that the price was indicated on the cover of the book (it was a present)."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck won a Pulitzer Prize in 1939 and the Nobel Prize in 1962. This wonderful writer died in 1968. I am so glad he won coveted awards before his death. He set a high standard for authors who came after him. I think we need men like Mr. Steinbeck who teach us that reading can be fun. His prose, characters and messages created stories that I believe we can all relate to in one way or another. I think readers can re-read his stories over and over and find something new in them every time. John Steinbeck was a famous author and rightfully so.Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author of \\"I Saw the Light\\""},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"My ex-wife had a collection of Stienbeck novels years ago and I really loved all of them, especially \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\". Now, many years later, I called someone \\"sugarfoot\\" and thought of Stienbeck again so I ordered that book for my kindle (my phone). After that, I ordered this Short Novels collection since it was a much better value than buying them separately."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"Don't let these short works of Steinbeck get past you; they are pure entertainment. I'm a little sorry I did not know to read them many years ago, but then again, they are now a pleasant suprise. I'll be looking for more copies to give to friends next Christmas. Book makes me happy!"},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"These six short novels came highly recommended to me, since I enjoyed Travels with Charley by the same author. Steinbeck is a very powerful, thought provoking writer and I enjoyed this collection very much. I second the recommendation.I will endeavor to describe each book separately....The Red Pony - It's about a boy and his pony. Or is it? Excellent writing, but there's a deeper meaning here that's left to the reader to determine. Animal lovers be warned: bad things happen to two animals in this story and it was VERY hard to read - and hard to scrub from the brain afterward. I know stuff like this really happens, it's just difficult, that's all.The Pearl - Wow. Powerful writing. The story of what happens to a simple family in poverty when they discover a valuable pearl. It is incredibly tragic and I admit that I cried. I cried, and then I thought.Of Mice and Men - The story of two men - one who is small and smart and his friend who is large and 'not too smart'. The large man, Lennie, is kind but hurts the things he loves by accident. He doesn't know his own strength. His smart friend George tries to look out for him and protect him from the damage he causes. Read this and see if you can guess the shocking conclusion. Steinbeck demonstrates the expert use of subtle foreshadowing here. My English teacher should have used this book for class! I'm glad to have finally read this.Cannery Row & Tortilla Flat - I have to group these together because they are so similar. Both novellas are about a poverty stricken community and the people who live there as they struggle to survive. These are real people - all their flaws and inner beauty are shown. Steinbeck introduces these people to the reader and they become the reader's friends. The heroes of both books are a group of guys who never hold down 'real jobs' while somehow managing to survive - and thrive. They drink too much, they steal, they lie, they fight...but when you go with them on their daily lives you will come to love them. How does he do that?The Moon is Down - By far, my favorite of the six. A town is conquered by an invading army during a war. The invading army rejoices over their victory, but have they really WON? Hmmm..."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"John Steinbeck's short novels are among his finest works. Of Mice and men must be one of the most powerful novellas ever written, while both The Pearl and The Red Pony are simple yet wonderfully moving too. They're also a good introduction to Steinbeck's work, as if you don't like these you probably won't like his longer novels."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"This is a wonderful book containing several of Steinbeck's best short novels. He is one of greatest writers of modern or any other time. He is very descriptive so that you feel like your witnessing the events as they unfold. The book is very well binded, etc. This was a great buy."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"This is a nice edition (Kindle). Steinbeck's prose style is simple, yet he gives a sense of people and place that create vivid pictures of them. The most interesting aspect of these stories for me were how they reminded me of Classical Greek Tragedy -- that is they are about how people exercise their freedom of choice and express their dignity within the circumstances of their lives over which they have no control. However, unlike the gods and heroes of that genre, Steinbeck does this for very ordinary people. The stories make the reader think about how each of our lives are the same. We have circumstances, such as affluence or poverty, disability, the family we are born into, chance aquaintances ecountered in our work lives, people we just meet randomly under significant circumstances, war, etc. over which we have limited or no control. But it's how we decide to act within these circumstances that is the theme that makes these stories relevant for anyone's life. BTW, the story that impressed me the most was one I'd never heard about before, \\"The Moon is Down\\"."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck includes some noteworthy books, like the Red Pony and Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck wanders around a lot when he weaves his descriptive tales. After awhile, reading Canary Row, which is included in this digital collection, I've come to the conclusion that he really likes to wander a LOT and develop his characters, and sometimes seems to lack direction in his story as a whole, but perhaps that's the point. Anyway, a great collection of classics by one of the more famous of American writers."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"Steinbeck's novels are wonderful to read. I'm not writing this review for these iconic stories. My critique is for the Kindle Edition. I do love using the Kindle to read, particularly with a book like this that might be a bit large to hold for a long period of time. Yet again, and again, on the Kindle I encounter formatting problems that don't exist in the print editions. In the mad rush of offering all books digitally, publishers are not taking the time to make sure Kindle edition books are of the same quality. I've found may words in this book split in half (a space in the middle of the word), about every ten pages. It doesn't make the book not worth buying, but it is distracting and it can easily be fixed with adequate proofreading."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"This is an outstanding collection of the best know shorter works by Steinbeck, or more accurately a collection of his novellas. The writing is exceptional and this is a highly recommended buy.The stories are short and they cannot be compared with his best known novel \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" But this is a superb collection containing his best short work and first novel \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Also, it contains \\"Cannery Row,\\" another great story. And, it has his interesting novel \\"The Moon is Down.\\" It is about resistance to an invading force. We can assume that it is probably Norway during World War II, and their resistance to Germany, but Steinbeck keeps it a bit vague which broadens the appeal of the book. It could apply to any invading force.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" has over ten million copies in print.Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels, so the present collection is a great buy.The collection has his famous short works and is not a heavy read. Each of the works takes one evening to read. I liked all the stories. Readers will appreciate the clarity of the prose, the characters, and the messages. This is a great value purchase and an interesting reading experience."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"Although no one else has reviewed this new edition of Steinbeck's shorter fiction, you'll find plenty of readers' comments on each of the component novels. Often readers are surprised that Steinbeck's works, being frequently cited as a modern classics, are easy reads. It is the characters and situations in Steinbeck's stories that are compelling -- not a lot of flowery language. I have to admit I somehow missed The Red Pony, but if it's as good as the other five (and people seem to agree that it is) this compilation easily deserves five stars."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"-Tortilla Flat : This opening story ended up being perhaps my favorite of the lot. It's essentially nothing more than the story of a group of lazy, dopey, self-serving Mexican paisanos (country-men) living in Monterey, CA. They are basically panhandlers whose only goal is to acquire the next gallon of cheap wine. The story surrounds four or five of these men who try very hard to have good intentions and help their town-fellows in various ways, but their plans are almost always foiled by seemingly-wise-but-horribly-foolish drunken thoughts and the wasting of what little money they have on more wine. The characters are shockingly real and human and their interactions and motivations are hilarious. Seriously, I chuckled out loud on more than one occasion, and that's saying something about Steinbeck's age-defying talent for human portrayal since this book was published nearly a hundred years ago. Tortilla Flat was funny and sad and silly and real. I absolutely loved it.-The Red Pony: A much more quiet and slow-moving tale, this one is rich with simplistic country-beauty and keen observation. It follows Jody, a young boy on a ranch in rural California who is given a surprise gift by his father; a red pony. The boy's father, Carl, has an outer sternness and his presence demands obedience and respect, however there are clear hints of his inner softness. Also living on the ranch is Billy Buck, a middle-aged stablehand who has a great deal of experience with caring for horses. The story has a smooth pace that weaves through seasons and years as Jody cares for his pony, that *spoiler ahead* ends up dying of a horrible cold, somewhat to the fault of Billy Buck who left the horse out in the rain for too long one day. A number of other things happen after this, including Judy owning a young black stag to care for after his original pony, but ultimately the story carries on and ends in an odd manner. I hate this term, but it's honestly kind of a \`coming of age' tale, with all the imagination and simple pleasures of a young boy, as well as the harsh pain of losing a beloved animal at a young age. All in all it was a sweet and moving story, and made me want to be out in the open and up in the mountains.-Of Mice and Men: Everybody has read this. Seriously. So I need not say much. But there is a reason for it's popularity and timelessness. The short book that Steinbeck intentionally wrote as if it were a play is easily his best known work. It has a quick and to the point quality, and moves in three basic acts as a play should. It is funny and sweet and the ending is downright heartbreaking, but it leaves you with the sense that you could probably read it over and over and never grow weary. A simple and lovely tale that is as good a picture of 1930's America as could be.-The Moon is Down: Had a little trouble with this one. An army of an unnamed country is at war and has occupied a small village in Northern Europe, setting up base in the home of the town's wishy-washy Mayor. Many think it mirrors the occupation of Norway by the Germans during World War II, which is probably why I had trouble connecting much to the situation. To put simply, the town strongly opposes to being occupied, refuses to cooperate, and the army is \`overthrown' by the townspeople through multiple acts of mounting rebellion. There are still hints of Steinbeck's ultra-real human characters on both sides of the opposition, but in general I had a hard time staying with this story as it seems very much to be a tale to those who lived through WWII.-Cannery Row: Cannery Row holds many similarities to Tortilla Flat, both in it's humor and unconventional quality (for it's time). It is not so much a novel as a collection of little short stories all revolving around very eccentric characters in one town. You get the sense that Steinbeck is simply creating character profiles on real people he encountered in Salinas, California, where he grew up. All of the folken are somewhat absurd and have their own little quirks which he describes so precisely you'll be sure you've met the person somewhere. Again, like Tortilla Flat, there are a group of drunken nobodies who try to do something nice for others and end up making a mess of things. This story is 3/4 silliness, but then ends on a surprisingly profound and beautiful note. Let's call it my second favorite.-The Pearl: The Pearl is a modern (in the 1940's) parable of sorts. It follows an extremely impoverished Mexican-Indian diver, Kino, who comes across \`the Pearl of the World,' or, the largest pearl ever discovered by man. He is amazed at his luck and immediately begins fantasizing about the wealth he will soon have when he sells the great pearl. However, the small town in which he lives quickly learns the news of his discovery and seeks to exploit it in their own ways. Kino brings the pearl before multiple appraisers and is determined he is being cheated by their low-dollar offers. He sets out with his wife for the capital city to have it appraised there, which only leads to further trouble. The story is a somewhat fantastical depiction of human greed in a perhaps unfamiliar setting, but it gets the point across clearly.To summarize, I was so very overjoyed to read this collection, and surprised despite my initial judgement of perhaps being bored with something \`old.' Steinbeck was an incredible, endearing author who truly knew his fellow man well and was able to accurately depict him with masterful precision. Reading through these, I realized all the more how much the current writers I enjoy must have been inspired and influenced by the trend Steinbeck began. I see hints of his style in Stephen King, Chuck Palahniuk, and Donald Ray Pollock, to name only a few. To read stories that are 75+ years old and feel as if they could have been written yesterday and still hold the same significance is quite a feat.So, to put simply, Steinbeck was a badass. And you should read him. I suddenly have a man-crush on someone who died 40 years ago."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"Back in junior high reading was never as much fun as it is now. It takes the fun out of reading when you're told to read ... and then turn in a book report. I was constantly looking for books without too many pages that lent themselves to those \\"uh-oh! I have a book report due tomorrow and I haven't read a book!\\" moments. Consequently, John Steinbeck's short novels like The Pearl and The Red Pony seemed ready made for the book report procrastinator.Eventually (translation: after I reached a point where I would no longer had to write book reports) I learned to appreciate Steinbeck's longer works like East of Eden and Grapes of Wrath. Both those books are on a short list of my favorite novels. But after stumbling across this collection while searching for Tortilla Flats I figured I'd re-read some of the books that served me so well as last-minute book reports.Re-reading The Pearl, Of Mice and Men and The Red Pony was a revelation. There were depths of meaning and nuance there I completely missed when I was parsing out the protagonists, antagonists, themes, central conflicts, etc. for book reports. There is a sparse beauty to Steinbeck's short works. He is among a mere handful of writers that can paint entire scenes with only the sparsest brush-strokes of words. Even the works I had not previously read - The Moon is Down and Tortilla Flats - held wonders just waiting to be discovered. Somehow it never connected with me that Steinbeck was re-telling the tales of King Arthur through his characters in Tortilla Flats.I came away from the experience convinced that I should re-read Steinbeck at least every decade to see what new revelations jump out at me."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"Being a huge Steinbeck fan, I love this book. Although I had most of the novels on my shelf already, it's nice to have the short novels together in one book."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"I have a little deal with my grandsons. I find some books and challenge them to read them. Some are a bit advanced for their understanding, some are a little tough to understand due to language (Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn), some, they think are \\"little kid's books\\"(Alice in Wonderland- not the Disney book) I thought I was doing great when I could buy this Steinbeck book for them and they were actually reading 6 little books. They were told that each story had very deep meanings. Not just the boy with a Little Red Pony, or someone who was poor finding The Pearl. This was a wonderful experience. We could discuss it across the 3000 miles that separate us. It was wonderful when a teacher assigned \\"Of Mice and Men\\" to the class, and my grandson had read it 2 yrs before in his Steinbeck book.I also paid my 5th grader $20 to read Watership Down. His older brother teased him about reading a \\"bunny book\\". When my grandson finished it (it was agony in some parts), he said, \\"It sure wasn't just about rabbits was it\\"? Well worth the $20.I often buy used books for the grandkids. The Amazon venders are so good. New books for presents, used books for a mental exercise."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"First of all, this is a smart buy if you plan to read all (or most) of the stories because the cost is much cheaper than buying every one of the 6 books. The only downside I can think of is that it is a heavier book to carry (not a problem for the kindle edition) and you won't be able to share with friends the way you would with separate books.All novels are compelling and this combo shines light on the multiple facets of Steinbeck the writer. While most people associate him to tough social novels such as \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"The Pearl\\", there is also Steinbeck the naturalist/philosopher/humanist/humorist that shines in \\"Tortilla Flat\\" (his first best-seller) and above all in \\"Cannery Row\\". \\"The Red Pony\\" is a moving, highly personal coming-of-age cycle of stories that is well-written, though not quite as gripping as the other stories. All the stories above, with the exception of the Mexican thriller \\"The pearl\\", take place in \\"Steinbeck country\\" that is the Monterey county in the central coast of California, which includes the agricultural riches of the Salinas Valley and the seaside beauty of Monterey Bay. That's where Steinbeck was born and grew up and he writes of the place and its people with unrivaled depth and love.\\"The Moon is Down\\" is a different animal, a political war thriller of Nazi vs. Nordic people where the burden of war and occupation is viewed from both sides.Steinbeck's writing style is accessible and vivid and can be easily enjoyed by most contemporary readers. I believe this combo to be a comprehensive and wonderful introduction to the author or, if you already know and like his work, a convenient way to own the stories."},{"Title":"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck","review":"You can't go wrong for the price. Great to have as an ebook when you want to read some real fiction by a master.

He's the only one who's ever published a translation of the entire thing (everyone else just translates excerpts); this is due to the incredible difficulty of translating some of the complicated linguistic games Huidobro plays with words, which Weinberger actually does a very good job of.Four star worthy if you can only read the translation; easily five star worthy if you can read both the original and the translation."},{"Title":"Altazor (Wesleyan Poetry Series)","review":"Are you prepare to fly upside-down and downside-up through an unexplored universe of words and electrifying feelings?

Unless you have very strong German reading skills, I would recommend looking for a translation. Also, if you are easily offended, especially concerning religion (Catholicism) or sex, this book is not for you.For those with strong German looking for a great post-WWII German literary work, this is a must-read.Oskar Matzerath, an artist of sorts, writes his memoirs while living in an insane asylum, creating a novel that defies all labels and categories, but has been called \\"obscene,\\" \\"burlesque,\\" \\"surreal,\\" \\"pornographic,\\" and \\"magical realist.\\" Through the eyes of the protagonist and his home city of Danzig, Grass lets us observe the culture and history of the \\"Dritte Reich.\\" The novel is divided into three \\"books,\\" which correspond to divisions of German history: pre-WWII, WWII, and post-WWII. Oskar, the observer, is a \\"hellhoeriger\\" infant whose intellectual development is complete at birth and only needs time to show. When he turns three, he recieves a tin drum, which he uses to attack, criticise, teach, and express himself. On his third birthday, he also decides to stop his physical growth, and continues to live as a paradox: to the outward world, he remains a somewhat \\"slow\\" three-year-old, but in fact he is able, from his \\"childish\\" perspective, to see through the shallow, petty lives of the adults around him.The book is written from an intentionally amoral perspective, leaving the reader to struggle with the implications of the events portrayed in remarkable prose. Through Oskar, Grass critiques, speaks of tragedy and violence with equally brutal honesty. He lets no-one off the hook. Die Blechtrommel suggests more than shows the link between the apathy, greed, immorality, and silence of ordinary \\"Kleinbuerger\\" and the rise of Nazi Germany. Even the narrator is shown with all his moral and physical defects, which are many and large. That he fails to win our sympathy or trust is not due to the author's lack of ability; Grass alienates us from Oskar intentionally, denies us an emotional identification with his narrator, startles and provokes us, and challenges us to think more deeply and critically than mere pathos would allow.To sum it up: if you want something that will challenge your German language skills, your assumptions about the world, and your literary perception, read this book."},{"Title":"Die Blechtrommel (bibliophile Ausgabe)","review":"I can think of nothing right about this book.

There was nothing new introduced - other than a few new characters with the same profiles that former characters have had. Anna's concerns haven't changed, her love life hasn't changed, none of the scenarios seem to have changed, and there's no sense of progress throughout the book.Furthermore, the author has been teasing us with glimpses of these other powers -- such as the Matriarch of Ranuck (sp?) and the Spymistress of Wei, yet they continue to lurk on the fringes of the plot and don't play much of a part at all. These characters have potential yet it never gets developed. I hope the author isn't going to drag us through several more installments before he decides to flesh out these players more.Like another reviewer said, this is just a regurgitation of the 2nd book -- even the spells are the same.One last thing, I quickly got bored by the endless dialogue about the chauvenistic men -- why won't they change, why won't they see the light? blah, blah, blah. I felt like I was at some sort of feminist rally (and I'm a working woman who firmly supports female equality). It's pretty clear the men of Defaulk are chauvenistic idiots. But the author shoves that idea down your throat so much you just want to scream, enough already, I get the point!"},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"Sigh.This was a disappointment. Anyone coming into this series without prior experience of the first 2 novels might have found it somewhat incomprehensible. And I, at least, having read with intense pleasure almost everything the author has written in the SF/Fantasy line, found this not up to his standards. Pretty shallow and more of the same ol' same ol'.I will admit that the glimpses of parenting techniques shown with Jimbob, heir apparent to the country, showed promise. [smile]I was especially disappointed in the lack of treatment of the dark-song drummers, especially after the build-up in Book 2.

Gone are the interminable references to Anna clearing mucous from her throat, the endless reminders that she needs to eat, the countless comparisons of Jecks to Robert Mitchum, and much of the pointless sitting around and nattering that marred earlier installments. Each of these are still present, but thankfully not OMNIpresent as they were before.In fact, I wonder if Modesitt either hired a ghost writer or a better editor for Darksong Rising, it's that much better-written than the first two.I was glad to see them finally bringing Jimbob (Worst. King. Name. Ever.) along on an expedition and trying to involve him in the running of things -- I swear, they treat him like a stuffed doll for most of the series.The \\"love story\\" between Anna and Jecks finally gets moving as well, which is good to finally see. The only way I could even tell in the first two books that there was any interest at all was that Modesitt tells us so. One of his great weaknesses as a writer, in my opinion, is that too often he tells us what we need to know rather than letting the story or the character's actions tell us. To quote Mizz Doolittle: \\"Don't talk of love, SHOW ME!\\"Ahem. Anyway, by far the best of the first three books."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"Once again, L. E. Modesitt, Jr. has out-shined himself.

Along the way she is confronted by rebelling Lords and invasion by Ebra and the minions of Erde's largest empire Sturin. This is swords and sorcery at its best. L.E.

It seemed that Anna is faced with the same issues she faced in the last book. The villains are all one dimensional, power hungry, bigoted males. While these characters no doubt deserve their punishments, I would not want to read about them over and over again. This book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"This novel further develops the story and characters of the first two books. There are no surprises and the novel is comfortable, easy to get back into. I'm looking forward to the next novel."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"I wonder...with all the insights of female vanity, and Anna has plenty to go around, if L.E. is really a woman ?Let's get on with Jeck's and Anna's romance and Secca's training. If Anna is so powerful why can she not simply create more edible food for her battle travels and better shelter ?Anna should be more motherly toward Lord Jimbob&lt;giggle, what a name &gt;.This is one of his (?) more simple novels. But I loved it anyway. The writing is basic and keeps you interested.Thanks for the series L.E. :-)"},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"I adore 95% of Modesitt's writing, and have read all his books. And, I am very very comfortable with his feminist support vibes in this particular series. This book, however, seemed to be parked on the tarmack awaiting a signal from the tower for lift off. I would prefer that Anna get past the self absorbed, menopausal whining and complaining. She is portrayed as THE most powerful person on that world, yet she has mastered neither her emotions, nor her self pity. Too much self-talk nattering plus the reminders of her gluttonous nutrition are waaaaay boring. I had hoped for a deeper exploration of drum magic and for a more dynamic battle over the magic power struggle between Anna and the sicko, perverted teenage ruler Rabyn. I want to know more about the Matriarch and the Seers in Wei, and where/when they will come alive in this storyline. Anna needs to meet with the aforesaid powerful women, find her inner power, stop her whining, and as much as I have loved the developing flirtation with Lord Jecks she needs to get it on with or marry him. A much richer character development is needed by now on all the principals in this story. I would like greater insight into the use of &quot;music magic&quot; as it still is not concrete enough to be believable. Can Anna get her daughter to send books across the mist on pharmacology/chemistry/herbology so she can develop even rudimentary medicine to help her new people? The best part of this book were the closing 4 or 5 paragraphs. Mr. Modesitt warmed my heart with the exquisite, breathless moment of that long awaited recognition of love between Anna and Jecks. Even with the feminist focus in these novels, the author's message of love provided the true power in this story that, hopefully in future novels in this series may awaken and transform Anna at last."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"This book could have been titled &quot;The Spellsong War, Part 2&quot; due to the lack of any fresh plot direction. Again, the story of Anna and Defalk revolves around subduing rebellious lords and hostile neighbors, restructuring society, Anna's attraction to Jecks, and her inner turmoil over her lethal use of magic. By repeating the plot of the last book without providing a sense of an underlying purpose or direction, Modesitt reduces the series to a list of battles that prompts this reader to ask &quot;so what?&quot; Another disappointing aspect of this book was that after all the build-up about Anna's enemies and their drums, the actual confrontations were anti-climactic. Victory came too easily and quickly, even when Anna was caught off-guard. We did not see any protracted magical struggle or situation where Anna was overwhelmed, forced to retreat, and compelled to devise a new strategy. If Modesitt plans to continue this series, I hope he introduces some fresh elements.Sorry if this review appears twice, but Netscape crashed when I hit the submit button!"},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"&quot;Darksong Rising&quot; is a worthy successor to the two earlier books in the series. Anna is a believable (and enjoyable) character, and her attempts to wrestle with a new world are good entertainment. The transformation of Defalk continues, and her efforts make a really enjoyable read. Yes, she does whine a bit much about her exile from her children (although in this one at least a hint that she might be recognising that her new life is better). Yes, her sexual frustration over Jecks is also a bit much, too often. But she is entitled to some complaints, given the calls made upon her for selfless sacrifice to help others. I agree too that we could do with a bit less of the &quot;men are dreadful&quot; line. But her magical conflicts are excellent, and I would recommend the series to any fan of fantasy."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"Simply badOnce I start a fantasy series, I tend to stick with it. This was my main reason for buying Darksong Rising. However, I intend to make an exception for this series from now on if the author doesn't do the decent thing and abandon it.A typical scene from the book is as follows: Anna, the heroine, rides off to some castle, tries to treat with her enemies, they aren't interested so she vapes them with fire from the sky and that's the end of them. This happens repeatedly. Where in the first two books there was a little development and variety, in the third book, she's mastered the approach and just does the same thing again and again.Watching the heroine successfully utilize the same super weapon in the same way every time is just boring. It's also simply not believable that if someone has a super weapon that word would not get about so no one would cross her. There's some explanation in the text that the men are too sexist to take a sorceress seriously but it's supposed to be a world with a history of sorcery and sorceresses in particular.The spells are not very believable either. A spell that calls flame down from the heavens on anyone who doesn't treat women well just doesn't ring true. The author does not appear to have thought very clearly about how spellsong works or what its limitations are.The fundamental problem with the book however is a lack of feeling of progression. There are no setbacks suffered to be overcome, no difficult problems solved, just a sorceress riding aroung on horseback and vaping her rather capricious and stupid enemies.In short, don't buy it."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"I enjoyed the first two in this series, but this one was, frankly, just stupid in places. Not only were the characters black-and-white cutouts rehashed from the previous books, but the sorceress herself was just plain dumb at times. If you know the Bad Guy uses huge drums to amplify his magic and you have this convenient spell that rains fire from the heavens, it might occur to any sentient being to hit the drums with the fire while the Bad Guy is asleep, instead of waiting until he wakes up and tries to defend himself. Apparently that's too much to hope for.Also too much to hope is moral ambiguity and any chance that someone the sorceress dislikes at first glance will turn out to be anything other than a Bad Guy (possibly temporarily tolerated for Political Purposes).I had high hopes for this series. Pity this book is in it."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"I am a fan of most L.E Modesitt stories, and have always been a fan of strong female characters that are well written.True, some parts of the story seem to drag because SOME people like to get to the action quick and in a hurry and get tired of reading about peoples motivations. If a story is written poorly and boring then people would put the book down and never get to the end. Not so with this book. The Author does a good job of letting us see the workload that Anna must face on a constant basis and doesn't go the easy route of just giving her a bunch of efficient underlings to handle the menial stuff. In a still interesting way we get to see that all of her decisions are not easy ones and the things she does have consequences not just for herself but for the entire Kingdom of Defalk.In the story, though her actions seem roundabout to some, she gradually wins those in her immediate circle of influence over to her point of view. Those lords and rulers who are too wrapped up in their own way of thinking to change will learn that its not easy to overcome the Soprano Sorceress.The book had that building energy that you get with a thunderstorm that is on the horizon. You are not sure when it will actually strike with lightning but when it does the thunder makes you jump.This book was a very good read and if you enjoy a good story that lets you understand the motivations of a character then you will enjoy reading this book. One of the worst things in a story are when a person makes stupid decisions just to enhance a problem later in a storyline. If the characters make mistakes in this book you are made to understand why, either through prejudice, misinformation or just not having enough time, you the reader get to appreciate the motivations and you enjoy the ending when it comes.Hope there is another book when the characters get a little older!"},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"The first book in this series contained a very clever and fresh idea. The second book developed it nicely. The third book, however, is a disaster, and one can only hope from the ending, that it is the last. One of Modesitt's strong points, certainly in the Magic of Recluse books, is to blend action with introspection within a more or less steady growth. This pattern certainly characterizes the first two books of the present series, and then it stops. Anna does not develop in the book, she makes no attempts at finding any sort of alternatives to flaming those she doesn't like, nor does she look into some expansion of the magic that she does or any attempt at understanding it. She endlessly agonizes over whether or not she's justified in killing thousands to impose her idea of what's right, only to come to the conclusion that &quot;damn right, it's justified!&quot; Is it? I think not. It's certainly the easy way. In the first two books Anna thrashes about not knowing what she's really doing. In this book she knows all too well. Not a very nice person, if you ask me. This book may appeal to fanatic feminists who would love nothing more than to off whoever disagrees with them, but I think that Modesitt has vastly oversimplified and not really wrestled with the issues as he has done so well in other books. A very, very disappointing book."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"This third book in the Spellsong Cycle left me a little unsatisfied. I say a little and I mean it literally, because when this book was good it was DY-NO-MITE ala Jay Jay Evans. However, I did find myself wishing that Modessitt would get a little more experimental or playful with the story at times. For example:- What would happen if she fretted her lutar? Wouldn't it be louder?- What would happen if her daughter sent her a bunch of Earth-made, precision instruments? What about a really simple phonograph and symphony records? It wouldn't amplify, but it would probably be earth-shakingly magical in one area.- I'd like to learn more about Jecks. Maybe even have a whole chapter devoted to Jecks and what he was doing. That would have been great in this book because he was in the castle by himself for who knows how long. What did he have to do?Here is the good and the bad of Darkson Rising.Good:1) I loved this one idea that Anna had for solving her money problems - and the realistic issues raised by it. That falls a little into the \\"experimental/playful\\" category I was just complaining about. This was awesome, but I wish there had been more about it or like it.2) I was happy with the character development of Jimbob. I'd like more!3) I love the merit system she forces down everyone's throat, and her constant reminders to anyone who urges her to be cautious and move slowly that Defalk needs to change or it will fail.4) I was very happy to see Anna actually have a challenge with young prophet. Too often she shows up, sings, cries about it, eats something and then rides on to do it again.5) I appreciate the way Modessitt portrays people who are good and evil. Konstinn doesn't appear to be completely evil, and the lord of the Western Marches doesn't appear completely good - and its done realistically. I like this because it allows for unpredictability from the characters.Bad:1) I get it - sorcery makes her hungry. I have an idea that would save Modessitt lots of repetition and typing and us a lot of repetitive reading: she makes a really well-worded song which enchants a bag in such a way that the food inside of it transfers to her stomach all day long, bit by bit, every hour on the hour.2) Lord Jecks is going to obviously be a more important character later - lets learn a little more about him. He's very two-dimensional and it'd be better if he wasn't.3) I'd like to know more about the world and its magic system. How does the music-magic work? How far back does this world's history go? What is its relationship to the mist worlds? Are there other magics in the mist worlds? Could Anna go there for help with something? Could they threaten invasion? This isn't a bad point so much as another wish list - my apologies.4) Here's a genuine bad point: Anna defeated the Sturanese (sp?) in a most humiliating manner, yet we only see Nordwei and that southern country's reactions to the things she does. We see nothing from the Sturanese - I think they WOULD react or plot her downfall, and I expect to see more about them in later books.Ok, that's all. Yes, I gave this book a 4 because I really liked the plot, the characters and all the things that happened. But I'm left craving more of the imagination and invention that I've gotten from the author - to a greater or lesser extent - in the other books that I've read by him."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"Strange book. Modesitt is almost always an entertaining writer-- this is no exception. His books are adept at introducing realism into fantasy, the characters worry about unions and logistics and politics more than they do evil and magic and that is one of the things that I very much like about his writing. I liked this book for the very same reasons.As a series entry, however, _Darksong Rising_ is oddly lacking. We see no character development from Anna and no real continuation of the older more interesting threads (Seers of Wei, for instance)and seemingly nothing new is introduced to be picked up later. It's as though Modesitt had to turn out a new installment for the publishers, but hadn't quite figured out where he needs to take his little fantasy-based political experiment. There are some interesting questions raised here (as in the others of the series) about cultural change, appropriate use of power, and political systems but I think that in order to keep the readers' attention Modesitt is going to have to come up with an equally interesting plot direction."},{"Title":"Darksong Rising - the Third Book of the Spellsong Cycle","review":"After reading what passes for literature in some of the other genres, to I think I'll stick with this series.

I've read nearly all of Bruce Catton's Civil War work and this one is the best--buy it and read it again and again."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"If you are one who has never read a book about the Civil War, or studied it since you were in high school, you could do much worse than to start with Bruce Catton's \\"This Hallowed Ground.\\" Mr. Catton, who passed away in 1978, has long been hailed as one of the best, if not the very best, Civil War writer ever to create a manuscript. Recently, when I mentioned to a friend during a conversation about the kind of books we prefer, that I read a lot about the American Civil War, she sort of made a sour face and began praising the virtues of Romance novels. Now, there are history books, even books about the Civil War that warrant a sour face, but the books written by Bruce Catton are not among them. His narrative, his prose, his whole writing style is sometimes enough to bring tears to the eyes or take the breath away. Here, I quote a paragraph from a chapter titled \\"Where They Were Bound to Go,\\" in the book that is the subject of this review.\\"The wind was being sown, and the hurricane would come later; and yet, all in all, these things were not so much causes as warnings - the lightning flashes that set evil scarlet flares against the black clouds that were banked up along the horizon. Somewhere beyond the lightning there was thunder, and the making of a great wind that would change the face of a nation, destroying much that men did not want destroyed. A doom was taking shape, and it seemed to be coming on relentlessly, as if there was nothing that anyone could do to prevent it. The republic that had been born in an air so full of promise that it might have been the morning of the seventh day was getting ready to tear itself apart.\\"In this manner Mr. Catton sets the scene for the war that took the lives of 620,000 Americans, tore families apart, and put some teeth in the statement that \\"All men are created equal.\\" As has been noted in other reviews here, Catton was top-heavy on the side of the North, and why not? He was a Michigan boy, and no one would expect a Michigan boy to lionize the South any more than they would expect a fellow from Georgia to shun Stonewall Jackson and glorify Tecumseh Sherman! Yet there is, wrapped up in all of the words in this book that seem to revere the Union cause, in the dramatic and often dynamic prose of a great writer, a recognizable thread of fairness, and deep admiration for the courage and valor of the Southern soldier.This Hallowed Ground is an excellent place to start any study of the Civil War, or even to engage in some casual reading. Bruce Catton begins before the beginning, and carries it through to the end, leaving out much of the battle strategy and tactics, and appealing to the heart of every American who, as he says on page 25 of the paperback edition: \\"......what they saw, briefly but clearly, after so many years in which nothing was clear - was the fact that they did have a country and that their common possession of it was the most precious thing in the world.\\" It may be that what Americans saw so clearly all those years ago, is the only way to understand the \\"why\\" of the war that changed the soul of this great nation. At least, I think that may be so."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"I only wish that I could write 1/4 as well."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"I first read this book almost 40 years ago. With some nervousness, I picked up a copy to read, wondering how well it has held up with the years. Bruce Catton wrote a number of works during his time--from his examination of the Army of the Potomac to his final two volumes of a 3-work biography of U. S. Grant. A number of things stand out about Catton's work. For one, he is an excellent writer. His books move along smoothly and even eloquently. One is captivated by his style. Two, he can, in a few paragraphs, tell us a great deal about the people of the Civil War. Want to get a sense of the crusty veteran general, Charles F. Smith? In a few broad strokes, you get a sense of the man. Three, he provides broader context on the war and its battles, for example, illustrating at one point the difference between the industrial might of the North and the much less advanced industry of the South. A telling commentary on the raw differences between the two sides.This book, then, has something in common with McPherson's splendid \\"Battle Cry of Freedom.\\" As McPherson, Catton provides a context in which to examine the Civil War. However, even though his description of battles and campaigns tends to be terse, one nonetheless gets a sense of what was at stake and how the battles unfolded. Even with only a few paragraphs on the battle at Wilson's Creek, for instance, one gets a sense of the strange saga of the pugnacious General Lyon's outnumbered army trying to envelope the superior southern forces (the text does not mention that making the odds even longer, Lyon depended on Franz Sigel to carry out the envelopment--a most unfortunate choice).Just so, the discussion of both Gettysburg and Vicksburg is brief but in enough detail to get a sense of the challenges facing both armies at these struggles.Catton unequivocally identifies slavery as a key issue as a part of the cause of the war; he also points out, here and there, how the Union army came slowly to see the evil of slavery, even as they harbored prejudice against slaves.If the reader wants detailed analyses of battles, this book would not serve well. If the reader is interested in a well written historical work that looks at the Civil War and its context, then this book should do nicely. Over a half century since its original publication, this book holds up pretty well--and it is written superbly."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"If you're interested in the Civil War enough to browse this book, go ahead and snag it. To get a grasp on this period of our history, you must read Catton. He tells the overall story in the style almost of a novel. He is accurate and factual. Never fear. But this isn't reading history as you might remember. Catton will get your attention, draw you in and help you to feel some of the myriad of emotions that coursed through our ancestors on both sides of this conflict. He made me understand that wherever they trod was indeed hallowed ground after their passing."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"This is a book about war, rebellion and freedom. And Bruce Catton weaves these three ideas with great precision in telling this story about our American Civil War. War is about battle and Catton leaves no stone unturned, describing the battles fought and the participants involved with clarity and precision. No significant action in the Eastern or Western theaters of operation is omitted and the reader is left with an understanding of the shifting, near thing with which many of the engagements are fought. From Bull Run in 1861 to the final contest at Five Forks in 1865, Catton works his audience through the campaigns in singular detail.With regard to rebellion, Catton is not one to mince words and defines it in one word: Treason. He points out that the South's most significant error was their complete failure to understand early on, the North's total dedication to Union. \\"The South could only win its independence by destroying the government of the United States. As such Southerners were not merely enemies; they were traitors, to be treated as such.\\" It would be a long and vicious war whose terms and methods of waging it would be defined by Abraham Lincoln.But it is with regard to freedom that Catton is at the top of his form. He regards the Emancipation Proclamation as the most significant weapon fired during those four long years of war. Declaring slavery extinct in exactly all the areas in which the Federal Government could not enforce the decree, the Emancipation was truly an unusual document. But Lincoln knew its ultimate impact. Emancipation isolated the South. In Catton's words, \\"It closed a great door in the face of the southern Confederacy. It locked the Confederacy with the anachronism that was the Confederacy's dreadful, fatal burden.\\" Europe could not support slavery. The South was alone with limited manpower, no manufacturing capacity to produce the instruments and material with which to wage war and no friends. The millstone of slavery, that for which it had been fighting, would drag it under.Catton delivers a thoughtful, stirring analysis of the American Civil War. Written in 1956, This Hallowed Ground is totally devoid of rancor, finger pointing, or the revisionism so prevalent in many of the works of its era. Bruce Catton is probably the most prolific writer on this subject; given his superb writing he is also probably the best."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"\\"This Hallowed Ground\\" is famed Civil War historian Bruce Catton's one volume history of that conflict. It captures the great themes of his three volume centennial history in a concise yet complete reading experience.Bruce Catton wrote \\"This Hallowed Ground\\" in the mid-1950's, prior to the centennial of the Civil War. His scholarship is therefore dated with respect to details revealed by later research, and certainly more recent historians have contributed new and fascinating interpretations of events and participants. However, none save Shelby Foote have approached Catton's literary gifts as a narrative historian of the first order. \\"This Hallowed Ground\\" reads as tragic human drama on an almost mythic scale. Catton's gift is to provide a coherent narrative of the conflict while locating the stories of very human actors within the larger tragedy. The result brings a long and complicated war into focus for the average reader.Catton came to the study of the Civil War from a career as a journalist, and as one who had known Civil War veterans during his youth in Michigan. Catton had the good journalist's ability to capture a sense of the person, the place, and the event. \\"This Hallowed Ground\\" is told as a series of rather vivid vignettes, each capturing a key moment in the war. The reader comes to understand how the force of events quickly overran the intentions of both sides at the start of the conflict. Key persons, themselves often driven by political considerations of the moment, changed the direction of events, sometimes inadvertantly. The major personalities, Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Grant, and Lee march across the stage, but a host of lesser characters have their moments as the war winds down to its awful and perhaps unavoidable conclusion.This book is highly recommended to the reader looking for a highly readable one volume history of the Civil War, and to students of the conflict looking for an account that transcends dry scholarship."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"Bruce Catton is one of the best history writers of the Civil War. He writes in a fashion that is easy to read yet leaves no doubt what he is saying. Very good way to enjoy history. It is almost like reading a novel."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"(For a complete, formatted review, please visit [...]There are not enough superlatives to do justice to this book. I read it as a teenager and bought it in a Washington bookstore for my son but ended up reading it again myself. As many reviewers have noted, if you read only one book about the Civil War, read this. Bruce Catton has a lyrical poetic style that weaves colorful anecdotes with sweeping prose that makes about as much sense as anyone can of the horror of America's bloodiest war by far.First published in 1955, before the civil rights movement entered into the consciousness of most educated Americans, This Hallowed Ground was remarkably prescient, referring repeatedly to the painful issue not just of slavery but of race and of the inevitable reckoning that would have to come if the \\"peculiar institution\\" were abolished once and for all. Eight years before Martin Luther King was to deliver his \\"I Have a Dream Speech,\\" Catton could see that almost a century after the Civil War, the United States remained a work in progress.Catton avoids the pitfalls that trap many historians, such as a compulsion for detail that misses the forest for the trees, or a contemporary interpretation whose bias makes later readers wince. When Catton drills down to a battlefield, he gives just enough detail to create a vivid word picture but is adept at zooming out and showing us how the battlefield fits in the campaign, and the campaign in the war, and the war in the history of America. Long before Ken Burns' PBS Civil War series had been conceived (Burns was only 2 when the book was published), Catton peppered his narrative with extracts from letters and diaries of the ordinary men who had a front row seat to this extraordinary history.Perhaps because of all the shouting going on in American politics today about what it means to be an American and the proper scope and power of the federal government, there was something eerily contemporary about the book's opening. Following arrests made in Baltimore, \\"when Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney issued a writ of habeas corpus to set one of these free, President Lincoln blandly ignored it... The Supreme Court had indeed been flouted, the Constitution had been stretched, perhaps even broken (depending on one's point of view), scores of people were being held in prison without due process of law... No matter. Maryland was not going to go out of the Union.\\" And I could not help think of today's political attack ads when reading that \\"men who were whipping themselves up to the point where they would refuse to try to get along with one another were, at the same point in time, doing precisely the things that would bind them together forever whether they liked it or not. \\" But for all the harsh words, today's acrimony has not spilled over into violence, as it did on the senate floor in the opening scene of the book with the 1856 caning of Senator Charles Sumner. But the compulsion of demonizing one's adversaries remains: \\"All of the things that were slipping beyond hope of easy solution - ... varying interpretations of the American dream - all of these somehow might hinge on what was done about Kansas, so that the wrong phrase in an enacting clause could mean earth's best hope lost forever.\\"If Catton's work had been fiction, it would have been rejected for lack of plausibility. Given the carnage of the war that was to come, why would volunteers be so eager to fight that \\"soldiers sent home in Indiana threatened to shoot their colonel\\"?How could it possibly be that the house chosen to host the surrender that would end this terrible war would be that of Wilmer McLean, a Virginian who found his Bull Run home too caught up in the war's opening battle, so moved to Appomattox? Who knew that Grant not only owned a slave at one point but didn't care all that much about slavery one way or the other until about 1861? Or that the two generals most instrumental to ending the war were both from Ohio and overlapped at West Point (Grant was a senior when Sherman was a plebe)? Or that on the very morning that Sherman was to accept the surrender of General Johnston he received a telegram telling him of Lincoln's murder? And the contrast between General Lee - \\"tall, gray, one of the handsomest and most imposing man who ever lived, dressed today in his best uniform, his sword belted at his waist\\" and the man who received his surrender \\"US Grant, rather scrubby and undersized, wearing his work in close, with mud spattered boots and trousers and a private's rumpled coat with his lieutenant general stars tacked to the shoulders\\" at a surrender ceremony where Grant had to borrow ink from the Lee and Lee had to borrow paper reflected staging too perfect for a good fiction editor.His writing pulls you in and keeps you riveted such as with this description of Antietam:There never was another day like Antietam. It was sheer concentrated violence... it had all of the insane fury of Shiloh with this difference: at Shiloh the troops were green ... at Antietam the men were veterans and they knew what they were about... so that the dawn to dusk fight above Antietam creek went into the records as the most murderous single day of the entire war.Sherman's march to the sea is described in a way that rivals the far more biased and regional fiction of Margaret Mitchell: \\"Smoke filled the sky like a gigantic ominous signal as Sherman's army pulled clear of the city [of Atlanta] and started for the sea... And so began the strangest, most fateful campaign of the entire war, like nothing that happened before or afterward. These federals were not moving out to find and destroy an armed enemy; the only foe that could give them a fight, Hood's army, was hundreds of miles off to the rear, and everybody knew it. They were not being asked to hurry; 15 miles a day was much less than these long legged marchers could easily make, and everybody knew that too. Their mission was to wreck an economy and to destroy a faith - the economy that supported the thin fading fabric of the Confederacy, the faith that believed the Confederacy to be an enduring creation and trusted in its power to protect and avenge.\\" The men were \\"conscious agents of this destruction; men who trampled out the terrible vintage of the grapes of wrath, led by an implacable general who was more and more coming to see a monstrous but logical destiny in his mission... For Sherman was not fighting and opposing army now; he was fighting an idea, knocking down the last shredded notion that the Southern Confederacy could exist as an independent nation, moving steadily and relentlessly not toward a climactic engagement but simply toward the end of the war.\\"The final days and aftermath of the Civil War are such well-trodden ground that it is surprising that no author before or since has really topped Catton's riveting description of the end:Until this Palm Sunday of 1865 the word Appomattox had no meaning. It was a harsh name left over from Indian days, it belonged to a river and to a country town, and it had no overtones. But after this day, it would be one of the haunted possessions of the American people, a great and unique word that would echo in the national memory with infinite tragedy and infinite promise, recalling a moment in which sunset and sunrise came together in a street glow that was half twilight and half dawn.Like a brilliant movie director, Catton pans his camera over the horrific cost and inevitable consequences of the Civil War in ways that make historical abstractions come alive:Here and there all over the country where the mounded graves of half a million young men who had been alive and unsuspecting when all of this began. There would be more graves to dig, and when there was time there would be thin bugle calls to lie in the still air on a handful of dust drifted down on a blanketed form, but most of this was over. A little more killing, a little more marching and burning and breaking and smashing, and then it would be ended.Ended; yet, in a haunting way, forever unended. It had laid an infinity of loss and grief on the land; it had created a shadowed purple twilight streaked with undying fire which would live on deep in the mind and heart of the nation, as long as any memory of the past retained meaning. Whatever the American people might hereafter do when one way or another take form in color from this experience.If Catton can be faulted, it is for a certain tendency to repeat but his prose is so lyrical, almost hypnotic, that he can be forgiven. He also shares the compulsion of all historians to assign meaning to events, even if some things, perhaps most things, just happen. Historians probably would not be historians if they did not discount the role of randomness, meaningless, and blind chance. But I find myself so mesmerized by Catton's authoritative writing - at times he seems to have known the protagonists personally - that I find myself wanting to believe his sweeping, all-explanatory narrative."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"When I was a freshman in college, way back in 1986 I happened upon a Bruce Catton (1899-1978) book in the bookstore while buying all of my textbooks for my first semester. I picked it up just because I was in a mood to be educated with something that looked more interesting and less daunting than my economics and math textbooks. My fascination with all things Civil War began with that book (I sold it in a fit of stupidity a couple of years later). I read his trilogy, re-printed articles in American Heritage and then I moved on to other talented authors, such as James McPherson.Rather stupidly, I forgot how truly gifted Catton was as a writer and I just assumed that because Catton was the historian of my childhood, he was an inferior writer. Why? I don't know. I picked up this This Hallowed Ground: The Story of the Union Side of the Civil War to read on a family vacation and I was reminded, once again, that this man could truly write and he belongs right there in the pantheon of truly gifted storytellers who can tell the story of America in an entertaining, factual and compelling way (for those that scoff at narrative history in favor of \\"serious history\\" I say that the purpose of a historian is to tell his society their own story and make it seem that it matters. Bruce Catton did just that.)Catton begins with a single week in May of 1856. We have the beating of abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner by a pro-slavery Congressman in the Senate Chamber, the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces and John Brown's brutal attack at Pottawatomie Creek. All within a few days of each other - all portents of things to come. One thing seemed to unhinge everyone in America - slavery and the disagreement over a state's right to declare a man to be another man's property.Catton does tell the story almost completely from the Union perspective and it is clear that he is sympathetic to the Union cause in this book. He is not the only author of Civil War histories to have favorites, but he is clearly not disrespectful of the Confederate soldiers or of their efforts. He is also leery of some of the liberties Lincoln took in his effort to maintain the Union, as is clear in the section on Clement Vallandigham.Mostly, though, Catton's strength is just his storytelling. It moves along crisply with a penchant for telling the odd, humorous and tragic little stories that make up the overall big story. Along the way, Catton produces some profound little gems, like this paragraph about 1864 the slow, bloody demise of slavery and what that meant for the country that concluded a chapter:\\"It would be that sort of year: year of Jubilo, year of overturn and disaster and ruin, year infinite bloodshed and suffering, with the foundations of the great deep broken up; hard tramp of marching military feet, endless shuffle of splay-footed refugees running from something they understood little better than they could understand what they were running toward; the significance of their march being that it led toward the unknown and that all America, like it or not, was going to follow.\\"To sum up, this is a lovely little history - beautifully written, skillfully told by a master storyteller. It is not the only history that someone should read of the Civil War, but it is a great place to start. Also, I am thrilled that I went back and re-discovered Bruce Catton and found that he is not only as good as I remembered - he is better.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"I have an extensive Civil War library, and this is simply the best of the best book therein. It is a one volume offering from the Union point of view, although it clearly defines both sides. Catton's style is simply amazing. Although history at its best, this reads like classic literature. The concluding scenes described by Catton practically bring tears to your eyes.Be aware that this book is out of print. This is why I bought several more copies at Amazon."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"Catton has masterfully crafted a well researched very readable book. It explores much more than troop placements by putting a very human face on the greatest of American tragedies."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"I was half way through the first volume of Foote's epic 3 volume \\"The Civil War: a narrative\\" when I paused for a breather and read Catton's Hallowed Ground.So, compared to Foote's 3 volume The Civil War, Catton's Hallowed Ground provides a good overview of all the major battles in the Civil War. He had also included quotes from letters soldiers had written to family which I thought was a nice touch as it provided a different view of the civil war and illustrated how tough things were for them. What I also liked about Catton is that he had referenced the quotes and pointed to other books if you were interested in that particular regiment or battle.For someone new to the civil war, I would definitely recommend reading Catton's Hallowed Ground first then refer to Foote for more detailed description of the more interesting battles. However, as another reviewer here points out, there is a hint of bias in favour of the confederacy in Foote."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"The Civil War was a vastly complex conflict, and there are thousands of specialized texts to be had. This book captures the heart of the tale, and you come away with both the history and the powerful national and human drama. I read this book with a sense that I was there, watching the battles unfold, listening in as the decisions were made that sent men to their triumphs or to their deaths. It is highly readable, but I did not want to rush through it; I periodically put it aside to let my spirit settle.If your knowledge of the Civil War is limited and you think maybe you ought to know more or you'd like to know more, but you don't want to crack open a dry textbook -- then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"The Civil War remains the pivotal and most discussed event in our Nation's history. Every generation of writers and readers feels the need to tell the story of the War anew and to reflect upon its meaning. In the mid-20th Century, the leading interpreter of the Civil War was Bruce Catton (1899-1978). Catton wrote narratives for the nonspecialist reader. He had the ability to make the Civil War era, the battles, and the issues come alive to a broad public. There is still much to be learned from his writing style and from his discussion of the War.Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground: the Story of the Union Side of the Civil War&quot; (1956) remains an essential one-volume study of the conflict. Only James McPherson's work, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; comes close to matching its scope. While McPherson's work may show a greater degree of scholarship, Catton's work more than compensates in its eloquence and passion.The book begins with the famous caning that Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina gave to Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in 1856 following a Sumner speech against slavery before the Senate. It examines the causes of the War, the battles and politics of the conflict, and concludes with the end of the long conflict in April 1865. (It gives only a brief glance to Reconstruction.)Catton tells the stories of the War's military engagements simply and understandably. I have read detailed accounts of many Civil War battles and tend to become confused. Catton's accounts of the battled are short and, of course, simplified; but they cut to the heart of the matter. I would recommend that anyone interested in studying a battle in depth read Catton's account first, both for an overview of the War and for a basic account of the battle and its place in the scheme of the War.Catton unequivocally states that slavery was the prime cause of the War. I think most contemporary historians agree with him. But many recent writers try to persuade their readers that they are discovering the importance of slavery to the conflict for themselves -- almost for the first time since 1865. It is helpful for an understanding of the history of history to see Catton's recognition (in a popular work written more than a generation ago) of slavery as the driving factor of the War. Catton also writes eloquently about industrialization in North America and about the factors which worked ultimately to make the United States a unified nation. I learned a great deal about the issues leading to the War and about the changes it effected in American life from Catton's account. (In his short discussion of Reconstruction, Catton suggests that the victorious Union took an unduly punitive approach to the South. This is one area in which many contemporary historians, I think, would tend to disagree with him.)Catton's work also places great emphasis on the Western theatre of the War beginning with the capture of Fort Donelson in 1862. He sees Antietam rather than Gettysburg as the Confederate &quot;High Tide&quot; in the conflict. In these matters too, Catton's discussion is in accord with much recent writing on the War.Although Catton's book focuses on, and is deeply sympathetic to, the Northern war effort, he portrays the Confederacy as a valiant and determined foe making its own effort to preserve what it viewed as a traditional, agrarian way of life. Again, he never allows the reader to forget that this way of life was predicated upon slavery. He recognizes the South's persistence in the War, the determination of its people, the courage of its soldiers, and the brilliance of Robert E. Lee without falling into &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology.I am pleased that Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; remains in print and available for new readers who wish to understand our country and its greatest conflict. This book is an excellent choice for readers who only wish to read a single work on the War. I enjoyed the comments of the other Amazon readers who have reviewed this book."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"Bruce Catton is first and foremost a storyteller. Beyond the actual retelling of the events, which are truly awe-inspiring in their own right, Mr. Catton offers the reader true insight into the stakes of each major battle and the entire as only historical hindsight can offer. The reader will likely gain an appreciation for Lincoln's burden, who seemingly was singly aware amongst the Northern decision makers of the broader consequences of the actions taken to preserve the fledgling union. Mr. Catton does not overly dwell on tactics and casualty numbers, focusing rather on the Civil War amid the context of American culture and history.A note on the tone of the book. This is not a balanced account of the great story, in that there is focus on the Northern side. However, Mr. Catton is delivering no more or less than promised, as the title of the book identifies this intent. That said, this does not mean that he in any way exaggerated the cause or characters in any apparent way. I am not an historian, but am a budding Civil War enthusiast, and have read a couple of the heavyweights: McPherson's &quot;Battlecry of Freedom&quot; and Foote's &quot;The Civil War: a Narrative,&quot; and consider Catton's work superior to both. McPherson's work is a bit more factual, but not as poetic. Foote's 3000+ page work is difficult to read due to his unabashed favoritism to the Confederacy's cause, its heroes, and its battle prowess; even though he is every bit the storyteller and researcher that Catton is. All in all, I would recommend reading both Catton and Foote to achieve a well balanced tutorial of our greatest American story."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"This is one of the two or three very best histories of the Civil War ever written.

It teaches us tremendously important lessons of character and history.In addition, it's a real page-turner - not a hard read at all. I've quoted more sections of it to my wife, my children (ages 11 and 13) and my co-workers than any other book I can think of.I recommend this book to my brothers and sisters who are descendants of Confederate veterans, as well as those of us who are descended from the Union side.

It's a massive subject matter with what must be millions of words written in it's account. Thus reading about the war could be confusing at the least and over powering at the most. This is not the case with Bruce Catton who writes with a clarity that enables the reader to clearly understand the events he is relating.'This Hallowed Ground' is no exception. It is concise, clear and informative, thus the reader whether this is their 1st Civil War read or their 100th will put the book down and want to know more!For a factual book it often had the feel of a good Civil War novel, it is exciting and breath taking with a real power that I feel is hard to match elsewhere. Here is an author that not only both knows and respects his subject matter but is able to transfer this to the written page.One word of warning, read it slowly. If you rush through this book (and there is a temptation to do so due to its strengths) you will regret it when the last page is completed."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"I have been a reader of Bruce Catton's Civil War histories for years (I own 10 of them). I agree with the reviewers about Catton's vast talent as a storyteller and as a narrator of events. It was through reading his works that I first became aware of some of the lesser known colorful characters of the time, such as Gen. Phillip Kearney, Gen. D.H. Hill, and Robert Toombs. In fact, it was the writing of Bruce Catton that first turned me into a Civil War buff.I have a rather strong objection to the subtitle of this work, which the late historian would never have approved were he alive today. This book is not \\"the Union side\\" of the Civil War; it gives BOTH sides. In fact, the author is more sympathetic to men like Gen. Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis than I would have been. For many years, some influential historians have sought to label any history that seems to hint that the right side won the Civil War as biased. (Over four score and seven years, actually.) This work is a balanced account, and one of the best one-volume histories of the war ever written, both on the battle front and at the home fronts. It deserves to be thought of as such."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"Of all the heartbreaking, sacrificial, and exhausting wars that the United States has encountered, the Civil War is the most upsetting of all. Bruce Catton, part of the last wave of a generation of romantic historians, paints a vivid portrait of the Union side of the conflict. Like all war historians, he is impressed by the elements that are found in the crucible of a long fight: the pageantry, brilliant tactical moves, feats of individual courage, and the inexhaustible source of stories. But on the other, he has enough judgment to temper his own writing with accounts of casualty lists and useless battles.Catton's main thesis is that although the war did not begin over slavery, it became so through the force of the war's tide, and that the tide only became inexorable after a series of poor decisions on the Union side. He is especially adept at tracing the threads of the various campaigns - the Army of the Potomac's stalemated situation in Virginia, for instance, is contrasted with Grant's quick thinking out west with the Army of the Tennessee. As the title would imply, the book focuses on the to and fro movements of the Union side. Lincoln, Lee, and the particularities of the situation prior to the war are not dealt with in any depth.Nor is this is a book with a list of laundry items for the typical soldier and a slew of footnotes, although it is well-researched and thorough. Catton is more interested in quickly sketching an army as they march through the heat of the Mississippi and the lush countryside of Georgia. He unabashedly plays favorites with his \\"cast of characters\\" - Grant and Lincoln are praised, McClellan is not - but in most cases his biases are justified.One could argue Catton's taste for drama and humorous anecdote overrides his ability to assess rationally the Civil War, but perhaps his romantic/realistic view of history is more in keeping with the age it is describing. The Civil War was fought by stubborn men who refused to cede a tenet long past its due date - and that in itself is the true tragedy."},{"Title":"This hallowed ground;: The story of the Union side of the Civil War (Mainstream of America series)","review":"There are more books about the American Civil War than on any other subject in US history. New books are written everyday. Some are very good, some are not. However, despite all the new enteries to the field of study in my opinion the best is some of the oldest. In my opinion no one writes better about the Civil War than Bruce Catton. In this work he looks at the Civil War from the Union point of view. But regardless, it is one of the best single volume histories of the war. And despite its age, Catton's works has stood the test of time. His history is good and accurate. And he can write. Catton discusses good history and tells it in beautiful writing. This could be a novel.

In so doing, both books provide an insightful analysis of racism in the mid-nineteenth century and how it is a foundation for racism today.

Snow's THE MASTERS, the fourth in his STRANGERS AND BROTHERS sequence, is his best-known book and has often been hailed as his masterpiece. It's been compared frequently to BARCHESTER TOWERS: a valid comparison, since among his many other achievements Snow was also a biographer of Anthony Trollope. Certainly THE MASTERS does seem to have used Trollope's governing plot of the jostling and politicking to fill vacant episcopal seats; but it is in comparison to Trollope that Snow's novel most seems to suffer today, despite its fame and undoubted influence since its publication in 1951.When the master of an unnamed Cambridge college becomes fatally ill at the beginning of this novel, the fellows of his college begin to maneuver to ensure the success of their own favorite candidates for the master's position. The novel is mostly an exhaustive description of the jockeying for influence and loyalty undertaken by the two opposing sides, behind Jago on the one side (that shared by our narrator, the central figure in STRANGERS AND BROTHERS, Lewis Eliot) and Crawford on the other. The competition is fought with fierce desperation, but because it's so difficult to tell what sort of vision either man has for the college should he succeed, it's hard to care much about the outcome--and Snow does very little to satirize his participants, as Trollope did to signal his awareness of the pettiness of the battle. Crawford, we are told, is an awful snob; but since when was this new among Oxbridge dons? Although the characters of the fellows are often amusingly drawn (particularly the two eldest among them, Gay and Despard-Smith), they're also not given much depth. The whole thing comes off as a bit arid."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"A novel set in the intimate, closed world of a school or college (or a convent, or cathedral close) has a better-than-average chance of being fascinating to begin with. Whether a school story is a work of literary art such as Snow's The Masters or Antonia White's Frost in May, a decent novel in the vein of Hughes's Tom Brown's School Days, Kipling's Stalky and Co., or Farrar's Eric, or even the kind of boarding-school story churned out by the likes of Angela Brazil and the author of the Greycliff series, school stories tend to hold one's interest because they are school stories. Generally written by one with insider knowledge, such books seem to reveal not only the characteristics of a society in microcosm, but also the particular stresses and strains imposed by intimate, closed worlds.Snow's The Masters is perhaps the supreme example of this genre. A perfectly plotted and self-contained novel filled with unforgettable characters (Mrs. Jago, the embittered Despard-Smith and the beautifully-realized Professor M. H. L. Gay come to mind), The Masters is certainly C.P. Snow's best work. Snow's college world is no ivory tower. Passions and ruthless hatreds surface as two factions clash over the election of a new Master of a Cambridge college. The power brokers Chrystal and Brown display their practiced adroitness as they machinate to put their candidate in office and angle for a major benefaction from a wealthy industrialist. Political overtones from the outside world (the novel is set iduring the period of Hitler's rise to power) begin to agitate the election question further. This is a novel to read again and again."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"The Masters concerns an election of the head of a college in England by the masters (professors) at the school. Snow skillfully illustrates to us the politics of small groups, and how very different those politics are from politics in a broader sense. This book is one of the Strangers and Brothers series, but it reads very nicely as a stand-alone work. The Masters is a good read, in which we follow the partisan manuvering of two factions seeking different candidates in the school election. Snow's style is straightforward, almost a latter-day Trollope, and his ideas are very insightful. This is a classic, which deserves to be more read."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"I'd urge you to read this one. Few people describe the inner life of men, or at least his class of 20th century Englishman, so well as Snow. The characterisations are the strength, all vanities and motivations probed as if by a surgeon, though the &quot;closed&quot; politics plot is entertaining enough. Other reviewers list their favourite characters, I'd plump for Winslow and Brown myself. Beautiful writing style."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"C.P.Snow has some fine qualities; he is succinct, perceptive and astute. This novel, perhaps to a greater extent than any of his others, reflects these qualities as \\"The Masters\\" is a triumph of characterisation. Jago, Brown, Calvert, Nightingale and Gay will live long in the memory and the understated way in which Snow brings them to life is most adroit. Ultimately, however, like all of the Strangers and Brothers sequence, it is a novel about the narrator, Lewis Eliot; the relationship between tale and teller here is particularly impressive. The reader becomes unconsciously embroiled in and fascinated by his life - here is a narrator who is both partial and impartial, intense and detached. The claustrophobic, parochial and insular world of academic life is captured perfectly here. I recommend it highly; for anyone who has read it and enjoyed it, I commend to their attention \\"The Affair\\" by the same author. Set in the same Cambridge college, many of the characters reappear and it is another very fine read."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"Another terrific book , supposedly the best in the series (\\"Strangers and Brothers\\"), but I think that several others are possibly better. And, really, it ends so dismally. Although I guess any other way would be too trite, and I'm quite sure that this is based on some real event in Snow's life, as I feel all the books are. The dons are all so sharply drawn, each clear in his own character. And the eating and drinking they constantly did! I guess they walked a lot. I loved it. The intrigues and politics that Snow writes about, are worthy of any Washington lobbyist. Except that here we are at Cambridge."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"This book came up in discussion since we were talking about the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper and it was mentioned that he may have been a model for one of the characters in the book. I usually consider such suggestions homework and so got the book and read it with great interest. It certainly was an interesting study of men interacting over the nature of their status in a close knit group in an institution with a great sense of tradition regarding the status and promotion of individuals to offices in the college. I found it odd that hardly any description of the Fellows interaction with their students was part of the book though certainly that would have been off the theme. But it left the impression that most time spent is done in meetings and over drinks or meals. Throw in a few walks now and then. There was no discussion regarding their studies except for those of a scientific mind who were working on their experiments, or the individuals love for the subject was viewed as mildly annoying in the case of Professor Gay. All in all it was certainly a worthwhile read and I have done my homework for the week."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"How does an assortment of 13 professors at an English university choose the next head of their college? \\"The Masters\\" examines the personal and university politics that shape this decision through the narrative style of C. P. Snow. This captures a brainy professorial world through heavy reliance on complex and conditional dialogue, acute but unspoken observations, and highly abstract character analysis. Here's an example of his approach: \\"His manner was deliberately prosaic and comfortable. He was showing less outward sign of strain than any of us; when he was frayed inside, he slowed his always measured speech, brought out commonplaces like an amour, reduced all he could to the matter-of-fact.\\" Still, the story, while minutely imagined, doesn't go deep. It's a tempest in a teapot."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"The masters is the best loved of C. P. Snows works and a part of the series of novels that he eventually called 'Strangers and Brothers'. The overall theme of the novel is the behavior of men in a small closed society as they strive for advancement, respect and authority. Charles Snow was a master at portraying and understanding men and women although some critics have found fault on the latter score. The story, as in all of the 'Strangers and Brothers' series, is told by a semi-outsider Lewis Elliot and when I met Snow in 1970 he told me that Elliot was a man that we could all respect. \\"He is 'strangely' above all of our own mortal failings,\\" he joked at the bar of the University of Warwick. If you don't know Snow, please start with 'The Masters'. As a background read, find a copy of the book by his brother Philip Snow. Avoid at all costs the terrible TV serialization of Strangers and Brothers. Incidentally, Snow did slightly edit 'The Masters', for the three-volume composite collection called Strangers and Brothers but nothing of any significance. Note the dedication to G H Hardy, his great colleague at Cambridge."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"I first read the Strangers and Brothers series years ago, and avidly went from one to the next. I vividly remember loving them, the situations, the people, the writing. So, I thought I would read them again, several decades later.I was struck by how very much of a time and place they are, and how the English reticence and manners in the first half of last century shaped the conversations and relationships in the novels.Much is made of a glance, a start, or an averted face.Events unfold in their own pace, and the life and customs living in Cambridge and within a college are detailed and evocative.The Masters is about the succession plans for the leadership in a college when the master is dying, and when he does die, how the decision is made by the fellows. It is decidedly a period piece, but once into it, there is something compelling about the world and the people created by Snow."},{"Title":"The Masters","review":"Lewis Eliot learns from Paul Jago that Vernon Royce, the Master of the college, has inoperable cancer. Roy Calvert is a student of the Master and a beloved friend of the family. It is believed that the Master's daughter Joan is half in love with Calvert. The Master's wife, Lady Muriel, decides to keep the true state of things a secret from the Master. The Master is to be told he has an ulcer and needs rest.Brown orders a bottle of claret to celebrate the achievement of Winslow's son. Young Luke and the other named members of the college discuss the Master's circumstances. Crystal and Brown are both capable of running things. They believe a Master can be found inside the college. It is believed that Crawford and Jago will be considered for the post.It is learned that Nightingale and Pilbrow are back from vacation. The oldest among them, Gay, is subject to a flickering memory. He seems to forget that Royce is the current Master. Nightingale has been frustrated, unlucky, and envy has never left him alone. He is a theoretical chemist. At one time he had promise. Roy Calvert has always found the intimate formality of the college humorous.Lewis says that his choice is Jago. Arthur Brown is for Jago and Chrystal thinks he can manage him. Brown actively dislikes Crawford and has regard for Jago. Brown is a politician by nature. Brown, Eliot, and Chrystal go to see Jago. Mrs. Jago is a sensitive sort who with her temperament drives Jago's friends away from him. It is anticipated that Crawford, Despard, and Winslow will be opposed to having Jago as the Master. Jago is more extravagant than many men and loves display more.Francis Getliffe, a scientist and Lewis's particular friend, says that he is worried about the talk of Jago as Master. Getliffe would rather have someone of the left fill the office and would rather support a scientist. Jago is an English scholar with an interest in the colonial figure William Bradford.Roy Calvert becomes Lady Muriel's mainstay in the nearly year-long process of the death of her husband. Nightingale wants to get a college office out of the change and Jago is disinclined to see such a thing happen. Following a feast held for a potential benefactor of the college, the Master is told the true medical view of his health. He says that it is hard to think without a future.The group supporting Jago loses its clear majority when Nightingale goes over to the other side. The Master lives for a longer time than expected. Winslow's son fails the final examination although the nephew of the expected benefactor gains a third class degree. With Winslow downcast, Roy Calvert, consumed by his own depression, speaks wildly to him.Jago's pride is mountainous. His diffidence is intense. He is vulnerable. He has never used his powers, he has never been able to compete. Pilbrow, after traveling abroad and in view of national and international issues, decides to shift his vote from Jago to Crawford. There seems to be a deadlock.Chrystal suggests a third candidate-- Brown. Chrystal announces he is moving his vote over to Crawford. Perhaps envy and pique and vanity changed the circumstances of voting for Chrystal. Jago is easier with proteges than with friends. He has a proud nature and is unable to unbend.The nuances of character and circumstances are fascinating in this novel. This skeletal summary of the plot is insufficient to demonstrate that the reader comes to care deeply about the outcome of the election described in full by the author."},{"Title":"Disney's Family Storybook Collection: 75 Fables for Living, Loving, and Learning","review":"This is a nice addition to your nursery or reading room.

Lest you quit reading, thinking I'm a newbie, let me just tell you that I do have a California teaching credential, and a Master's degree in Education, and I have taught in a school setting for a few years. But I was frustrated with the regimented, by-the-book education that a school setting is forced to provide due to, well, many factors, and my 2nd-grade son was already hating the workbook approach to learning. This book is the answer. It is very right-brained, tactile-learner focused, and it has a few activities for all subject areas including writing. Ironically, I will once again be teaching by the book, but it will be by this book, which is another thing entirely. I will be supplementing with other curriculum for Readin' Writin' Rithmetickin,' but not much because I feel the activities in this book, along with a geology-related field trip once each week, will foster in my kids a strong desire for learning--they'll WANT to learn, so I won't have to force them to.Honestly, I didn't know much about geology despite taking \\"Earth Science\\" in 9th grade, where I carefully read, detested, and answered textbook questions, but just reading through the activities in this book I suddenly know much more about geology and have had to restrain myself from enthusiastically telling my kids everything I've learned before our school year starts."},{"Title":"Geology Rocks!: 50 Hands-On Activities to Explore the Earth (Kaleidoscope Kids)","review":"This is a wonderful introduction to concepts for your young geologist as well as a great place to find ideas for activities and experiements to aid her in her exploration of the earth!

It left me either grinning or laughing the entire way through it.Emelina Stratton's brother is being blackmailed. In an effort to save him, she turns the tables and does a little spying to try and get some bargaining info on the blackmailer. The darkly handsome Julian Colter (who is a rumored mob boss) agrees to help Emelina in her scheme, but will demand a payment from her when all is said and done. Emelina is nervous about what the payment will be, having no idea Julian intends for the payment to be herself...This book left me in stitches. From Emelina faking an orgasm--and getting caught!--to Emelina's overactive imagination concerning Julian's &quot;occupation&quot;, I couldn't stop grinning. Don't miss this one while it's still in print.(sexual content R = consummation scenes described in lots of detail)"},{"Title":"Devil to Pay (Silhouette Desire, No 187)","review":"Devil to Pay, by Jayne Krentz writing under the Pseudonym of Stephanie James,incorporates many of the touches of the present Krentz' romances but with less developed plot line and characters.The plot evolves around Emelina Stratton, who because of her loyalty to her brother and a very vivid imagination, becomes involved in a blackmail scheme. Her love interest is Julian Colter, the mysterious man about whom the villagers whisper. Having little luck with her plans to uncover something on the blackmailer of her brother, Emmy makes a deal with the devil himself, Julian, and the price she pays is her heart.The mystery is thin but there are some very fine, humorous touches: the telling clue is receipts in the bottom of grocery bags and the way Emmy defends Julian against the town's innuendos is priceless. Readers of Jayne Krentz will recognize some similarities between this early work and Family Man: the dark, strong male protagonist with slightly questionable motives, the woman who's loyalty is a prize worth winning, and the &quot;lethal&quot; dog who nuzzles his way in.Also of interest to Jayne Krentz fans is the fact that Emmy is an author who is trying to interest a publisher in a Science Fiction/Romance genre, which Ms. Krentz has published under her own name and recently under the name Jayne Castle."},{"Title":"Devil to Pay (Silhouette Desire, No 187)","review":"In &quot;The Devil to Pay&quot;, Jayne Ann Krentz clearly shows the foundations of her trademark style. Emmy Stratton and Julian Colter strike sparks from their first meeting (and we have to love Xerxes the dog). Written in the mid '80's, Jayne reaches a point where she allows her heroines to be feisty, opinionated and to take risks - some with the hero - there is much less surrendering here and much more mutual satisfaction. The dialogue is delightfully witty (another soon-to-be-Krentz trademark) and the plot is carefully crafted as always.

If you've read many of her books as I have you'll agree that her writing has matured since her Stephanie James period. There are a few elements in this story that found their way into later novels: the hero with a large dog (Smoke in Mirrors), the hero's obsession with good coffee (Eye of the Beholder), and the hero who fails to tell the heroine who he really is at the beginning of their relationship (Grand Passion; Deep Waters; Obsidian Prey).However, those elements can't save this story, which is too surreal to be believed. Julian becomes obsessed with a stranger in town (Emelina), then stalks her, virtually kidnaps her and comes close to raping her. Oh, yeah, it's supposed to be seduction, except that his sex dialog sounds too much like a horny teenager instead of a 40-year old executive. Feminists would probably consider this novel a \\"bodice ripper,\\" since the plot is so much like that genre. This novel depicts an almost D/s kind of relationship, except without the collar and chains. That Krentz would write a story in which a total stranger highjacks a woman and takes over her life without one word of explanation of who he is seems incredible. And, of course, the heroine is too subject to her own confused emotions and passions to tell Julian to go screw himself. Maybe Emelina was simply a victim of the Stockholm Syndrome and five years into the marriage she's going to wonder what she has done to herself. In my view their beginning does not bode well for a long-lasting happy marriage."},{"Title":"Devil to Pay (Silhouette Desire, No 187)","review":"Writer Emelina Stratton is determined to help her brother who is being blackmailed.

Here are some important notes:1) Theonomy does not \\"stand or fall\\" based on Bahnsen's _50 page_ exegesis of St. Matthew 5:17 ff. While it is integral, the reviewer who stated this below, I would wager, did not read the book. Theonomy is a _framework_ that is developed exegetically and logically from the entire Bible, starting in Genesis and ending in Revelation. Bahnsens' _30 page index_ of Bible passages at the end should have been a clue. There is not one passage in the Bible regarding the law that Bahnsen does not use, I am sure. He brilliantly coheres the Torah with Sts. Paul, James, Peter, and John in a manner that is _consistent with Reformed Orthodoxy_. He is firm that there is _nothing new_ in this book. The church has historically believed the thesis contained here, and he frequently goes as far back as Tertullian and Augustine to show this. I cannot emphasize this more: theonomy is developed from the _entire Bible_.2) This book is big. It reads big. It does not read like a concise, epigrammatic literary masterpiece (like many of Rushdoony's shorter books do). Instead it is meticulous, thorough, repetitive, painstaking--big. You feel like you're reading a masterwork when you're reading it. It feels big in your hands; it feels big in your head. Some people like this; some don't.3) Even so, Bahnsen's language is known for its supreme clarity and cogency. His repetition is welcomed (as far as I am concerned), and his laconic summaries are each highly quotable. It is a joy to read.4) What can bog the reader down is the _insane amount_ of Biblical references, which is obviously a good problem to have. Frequently, Bahnsen will assert something and then parenthetically include upwards of 20+ references. In the preface he asks the reader to check him on it, so do it! You won't regret it! My knowledge of how to interpret the Bible greatly augmented by following his references. His immense encyclopedic knowledge of the Bible can be overwhelming at times, but you'll come out for the better.5) Bahnsen's knowledge of Greek is also a bit overwhelming, as seen in both the 50 page exegesis of Matthew 5 and the amazingly insightful appendix 1, an exegesis of Galatians 3. While he throws around a plethora of Greek vocabulary and grammar, he usually explains it all particularly before plugging it in the interpretation; this allows the reader to still check him on his work by referencing Greek dictionaries, &c.; It must be said though that his painstaking approach to Greek grammar, while enlightening to the core, can bog the reader down at moments (I won't lie).6) Bahnsen presents an existential theory here; don't feel that you won't be edified! This book is uplifting, encouraging, and exhortative.Some random points you will learn about: the Holy Spirit (in the context of the Old Covenant as well); a crash course (over 100 pages) on Biblical political theory; a crash course (30 pages) on anti-theonomic philosophy of many types (for more, see his _Van Til's Apologetic_...that's 800 pages); Dispensationalism; Covenant Theology; Bible interpretation; everything you ever wanted to know about the nature and use of Law (duh); the nature and use of Grace, Faith, and Love; &c.;You owe it to your spiritual life and church vows to read this book! Kierkegaard says to \\"realize yourself before the face of Christ.\\" Bahnsen shows how to do this in some of the most neglected and important ways.It'll humble you, instruct you, and exhort you."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Greg Bahnsen in this work offers the world a comprehensive hermeneutical lens by which all of life is to be viewed -- viz. God's Law.Bahnsen begins with a masterful exegesis of Matthew 5:17-20 and the following reproof of the Pharisees which lays the foundation for his thesis. Bahnsen does such a thorough job of refuting the competing views that, I must say, Mr. Cunningham (the reviewer above) has an impossible task before him (i.e., to refute Bahnsen).Bahnsen cogently presents Theonomy as a foundation to Christian thought which one cannot do without if the Christian community is to be faithful to the Word of God.He proposes that not only is the Christian to bow before the Law of God in all of life, but that ALL MEN in every realm are expected to conform to God's Law. This includes even the civil magistrate, which should rule society according to the eternal bar line of the Law's justice.He furthermore recoils at any Church/State union, but shows that Church and State alike have only one standard: God's Law. Thus, there should be a sort of checks and balances between the two administrations -- the Church holding the State accountable to rule according to the Law, and the State protecting the rights of the Church, while making sure the Church does not exceed its rights in society (e.g., by administering capital punishment, etc.).There has been much misunderstanding and controversy especially over Bahnsen's (and Theonomy's) proposal that the Law's penal sanctions should likewise be administered, which would basically amount to capital punishment for adultery, rape, homosexuality, abortion, and other crimes. Many have seen this as an element of an all too harsh OT ethic. However, if that be the case (that the OT penal sanctions are too harsh), then that would be tantamount to saying 2 very astounding things:(1) God's morality changes(2) God's perfect Law (Ps. 19) is not perfect, since it is not truly just.This is unreasonable and impugns the integrity and righteous character of God. To be faithful to God's Law for society, the civil magistrate must rule according to God's Law in every jot and tittle.I could go on and on recommending Bahnsen's book, but suffice it to say that EVERY Christian should read this book to understand how God's Law should apply to his/her life.A MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"First let me say this: This book reads like a thesis (and as it started out as a thesis for a Master of Theology degree, that makes sense). But what a Biblically substantiated, exegetically sound, and theologically insightful thesis it is - by a truly gifted theologian, teacher, and communicator!It is so very rare that one comes across a book in which after finishing it he can say, \\"This book has truly altered the course of my life.\\" If there is any one book - obviously apart from the Bible itself - of which this can be said by me, it is Greg Bahnsen's \\"Theonomy in Christian Ethics.\\"The theonomic principle as stated by Bahnsen is simply this: \\"By 'theonomy' I will mean that verbalized law of God which is imposed from outside man and revealed authoritatively in the words of Scripture\\" (p. 35). Theonomy is God's Law - over against man's self-law - applied in all areas of life, both in the church and in society.While throughout the history of the church it was taken on assumption that the Old Testament had abiding validity unless something in the New Testament was revealed to have cancelled or changed it in some way, in today's evangelical world just the opposite view seems to be the one most widely held: that unless a commandment is repeated in the New Testament, we should assume it no longer has abiding validity (a view with many more problems than one might think).And so Bahnsen lays out cogently, articulately, and (most importantly) Biblically in 563 pages his thesis that the Old Testament Law is just as much applicable today as it was in the days before Christ, even in the area of the civil magistrate.Bahnsen's main passage of exegesis is with Matthew 5:17-20 where he demonstrates very impressive historical research and exegetical skill in showing that in a more accurate translation of the text into English, Jesus said: \\"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to establish [or confirm] them\\" (v17) - rather than the traditional translation of \\"fulfill them.\\"We're talking 50 pages of exegesis on one passage of Scripture. So if any criticism can be made about this part of the work it's not that Bahnsen wasn't thorough in his research and analysis. As a matter of fact, it is this particular exegesis that Bahsnen sees as his main theological contribution to the topic of theonomy; for he is certainly not the first to hold a theonomic position. Even so, his argument is probably one of the most articulate and compelling.Even apart from this translation though he shows that the entire law according to Jesus has abiding validity. Not just the moral law; not just the judicial law; but the entire law! And what a work of theological scholarship in demonstrating this!Throughout the book there are an abundant amount of examples Bahnsen gives - too many to cite in a review. But suffice it to say that the people of the New Testament clearly understood that there was an abiding validity of the Old Testament - even if some forms of it had been changed or further clarified.As the book progresses, after Bahnsen firmly establishes Christ's own view of the law and its abiding validity, he then turns his attention to one of the most widely held misconceptions of theonomy:(1) Theonomy is a form of legalism.Of course as soon as Bahnsen says that the New Testament speaks of the Law of God as having abiding validity even in the New Testement era, it will surely call for a resounding rebuttal of \\"we are not under law but under grace.\\"And it is very true that we are not under law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). That is surely the case as it pertains to our justification, position in Christ and our ability to keep the law.But as one continues reading this very passage he finds that it is just because Christ offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for our sins, died as our substitution, and rose again for our justification that we are no longer enslaved to our own sinful nature but are free and empowered to keep the law of God. \\"For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification\\" (Rom. 6:19).Just as Paul says \\"For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law\\" (3:28) in seemingly the very same breath he says \\"Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law\\" (3:31).As Bahnsen demonstrates, the law is not sin, and the opposite of the law is not grace. Where law and grace are contrasted is in our ability to keep the law. The law can tell us what God's moral requirements are - but it cannot in the slightest help us meet those requirements. But grace - grace in Christ meeting those requirements once for all on our behalf, and grace in the Spirit by transforming us and meeting those requirements in us in our daily sanctification - grace gives us the power, the ability to keep the law (though because of our remaining sinful nature we will not keep it perfectly this side of glory).So as a power for enabling believers to keep God's moral standards, grace can be, and should be, pitted against law (Rom. 7-8). But regarding moral standards themselves, regarding \\"law\\" - law's opposite is not grace, but sin, i.e. \\"lawlessness\\" (1 Jn. 3:4).Theonomy understands this distinction and all the more to a better understanding of the gospel and conversely the gospel's distortion in true legalism. In fact it's precisely because theonomic doctrine holds such a high view of God's law that it is all the more drastically against pharisaical legalism. If one ever endeavors to keep God's law (not one's own law, but God's true law) on his own terms, in his own strength, he will ultimately come to terms as Paul did, that he cannot do it (Rom. 7:18-19) - that he has to be delivered by Christ and enabled by Him to live a life that is pleasing to Him (Rom. 7:22-8:11).So it turns out that theonomy is anything but legalistic. The higher regard a system of doctrine has for God's law, the quicker and more severely it will drive the sinner to repentance and to the grace of Christ for salvation and sanctification. So as theonomy by its mere nature holds such a high view of God's law, it theologically leads always to the freeing, wonderful gospel - over against self-made legalism.And so answering that misconception, Bahnsen then takes the next two sections of his book to show the internal integrity of God's law as well as Christ's obedience to the Law - that very particular qualification which secures the believers' atonement. He demonstrates the fact that the Spirit now directs the believer's life by turning his heart to follow God's law. And finally, he shows at what point the New Testament does change a certain aspect of the Old Testament law - and that aspect only - which culminates in his chapter showing that God's law in itself is never opposed to or pitted against but always held in conjunction with grace, faith, and love.And so what has changed from Old Testament to New Testament in regards to the Law? Bahnsen shows that in every instance it is clear that the one aspect of the law that has a new form is the ceremonial, or restorative law of God. In a sense even the restorative validity is still abiding. God still demands sanctification from the world and penal substitutional sacrifice for sins. But the New Testament is so absolutely clear that there has been a significant change in its form. In Galatians and Colossians the ceremonial (or restorative) laws are referred to as elementary principles: \\"You observe days and months and seasons and years!\\" (Gal. 4:10); \\"Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath \\" (Col. 2:16). Paul says \\"these are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ\\" (Col. 2:17).Similarly the author of Hebrews speaking specifically of the ceremonial/restorative worship rites in the temple said: \\"They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. ... But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises\\" (Heb. 8:5, 6).And what is this better covenant? It's the perpetual forgiveness of sins because of the finality of Christ's sacrifice; and the ability for believers now - in the power of the Spirit - to be able to keep God's law. \\"For this is the covenant that I will make...I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts....and I will remember their sins no more\\" (Heb. 8:10, 12).Certainly a review cannot summarize all that was said in this 563 page work. But the premise is that it is the ceremonial (or restorative) law only that has changed in its form - as it was promised even before the Babylonian captivity (Jer. 31). And that the covenant community of the New Testament clearly saw the rest of the law as having the same form with abiding validity (Eph. 6:1-3; Mk. 7:10-11, 10:19; 1 Tim. 5:18; 2 Tim. 3:16; 1 Pet. 3:8-12).And so now for the most controversial part of theonomy, Bahnsen then turns his attention to how God's law applies to the state.He shows that God has charged the civil magistrate with upholding His justice (this can be seen even in the New Testament - Rom. 13). But how does the civil magistrate know the socio-political demands of God's justice? Well they've been clearly revealed in the Scriptures - in the abiding validity of the Older Testament cannon.Therefore, it is the duty of the magistrate to rule according to Christ's will (Ps. 2). Does that mean there are certain crimes today that according to our society need not be punished at all, but according to God's own Word are so heinous that they're deserving of capital punishment (because not only are they sins against God - a matter for the church to deal with; but they are also crimes against the justice and righteousness of a nation - a matter for the state to deal with)? It surely does. And so it is here that the other most widely held misconception of theonomy arises:(2) Theonomy fails to see a distinction between (or separation of) church and state.Nevermind the fact that Bahnsen has an entire chapter in his section, \\"Application of [Theonomy] to the State\\" arguing for the Biblical standard for the title of the chapter: \\"Separation of Church and State.\\" For some reason it is still thought by many that theonomy fails to see a distinction between the two (see. Wayne Grudem, \\"Politics According to the Bible,\\" 66). But this is completely false.As one reads throughout Bahnsen's work and especially in his chapter on the separation of church and state, it becomes clear that it's precisely because the theonomic principle is rooted in Scripture as the only infallible Word on anything about which it speaks that one can legitimately defend a Biblical reason for the separation of church and state.What one finds in Bahnsen's work is that theonomic doctrine has a very positive (and Biblically defensible) position guarding both a clear distinction in character as well as a clear separation of power between church and state - more so than any other pluralistic system of politics can ever hope to defend. But what differentiates theonomic doctrine is that rather than coming to the text first with a preconceived notion that \\"separation of church and state is supreme\\" and therefore supersedes what we might find in Scripture, theonomy as a system holds a very strong conviction of the separation of church and state because of the fact that it derives this viewpoint from Scripture itself. And that is why the theonomic conviction of separation of church and state is so strong.Yet, as Bahnsen lays the theonomic doctrine out, this does not mean that the church is bound to Christ and the state is bound to some other authority (or even no authority at all). They each have their own boundaries and duties, but they both are accountable to Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; Ps 2). As Paul says in Romans \\"Never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, \`Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord,'\\" he then goes right along to say how God does carry out that vengeance and wrath. And it's through the civil magistrate: \\"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God...For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.\\" (Rom. 12:19, 13:1,4).So in theonomic doctrine the church does not have the right to wield the sword, but the state does - and that right has been given to it by God. Similarly the state does not have the authority to administer the sacraments, but the church does. But both church and state, while acting in different roles and having separate responsibilities - both are held accountable to the same authority - Christ who has said with finality: \\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me\\" (Mt. 28:18, cf. Ps. 2). He is not just Head of the Church, but King of kings and Lord of lords. And while He rules in the lives of believers by means of writing His laws in their hearts, He still rules the nations by means of giving the magistrate the sword as the avenging agent in carrying out His wrath against the societal wrongdoer.So if the civil magistrate - even in the New Testament - is charged with being God's agent for civil order, carrying out God's wrath against the wrongdoer and promoting righteousness in the society; if this is the case, how is the civil magistrate to know what measure of the sword to use in avenging the wrongdoer? What standard is the magistrate to use in determining what is a just retribution in judging and what is a righteous law in governing a society? Well, the answer is that God has already clearly revealed his righteous laws and just retributions - they're in the Old Testament cannon:\\"And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today?\\" (Deut. 4:8). This very law in which, \\"Every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution\\" (Heb. 2:2)There is so much more to this thesis in showing Biblically how this works out and answering all the anticipated objections that such a superficial review cannot do it justice. But let me simply be clear that Bahnsen, from Scripture, does answer those objections. A review is just not the place to do it.And allow me to be completely honest. It is not easy to reach this conclusion on an emotional or psychological level. Our culture has simply gotten the best of us when it comes to this arena. But in reading this work, in studying the Scriptures to see if these things are so, it is very, very difficult to argue with such compelling arguments that Bahnsen presents in this work.But now allow me to be even clearer so as not to give more misrepresentation to the theonomic outlook. Theonomic doctrine is not concerned with getting Christians into the civil magistrate and then by way of misguided tyranny forcing \\"Christian Law\\" on all of society. That is not the way. Just as in the Old Testament a very strong case can be made for separation of church and state - so also can a democratic form of government (remember David was not only appointed by God to be king, but he was also given consent from the governed to be their King - 2 Sam. 2:7, 5:1-3).In reality, Theonomy is nothing more than a clear mission of the church to obey the Great Commission to \\"make disciples of all nations...teaching them to observe all that [Christ] has commanded [us]\\" (Matt. 28:19-20). The \\"all\\" is inclusive of the entirety of the Old Testament, which Christ taught his disciples to observe - including the societal laws and penal sanctions as far as we can. Those are the disciples that we as the church are commanded to make: disciples who will observe all of God's commandments - not through their own power, but the through the justifying and sanctifying power of Christ and the Holy Spirit - but all of God's commandments nonetheless. \\"If you love me, you will keep my commandments\\" (Jn. 14:15). This very statement is a very powerful promise of what Christ in a believer can do as well as a mark of a true disciple, which He Himself has regenerated unto life.Theonomy is not a militant doctrine. At the end of the day it is revival that is at the heart of theonomy. Just as Jesus promised to be with His church until the very end (Mt. 28:20), and the gates of hell shall not prevail against her (Mt. 16:18) - so the mission is to make disciples (not by way of sword but by way of evangelism) of all nations who will love Christ and observe all that He commands. It is in God working in us to accomplish this mission that we will have just societies who will willingly place in their leadership just leaders who will rule according to God's just laws.If the thesis is correct, if continuity should be assumed and if making disciples of all nations, teaching them to obey all that Christ has commanded is the mission of the church, then how can massive revival in the nations with the aim of Biblical Law for the society not be the conclusion?I wish every Christian pastor and educated layman would put forth the time into reading this work (as tough as it might be) and applying its principles to his life. For what more is theonomic doctrine than theology applied - to all areas of life? As for my assessment, I submit it is just that!"},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"This book is widely considered among Theonomic scholars to be one of the foundational works of their school of thought, and it is easy to see why. Greg Bahnsen, in this work, manages to skillfully defend the eternal validity of the law of God in a systematic and rigorous way. First, Bahnsen opens with an introduction of the Theonomic thesis that God's standard of righteousness at all times and for all people is His law in its entirety, and then exhaustively giving the exegetical case for this from Matthew 5:17-19. After this, Bahnsen moves on to tackle one form of antinomianism, Pharisaism, showing how the law is unable to justify and empower us, because the purpose of the law is to show how we fall short of the unchanging and eternal standards of God, rather than to justify our actions before our Creator. Then Bahensen takes a bold stance and shows how the Theonomic thesis is integral to true Christianity, showing the integrity of the law (defending it from the attacks of antinomians), shows Jesus Christ's obedience to the law and the necessary continuity of the law because it alone demonstrates our need for atonement, shows how he sanctification of the Holy Spirit allows us to be obedient to God's law, and then shows how the covenants of God are united together, rather than being hostile to others as Dispensationalism assumes. After this, Bahnsen answers three supposed conflicts to the Theonomic view, showing how the Ceremonial law remains valid typologically, pointing to the actions of Jesus Christ, rather than being abrogated, explains the supposed negative passages in the Bible towards the law as condemning the wrong use of the law or the use of human tradition (see the Talmud) as law, and explaining the relationship of Theonomy with grace, faith, and love, showing how true obedience to God's law is not only not contradictory, but is directly and positively related to these three cardinal virtues. Bahnsen then touches on the NT confirmation of Theonomy and gives the functions of God's law, and then shows the antithetical values of autonomy (humanism) and latent antinomianism (where people pick and choose which laws of God they wish to obey), before turning to perhaps the boldest and most extensive part of his thesis, which is showing how God's laws are applicable to the state--in Israel, in the nations around Israel in the OT, and in the NT, as well as showing the Bible's extensive support of the separation of church and state and the implications of God's laws on penology (which is perhaps one of the more controversial elements of Theonomy). To close the book, Bahnsen attacks indifference to obedience to God, shows the blessedness of the law in the Bible, and then closes with some intriguing appendices: an exegetical study of Galatians 3:15-18, showing the roles of the civil government according to the Westminster Confession of Faith, discussing and providing Cotton's \\"Abstract of the Laws of New England,\\" a Thenomic political work from the Puritans of New England in the 1600's, and then a critique of the exegetical methods of one M.G. Kline concerning the covenants of the Bible. The book as a whole is a powerhouse, one of the most powerful works one can find in its scope and thoroughness demolishing all claims one could have on biblical grounds to refuse to obey God's laws in their entirety, and also shows the characteristic Theonomic concern for the implications of God's laws on outside society. For those wishing to read a scholarly and yet passionate defense of God's laws, this book is highly recommended, and will serve an honored place in my collection of these works for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"This book coupled with R.J.

It is vital to Christian progress."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Bahnsen, who passed away over a decade ago, is a name that draws out the best and worse in people. And, in many ways, it is because of this book. Bahnsen wrote this book in the 70's and it created a firestorm in Reformed circles. Almost immediately debates about \\"theonomy\\" started to run rampant in Reformed and Presbyterian circles. Some started denouncing Bahnsen and Bahnsen's supporters started shouting back. Fortunately, enough time has passed that the issue can be discussed reasonable, although the discussion often produces more heat than love. This is unfortunate, because it is an important issue to discuss, especially given Francis Schaeffer's influence on the American Church during the second half of the 20th century and Christians have begun to \\"engage culture\\". Yet, for many, like me, I am left asking, \\"O.k, we are to engage culture, but with what?\\" Bahnsen, I believe, provides the answer. We are to engage culture with the complete revelation, \\"Old\\" and New Testament, from God.Bahnsen basicaly argues (from Mt 5.17+) that Christians are to observe every jot and tittle of God's word until there is a clear revelation to the contrary. This includes the fact that the civil magistrates should observe the Mosaic judicial laws for civil society. If God has spoken about these issues, should we not seek to apply His Word to these areas? If he has not spoken, then can we really say, \\"We are to engage culture?\\" If we are, then I believe God is responsible to equip us. As is, he has equipped us and Bahnsen has helped that cause.I highly recommend reading this book because it will do several things. One, make you read the Old Testament in a much better light. Two, Bahnsen will shed some light on various passages like Jesus' teaching on divorce. Three, it will give a primer on ethics. Four, it will allow you to understand theonomy from the source. All of these things are good and profitable. Even if you end up disagreeing, at least you will be educated."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Greg L.

He repudiated the Pharisees, not the law. Hence it is totally unwarranted to maintain that Christ expressly abrogated the law's penal sanction against adultery.\\" (Pg. 110) He asserts, \\"The fact that adultery is contained in the larger class of crimes, fornication, does not imply even remotely that Christ abrogated the penal sanction against adultery.\\" (Pg. 112)He insists, \\"Theonomy must be CENTRAL in Christian ethics... we do not demand autonomous justification for God's commandments... Theonomy, and theonomy alone, must be the standard for Christian ethics. The sole Law-giver and Judge is God.\\" (Pg. 305) He argues, \\"Those who propose the abolition of the death penalty ... should also carry out the logic of their position: if the gravest punishment (death) is abolished, HOW MUCH MORE the lesser penalties! The result would have to be NO punishments at all. Thus, the magistrate could no more impose a traffic fine upon someone for speeding than he could execute someone for murder!\\" (Pg. 447)He concludes, \\"While many specific questions need to be answered in particular situations, the basic or fundamental principle of social morality and state responsibility has been answered... Our categorical assumption must be that of continuity with Older Testament morality.\\" (Pg. 470-471)Obviously a highly controversial book, it is also a very IMPORTANT one, and is \\"must reading\\" by persons on all sides of this debate."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"If Bahnsen's discussion of the Greek term for &quot;fulfil&quot; in Matthew 5 is really the weakest part of the book, then we have before us an outstanding work of ethics and exegesis.

He is currently working on a full exegetical review of Bahnsen's view of Matthew 5:17-20.)Theonomy derives from two Greek words meaning God and law respectively. Greg Bahnsen's version of Christian ethics stands or falls on whether his understanding of Matthew 5:17-20, given in the chapter \\"The Abiding Validity of the Law in Exhaustive Detail\\" is correct. While Bahnsen presents his thesis in a way that at first glance looks highly convincing, it has been demonstrated that he is incorrect at so many points that his thesis cannot stand.Unfortunately Bahnsen's mistakes are not immediately obvious to those of us who are unfamilliar with Greek grammar and word meanings. An additional problem is that many of the folks who do know Greek have made their counterarguments to Bahnsen's position in theological journals or unpublished academic papers such as Masters theses which layfolk do not normally run across. One key work, however, is still available to the general public and those considering buying \\"Theonomy\\" owe it to themselves to buy and read Vern S. Poythress' book \\"The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses\\" before accepting Bahnsen's thesis.To give but one example of what is involved, Bahnsen claims that the Greek word our Bibles normally translate \\"fulfill\\" in Matt. 5:17 should instead be translated \\"confirm\\"-a meaning for the word not found in classical Greek and not generally accepted as valid for New Testament Greek. Poythress in his chapter \\"The meaning of plaroo\\" reviews the evidence for Bahnsen's suggestion and, while not deploying the strongest arguments against it, deploys enough to conclude that Bahnsen's suggested translation must be rejected.(Lest any believe the oft made but incorrect claim that Bahnsen refuted Poythress' arguments on this point in his later book \\"No Other Standard,\\" the truth is that Bahnsen refuted none of the arguments: he didn't even discuss them in any detail. Instead he attempted to dismiss them as \\"quibbles,\\" which, as anyone familliar with Poythress' arguments knows, is simply untrue. Similarly, Bahnsen's counterclaim that the main lexicon for New Testament Greek accepts \\"confirm\\" as a valid translation of the word in question overlooks the fact that the mention of \\"confirm\\" occurs within bracets - a convention which the authors of that lexicon use to reference a meaning about which there is ongoing debate, but which they themselves do not accept as valid.)If Theonomy is Biblical teaching, it will need better Scriptural support than Bahnsen deploys to prove it."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"This represents probably the best defense of theonomy in print [sic]. If you desire to understand this position, then somehow find this book."},{"Title":"Theonomy in Christian ethics","review":"Bahnsen says &quot;it is the point of slightness that Jesus bring forcefully before us, not even the very least extensive number of the very least significant aspect of the old testament law will become invalid until heaven and earth pass away, it is hard to imagine how Jesus could have more intensely affirmed that every bit of the old law remains binding in the gospel age.&quot; The main verse used by theonomists is Matthew 5:17-18 where Jesus says, &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18&quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.&quot; The problem for Bahnsen and the partial preterist (and futurists) is that the &quot;heaven and earth&quot; of 2 Peter 3 passed away in 70AD (which many partial preterists agree with, see Isaiah 51:15-16). In this book he lists the 5 rules of theonomy.1) The Christian is morally obligated to observed every jot and tittle of the Old Testament law, to disobey any point is to validate the whole law. (He cites James 2:10 which reads &quot;For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.&quot;)2) There's a system or set or ceremonial laws.3) The observation of this system of redemptive ceremonies was intended to be superceded, it was a foreshadow of Christ's saving economy and has become obsolete with His historical work.4) The continued observation of this system of shadows is to miss the true importance; it is opposed to Christian faith and evidences condemning bondage. (which means no more sacrifices are to be made)5) In order to walk righteously before our God, we must identify and distinguish between ceremonial observances from moral observances.Another theonomist writes, &quot;We must observe all the ethical and moral principals of the old testament law.&quot; I agree with that and I know you do too. God has given us a conscience to know that lying, adultery, stealing, etc. is wrong.&quot; But the problem is that the theonomist goes farther then that. Bahnsen says that &quot;every bit of the old law remains binding in the gospel age&quot;, that includes the jots and tittles. Bahnsen writes on page 73 and 74 that &quot;jot and tittle are not broad, vague principals&quot;. He is right. Jots and tittles are every tiny Pharisaical, legalist detail! If theonomy is true then the entire Christian church has been disobeying God's law for almost 2000 years! It means that the Old Testament ceremony laws, dietary laws, etc. are still in effect! This is absurd! The way Bahnsen gets away with this is that he cites but doesn't quote Hebrews 8:13 in this book.Hebrews 8:13 says &quot;In that He says, &quot;A new covenant,&quot; He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.&quot;But Bahnsen writes on page 194 from Theonomy in Christian Ethics &quot;Hebrew 8:13 says that the old age is past but the age of the Son is here to stay (Heb 8:13).&quot;That is a true statement now and anytime after the Old Covenant passed away, which was in 70AD. But this is not what the verse says. The verse says it was passing away. On page 209 Bahnsen writes, &quot;the Old Covenant has disappeared (Heb 8:13)&quot; This is now true after 70AD but when the verse was written, which was before 70AD, it says it was disappearing. It hadn't disappeared yet. I'm sure this whole false view about the law has caused many Christian Reconstructionists to doubt their salvation.God's only current law in the Christian age is the &quot;law of the Spirit of life&quot; and the &quot;ministry of the Spirit&quot;. (Romans 8:2, 2 Cor 3:8)."},{"Title":"A Woman Called Fancy","review":"I first began reading this book while visiting a relative over 25 years ago. The visit ended before I could finish the book, and then the relative got rid of the book during a move. Every so often over the years I would search for the book (partially because I wanted to know how it ended, and partially because the memory of reading the book as a child was a particularly poignant one) but to no avail, until I finally found it on Amazon last year. To be honest, the book was not quite as riveting as my imagination had built it up to be over so many years, but it was a solid read, with interesting characters, a strong sense of time and place, and a satisfying ending. It now has a place on my bookshelf, for me -- and for others, to enjoy."},{"Title":"A Woman Called Fancy","review":"As you can read here already, the setting is the South in the 1880's. Fancy is an unusual Yerby character in that she's actually interesting and worthwhile. (Yerby usually can't write a decent female protagonist to save his life.) While struggling to make a better life, even if that means bellydancing for backwoods men, Fancy stays true to herself, despite all the talk and rumors from people who don't really know her. She's strong yet tender, resilient and willing to learn from her mistakes. You truly want to root for her, except for one thing. Her inexplicable love and devotion to Court Brantley. Court does NOTHING right. He cheapens her, ridicules her, shames her, doubts her, cheats on her, lies to her, abuses her and abandons her. You just want to reach into the book and shake Fancy while yelling, \\"Cut him loose and let him sink on his own!\\" Alas, like too many women in real life, Fancy just keeps taking him back, hoping that one day he'll change. He won't. They're called 'loser' for a reason, honey."},{"Title":"A Woman Called Fancy","review":"This is a great love story. Read it years ago.

There is no political correctness in Parkman and he describes savages, French, frontiersmen and Mormons exactly as they were without apology.This work is a masterpiece everyone should read and be a guidebook to modern historians who spend more time working a political end and getting in the way of history rather than letting history tell it's truthful tale.Parkman is not just the historian or recorder of events. He is the bard of Sioux myth, the geologist, biologist and countless other things describing flora, fauna and weather. He is complete in having that air of Boston social elite in beginning his journey and returning from the plains an American having tasted, smelled and breathed the savage world and revealed the eastern thoughts on how that world would evolve for the next 60 years.Parkman is remarkable and the best compliment for this book is to recommend that readers search for other Parkman histories to read as they are real.I am currently in his wonderful Montecalm and Wolfe series on the history of Canada which actually created America. If you have children, share Parkman's history with them as he will make it come alive for them.As you can see by all of the lengthy reviews, Francis Parkman invokes a great deal of thought and emotion in his histories which transfers to the reader."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"Parkman was little more than a youth when he set out with a group of fellow greenhorns to tackle the Wild West. The West really was wild in the 1840's and this book gives us a rare glance at what it was really like. Parkman and his companions meet Indians, settlers, mountain men and wild animals and somehow avoid disaster and death. Long considered a classic of western exploration it is also a saga of youth and freedom."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"Parkman is one of my favorite authors, and the only thing I can add to what others have said in reviews before mine is that this is NOT a history told from the point of view of an emigrant - in fact, he views them (and nearly everyone else) with the disdain that only a Bostonian can render. So, although incredibly entertaining and informative, he does not travel the Oregon trail in the traditional sense but wanders far and wide from it, and does not cross the Rockies; so anyone looking for a narrative history of what it was like to travel the full length of the Trail might be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"Francis Parkman lived from 1823 to 1893. The Oregon Trail, an account of his travels in 1846, was his first published book. Parkman's journey would have been much easier to follow if the book had a map tracing his route.My reading edition of The Oregon Trail is that in The Library of America volume [53] containing both The Oregon Trail and Parkman's The Conspiracy of Pontiac; but since I haven't yet read the book on Pontiac, I'm placing my review under the present volume. The Library of America edition of The Oregon Trail (TLA.OT) is of Parkman's 1849 first edition published by George P. Putnam, with a correction of the title, restoring it to Parkman's intention. The book was revised and reprinted several times, the last edition, illustrated by Frederick Remington, in 1892.The year 1846 is also the year of the Donner Party's attempt to reach California. In chapter 10 of the Oregon Trail, Parkman mentions them, although not by name. He has stopped at a place he calls Richard's trading-house (TLA.OT: 118) near Fort Laramie. A group of emigrants on their way to California are there, and Parkman is introduced to a Colonel R----- who is the emigrants' erstwhile leader.\\"Fearful was the fate that months after overtook some of the members of that party. General Kearny, on his late return from California, brought in the account how they were interrupted by the deep snows among the mountains, and maddened by cold and hunger, fed upon each other's flesh!\\" (TLA.OT:121)If Parkman actually talked with or recalled the face of anyone from the Donner Party, he doesn't mention it, and the above quotation is all he says of them. The Colonel R------ is William Henry Russell (1802-1873). The Donner Party was, in fact, part of the Russell Party before going off on its own via the Hastings Cut-Off after crossing the Continental Divide through the South Pass. At the time Parkman is speaking with him, Russell has been deposed as leader, but the Donner Party has not yet split off. \\"His men, he [Russell] said, had mutinied and deposed him; but still he exercised over them the influence of a superior mind; in all but the name he was yet their chief.\\" (TLA.OT:121) Lilburn Boggs eventually took over leadership of the Russell Party (see, for example, Ethan Rarick's Deparate Passage: The Donner Party's Perilous Journey West, page 51), but Parkman does not mention Boggs. This narrative of Parkman's experiences on the Oregon Trail can then be read as concurrent (up to a time) with the tragic experiences of the Donner Party.California emigrants took the Oregon Trail until after crossing the Continental Divide through the South Pass, and so spent part of their journey with emigrants to Oregon; but Parkman was not on the Oregon Trail as an emigrant at all. In fact, he doesn't appear to have even reached the Continental Divide. The book has no map of his travels, and he's not always clear, but he seems to have gotten only as far on the Oregon Trail as Fort Laramie. While there he learns of an upcoming gathering of \\"Dahcotah\\" Indians, waging war against the Snake Indians. An \\"Ogillallah\\" chief, called the Whirlwind, has lost a son in battle, and he is determined to \\"chastise the Snakes\\". Parkman learns that the gathering will take place \\"at 'La Bonte's Camp,' on the Platte. Here their warlike rites were to be celebrated with more than ordinary solemnity, and a thousand warriors, as it was said, were to set out for the enemy's country.\\" (TLA.OT: 110-11) Parkman is overjoyed.\\"I was greatly rejoiced to hear of it. I had come into the country almost exclusively with a view of observing the Indian character. Having from childhood felt a curiosity on this subject, and having failed completely to gratify it by reading, I resolved to have recourse to observation. I wished to satisfy myself with regard to the position of the Indians among the races of men; the vices and the virtues that have sprung from their innate character and from their modes of life, their government, their superstitions, and their domestic situation. To accomplish my purpose it was necessary to live in the midst of them, and become, as it were, one of them. I proposed to join a village, and make myself an inmate of one of their lodges; and henceforward this narrative, so far as I am concerned, will be chiefly a record of the progress of this design, apparently so easy of accomplishment, and the unexpected impediments that opposed it.\\" (TLA.OT:111)So Parkman resolves to be at 'La Bonte's Camp' for the upcoming Dahcotah rendezvous. Several chapters cover his journey there and his adventures with the Dahcotah, including a buffalo hunt and time spent in the Black Hills. He and his companions eventually return to Fort Laramie and from there head south, down to Bent's Fort on the Santa Fe Trail. They hunt buffalo along the Arkansas river, and journey east towards Fort Leavenworth and civilization, essentially completing their circuit.\\"We had met with signal good fortune. Although for five months we had been traveling with an insufficient force through a country where were were at any moment liable to depredation, not a single animal had been stolen from us. And our only loss had been one old mule bitten to death by a rattlesnake. Three weeks after we reached the frontier [by which he means the western edge of the United States as it stood in the midst of the Mexican War of 1846], the Pawnees and the Camanches [sic] began a regular series of hostilities on the Arkansas trail, killing men and driving off horses. They attacked, without exception, every party, large or small, that passed during the next six months.\\" (TLA.OT: 337)"},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"The Oregon Trail by Francis Parkman is an account which further enforces the history of the Oregon Trail we had learned about in [U.S. History] class. The book portrays what it must have been like to travel on the Trail, never knowing what the next day would bring. The buffalo hunting which took place throughout the book became monotonous and boring after the first exciting few, but other than that repetitiveness, the journey was well depicted. I especially enjoyed Parkman's in-depth descriptions given to the reader of the people he meets on his journey and his observations on their actions as well. His vivid imagery of scenes from nature such as animals, prairie landscapes, and the weather, place the reader right next to Parkman in his adventuresome expedition. There are some dull, repetitive points in the observations made by the author, but aside from that his autobiographical telling of his journey is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"Before his death in the early 1890's, Francis Parkman would be hailed by many as North America's greatest historian. One of his first major works, The Oregon Trail, illustrates why. Written in 1847, the book chronicles an extensive journey undertaken by the youthful Parkman and his loyal friend Quincy Shaw the previous spring and summer. Parkman's express purpose was to see the \\"real\\" American West and live among \\"real\\" American Indians before their way of life passed forever. A vigorous young man, possessed of a keen intellect and observant eye, and already blessed with a rare and masterful prose style, Parkman chronicles his journey from St. Louis into the heart of the largely \\"unknown\\" American Plains. Peopled then by only a few white traders, trappers and ruffians slowly pushing their way into the domain of the Pawnee, Comanche, Arapaho, Dakota, \\"Shienne\\", Snakes and Crows, the West was a truly wild and dangerous place - and Parkman revels in it, providing meticulous descriptions of the landscape, people, and struggle for life and lifeways that would soon be no more.Along the way Parkman introduces you to the men of Fort Laramie (established and maintained by traders long before soldiers came to the territory), lives amongst a Dakota band, hunts buffalo, weathers awe-inspiring Plains' thunderstorms and periods of drought, explores the Black Hills, the Rocky Mountains, and New Mexico. His journey takes him up the Missouri River, the Platte, the Arkansas and more. And far more than describe fascinating places and events, Parkman charms with full renderings of the characters he meets along the way: redoubtable hunter and guide Henry Chatillion, muleteer and cook Delorier, the dolorous Raymond and Reynal, jester Tete Rouge, hundreds of loathesome \\"pioneers\\", Indians Mene-Seela, Smoke, Whirlwind, Hail Storm, Big Crow and more. All characters worthy of Mark Twain. We are also made witness to Parkman and Shaw's slow transformation from adventurous young Bostonian scholars to worthy \\"plainsmen\\".Even before finishing his college studies, Parkman declared that his ambition was to chronicle the \\"struggle for the continent\\". He achieved his goal in glorious measure. Parkman's works on the founding of \\"New France\\", LaSalle's explorations, the French/Indian Wars, Pontiac's conspiracy, Montcalm and Wolfe, etc., remain standards today, rich source material for authors from DeVoto to Eckert.His brilliance lies in the fact that Parkman was no \\"arm chair\\" historian. His research was not limited to books and papers found in libraries from Boston to London and Paris. He personally visited nearly every town, battlefield, and waterway he wrote about. Parkman was also deeply committed to understanding the effects of the English/French/American struggles for the continent on the hundreds of North American tribes that were caught in the middle. To wit, the \\"Oregon Trail\\" trip to the Plains of the 1840s was designed to assist the historian's mind in understanding what was lost by eastern tribes decimated during the wars and land-lust of the preceding century. Even then Parkman foresaw a similar misfortune for western tribes: loss of free roaming on their ancestral lands; extinction of the buffalo; the ravaging effects of disease, whiskey and other evils of white contact. But Parkman was no romantic. He refers to the various tribes and some individuals (both white and red) as \\"savages\\", revealing a touch of his mid-1800s Bostonian elitism, yet by no means can Parkman be considered a closed-minded misanthrope. His life's work, starting with The Oregon Trail, reveals far too much sensitivity and fairness of thought for that label to stick. Read this, then dive into Parkman's later work on the history of Canada and early America. It is astonishingly good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of Parkman's historical works concerning the French and Indian Wars. I did not find \\"The Oregon Trail\\" to be nearly so engaging as his other books. Obviously, the book is a valuable first-person account of the great plains during the mid-1840s. Most especially Parkman's observations of the Indians among whom he spent a good deal of time. That being said, I found the account to be somewhat tedious and redundant and would only recommend it to someone with a particular interest in the plains Indians or the westward expansion of that period.

It was \\"breaking away\\", \\"a testing of self\\", \\"seeing the world\\", \\"the search for the other\\" or maybe just drugs and a hippie vibe. In 1846, a Harvard graduate certainly didn't have such an option, but still he could choose not to travel across to Europe for the usual Grand Tour. The 20th century European travelers in Asia viewed the various peoples they met with a mix of incomprehension, awe, prejudice, and myth. Parkman's account of a journey to the high plains of America reminded me of the latter day tales immensely, though in his day, \\"cultural relativity\\" had not been thought of. At 23, just out of Harvard, he and another Boston friend headed for the West, then just being opened up (or invaded) by overland pioneers, Mormons, trappers, buffalo hunters, and soldiers. Parkman and Co. travelled through Kansas, Nebraska, and into parts of South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado. He met many Indians, spending a couple months with an Oglala Dakota band. Totally ignorant of their language and assuming innate understanding on his own part, he drew a rather biased portrait. Yet such is the skill of his writing and his feel for drama, that any reader will still, over 160 years later, find this book hard to put down. His descriptions of the land, the storms, the vast herds of bison, the rugged but raggedy trappers and mountain men, and the look and behavior of the Indians is as vivid as a book of photographs. Parkman has left us an invaluable document whatever its shortcomings. He provides us with a rare look at an America now completely disappeared. After all, \\"Overland to India\\" occurred in the Age of Photography, but Parkman had no camera. To have written this book despite being in bad health for most of the trip is indeed an achievement. It's an American classic well-deserving of the name, despite its jaundiced treatment of the so-called savages, who hosted him, helped him, and never hurt him. That bias too is part of the same history."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"I ordered this book based on the film, \\" The Oregan Trail,\\" which I enjoyed watching. The book is a good follow-up to the movie, making much of the content even more real for me."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"Parkman's travelogue on the Great Plains is a major work of life among the Native Americans. His descriptions are honest and capture a society that was fading even while he was writing. The book had a major impact on the way that non-westerners saw the Great Plains. This was both good and bad. Parkman wrote through the lens of a Boston aristocrat and was full of prejudices against those who did not meet his standards. This was dangerous in that many who read about the \\"backwardness\\" of the Native Americans used this as justification for \\"civilizing\\" them. Although this was probably not Parkman's intention, it was a consequence of his writing. In addition, he promoted the hunting of buffalo for sport, which led to the decimation of the buffalo heards on the Plains.Another major issue with this book is that, in spite of its title, it is not about the Oregon Trail. Parkman went no further than the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains and he did all in his power to dissociate himself from the pioneers moving along the Oregon Trail. If you are looking for a history of the trail, this book will not satisfy your needs.However, in spite of the misleading title and the prejudices that surface throughout the book, it is still a fine piece of writing that opens up a world that has been lost to today's readers. Read it and enjoy your travels into another time and place."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"The Oregon Trail is an undeniable classic -- although overrated compared to other books written about the same time about the same subject. Parkman is a priggish, Boston snob who complains his way across the West.

It is amazing how little the landscape has changed between the 1840s and today, especially Western Nebraska.Francis was a lucky man to survive the journey; however, he gave no indication that he was fortunate. The follies and close calls were just a day in the life of an Oregon Trail traveler.His time spent with the Dakota Indians was most intriguing. At times Francis would show respect for the Indians while his opinion of their lifestyle and culture was one of disrespect and crudeness.The book does get bogged down in the latter half with the wasteful killing of buffalo and almost anything that moved (antelope, elk, birds, rattle snake, etc.). It seemed as though a herd of buffalo would appear at every crest or vista, which would prompt Parkman and his travel mates go on a killing spree. The tails and tongues of the bulls were cut off and placed on the shooters saddle. Bull meat was almost never eaten and the carcasses were left for the wolves and buzzards."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it.

Instead, it was an account of Parkman's experiences as he traveled in some of the Western areas of the U.S. (Wyoming area, Black Hills, etc.) Much of his time was spent with the various Indian tribes as he befriended them and learned much of their culture. He also spent a great deal of time hunting. My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive.

Setting out from Independence, Mo., Parkman proceeded to Ft. Larime (Wyoming), spent many weeks with a band of Indians as they hunted buffalo and secured life's necessities for the coming season, and returned to &quot;the settlements&quot; via Bent's Fort (Colorado) and the upper Santa Fe Trail. (Making this wonderful book misnamed since he was only on about the first 1/3 of the Oregon Trail and never crossed the Rockies).What Parkman has left us is a wonderfully descriptive first person account of overland travel in the rugged west and the life of the Indian (as viewed by an outsider).The strength of this book is in the details. Parkman has a keen eye whether it is turned towards imposing landscapes, Indian village life and travel, or buffalo hunting. This book has a gritty feel that paints the grandeur of western vistas as well as the hard reality of subsistence life (both Indian and white traveler) lived outdoors in a frequently unforgiving land.Parkman's voice does have a 19th century feel. Modern readers will find he over-introduces new subjects (ie, &quot;since, reader, we are telling of a buffalo hunt, now is a good time to acquaint you with the manner in which buffalo are brought to ground.&quot;) and the book does not have the flow associated with more contemporary writing. His attitudes towards Indians reflect the majority view of that time period and he was certainly at times a gratuitous hunter.But the book's descriptive power, as well as the fascinating telling of life among the Indians and on the plains makes this well worth the time. This is a first person account that speaks of authenticity and gave me a feel for \\"what it must have been like.\\" A good read."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"The Oregon Trail still stands as a classic of American literature and of a rapidly vanishing past. Written as an account of a summer he spent traveling the Oregon Trail, Parkman captures the details of communal Native American life with no sentimentality, just hard reality. Even though written in 1846, Parkman is amazingly precise in his estimation of the vanishing frontier and Native American way of life. At times, he is rather callous toward the Native Americans, but this also reflects his times and environment. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"Living at the main jumping-off point of the Oregon, Santa Fe and California Trails, and having traveled frequently throughout the great plains and Rocky Mountains, I thought this book would be a good read. I wasn't disappointed.The book chronicles the author's trip along the Oregon Trail in the Spring and Summer of 1846. He begins by joining a group of fellow adventurers at Westport, Missouri, in present day Kansas City. Together they embark for Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. From there they head out to the plains, visiting Fort Laramie in Wyoming and the Black Hills of South Dakota. While in this general vicinity, the author joins a band of Indians and lives with them for a prolonged period, richly detailing the living conditions and customs of a Plains tribe at this time. He accompanies the tribe on a hunting trip to the Black Hills where he details this pristine area before the onrush of white encroachers after Custer's 1873 expedition.The title of the book is somewhat misleading in that the author doesn't travel the entire Oregon Trail. In fact he only traverses about 1/3 of the trail, for he returns to Fort Laramie after his stay with the Indians where he regroups with his party before heading to Bent's Fort in Colorado. The country in between these two forts is vividly illustrated by his pen as is the fort itself upon his arrival.At the fort his party is joined by a jester of sorts, a mentally ill volunteer soldier who had been left behind by his unit on their way to fight in the Mexican War which had begun just prior to the author's trip. He gives a colorful description of this man and his odd attributes during their return trip to civilization.The party follows the Arkansas River through Kansas on their way back to Westport. Along the way they meet Indians and groups of soldiers marhing along the Santa Fe Trail toward action in Mexico and California. They also partake in hunting buffalo and of this experience the author does an exceptional job of putting the reader at the scene of the hunt. While this makes for exciting reading, it is also sad when one reflects that actions such as those of this party would later lead to the near extinction of the bufalo as well as the irradication of the plains' Indians lifestyle.Having been on the plains, I felt that the author did a good job of describing the varying weather there, from the oppresive heat to the violent storms. I found it interesting that whenever one of these storms should arrive, the author and his companions would seek shelter below trees, contrary to what we are taught today. But then again, being caught out on the open plains with no adequate shelter when one of these tempests arose, I suppose one can see the reasoning in their actions.This book was a quick read and I found it very educational. It was fun to see the plains through the eyes of someone who had been there when they were still little touched by civilization. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the period, as well as to those who are studying the history of the nation's development or thinking of traveling in this part of the country."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"Francis Parkman lived the Oregon Trail, slept it, ate it, marveled at it, and wrote an excellent memoir that leaves one with the feel of sand in your boots and the smell of buffalo roasting on the fire.As a young man, Parkman went out west in 1846 to discover the American Indian. Setting out from Independence, Mo., Parkman proceeded to Ft. Larime (Wyoming), spent many weeks with a band of Indians as they hunted buffalo and secured life's necessities for the coming season, and returned to &quot;the settlements&quot; via Bent's Fort (Colorado) and the upper Santa Fe Trail. (Making this wonderful book misnamed since he was only on about the first 1/3 of the Oregon Trail and never crossed the Rockies).What Parkman has left us is a wonderfully descriptive first person account of overland travel in the rugged west and the life of the Indian (as viewed by an outsider).The strength of this book is in the details. Parkman has a keen eye whether it is turned towards imposing landscapes, Indian village life and travel, or buffalo hunting. This book has a gritty feel that paints the grandeur of western vistas as well as the hard reality of subsistence life (both Indian and white traveler) lived outdoors in a frequently unforgiving land.Parkman's voice does have a 19th century feel. Modern readers will find he over-introduces new subjects (ie, &quot;since, reader, we are telling of a buffalo hunt, now is a good time to acquaint you with the manner in which buffalo are brought to ground.&quot;) and the book does not have the flow associated with more contemporary writing. His attitudes towards Indians reflect the majority view of that time period and he was certainly at times a gratuitous hunter.But the book's descriptive power, as well as the fascinating telling of life among the Indians and on the plains makes this well worth the time. This is a first person account that speaks of authenticity and gave me a feel for \\"what it must have been like.\\" A good read."},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"I heard this book on tape.

The following year he published this travelogue which remains one of the great books ever produced by an American and embarked him on a career as one of America&iacute;s first great historians.On their trip, they were accompanied by Henry Chatillon, a hunter &amp; guide, and Deslauriers, a muleteer. Parkman, in a passage which nicely illustrates his mastery of descriptive technique, sketches them as follows:Deslauriers was a Canadian, with all the characteristics of the true Jean Baptiste. Neither fatigue,exposure, nor hard labor could ever impair his cheerfulness and gayety, or his politeness to hisbourgeois; and when night came, he would sit down by the fire, smoke his pipe, and tell storieswith the utmost contentment. The prairie was his element. Henry Chatillon was of a differentstamp. When we were at St. Louis, several gentleman of the Fur Company had kindly offered toprocure for us a hunter and guide suited for our purposes, and on coming one afternoon to theoffice, we found there a tall and exceedingly well-dressed man, with a face so open and frank that itattracted our notice at once. We were surprised at being told that that it was he who wished toguide us to the mountains. He was born in a little French town near St. Louis, and from the age offifteen years had been constantly in the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains, employed for themost part by the company, to supply their forts with buffalo meat. As a hunter, he had but onerival in the whole region, a man named Simoneau, with whom, to the honor of both of them, hewas on the terms of closest friendship. He had arrived at St. Louis the day before, from themountains, where he had been for four years; and he now asked only to go and spend a day withhis mother, before setting out on another expedition. His age was about thirty; and he was six feethigh, and very powerfully and gracefully moulded. The prairies had been his school; he couldneither read nor write, but he had a natural refinement and delicacy of mind, such as is rare even inwomen. His manly face was a mirror of uprightness, simplicity, and kindness of heart; he had,moreover, a keen perception of character, and a tact that would preserve him from flagrant error inany society. Henry had not the restless energy of an Anglo-American. He was content to takethings as he found them; and his chief fault arose from an excess of easy generosity, not conduciveto thriving in the world. Yet it was commonly remarked of him, that whatever he might choose todo with what belonged to himself, the property of others was always safe in his hands. His braverywas as much celebrated in the mountains as his skill in hunting; but it is characteristic of him that ina country where the rifle is the chief arbiter between man and man, he was very seldom involved inquarrels. Once or twice, indeed, his quiet good nature had been mistaken and presumed upon, butthe consequences of the error were such, that no one was ever known to repeat it. No betterevidence of the intrepidity of his temper could be asked, than the common report that he had killedmore than thirty grizzly bears. He was a proof of what unaided nature will sometimes do. I havenever, in the city or in the wilderness, met a better man than my true-hearted friend, HenryChatillon.&quot;Any man would consider his life well spent if he could inspire that portrait. But lest you think he's too pedantic, he also writes with great humor, to wit:Whiskey, by the way, circulates more freely in Westport than is altogether safe in a place whereevery man carries a loaded pistol in his pocket.or try this remark on setting out from Fort Leavenworth:Thus we bade a long adieu to bed and board, and the principles of Blackstone&iacute;s commentaries.Parkman's later work, The French and English in North America, was one of the first works published by the Library of America and it was the first great work of history produced by an American. It is also epic in length, numbering some 2000 pages or so. For a little easier introduction to his work, try The Oregon Trail.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The Oregon Trail (Signet classics)","review":"this real-life journal of a wealthy Bostonian adventurer traveling the Oregon trail in the late 1840s is outstanding in its description and as a historical reference.

Only twenty three years old, he and his friend Quincy Adams Shaw went west &quot;on a tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains&quot;. Stopping off at Fort Laramie, we acquire a taste of what life was like there in those early days of overland emigrants, trappers, traders, Indians and &quot;ruffians&quot;. He then spends time with the Sioux, observing and describing their behavior, culture and customs while in the Laramie Mountains and Valley, and the foothills of the Medicine Bow Mountains. From here, Parkman and Shaw travel down the front range of Colorado to Pueblo, Bent's Fort and back to St. Louis via the Arkansas River.

It presents 2 main concepts: first, agricultural involution, a significant form of intensification but which may not bring actual development; and second, the divide between irrigated and swidden (slash & burn) farming. He develops these ideas with clarity and authority, enough to have inspired many comments and some revision, but the book's core remains permanently valuable. Both concepts have applications beyond Indonesia and wet-rice regions, and his historical approach provides essential time depth. Clearly Geertz's 1950s sojourn in the Indies was among the most fruitful fieldwork stints ever, producing a raft of classic books and essays. \\"The Religion of Java\\" is merely one among these, while F.

However, the work gains momentum as one is drawn into the dynamics of Robert and his relationship to the larger world of relatives, friends and worldly experiences.What emerges is the picture of a person much richer than the stigma of schizophrenia can detract from: a human being who must be taken in total as such, rather than merely a collection of psychiatric symptoms.The author presents a model of how compassion, family, and friends may not &quot;cure&quot; such a devistating illness, but can contribute to making such a difficult life take on worthwhile meaning.And through these recollections of his brother, the author gives Robert a presence in the world far beyond the walls of his confinement.D.P.

But I found Mr. Neugeboren's writing to be incredibly irritating -- sentences with 4,5,6,7 or more commas -- parenthetical statements in the midst of far too many sentences. I found it to be tiresome and irritating. I have no way of knowing whether this is the author's natural writing style, or whether he's aiming for a poetic, disjointed sort of flow. In any event, it was a bummer to have so anticipated this book and have been so disappointed."},{"Title":"Imagining Robert: My Brother, Madness, and Survival : A Memoir","review":"First, the good things: it must have taken courage to write the book, because of the possibility of betraying the privacy of the family. At the same time, the writing process must have been immensely satisfying. I imagine Jay finishing it, sitting back, smiling, and saying &quot;If God takes me tomorrow, that's ok; the story has been told.&quot; In fact, Jay came to visit my college English class, and he told us that's exactly what he was thinking. I know how difficult it is to tell a true story about oneself in such remarkable detail, which is why the book earns three stars. But based on its execution, I'd rather only give it two. Here's why...Is this book really about Robert? How many times does Jay congratulate himself on rising above a background that was out to get him? He went to Columbia, you know. And did he mention he's a writer? He throws that in so many times, you just KNOW he views being a writer as the noblest and most enviable profession in the world. The phrase &quot;my accomplishments&quot; crops up an awful lot, especially in a book supposedly dedicated to a mentally ill brother. Also, did Jay mention he's a writer?And yes, the sentence structure was maddening (pun intended). A sentence can go on for an entire page, sometimes to such ridiculous lengths that I'd walk down the hall and read it aloud to my friends, just to show them with what I was dealing. I understand this problem a bit, though. I imagine Jay sitting at his desk with so much to say, afraid that if he doesn't put as much down as possible, as soon as it comes into his head, he'll lose it. So he erects a quick parenthetical fence and sends it down.Basically, when I'd finished reading the book for my English class, I wished that Robert could come to visit instead of Jay. Much as Jay tries to overshadow him, Robert is the star of this book and a truly fascinating character. I realize that I only know about Robert through Jay's writing, so I respect Jay for that.

This is not a new problem and anyone who knows the story of poet John Clare, b1793, will realise that it was by chance that he found an advocate at the asylum who helped him to continue writing. It was by chance too, that Jay survived the intense psychological trauma caused by his dysfunctional parents , that he could afford the more helpful talking therapy, and that he was able to express his emotions in coherent prose, containing a deep admiration for his brother's poetry.Just before buying this book, I chanced upon a beautiful book \\"Today and Today\\" illustrated by Brian Karas, show-casing haiku by Issa, so it was a surprise to read the haiku written by Robert at the age of 19, in 1962, (Pg 175) before the irreversible ravages of innumerable, unsuccessful psychiatric treatments. Identity and meaning were lost. 'Meaning' is a philosophical abstract that is also becoming redundant in the 21st century so all we can hope for is that the most expedient, technological treatments will do less harm than their predecessors. For those lucky enough to have alternatives to the mainstream maelstrom, identity, meaning and poetry may survive."},{"Title":"Imagining Robert: My Brother, Madness, and Survival : A Memoir","review":"This is a marvelous book, one of the best I have ever read. It is the authors memoir of his brother Robert. He attempts to compose a life, one that is unique, creative and mercurial.Robert has spent most of his adult life struggling with mental illness, enmeshed in a bureaucratic and dispassionate system that views him as a disease or label, giving little attention to the human composition of this precious man.Robert and Jay's lower middle class Brooklyn upbringing evoked many similar images from my own childhood in New York. Their narcissistic mother uses shame and guilt as the means to inspire adoration. Their mother worships their father who is emotionally non-existent to Jay and Robert.Jay attempts to understand who Robert is a a component of his family, society, experiences and genetics. He opposes the reductionist medical model of mental illness and abhors the dehumanizing treatment model that Robert has been forced to endure. Their love is poignant and this book is a grand testimony to their relationship. I imagine Robert."},{"Title":"Imagining Robert: My Brother, Madness, and Survival : A Memoir","review":"The idea of this book seems to have much greater potential than the actual work itself. That Neugoboren has written this book on mental illness-the ravages it bestows on families and those who suffer from it, the paucity of real knowledge on how to deal with it-is the best thing about this book. The courage to write it should not be overlooked. That being said, I find the book much more a self-absorbed description of the AUTHOR's experience of his BROTHER's mental illness than an imagination of what it might be like for his brother. Case in point, the author seems to have completely lost touch with his brother for a whole decade (the 80s). How then is this about Robert? I also find a disturbing hint of some kind of &quot;women&quot; issue in his barely veiled angry descriptions of his mother and lack of descriptions of his wife (or is it wives? they are barely mentioned in the book while whole chapters are devoted to things the influenced the authors life). The author touches superficially on so many important issues (what it feels like to have a different caregiver every month, being stuck in an unsuitable living situation, the way caregivers only call you back when you write to their superiors, etc.)but doesn't delve into them in any meaningful way. Having worked in a residential facility for chronically mentally ill adults for close to two years, I understand through experience the helpless feelings of dealing with a mentally ill individual. While we may never know how to effectively &quot;treat&quot; (clinically speaking) these patients, perhaps effort is better expended exposing the injustices they suffer in a criminally overburdened, underfunded and neglected system. From my experience, there is NO FUNDRAISING EFFORT for the day to day livingin of the mentally ill. I don't mean drug development, or psychological research funding, I mean fundraising efforts for supported housing like the author mentions his brother kept trying to get into (and often denied). This is never mentioned in the rare media stories on mental illness. Peole don't want to deal with mental illness, they just don't want to be affected by it. In writing this book, I ask the author if his efforts perhaps stopped short of encouraging real public knowledge and effort on the behalf of men and women like his brother Robert"},{"Title":"Imagining Robert: My Brother, Madness, and Survival : A Memoir","review":"This book was terrible, it was an expolitation of his brother, and a shameless way to promote his other books.

It's extremely well written, as Strieber was already a successful writer when the experiences began to intrude through his consciousness in the mid-1980s. The publisher did an excellent promotional job and got the author interviewed on top-line mainstream media across the world; the book was very well promoted and distributed, and the striking cover image painted by artist Ted Jacobs - though not quite accurate in some details according to Strieber and other abductees who saw it - became an iconic and deeply disturbing image to many with suppressed memories.The book is written in novelistic style with great skill, as the author tells his own story of the trigger-events in late 1985 which shockingly alerted him to the intrusion of the \\"visitors\\", as he terms them, into his life and the lives of his wife and son (whose ID is protected as his name is never mentioned in print). It's a real page-turner and highly readable, as the narrative builds and fills in the complex emerging picture of the interactions which are always on the visitors' terms and never (by them) explained.Back in 1987, this reviewer first came across the name of Budd Hopkins through the pages of Strieber's book, but did not come to personally know and respect this intelligent, humanitarian and first-class investigator until many years later. New-York based Strieber was lucky to find Hopkins, who helped him unravel the complex tangle of memories and introduced him to others with similar experiences.Strieber's book is by and large a pretty realistic picture of the abduction phenomenon and one experiencer's attempts to understand and come to terms with the suppressed memories as they emerge. It's downright scary in places, and those of a nervous disposition might be well advised not to read it alone in a quiet house at night. However it's also intelligent and thoughtful as the author explores exactly who or what these visitors might be, through his personal searching and meetings with psychiatrists, hypnotherapists and support groups made up of others going through the same trauma - always anxious to keep their IDs secret, such is the social stigma surrounding The Great Denial of this widespread phenomenon. Conclusions, however, are thin on the ground as Strieber seems to have failed, like many others, to really understand what might be going on and goes a bit \\"new-agey\\" in his musings about the meaning of the experience. He's not the only one to go this route, of course, as the visitors don't tell us what they are doing, or why.One caution to the reader: many people who know Whitley Strieber point to his frequently unstable and odd social behaviour, and it has been said that he \\"has a difficult time telling fact from fiction.\\" With this in mind, you are still recommended to read \\"Communion\\" because of its historical importance, because it is so well written, and its narrative is supported by many accounts from other abductees.It was in \\"Communion\\" that the infamous \\"anal probe\\" procedure was reported, rarely if ever described by anyone else as it does not seem to be part of the visitors' normal investigative processes. Because of the book's notoriety and sales success, this possibly-imaginary detail stuck and became associated with the visitors in popular consciousness: ironic, as it seems in reality they don't do this.BTW don't bother with the abysmal \\"Communion\\" film starring Christopher Walken playing the part of Strieber: it's overly melodramatic, uninvolving and doesn't work as drama. Instead see either the feature film or longer original mini-series version of \\"Intruders\\" starring Richard Crenna, Mare Winningham et al. It's much, much better - gripping, intelligent, superbly written and edited, and a more accurate dramatization of the phenomenon."},{"Title":"COMMUNION A TRUE STORY","review":"I read this book years ago while in a cabin in a very rural area while on the road far from home.

I instantly ordered it from Amazon, but the one I received has been re-written to be quicker and thus not as charming and sweet! This version has the kitty running from animal to animal in a panic looking for her purr, whereas the one at the library described how she went on her search through the day, and at days end she was getting quite tired by the time she talked to owl and the ending read much sweeter than this one. I don't know what year that edition was (it was hardbound - maybe that's the difference) or if it had a different publisher, but I was disappointed with this version and will continue my search for the one I fell in love with.P.S.

It'd probably be ok for younger kids, though. There were some magor types of wildlife that I thought should be included that were not (red-tail hawk, box turtle), as well as some that I don't know why they're in there (humpback whale, viruses). The descriptions were short, and included very little as to where the animals were actually found (no idea of range). The plants section was really tiny as well. Needless to say, I'm still searching for a field guide to use in my class."},{"Title":"Peterson First Guide to Urban Wildlife","review":"This compact book, labeled and formatted as a field guide, introduces young naturalists to city wildlife. It ranges widely among organisms in urban areas including many familiar mammals and birds as well as skimming a few bacterium, viruses, protoctists, fungi, and plants into the mix. Including these latter life forms reminds readers that there's a lot of life going unnoticed, much of it too small to even see, right around them. If, however, kids want to identify wildlife around them, the usual reason to get a field guide, including wildlife that literally cannot be seen is out of place. This latter issue rubs especially since so many more likely critters; ones that many kids will see around their neighborhoods, were not included.Attractive illustrations are offered at one per entry and each entry is described in a few sentences. Don't expect the kinds of details in adult field guides. No information is offered on variations in size and appearance by sexes, ages, and seasons which can be essential for field identification. Nor are ranges presented. What this really offers is a general introduction to the neglected part of nature outside kids' front doors in an easy-to-browse format. For older independent readers."},{"Title":"Peterson First Guide to Urban Wildlife","review":"I read Peterson First Guide to Urban Wildlife cover to cover, since it's quite brief and succinct. It's oddly organized--despite claiming on the back cover that it focuses on the \\"things you are most likely to see,\\" it begins with a discussion of microscopic organisms including the common cold virus, something everyone is familiar with through experience, and yet not at all likely ever to see. The insect section covers many common household pests including 4 different kinds of cockroaches, but only 4 butterfly species. The selection seems almost random at times; why include trees at all if there is room for only two, and why those two? There are no maps and the information on ranges is often vague. However, despite being very familiar with most of the animals and plants included, I learned a few new things about some of them--for example, that common barnacles are crustaceans, not mollusks.Overall, this is probably a handy little book for beginners or young people who don't have a lot of opportunity to get far from human habitations. It would make a fine addition to an elementary school library. The writing and illustrations are clear and easy to understand, but anyone with much outdoor experience or a desire to learn more about individual species will quickly outgrow it."},{"Title":"Peterson First Guide to Urban Wildlife","review":"This book includes more of a random assortment of animals, like viruses and starfish, and not just urban animals. There is no mention of what distinguishes an urban habitat from any other. Many entries aren't specific enough about where you can actually find each animal, or what it eats. The mammals and bird sections are pretty good, almost good enough to buy the book. This should have been a larger book about all animals; it is misleading to label this as an urban wildlife guide."},{"Title":"Peterson First Guide to Urban Wildlife","review":"My two boys often ask questions such as \\"What kind of bird is that?\\" or \\"where would we find a vole?\\" I purchased this book right before two road trips and we made great use of it.

Furthermore, the character was real and relatable. What I enjoyed about him was his way of criticizing himself and seeing that although he comes across to others as powerful and in charge he is just as self-reflective and vulnerable as we all are. This narrative was powerful in that the lessons taught were provided through the story line and not by text book bullet points, tables and charts. What I was able to learn in this book has helped my own glass to melt."},{"Title":"The Glass is Half Full and Frozen","review":"I thought this was an enjoyable read. I like the optimism of half full or half frozen. Life is full of conflicts and adventures, whether these are good or bad depend on the way we perceive them.

The author gives a clear description of basic Buddhist philosophy in the first 5 chapters, including an inspired interpretation of a natal chart for the Buddha. Then he describes each of the 12 Houses and gives lively descriptions of the meaning associated with the moon, sun and planets. I took out my own chart to learn more about my own natal chart. The only negative criticism I have is that the book nowhere gives the symbols for the planets so I had difficulty reading my chart.The book ends with a delightful biography of the author who, though born a Canadian, became a Buddhist monk , lived in Dharmsala,was taught by the Dalai Lama,did a 3 year retreat in a mountian cave and after 13 years was given permission by the Dalai Lama to give up his ordination and teach Buddhism in the West. His description of this life is fascinating.There is a glossary of Buddhist terms,a bibliography.and an index - all things a good book needs!"},{"Title":"Buddhist Astrology: Chart Interpretation from a Buddhist Perspective","review":"The main author, Jhampa Shaneman has extraordinary Buddhist background including the traditional 3 years retreat of Tibetan Tantric Buddhism. From his biographical sketch at the end of this book (and his website) you know how devoted he is about his practice. Actually this what I was impressed the most.Due to such kind of practices, as well as his knowledge, experiment and practices of Western Astrology, we can see in-depth perspectives applying Western Astrology to our mind, which is the core and source of our daily-life, past, present and future... Thus Astrology is useful to us in a very practical way. Western Astrology has been very close to western Psychology after Jung. However, this book presents Astrological Psychology with the deepest school of eastern Psychology... which is worth reading and thinking about.One of the most special points in this book is that he tried to trace Buddha's birthchart out of records and we can find very reasonable and helpful information out of his interpretation of the chart, including tracing the time and inner-experience when Siddhartha (Buddha's name before he became enlightened) escaped from his palace and attained Buddhahood.Jhampa's Buddhist teachers including Lama Yeshe and many greatest gurus of the century. The most famous western Tibetan scholars nowadays like Robert Thurman, Jeffery Hopkins, are about the same time or later as his beginning of studying. And he is also one of the few westerners permited by His Holiness Dalai Lama to teach all levels of Buddhism.From his website, you will find more of his information:http://www....-astrology.com/Sorry that I cannot express well with all the good points of this book. I will try to tell more later."},{"Title":"Buddhist Astrology: Chart Interpretation from a Buddhist Perspective","review":"The introduction to Buddhist thought and philosophy is worth the price of this book. The astrological interpretations, given from this Buddhist perspective, offer peace and tranquility in the face of stormy life-situations and inner turmoil. The message which permeates these pages is: you are not mortal; your true being is one with life, not at odds with life. Buddhist Astrology--the book and the approach--pierces through the veil of an illusional mortality. Astrological consultations, whether through a personal astrologer or through a well-written book, ought to bring hope, peace, comfort to the seeker. These things are to be found here."},{"Title":"Buddhist Astrology: Chart Interpretation from a Buddhist Perspective","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The Buddhist philosophy was incorporated into astrology with tack. There is no lecturing, and it is thought provoking. The professional style makes the book highly readable and opens the subject up to people of different philosophical backgrounds without misrepresenting astrology. I am glad that this book is on the market. It reflects well on the system and is an example of what astrology should strive to be--a well thought out philosophy of life. I couldn't recommend the book more and I am not Buddhist."},{"Title":"Buddhist Astrology: Chart Interpretation from a Buddhist Perspective","review":"This interpretation of astrology chart readings from a Buddhist point of view is very interesting and insightful.

They were days of exploration into exotic lands and grand adventures on the high seas, days when young men dreamed of making their mark on the world in impossible ways. It was an epoch that would change the world we know in ways beyond imagination.Lt. James Brooke of the East India Company has been commissioned by the King, as were his father and grandfather before him. From a life of ease and privilege in England, he travels across the world to India and Burma. Never one to knuckle under to authority and constraints, Lt. Brooke dreams of gaining riches and fame in the Far East. Not even devotion to his father or love for the far-from-innocent Elizabeth Wethington can deter that dream for long.Despite his young age, James Brooke is blessed with a force of character and courage that inspires the men he leads in battle. Those who opt to stay beside him when he resigns his commission are an odd mix. Si Tundok is an imposing half-breed Malay, devoted to no man or cause until he meets Lt. Brooke. Henry Steele is a rough-around-the-edges Welshman and former soldier of the King's Army. Captain Timothy Irons is a seaman who finds more adventure than he wanted in the company of Brooke. Dr. Arthur Claygate and his wife Margaret find in James a humorous compatriot and friend.Random happenings and chance circumstance throw James into the adventure he seeks. He finds his way to Borneo, to Sarawak. And what an unexpected life he finds there, one of breathless wonder at the land itself and an unanticipated sympathy for the native peoples living there. Through the eyes and experiences of James and his friends, the reader meets headhunters, fierce warriors, gentle jungle dwellers, and the cruel despots who have plundered Sarawak for years. The author leads us into the lives and longhouses of each tribe James encounters - the Punan, Kayan, Iban, Bidayuh, and Maylay - and documents their differences in entertaining style. We meet the villains of this story and learn to hate them for their callous greed. Worst of all is the Maylay prince, Api, who taxes his own people to the point of starvation, and whose taste for cruelty is worsened by the impotence he tries to hide. Not far behind Api is Geoff, the foulest Englishman who ever graced a literary page. Loi Pek, the Chinaman, cares little for anyone or anything but opium and gold.James Brooke becomes Rajah of Sarawak, and soon develops an almost fatherly concern for the native people. He gains cooperation from all tribes because of their superstitions and beliefs. James is tall, an imposing figure to the short and stocky tribesmen. Brave in battle, as ferocious as the most successful headhunter, James &quot;casts a long shadow&quot;, and one the natives would find difficult to bury.Sarawak is what might have been labeled an epic tale or sweeping saga in earlier times. Through what must have been diligent research, Mr. Mohrlang makes this story come alive. A decidely masculine writing style and focus adds to the feeling that this is James Brooke's story, told from his perspective in another time and age. For readers who are history lovers, Sarawak is a must read. For those who think that history is boring, there should be enough adventure, romance, violence, warring and intrigue between these covers to satisfy. I recommend this book, and wonder what Jerry Mohrlang could possibly do to top it. I'm hoping for a continuation of the James Brooke story."},{"Title":"Sarawak","review":"Sarawak by Jerry D. Mohrlang is an extremely well written epic tale. Mohrlang has crafted a story that takes the reader back 200 years to a land that was the epitome of uncivilized. This story feels real, seems authentic and true to the way it must have been back then in Sarawak, Malaysia. And if it isn't, the writer is so good at penning a novel, he makes it all unmistakingly believable. The senses are all entertained as well as satisfied with Mohrlang's knowledge of what he writes about. Descriptions are so attended to, the reader will want to taste the padi (rice) balls and fish wrapped in banana leaves and cringe when the blood oozes onto the parang (thick sword) during battle, of which there are many graphically portrayed throughout this amazing saga of life, death, conquest, social change, and savage vs. civilized. I highly recommend this literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"Sarawak","review":"Sarawak, by Jerry D. Mohrlang, will transport you back in time as Lt. James Brooke, of the East India Company, sets out on a grand adventure to find fame and fortune. This tightly woven and intricate tale lets you sail across the world to Sarawak, Malaysia.Lt. James Brooke proves to be more than a capable leader who exhibits valor and an amazing ability to survive in the midst of battle. Despite the fact that he could lead a life of extraordinary privilege with the love of his life, Lt. James Brooke dives into a sea of danger that leads him into a whirlpool full of headhunters, Rajahs, bloodthirsty warriors, and other, less threatening tribes of the region. The Punan, Iban, and Maylay tribes led lives that simply astounded this reader.Lt. James Brooke remained my favorite character through this epic novel, but Si Tundok, a half-breed Malay warrior, also displayed admirable qualities even though he possessed an untamed and possibly misunderstood spirit.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and applaud Jerry D. Mohrlang's attention to important details that were vital to making this story come to life. While reading Sarawak, you'll get lost in the vivid imagery and wonderful character development. If you desire adventure on the high seas, spiced with a bit of romance, and dreams that are dipped into plenty of danger...then you'll want to devour Sarawak. It's easily a five star read."},{"Title":"Dollmakers and Their Stories: Women Who Changed the World of Play","review":"Though Dollmakers And Their Stories: Women Who Changed The World Of Play by Krystyna Poray Goddu was written for a younger readership and can appeal from middle school grades on up, Dollmakers And Their Stories is reviewed here and strongly recommended for adult readers for its fine applicability to anyone of any ages who is just beginning to collect dolls. Girls have played with dolls since ancient times and the dolls have changed over the centuries: selected stories of courageous dollmakers who produced Barbie, Madame Alexander collectibles, the Sasha line and more provide wonderful stories of strong entrepreneurs and feminists who displayed both business and political skills in producing dolls in times when women didn't ordinarily work outside the home or the family farm."},{"Title":"Dollmakers and Their Stories: Women Who Changed the World of Play","review":"[This review was first published in the \\"Ephrata (Pa.) Review.\\"]The author, founding editor of \\"Dolls\\" magazine, argues that it's been women, strong entrepreneurial women, who have designed the dolls that children over the past century have loved, and continue to love. Here she tells the stories of five of these women, along with profiles of six contemporary dollmakers.The inability to find dolls to meet their own daughters' needs inspired several dollmakers. Kathe Kruse, for example, may have never designed dolls if not for her 2-year-old who, after a brother was born, asked her mother for \\"a child like yours.\\" The lavish porcelain dolls available in Germany in the early 1900s were hardly babylike. It took Kruse years of experimentation to find a design for a realistic baby doll. The company she founded still produces dolls that inspire tenderness and care.Ruth Handler created Barbie only after noting how her preteen daughter and friends played for hours with paper dolls representing adult women, creating imaginary worlds for them, which Ruth viewed as the girls' rehearsal of possibilities for their own futures.In each of the five bios the author emphasizes how each woman became an entrepreneur, struggling to bring her inspirations to life and breaking ground in a men's world. These stories will appeal to doll lovers. They will also inspire and instruct creative young women embarking on their adult lives."},{"Title":"Dollmakers and Their Stories: Women Who Changed the World of Play","review":"Little girls love dolls such as Barbie and American Girl but do they know they got started.

It is also the one that has suffered most from the passage of time, as subsequent archaeological research has revealed errors in what was considered, in Norris's day, to be \\"factual\\" information about costume. The best thing about his book, in my opinion, is the meticulous line drawings of brooches and other items of period jewelry, but again, more recently published works contain excellent, full-color photographs of the same or similar specimens. Read this book if you enjoy Norris's style, but do not accept anything in it blindly as much of it is plain wrong."},{"Title":"Ancient European Costume and Fashion (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"There are hundreds of books on Costume history, ranging from the Egyptians through to this century. Almost all of them ignore the period known of as the Dark Ages. Not only does this book go into detail on the costumes worn by the Celts, the Gauls, and the Goths, it also tells some of their history. The book is mostly text supported by mainly black and white illustrations. I personally found it very informative."},{"Title":"Ancient European Costume and Fashion (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"Now dated, this 1926 publication is still worth using in conjunction with other texts. Granted some of this work has since been shown to be inaccurate by more recent scholarship. Furthermore his attitudes and observations are not only dated and politically incorrect, in the context of the 21st Century could also be considered racist. That said, Norris' body of work deserves our respect as being equaled by few of his generation (and surpassed by none). He has also proved to be a stepping-stone for future costumes historians - just check out the bibliographies of some important costume history texts and see how many reference Norris.Many of Norris' statements are a little questionable. The stone-age chapter is almost charming in its dated naivet&eacute;, and is by no means a reliable reference. The Greek chapter is also filled with questionable statements, and in other places one gets the impression that Norris is putting forth conjecture as truth. However, many of his observations are of great use. For instance, the account of the evolution of the pallium - its journey from the voluminous philosophers cloak in Greece, through Roman and Byzantine usage, to a finally a narrow band of fabric used as a Christian vestment even today - is clearer than in any other publication I have ever seen.As with all his books, all the illustrations are redrawn by Norris himself and no primary source material is illustrated. This is typical of most costume texts published prior to the 1960s and is not a further reflection on Norris' scholarship."},{"Title":"Ancient European Costume and Fashion (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"When a late 14th C. illuminator depicted Saul fighting the Amalekites, he likely depicted Saul armored in a pig snouted bascinet and wearing a surcoat colored in the royal arms of Jerusalem, while his Amalekite enemies, if the scribe was trying to be \\"authentic\\", might look remarkably like a contemporary Turkish janissary. Among the \\"Nine Worthies\\", Alexander and Caesar and Charlemagne would all wear the armor of Augsburg or Milan, as tho' they were both contemporaries of each other and of the artist. And who does not remember the charming Renaissance depictions of \\"The Adoration of the Magi\\", replete with Oriental kings dressed in Renaissance finery and bearing the faces of Lorenzo and Giuliano di Medici? Only in the 19th C. did it begin to occur to folks that people in the past might have looked and dressed \\"differently\\" and there grew up around that realization numerous efforts to improve art by improving the artist's understanding of what his subjects likely wore (a process which spawned whole schools of art, from the quasi-realism of the Pre-Raphaelites to the fully developed works of the \\"Academicians\\" such as Alma-Tadema and Jean Jerome). Behind those artists were the costume historians, one of the earliest and most prolific of whom was Herbert Norris, who published numerous books and monographs on the topic, all eagerly sought out by his contemporaries, including historians and artists and stage directors and/or their costume designers from the theatre. This is a reproduction of one of his works (with some supplementation).Where Norris had actual exemplars to work from (such as in jewelry designs), his work was often little short of remarkable (artistry in and of itself). When he had to work from secondary sources (such as from paintings from the period under consideration), errors and misapprehensions began to creep in. When, however, he had to work from non-pictorial sources or written descriptions, his imaginings become little short of hilarious - for instance, in attempting to interpret the appearance of a Germanic spangenhelm from the descriptions of it in such works as the \\"Gododdin\\" (which called them \\"four cornered helms\\"), he came up with a bizarre, curled edged box-like affair so impossibly stupid-looking that it would have embarassed Lady Gaga (with the remainder of the costume a comic opera blend of Roman and Medieval elements with not a little Jules Verne thrown in). Pity the poor actor who got to play Siegfried in a Norris \\"validated\\" costume...It is this blend of art and absurdity which makes Norris so interesting today. As a reliable source of costuming information and of historical dress, he is only selectively reliable, but as the embodiment of the history of historical costume research, he is priceless. Anyone who fancies themselves an historical costumier needs to read Norris' works if for no other reason than to pay homage to the man who largely created the discipline, as well as as a cautionary tale about how our presumptions and assumptions can sometimes lead us astray. This is as good a Norris book as any to start with, chock full of both learning and laughs.

Just about all of the plays are useful for all of these purposes, and it's just a fun thing to read!"},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"I played Dawn Divito in the stage version and I thougth the character was amazing. It gave a nice character development, from the shy girl to the outrageous and confident student at the end. The audience howled at the plays, all six of them. Particular favorites were The Universal Language, Var. on the Death of Trotsky and A Philadelphia. Buy this play! It's outrageous."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"I have seen these plays produced two times, performed a monologue from Ancient history, and have also performed Sure Thing various times. These plays are hilarious, accessible, and absolutely genious. Even just reading them puts you in stiches for hours. This is a must read for anyone....and for any actor out there looking for a short play or scene....you have found the place!"},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"The plays in this book keep me laughing even when I'm not readingthem. I have to say my two favorites are &quot;Words, Words, Words&quot; and &quot;The Philadelphia.&quot; They are great for if a group wants to doquick, funny plays."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"Escape to world that mocks the closed mind! Even though he could delve a little deeper into his pokes at great literature, David Ives does a great job at weaving in Shakespeare and other literary works into his hilarious plays. &quot;Bathroom humor&quot; maybe, but raised to an art form! I enjoyed it a lot."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"If you don't know the playwright David Ives then you should get to know him. His introductory chapter is a delightfully funny collection of answers to common questions a playwright might get - without the questions, because the questions themselves are superfluous.The book consists of 13 one-act and 1 full length plays.Sure Thing: A man tries to introduce himself to woman reading a book. And says the wrong thing. Ding. Reset. They try again and again until they get it right.Words, Words, Words: 3 monkeys, Kafka, Milton and Swift, trapped in a room with a set of typewriters by an unseen psychologist until they produce Shakespeare's Hamlet. They think of rebellion. Great dialog, extremely funny.The Universal Language: With hat tips to When The Earth Stood Still, Yiddish and Monty Python. Student Dawn meets teacher Don and together they create an Esperanto like language that is both funny and swimming in culture. Getting the language is half the fun as most of it is just punned English.Variations on the Death of Trotsky: The basis of the cover image, Similar to SURE THING in that it reuses resets to play out the same scene in different ways, this comic sketch on Trotsky's murder plays on the historic fact that Trotsky was killed by an axe on Aug. 20th 1940, but died a full day later. So how does a noted Bolshevik survive a whole day with an axe in his head?The Philadelphia: Every had one of those days when you seem to be somewhere else. Al and Mark do. Once you learn the rules it's easier to manage, but can you get out?Long Ago and Far Away: Memories in a New York apartment. Laura slips back in time and then is lost. Less of a comedy and more of an existential wandering.Foreplay: Where miniature golf stands in for seduction. Ives employs parallelism showing 3 variations on a date with the same man and similar women but run simultaneously.Seven Menus: Another excursion into resets, composed of 7 scenes at the same restaurant, but different times, but this time changing only one or two characters at a time; technically interesting.Mere Mortals: Written in memory of his father, 3 sensitive construction workers on a beam come up with a fanciful theories as to who they really are - and one of them claim's he's the Lindbergh baby.English Made Simple: A mockumentary in the style of those 1950s on how to behave films, in this at a party. Three roles - a narrator and the subjects: Jack and Jill.A Singular Kind of Guy: A short monologue where a young man imagines himself to be a typewriter. Nothing special but one can make something out of this.Speed The Play: Terrific parody produced in honour of David Mamet. If you're familiar with any of American Buffalo, Sexual Perversity in Chicago, Speed the Plow or Glengarry Glen Ross you'll appreciate how Ives nails it. And if you aren't, it's funny anyway.Ancient History: A full length two hander quasi romance sputtering to extinction. IMV its also also a weak entry with themes of love/lust and 30 somethings bickering over identity getting a bit old. The play is rooted in a clever couple who spend most of their time rooting each other, which makes the set simple - a bedroom. Jack, an ex-lapsed Catholic Peter Pan and Ruth, a Jewish Wendy are in lust with each other, but Jack peters out as Ruth wants to take him out of Neverland. Interesting use of repeated dialog but that's technique.Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread: This one I didn't really get, but then I've never seen a Philip Glass opera performed or listened to one of his symphonies. Perhaps I should. Ostensibly Phil Glass goes into a bakery, buys some bread, gets his change and leaves. There are 4 parts and they all speak slowly and at the same time.The one acts are Immensely suitable for as acting exercises, but perhaps some enterprising impresario could transplant the cinematic idea of a comic animation before the show and offer pieces like these as a preshow treat before a longer performance. Enjoyable just for a read as well."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"All in the Timing: Fourteen PlaysThis is a great book if you are looking for humorous scenes to use in an acting class.

They talk to each other about how absurdthe experiment is meanwhile reading back the nonsense theyhave written."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"So what if Christopher Durang, Dorothy Parker and David Sedaris combined DNA? You just might get David Ives.Witty and cerebral, Ives comments on relationships, language and mortality in some of the cleverest one-acts to ever find their way into print. All the works have a Tom Stoppardian-esque command of the English language. Especially in &quot;Foreplay, Or The Art of the Fugue&quot; and &quot;Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread&quot; is his impeccable command of ordering words into almost symphonic patterns best displayed.(Hey, it also helps to know a little about Philip Glass, who was a postmodern musical innovator and it is his musical phrasing Ives mimics in &quot;...Buys A Loaf...&quot;)Some of these plays deal with modern relationships. &quot;Sure Thing&quot; continually backtracks the forming of its 2 characters' relationship with each other by allowing them unlimited &quot;re-dos&quot; when they make a social or relational faux pas, until the &quot;perfect&quot; pattern for falling in love is found.&quot;Ancient History&quot; is perhaps my favorite out of all the plays. It has two very real, very funny, very sympathetic romantic characters that will constantly remind you of yourself. Jack and Ruth argue, banter and raise issues we're all familiar with in a way that makes you laugh until you realize how sad it really is.Ives has no trouble taking fellow playwrights down a peg or two as well. &quot;Speed-The-Play&quot; requires an elementary knowledge of David Mamet to really appreciate how hilarious (and accurate) it is.All of the other pieces are wonderful and hilarious. &quot;English Made Simple&quot; and &quot;Variations on the Death of Trotsky&quot; were probably meant to be read anyway. &quot;Mere Mortals&quot; is a witty commentary on man's ego and inner thought life. &quot;Words, Words, Words&quot; is an exestential little work where Ives explores the actual possiblity of chimps, left alone with typewriters long enough, cranking out 'Hamlet'.Think of it as excersize for your mind. Do a few yoga stretches and enjoy!"},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"In these days of cookie-cutter plays, where an intellectual evening is watching David Copperfield making his career disappear, it is refreshing to read anything that challenges one to think. All In The Timing succeeds, with Ives mastery of the English language and timing being the key to the cleverness of the play. These series of plays are not slap-stick, nor are they Checkov, but an intellectual medium for one who has apparently a bit ahead of his time. While some will find the read of some of the plays difficult (The Universal Language and Phillip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread). These plays, in particular, are for enjoying on stage, rather than read. But for the most part, this collection is an enjoyable evening of intellectual theater."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"This collection of plays has opened my mind to different ways of writing and reading. As a high-schooler, I was looking for a one-act play to direct, and I was certainly given a wonderful choice by Ives. He is especially innovative, considering that he manages to connect music to his writing : &quot;Foreplay, or the Art of the Fugue&quot; was written in the style of a fugue, and &quot;Variations on the Death of Trotsky&quot; is written similarly to variations on a theme of music. &quot;Phillip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread&quot; has incredible rhythmic qualities, and overall, I think that &quot;All in the Timing&quot; is a first-rate set of plays, worth anybody's time."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"My current favorite playwright primarily because of his humor. It's outlandish, but not so you don't understand the underlying meaning to the plays as a whole. &quot;Sure Thing&quot; is one that I expect I will perform in soon. I held off directing it because I wanted to be in it so badly. I did, however, direct &quot;Seven Menus&quot; and it was a lot of fun. His plays are great for college productions, as well as, community plays. Anyone would have fun reading them! Not much of monologues...lots of fast paced, back-n-forth dialogue."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"I bought All in the Timing after being a part of a production of &quot;Words, words, words&quot;, &quot;Variations on the Death of Trotsky&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Sure Thing&quot;. After enjoying immensly the 12 times I saw these performed, I found out that there were more! I immediately bought the complete collection and have been laughing my head off ever since. I read them over and over and loan the book to all my friends who appreciate comedy. If you need a good laugh, read &quot;All in the Timing.&quot;"},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"This collection from Ives is one of the most complete and entertaining works around; humorous one acts keep the audience (reader)laughing consistantly at the situations. However, as a magnet theater student, I've seen the plays done nearly three times each (Sure Thing at least five times). The collection is must-read, but if it remains the source for assignment material in American high schools, soon the novelty will wear down and the plays will be in the same boat as Durang's Laughing Wild."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"David Ives demonstrates an almost superhuman command of his material, to such an extent that he's able to distance himself from convention and even make fun of himself and the 'cult of intelligence'. Ives's knowledge of art OUTSIDE of theater comes through at every turn as well as a knack for comic profundity ne plus ultra. Disparate as the individual plays may seem, the whole thing holds togetehr and in toto becomes an encyclical on interpersonal relationships and the meaning in life (or lack thereof). Ives avoids any heavy-handed intervention, allowing cliche and commedy to speak almost misologically for themselves. This is a must for anyone who's into drama, humor, or the arts generally.--Justin Laird Weaver &lt;uweavj02@umail.ucsb.edu&gt;"},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"David ives deserves more recognition than he is getting today. He is both a craftsman as well as an artist judging by the plays in this book. while he could be real funny and creative (e.g. the philip glass piece) he proves that he could be equally good at crafting his play (mere mortals). my favourite piece is 'mere mortal', as it started out as if it's a fantasy play, then slowly it makes you realise that it's actually a naturistic play. this is one of the most powerful plays i've come across in a long time. the timing and tempo of the play is perfect."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"This excellent collection of one act plays shows Ives' great sense of rhythm, randomly interesting observations about life, and excellent sensitivity towards relationships.

Also, he's dull when he writes full-length - no timing there at all. He does employ &quot;potty&quot;-humour/language on occasion, which works perhaps a third of the time, but otherwise is merely banal.However, those searching for one-act plays would do well to give David Ives a gander, as well as those who enjoy a little bit of post-modern humour."},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"I am a high school student and I've read this books with my friends.

I was very surprised with how I little I liked the script in its entirety. I am familiar with Sure Thing because I worked on it in college, and was expecting more of the same...quick witted, funny pieces that would easily make for a night of entertainment. Honestly, due to content and language, I don't see how we can perform many of these plays on our stage. I know that the scholars are going to bash me, but from a director's point of view, I vote to shelf this one. No audience is going to want to sit through all 14 of these plays when most won't make much sense to them. They want to be entertained and walk away with a thought other than confusion at the end of the night.

No, theyre not unfunny. The jokes just, far too often, come, and simply refrain from BEing funny. It's unfortunate. The Universal Language is a play that is always FUN to do, and one that will never leave peoples brains, but it's not entertaining because of any wit. This is what tends to happen to Ives. He gets going, and write a great play, but the characters don't have much depth, are not particularly interesting to play, and don't manage to actually be comical too frequently, so it's really not worth it to want to participate in the plays. (With the GRAND exception of The Death of Trotsky)"},{"Title":"All in the Timing","review":"David Ives is to America Theatre what William Shakespeare was to British Theatre. The only difference is, David Ives is funny. Obviously underrated, Ives knows how to write plays in a a way that is (although I've seen it done) hard to screw up. All you really need to have is a basic sense of rhythm and his plays are a breeze. Just know that he is a master of the English language and will have you studying the basic underlying rhythm of speech (English Made Simple, Phillip Glass), studying relationships (Sure Thing, ForePlay, Seven Menu's) as well as death and Mamet (Speed the Play, Variations on the Death of Trotsky). Ives knows creativity, and works hard at his craft... if you have any other questions about his book just read the Introduction to it and see what you think. Absolute Genius!"},{"Title":"With a Daughter's Eye: A Memoir of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson","review":"Margaret Mead was one of my heroines when I was growing up. How fascinating to read this biography which is a blend of intellectual and up close and personal history of her. To have her husband, Gregory Bateson included is icing on the cake. Mary Catherine has done an extremely creditble job. For example, she writes, \\"Margaret always emphasized the importance of recording first impressions . . . for . . . the informed eye has its own blindness as it begins to take for granted things that were initially bizarre.\\" As I read of Margaret's reaction to Mary Catherine's wedding -- that it must be a format that reflected Margaret and Gregory's place in the world, rather than just the personal joy and celebration of a daughter, I had to wonder if Mary Catherine ever connected the above passage to her own children. This daughter writes with a fairly clear eye about her parents. They are neither great untouchable icons, nor are they flawed little humans. I suspect she did a great deal of balancing in her own emotions to come up with the portraits she painted because, in truth, we have three portraits here, all interconnected and somehow, ongoing. Not a superficial book."},{"Title":"With a Daughter's Eye: A Memoir of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson","review":"I enjoyed the careful description of two legendary lives observed by the author as a daughter and an anthropologist. As a piece of anthropological writing, a certain distance is maintained when the author tells of her memories of growing up with her parents and the relationship between them. Yet, I can still detect her sadness and love in the seemingly unemotional and impersonal writing style. Often, significant feelings are embedded in the scientific explaination of her parents' theories and ideas. I not only gained a better understanding of the field of anthropology, but also find the \\"differences\\" (such as different kinds of families, marriages, choices, ideas, personalities) that we encounter in life as descriped by the author enriching."},{"Title":"Italian Family Dining: Recipes, Menus, and Memories of Meals with a Great American Food Family","review":"The first thing that struck me about this book is how beautifully designed it is. It's quite substantial, a good size without being unweildy. It is printed on good-quality cream colored paper with dark green ink, and nearly every page features hand-drawn illustrations. However, the proof is in the recipes.The premise of this book is that \\"Italian meals are structured in a way that keeps family and friends at the table.\\" Italians sit down together to eat; a custom that is rapidly becoming obsolete in our busy American lifestyle. Viewed that way, cuisine because one of the most important ways to spend quality time with your family. The book is in itself a family affair, a father-daughter collaboration.Italians acknowledge that food tastes best when prepared with fresh, seasonal ingredients and to that end the book is structured around the four seasons, featuring recipes and menus for spring, summer, fall and winter. It also features special recipes and menus for the major holidays of each season. There are many other menus build around themes such as \\"A Quiet Fall Dinner,\\" \\"A Simple Summer Dinner for Company,\\" or \\"A Sexy Winter Dinner.\\"The recipes are fabulous, although I was challenged by many of the ingredients. A good many of the recipes called for ingredients I simply cannot get at my local supermarket, such as tripe, fresh morels, onion blossoms, cardoons, puntarelle or cranberry beans. Some of these things I have never even heard of before! However, adverturous palates with access to gourmet food stores and farmers' markets will delight in the recipes that will allow them to make use of the variety that is available to them. There were enough recipes that didn't call for more exotic ingredients that I didn't have any trouble putting this book to good use.

It features fresh seasonal vegetables, small but reasonably sized portions and only on special occasions a light desert. There's a lot of fish. Where oil is used, it's olive oil.

This is a story so much more than about the greedy 80's. As you are reading you are saying to yourself exactly what Wolfe saids seconds later, as if he is in your mind. Its about political correctness gone awry. And its so \\"New York City\\" and you have to live and work there to totally see how Wolfe is so accurate even 20 years later.Sadly now as you read this great novel, you think to the disaster of a movie. So altered and so miscast. And reading about the making of the movie, the same fictional pressures of politically correctness in the book hampered the actual movie. For example Morgan Freeman's a great actor but his character is totally different than the book. This is a movie that SHOULD BE RE-MADE.In any event The Bonefire of the Vanities is a MUST read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Beginning this novel, I knew its reputation and its basic plot, but right off I feared I would despise this novel because of the horrible things that Sherman McCoy puts his wife Judy and daughter Campbell through.This novel is really about characters, primarly McCoy and to a lesser degree Larry Kramer, the DA. Yet Wolfe also devotes large chunks to Peter Fallow, the tabloid drunk journalist, and Reverand Bacon, the scheming civil rights leader.As the novel opens, McCoy is a selfish louse who views himself as a Master of the Universe in his position as a bond salesman. He also is cheating on his wife and lusts after other moms at his daughter's bus stop. McCoy is a bad man. But circumstances take over and other people, acting realistically, (like Kramer the DA and Fallow the journalist) and in their own self-interests begin to do things that on the surface are right, but end up attacking McCoy's sheltered life.As the novel progresses, McCoy became a more sympathetic man. One reviewer said they felt cheated because McCoy never changed until the final 2 pages and it would have been much better if he had changed some during the course of the novel. But I think McCoy began to change the moment he spent a few hours in jail. At that time, he needed Judy to be with him and tried to reach out to her, but his behavior previously had kept her from being supportive of him. Campbell was also affected by McCoy but not permanently.In this character driven novel, there aren't good guys or bad guys, just normal people acting selfishly and predictably and these situations ultimately force Sherman Mccoy to realize what is important in life before it is too late."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable books that I've read. With great characters and descriptions, it is definetely a masterpiece.The characters in the novel are downright brilliant. Each has his or her flaws, and Wolfe shows those, but not with too much severity, instead showing that we are all equal in our flaws.The description in this book, though sometimes too much, too long, and repetitive, is generally very good and paints a beatiful picture of the scene in your mind.The plot is very involved, but not so much that it confuses you, and more than enough to keep you interested. The ending is very surprising and very riveting, and is a perfect ending to a already great book.Highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"'Bonfire of the Vanities' is a quintessential novel of the contemporary era not only for its literary craft, but also for its insight into the modern-day social system. Wolf accurately depicts this system on all fronts. The social interaction between economic classes, the growing problems (maybe even failure) of politics and justice as vehicles of freedom and democracy, and the powerful control of consumerism over us all are themes of the book underlying a story masterfully written from a number of the characters' perspectives. You start to feel the strengths and weaknesses of each character, realizing how human nature and illusions of grandeur make us all into people we never thought we'd become.Being a big Easton Ellis fan, I thought the descriptive writing in this book was far from excessive and only illustrated some of its themes of materialism. It's also probably one of the fastest (substantive) 700 pages I've ever read. Don't count on the film for anything but a good laugh.Regardless, you will be more enlightened after readiing this book."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe does a wonderful job of displaying true feelings and thoughts to the reader in this unique story of the true realities of life in New York City.One of the merits of the book is how easily you can relate to the characters, how truely real they are and how real they react to each situation is how many of us could see ourselves reacting to the same situation. He does this by having people deal with things that they think about only in their heads, but would never say out loud. Another merit of the book is the ability of the author to create a true essence of New York City and of the American way. At the beginning of the book the author descibes a situation taking place in the heart of New York City. \\"Half full! Half consumed!Somebody has just thrown a half-eaten jar of Hellman's mayonaise at him (the Mayor)!\\" The idea that the author has the object that is thrown be something so real something that we all know and all use, shows how American and how normal the author's ideas are so that the reader is able to relate.One weakness of the book is how nothing seems to ever turn out right. That is not real lfe and in that aspect the story is never very fulfilling until the end, when by the time you finally get there and after all the bad things you've gone through with the characters it doesn't quite seem like enough good to fulfill the reader with in the end. It lacks the aspect of true happiness in the reader, making you think that life is all full of bad things and there is no hope for the good in people. And by the time you finally reach the good, it is so unexpected and uncommon that you don't even eralize it is there. You have to go through a tremendous amount of pain and hatred and it doesn't seem the happiness is worth all the pain.Overall i think that the book was very long and had a lot of unecessary detail the reader could have lived without. I only suggest this book if you are willing to face your own mind and the thoughts that you keep inside. It is very prejudice and stereotypical, but tHat is what makes it as good as it is."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The first thing that struck me, after reading a synopsis of Bonfire, is that its impetus is similar to the climax of The Great Gatsby. Given this connection, we can look at these two novels in the context in which they are written. The Great Gatsby is considered by some to be &quot;the great American novel,&quot; trying to encapsulate a time in the country's history. Jay Gatsby creates a wealthy identity for himself, appearing out of nowhere to claim his love, Daisy. Vehicular manslaugther ends their love. Sherman McCoy, in contrast, is born wealthy. Vehicular manslaughter ends his fun, which I hesitate to call love. Lust is probably more appropriate. This is only the beginning of the novel, and we watch his entire downfall unfold. So the two main contrasting ideas are what Jay and Sherman's motivations are (love versus lust) and what the focus of their lives in the novels are (love versus downfall). These are important things to think about when reading these novels and considering what each author might be trying to say about the period they are writing in. I also want to comment briefly on a few reasons some readers really dislike this novel. First, none of the main characters are admirable. There is definetly no one to latch on to as a moral center. Don't read on in hope of finding someone, but do read on anyway. Second, the entire society we are viewing is corrupt. There is no way to place blame on any single person or group in the novel. Be careful while reading and I hope that at the end, you are satisfied that everyone is equally at fault. I don't think Wolfe intended for his novel to place blame."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Somehow I'd missed reading Bonfire of the Vanities back when it came out. Now I see why it's considered a modern classic. Wolfe's characters are richly drawn composites of how I picture the ultra rich Wall Street traders, contrasted with the whole other world of the South Bronx. Although I've never been there or done that, I can relate to these characters and the fascinating situation that unfolds when their world's collide. Sherman, his wife and mistress, assistant D.A. Kramer and all the rest are so consumed with lust for power and position that their fall from grace seems appropriate; after all, what does really matter in life? The preoccupation with wealth, status and the pretenses of success all come tumbling down. I look forward now to reading more Tom Wolfe; I see what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"So, I am finally reading this book by Tom Wolfe; my sister just highly recommended to me \\"The Electric Koolaid Acid Test\\", which I ordered at my library to read. Glad I found \\"Bonfire\\" on the shelf in the meantime, and to have finally started on Tom Wolfe. OMG, I am so glad I am finally reading this novel. It is beyond sophisticated and beyond hilarious (any author who makes me bust out laughing like a hyena anyway I know immediately is wonderful); what an indictment of so much of the culture and style of the '80's. Reading this novel, I think I am able to see so much (good) about the author - his culture, humor, intellect and thinking, just shining through this brilliant novel. Especially if you have grown up on the East Coast, you immediately get the style and sophistication of this writing (maybe somewhat similar too I think to the great detective writing of someone like Raymond Chandler (?). Anyway, I do not want this book to end, I am so entranced; I am LOVING Tom Wolfe!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Even though this was written 30 years ago, i still found it fascinating. As a Brit, i was amazed and aghast at the portrayal of the diifferent strata of NY society. i found the law process intriguing and the corruption, resentment, the 'favor' system, the deals, the violence, all interesting and valid. The plot is secondary to the process , but i did enjoy the fall from grace that Kramer and the accused man suffered. Of course, Bacon and the girl, the most corrupt 'won' T'was ever thus."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I am so glad to have read this important book. Truer now than when it was written. A harsh look in the mirror for us all."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I can understand how this book was such a milestone. True genius, in the journalistic style--for portraying so well the status and money-obsessed nature of New York, which still holds true today. Wolfe does a terrific, and I mean really terrific, job at describing the city's political climate and how easily people can be taken advantage of once power and money are thrown into the mix.Each character's intense need to better his or her own situation is at the center of how each of them relate to the story. In that, the story is essentially a description of how five New Yorkers cross paths and manage to further and better their personal situations, at the expense of a rich Wall Street trader's criminal mistake and inward feelings of guilt. Even though Sherman McCoy's character is portrayed as your typical snooty financial industry professional, the way in which he is brought down is dismaying in itself. He is used as a scapegoat for the ills of the White Establishment by a crooked, black political figure (using the hypocrisy of the church to better himself); used as &quot;the Great White Defendant&quot; by an insecure, self-critical assistant DA to make his career as a trial lawyer; used as centerpiece of a tabloid story to build a shallow, alcoholic reporter's journalist career; used to displace blame by a promiscuous, sleek money-hungry trophy wife... The Bonfire shows the lengths people will go to in order to get ahead and the lack of underlying trust for others, irregardless of money and status. The book is a lesson in city life, opportunism, greed, and a fundamental lesson in our very nature and how we operate, in the strict, economic sense of the term.In another vein, the plot takes some movie-like twists and turns that dont necessarily work well in writing. Overall, an amazing piece of work, but seems very well suited to the screen more than anything else...I still have to rent the movie!!! Overall, a gripping and very accurate rendition of the city lives we all dream of living."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"When entering the competitive, cut-throat professional world, where stories abound of the dorm-mate who just landed the six figure job at Goldman Sachs, \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" just may help you maintain the precious altruism that you grew up with.This book is honest. It's a story of how people become when they allow their ego to be defined by their over-compensation, and it's not pretty. 'Bonfire' is witty and human. Mr. Wolfe does a fantastic job of developing his characters into people you'll care about, and builds their stories until you'll just cringe over the situations they put themselves into. In the end you'll thank God you're not them."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"On the surface, the book is a satire of the puffed up 80s. The &quot;Vanities&quot; that are being blown up are all the pretensions that people put around themselves. Sherman McCoy is a man who would've exuded strength and power in a prior age. But is he a &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; bond trader (a term coined by Tom Wolfe, later to make it into the popular lexicon) or just another fluffed up product of society? Indeed, the book explores this question. You'll be surprised by the answer!Is it just a novel of the 80s? I disagree, for several reasons...- The greed of the 80s reappeared in the past 5 years.- If you look hard enough, one of the characters in the book is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.- The deep characters Wolfe creates ring true today.- New York again sees itself in a time of great change. Maybe there are lessons in this literature?Is it the Great American Novel? Who knows... But it can be read with &quot;A Man in Full&quot; to understand grit, determination and what does make America different."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Perhaps the thing that struck me most about this novel was the fact that even if it was a \\"period\\" piece of the 1980s, it was shockingly similar to the society of the turn of the 21st century, right before the tech-bubble burst. In 20 years, it amazes me how much--and at the same time how *little*--has really changed. One might almost expect Sherman McCoy to pull out a miniaturized cell phone to bid on some shares of Enron rather than the Giscard bonds he was involved with. I felt, reading this book for the first time in the 21st century, that it might as well be the society of today under Mr. Wolfe's satirical scrutiny.The racially, politically charged media circus surrounding his arrest is perhaps now an even more familiar phenomenon than it would have been in the 1980s--something to which we as a society are becoming increasingly numb to. As the situation grows, and spirals further out of control, Mr. Wolfe makes it increasingly harder on the reader to land squarely on one side or another--on one hand we have the unjust death of a promising Bronx student, and on the other, we have the case being used by various people trying to further their public careers. One even begins to feel sympathy for the calculating, womanizing Sherman McCoy as his perfectly ordered life comes completely unraveled. And then we as readers become repulsed by such feelings--which is truly the \\"right\\" feeling in a situation like this? There is no black or white here (yes, that remark is meant on many levels)--only a confusing, boundless field of grey. And that seems to be at the core of Mr. Wolfe's purpose in writing this...it is an unflinching look at a society that seems to verge upon the completely amoral.With regards to its \\"unflinching\\" nature, some readers may at first be put off by the extreme bluntness with which Mr. Wolfe tells his story. Epithets and \\"outdated\\" social and cultural attitudes abound, and Mr. Wolfe doesn't shy away from the harshest, ugliest possible terms for them. And this very bluntness is perhaps what makes The Bonfire of the Vanities so compelling to me as a reader. We live in a society that has smothered itself by political correctness--a society where despite seeming openness, the lines of communication are really quite tightly controlled by that strange convention. To see the veneer of civilization completely ripped away from the society of the 1980s (and, one might imagine, from the very society in which we live now) is at once a repulsive and refreshing experience-- this is perhaps one of the best modern novels I have ever read, fully deserving of its 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe's kinetic style of writing takes some getting used to. He piles words on top of words, images on top of images, flinging them all at the reader with a fastball pitch. The pitch, though, is well-thrown.Wolfe's subject is New York City during the 1980s. He touches as many groups as he can -- wealthy Upper East Side socialites, tabloid journalists, criminals and burnt-out agents of justice in the Bronx, cut-throat sleazy lawyers, unscrupulous Wall Street stockbrokers... No class of people escapes having its faults exposed in Wolfe's sharp, accurate prose.Wolfe is sociologist first, novelist second. He probes the psychology of all these disparate groups and finds a common denominator: selfishness. All people are out for themselves no matter who is destroyed along the way.At the same time he satirizes the dark side of the human experience, Wolfe makes it impossible to hate any of the characters. There is no true villain in this story. As readers, we are left with just the uncomfortable sensation of recognizing human nature's ugly parts.&quot;How much differently would you act in this situation?&quot; is Wolfe's implicit question. There are no easy answers."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"As my title states, a smart person doesn't make a great writer of fiction. Through reading this novel I saw that Wolfe a lot of interesting ideas and is a rather well-studied individual, but his execution in this novel his terrible. He repeatedly destroys the momentum of the story with excessive detail. I found that I could often times skip fifteen pages and not miss anything but more pointless rambling about things that add nothing to the story. For example, Wolfe would often give us the salary of a character, then list how much he spends a month for food, clothes, cars, etc. There is another point where he goes into a irrelevant discussion about Christopher Marlowe. I could picture Wolfe jumping up and down, shouting, \\"HEY, LOOK WHAT I KNOW! I CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT EARLY MODERN ENGLISH DRAMATISTS!!\\" Also, while I understand that this is a satire, the character development is poor and there is not a single individual that the reader can bring themselves to feel sorry for except for Henry Lamb and his mother. The rest of the time you feel like you are just reading about a bunch of selfish bigots. This could have been an engaging novel about the socio-political situation in New York City in the late 1980s. But instead it turned into a self-indulgent monstrosity.However, I would love to attend a lecture given by Wolfe. He seems like he would be an interesting person to listen to. But as a writer of fiction, he just doesn't cut it for me."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"\\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" by Tom WolfeNew York City, early 1980's; Sherman McCoy, a self proclaimed \\"Master of the universe\\" had it all. A loving family, a multi-million dollar Park Avenue apartment and he is the top producing bond salesman for a Wall Street firm which pays him 1 million dollars a year and more if he can close his latest deal. This wasn't enough for Sherman though; he needed, no, deserved more. He is a master of the universe after all. Sherman became involved in an extra marital affair which he deserved and after a wrong turn ends up on the wrong side of the law. Maybe Sherman isn't the Master of the universe he had initially believed...Bonfire made for a great read and Wolfe seems to have really captured the essence of that era. The characters be they the richest of the rich or barely able to afford their one bedroom apartment are all driven by their ego and Wolfe has captured this masterfully. Watching these characters and their rise or fall is what makes this story an interesting read.The Good: Wolfe writes great characters and throughout the story we see some of them go through a complete evolution. None of the characters garner much sympathy from the reader out of the gate but as the story goes on that changes dramatically and by the end you may even find yourself feeling sorry for some them. The lifestyles captured are fascinating if for no other reason that to see how the super wealthy flaunt their power and influence and how no matter how much you make you can still be tapped out.The Bad: The story does feel a little long winded at times but not to the point of ruination.Overall: Wolfe's ability to draw and evolve interesting characters is what makes this journey worth taking. If it sounds interesting then pick it up and give it a try."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Although I have enjoyed some of Tom Wolfe's early nonfiction work, Bonfire languished on my shelf, unread, for several years. For some reason, I had dry and boring in mind for this book, which turn out patently untrue.To the reader who expects a true picture of gritty life in a big city, or a real picture of relations between groups of people, as other reviewers have called this, look elsewhere! Bonfire is satire...it is exaggeration...it is a farce.Great truths, however, often lie in humor. Wolfe has created a world where the reader manages to despise just about every character. You may be at least indifferent to the cops, or Fitzgibbon, the assistant DA who still seems to have his head on straight, but these characters just provide enough temperance to remind you how you hate everyone else.Wolfe's use of the English language is something like Shakespeare meets tabloid journalist, and his verbiage never fails to trigger an emotion, or two, often laughter and anger or despair at the same time.I often found I could not put the book down, but unfortunately,it seemed at the moments of highest suspense, the wordiness begins to drag, slowing the pace to a crawl, when you'd most like to fly."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"In all 31 flavors of \\"Law and Order on TV, the NYPD and DA's office disposes of a case from the incident to the trial in an hour--sometimes two if it's a two-part episode. In \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" Tom Wolfe does the same thing in about 700 pages. That's because Wolfe brings to bear all the complexities of trying a case in the real world.In the mid-1980s, Sherman McCoy is a bond salesman at Pierce & Pierce, a self-described \\"Master of the Universe\\" with a three million-dollar apartment on Park Avenue, a wife who spends thousands on decorating it, a six-year-old daughter who attends a pricey private school, and a mistress named Maria Ruskin, who herself is wealthy from marrying a much-older man. One night Sherman goes to pick Maria up at the airport and their Mercedes Benz becomes lost on the seedy streets of the Bronx. They're approached by two black kids, and from there the \\"Master of the Universe\\" becomes an unwitting pawn of a black \\"reverend\\" hungry for publicity, a drunken British reporter hungry for a story, and a Bronx DA hungry for re-election. Because in the real world, cases aren't solved in an hour and \\"justice\\" is a game won or lost based on who can cheat the most and get away with it.Like an ancient Greek tragedy, McCoy has to pay for his hubris. So do some of the other characters, although others are seemingly rewarded for their bad behavior. This is certainly not a novel of white hats and black hats where the good guys triumph and the bad guys get their just reward. If you want that, you'd better stick to the TV.What Wolfe does so well with this book is to paint the \\"big picture\\" of New York City in the 1980s with its melting pot of Irish, Italians, Jews, blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Wasps. All of these rival factions collide with the McCoy case to depict not just the justice system, but society as a whole. It's an unflattering image to say the least, even viewed through the prism of satire. More importantly, the image of black against white and rich against poor is still applicable today in America's major cities. That makes Wolfe's book as relevant today as it was back in the \`80s.Wolfe's writing itself can get a little tedious and long-winded at times. There are so many nuances and complexities and tangents going on throughout the book. While these provide richness and depth, at some point it becomes overkill. The stuff about the mayor and the Episcopal Church was interesting, but not really necessary. As well there are...so many ellipses...and exclamation points! It can be a little irritating after 700 pages.Still, it's a relatively minor flaw in what is a great book that even at 700 pages shouldn't take too long to read because it's so funny and clever that it's hard to put down. I had previously read Wolfe's \\"Man in Full\\" that came out ten years after \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" and has many of the similar themes of race, class, and a rich man in legal peril, though it takes place in Atlanta instead of New York. I'd recommend that book as well.As for the 1990 movie of \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" it pretty much makes every critic's worst list, so I wouldn't recommend that. The movie does stick to at least most of the book's main points. In its defense, it would be impossible to depict all the subtleties and nuances of Wolfe's novel on the big screen. Trying to adapt it really was an impossible mission.That is all..."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"When I first read this book, I didn't like it. It did grow on me and in retrospect I saw it was some of the best satire done in decades. But I think the actual book itself is so heavy and so full of genuinely mercenary and dishonorable people that it makes you want to hold it at arm's length. This is a tough read, and it dwells in themes that by nature are not pleasant. What it DOES achieve is an ultra-realistic (and growing moreso by the year) illustration of how society really works."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I read about 100 books a year (not bragging, just a lot of time on my hands), this is the best book I have every read. Looking forward to reading &quot;A Man In Full&quot;, but I know I'll be disappointed, it just couldn't possibly live up to Bonfires."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"First: the book is brilliant. It has some echoes of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" but a much larger canvas. Though it is very long and has some overblown descriptions it is absolutely engrossing. The focus of the book is Sherman McCoy, whom I found quite fascinating. He starts off quite unlikeable due to being an amazingly smug, arrogant snob. Then slowly one starts looling beyond these points. He is human after all and not all that bad. And that is true of all the other characters too, none is wholly good or bad.In a book about great moral issues, Tom Wolfe describes in great detail his characters' concern about their appearance, their social success and their finances. But for most people these superficial things ARE major concerns in life which influence their actions and destiny.Some of the earlier reviews have made a very interesting point. The themes of the book will never date but the plot as written could not have been set in the year 2003. Technology and media has changed so much in the last 20 years.But as an Indian who has never visited America I am not able to judge many things. Is American society as unequal and divided as portrayed here? India certainly is, and if the story was transported here it would ring true. The poverty in India is so extreme and wide-spread that the comparatively well-off are almost forced to make a habit of \\"insulation\\".Also: I dont for a moment think that Tom Wolfe could be racist. But it shows what a gap there must be between the races in America in that all the characters whose minds he explores are white. Non-whites are shown from the outside only. Similarly women are shown from the outside only. I understand that a male author may feel unable to speak about a woman's feelings. But are black males and white males so different?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Critics of Bonfire of the Vanities often say that Wolfe's epic novel is not \\"literary\\" or \\"high brow\\" enough to go down in the literary canon. I can see where these reviewers are coming from, but that does not make this novel any less entertaining. The difference between Wolfe, as opposed to an author like Jonathan Franzen, is that Franzen's novels are reflective of the psyches and personalities that make up middle-America -- essentially, Franzen has something to say about our society. Wolfe, at least to me, is more focused on telling a good story.Not that there is anything wrong with that. While Wolfe perhaps has something to say about race and socioeconomic relations (essentially, that the rich folks on Wall Street kind of jerks and poor minorities on the street are not all that bad), Bonfire of the Vanities is more an exercise in style and pacing. It is a testament to Wolfe's structuring ability that a book this lengthy (my hardcover is over 600 pages) never feels too long-winded. This book will not change your life or the way you look at things -- it will, however, provide you with a few solid hours of great entertainment."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This is the first Tom Wolfe novel I've read, and I had a preconceived notion of southern literature along the lines of Styron or Faulkner. This novel is more Olivia Goldsmith than Carson McCullers, and I have to admit I loved it. Wolfe's detailed inner dialogues were addicting, and I followed each of the characters with varying degrees of sympathy, admiration or disgust, but never boredom. He describes the world of his story to such an exact amount of detail that I feel like I could now write a novel of New York in the '80's (or at least Tom Wolfe's version of it). I was hoping desperately for a neat and happy ending, and I was both pleasantly surprised and disappointed with the resolution. Quick, satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" was first published in 1987, but 16 years later it is still the best parody of the political and social scene in New York City. Combining his everyday, \\"fly-over country\\"-style conservatism with his keen wit, Wolfe lays out a story that sends characters crashing into one another from all socioeconomic levels across the Big Apple.Sherman McCoy, a stereotypical, ego-maniacal bond-trader, is Wolfe's typical protagonist. The main plot starts when McCoy and his mistress, Maria Ruskin, take a wrong turn returning from Kennedy airport one night, leaving them lost in a bad neighborhood in the Bronx. This is where they cross paths with Henry Lamb, a seemingly innocent kid stuck in a sad world, and Roland Auburn, a neighbor of Lamb's and local drug-dealing hoodlum. In their haste to escape from a neigborhood within their city but light years from anything they recognize, Sherman and Maria strike Lamb with their car, critically injuring him. Once a struggling NYC journalist learns of the story, it becomes a perfect case for the politicians, media, and attorneys to latch on to for their own selfish gain. From there the Lamb case blows up into an ordeal beyond anyone's control, but one that could only descend into such madness in New York.Wolfe's writing is funny, entertaining, and searing. Through his fictional characters, he presents the perfect condemnation of the ridiculous excesses found in some NYC political and social circles, with specific real-life examples coming naturally to any reader's mind."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"In retrospect, there is no better snapshot of New York City during the 1980's than THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES. This novel completely captures the energy, and even the euphoria, which crept into city life during a decade that now seems far removed.BONFIRE is an engrossing novel, interweaving all of the many aspects of city life, from the self-indulgences of the newly (very) rich to the struggles of the ghetto poor. Much like that proverbial first potato chip, once a reader gets a taste of this book, it is hard to stop reading until the final resolution. Wolfe writes a detailed and informative story in his typical lively style.Anyone who wants to remember New York City during the overheated 80's will find THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES to be a clear snapshot of that time and that place."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Not since The Great Gatsby has a work so completely defined an era with such brutal honesty. So revealing of the affectations of the period, the filming of this book for the big screen was banned in the Bronx, ironically giving proof to Wolfe's indictment of the liberal political machine of the 1980's. This is a classic &quot;must read&quot; and, as usual, the film doesn't come near to doing the book justice. If you haven't read Bonfire, you're not well read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe, an eloquent, if sometimes pessimistic, writer who deeply understands modern culture, wrote this massive, classic tale of greed, ambition and power. He casts the story of financier Sherman McCoy in the financial world of Wall Street, but includes the racial, political and economic issues of New York City in the early 1980s. Even 13 years after its publication date, this is still a gripping read. You can use this book as the starting point for reading about business culture from a fictionalized perspective. Or, you can combine it with Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker and The New New Thing, for insight from fact and fiction into the major episodes of greed and economic boom in the past 20 years. This undeclared trilogy examines the desire - not confined to Americans, though the books are U.S.-based - to achieve wealth at any cost. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book, all by itself, as a seminal volume in business fiction."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Wolfe is an amazing author. On a literary level this is one of the best books I've read. The dialogues in the book are marvelous while the writing itself creates some beautifully contrasting and yet similar characters. The book bleeds social and racial overtones that are devastatingly real and yet rarely put onto paper the way Wolfe has. The story is okay, but the lack of a hero left me detached from the whole thing. The book is worth reading however, if only to appreciate the bluntness and humanity in Wolfe's writting."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Deliciously skewers liberalism. Only a smug liberal couldn't understand or enjoy the fun."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe brilliantly depicts New York City, the justice system and the police force of NYC in his best work ever. But its frustrating hearing the demonstrations and accusations of racism. Wolfe also portrays the stupidity of political correctness and liberalism. Wolfe is one of the greatest American writers in history."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"From it's thrilling opening to its open-ended conclusion, this is a book you not only want to keep reading and reading but never forget about afterwards. All the characters - their wants, fears, ambitions, and failures - make them human and believable. Depraved though they may all be, they are too complex merely to be shrugged off as &quot;unlikable.&quot; What makes this book great is not only its wonderful and on-point observations of New York but also its brilliant little touches: &quot;The Masters of the Universe,&quot; the wonderful &quot;Hack hack hack hacking&quot; laughs, the hilarious tabloid headline &quot;Scalp Grandma, Then Rob Her&quot; and on and on and on. I predict that fifty years from now school kids will be reading this along with &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as one of the defining novels of the twentieth century. It is a fierce and uncompromising look at &quot;the way we live now&quot; and its greatness comes from the fact that it doesn't spare anyone. I could write a whole book about how good &quot;Bonfire&quot; is and surely this book exists on so many levels that years from now people will write multitudes about its numerous meanings. And so on. One question: what does &quot;Heh-heggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh&quot; mean?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"A refreshing change from perfect &quot;Grisham-esque&quot; heroes and endings. If you are interested in reading a novel about the true (albeit somewhat exaggerated) nature of the human condition in the 80s, read this book! Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I don't wish to make a proclamation that this is the &quot;best American book ever written,&quot; nor do I want to complain about an &quot;inadequate&quot; ending. All I can say about this book is that, from the first chapter's over-the-top description of the mayor's speech in Harlem, &quot;Bonfire&quot; consistently held my attention. (I'm sorry to say that I can't say the same about the more recent &quot;A man in Full.&quot;) The sheer unfortunate reality of Wolfe's writing is, as many will tell you, a precise color photograph taken then and there in 1987, complete with polarizing filter and an all-too-true vibrancy. It's the kind of book that might be depressing to read soon after its publication and yet evokes quite a few biting, almost nostalgic memories of those infamously coarse upwardly-mobile days of yore. And while I was a mere four years old when I myself was caught in the middle of that web of 58th-and-Sutton &quot;would you like to draw pictures in the Met, Samantha?&quot; Upward Mobility, this seems to accurately capture that era that I at the time failed to understand but am now sure existed just as Wolfe has said.And yet &quot;Bonfire&quot; is by no means historical fiction. Rather, our good friend Tom manages to do what I've always maintained a good satirist should do: Keep a perfect distance. Wolfe manages to edge close enough to his characters to dig into their minds and show us what's inside -- and yet he stays far enough away that he can poke fun and them with his usual slightly-supercilious air.This perfect distance of his seems to be what ensures a constantly entertaining read. Seldom do the often-lengthy descriptions bore the reader; such minor allusions as that to the &quot;tub and shower stall module -- module! -- a single molded unit that deflected slightly when he stepped into the tub&quot; remain startling real, making the abrupt ending not at all unsatisfying but rather entirely appropriate and understandable; with literature this interesting, why would one ask for a happy ending?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The 80's were a time where people thought they were indestructable. Including Sherman McCoy. A hotshot investment banker he has it all. A Beautiful 12 Room Apt in Central Park, An Adorable Six Year Old Daughter who attends an exclusive Private School and a Interior Decorator Wife. He also has a mistress on the other side of town named Maria who's much older husband is the driving force behind a multi-million dollar airplane empire and together they take the wrong exit in the wrong section of town and hit an innocent black man named Henry Lamb and then the chaos ensues. From Reverend Bacon's quest for showing how racist New York is to Peter Fallow's desire use the story to get to the big time, Sherman's world is turned upside down with some pretty frightening yet hilarious consequences. It also teaches us that no matter how good our life is, we can automatically lose it with the snap of the fingers as Sherman found out the hard way. Tom Wolfe is next to Jackie Collins and John Grisham the very few white authors who can do a black character down pat. A must read book for anyone who's enjoyed A Man In Full."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This is probably the best book I have ever read.

Great plot and believable characters...Tom Wolfe really gets you into their minds and their emotions. I really liked it from start to finish. And, like so many novels out today, it wasn't corny. It was very believable..even the way it ended with Shreman McCoy still dealing with his problems.My only criticism would be that sometimes Tom Wolfe gets into some LONG oratories or explanations which, often, I skipped over because they were tol laborious.On the other hand, I LOVED the social parties...Wolfe's description of the &quot;ha ha ha&quot; and the &quot;heh heh heh&quot; was really a good laugh.This is one of the very few books that I'll probably read again."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This book sums up New York and the criminal justice system. Don't waste your time on A Man in Full. Wolf lost the gift after Bonfire."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I've read this &amp; A Man in Full, and both have similiar endings. But where A Man in Full falls into an unbelieveable collapse, Bonfire of the Vanieties is an exhilarating rush. Reading Sherman's rebirth, I was overcome with energy. In Bonfire of the Vanities, none of the characters are likeable, all shallow and self-serving. Only through losing everything including his dignity does Sherman have a chance at redemption. And when that time comes, he has given up on himself, probably the worst act anyone could do. Yet we are left with his rebirth, a lean, mean fighting machine. Incredible."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I read &quot;A Man in Full&quot; before &quot;Bonfire&quot;. This book blows &quot;Man&quot; out of the water. It was very interesting and made me laugh out loud a number of times."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This book is a great achievement in portraying the life and prosperity of the 1980s. The story involves characters that are not bigger than life. Through reading the decline of Sherman McCoy, one comes along a strongly written novel. At times you come across some of the funniest writing in English. Tom Wolfe is a genius."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"A contemporary classic, detailing the social dynamics of the 80s. Perfect in every way, form, function and style, it was &quot;unputdownable&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I loved A Man in Full and Bonfire was equal to the task. The book read well and the Dickensian descriptions showed up but not enough to be put off by them. The ending lacked the completness that A Man in Full had, which was part of the idea behind Bonfire. It was an enjoyable read and I recommend it but again, the book does leave you hanging. Everything comes together in a stew of egos, desires and greed...but the stew just wore a lil thin for my own taste."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This is an excellent attack on the pompous attitudes posessed by the rather &quot;well off&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I am an English major, and THE BONFIRES OF THE VANITIES is one of the few books I have ever read which has caused me to laugh out loud. For this reason, I believe it belongs alongside Catch-22 and Breakfast of Champions as one of the funniest an most intelligent satires of the 20th century. I will admit that I laughed the most loudly at the obvious, although well-set-up punch lines. However, the real joy of reading this book is not the trip-and-fall jokes, but rather the wry, dry, witty, and acid-tongued descriptions, characterizations, and prose which Wolfe fills his pages with.Wolfe is a little bit pretensious, a little bit obnoxious, and very funny. It is not racist to make fun of blacks if you make fun of WASPs, Jews, the British, men, women, and just about every other possible demographic group known to man.A telling sign of a wildly overambitious novel is one who's ending has difficulty wrapping up the exploits of all of the main characters without feeling contrived or forced. Unfotuntaly, this is where THE BONFIRES OF THE VANITIES fails. But for over 600 pages, it is a knee-slapping, bellylaughing, observation-deck yawp of a novel, and a whale of a good read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I admired Bonfire more for the innovative uses of language than for his social incisiveness. I despise the knee-jerkers who deplore the 80's as a &quot;decade of greed&quot; and point to Wolfe's book as a banner example of that sentiment. Surely, any reader out there would jump at the chace to have the wealth, connections and opportunities that the main character, Sherman McCoy had? Wolfe neatly lays bare the foibles of members from all levels of society. No one is spared, but most people seemed to really enjoy the downfall of Sherman McCoy. I felt nothing but sympathy for the man, but then again I'm always a few steps short of being a pariah. I had an intriguing assignment in a college English class: a favorite book of yours has been banned in your community. Write a spirited defense of the book.

This book, however, changed my opinion of the latter.I wasn't too thrilled to have received this book as a gift; but, decided to give it a chance. I had trouble with the first few pages --looking back, I probably should have re-read them. Nonetheless, the following pages kept me reading hour after hour. Finally finishing the book 2-3 days later.I can truly say that --after getting through the first chapter-- I enjoyed reading &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities.&quot; I highly recommend this book. And, I thank Mr. Wolfe for being one of a short list of authors who brought me back to the love of reading I had enjoyed as a child."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I saw the bizarre trainwreck of a movie many moons ago and did not give much thought to reading the book. There are times I wonder at my own stupidity. It was only as the year 2001 dawned that I began smarten up. Why had I never read this book? Got me. Two my favorite books of recent vintage owed a debt to Wolfe (or mentioned him outright): Turn of the Century (Kurt Anderson) and Last Days of Disco (Whit Stillman). I figured maybe it was time to read the Master himself.I remember when Man in Full came out, it was as if George Washington himself had risen from the dead. Who was this guy? I consider myself quite well-educated, but it was time educate myself about Tom Wolfe. I bought the paperback.I just finished it. I'm sad because the book ended. I love anything about the '80s, but this book basically defined it. The style is priceless as are the characters. These characters, even the smaller ones, Abe Weiss, Miss Shelly Thomas, Arthur Ruskin among them, are fully formered. The book is a true masterpiece. I knew it was a satire, but came to really care about these characters, winners and losers all of them. When I took a step back I could see the brillance the names in this book, satirically speaking: The author Nunnally Voyd, the law firm Dunning, Sponget, and Leach. And on and on. Peter Fallow. I should stop here. Readers should find out these treasures on their own. The book is so great because it evokes a time not long ago yet now a memory. Wolfe brings it life again. It works at so many levels. Tragedy, farce, brillance... Don't be dumb like I was. Just go read it. You'll thank the true of Master of the Universe later."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"My one star review is for the General Books LLC version and relates to the low quality of the publication.

No where has the ego and greed of Wall Street in its heyday been so exposed along with all the conventions and pretenses of the newly rich and famous. Few readers will forget the opening page with &quot;Shuuuurmen&quot; blaring out. The characters are unforgettable and Woolf is an absolute genius at capturing detail in both his dialogue and description. One of my favorite all time novels. At once fun, and great literature."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This novel still reads well and remains topical after more than twenty-five years. Mr. Wolfe handles confrontations with great verve and wit - these are confrontations between very distinct groups of people - bankers, district attorneys, ghetto thugs, preachers, journalists, detectives... Mr. Wolfe also perpetuates tremendous momentum through-out this six hundred page book.His observations of society through these different class groups are astute. For instance the detectives are bewildered by the Park Avenue doorman dressed in their Napoleonic regalia rushing into the street to flag a taxi. It is beneath the dignity of upper Manhattan types to do such a lowly activity. He explodes the bubble surrounding each class type. Within the varied encounters Mr. Wolfe illustrates the isolation felt by his characters.His settings - especially the fortress courtroom in the Bronx are well depicted and felt. Mr. Wolfe tells us that the lawyers within the courtroom dare not venture into the surrounding neighborhoods - they even order in for coffee. The deli lunch euphoria at their desks with their plastic containers of ketchup, mustard, relish, mayonnaise... is a contrast with the Fifth Avenue soirees embellished by tables of elaborate floral arrangements.Perhaps the ending is a little too sudden and is somewhat inconclusive. And too some extent none of the characters are particularly likeable - they all seem out to get something - money, women, status. To some extent Mr. Wolfe adjusted his characters in his future novels to make them more appealing.In many ways this is a novel about class cultures meeting and confronting each other - and all this in a New York setting where all is within walking and subway proximity. Mr. Wolfe, as stated elsewhere, captures the \\"carnival of life\\" - New York style."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"In times of stress when authors are producing crap (yes, that is what many publisher's are putting out there with superb quotes that can not possibly be real) and calling their &#34;work&#34; writing! So far from the truth as to be outside the Milky Way galaxy. My favorite &#34;writer&#34; to call out for this is James Patterson. Tom Wolfe's work is indeed worthy of another go 'round if you do not care for the classics and if you do care for the classics as well. I have read Bonfire so many times that my hardcover has pages falling out. Downloading it to my Kindle was well worth it. Still fascinating and worth the time to read and savor every page. I've read all his books but there is something about our current political climate that makes Bonfire a very fitting read! If you've not read Mr. Wolfe before, may I suggest you start with this book. I doubt you will be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I found the characters complex and believable. Many of them are shallow or superficial but that is the point - they are materialistic. This is not the same as saying that the characters were flat, one-dimensional, or undeveloped. The dialogue was well-written and conversational. This was the easiest 500+ page book I have ever read.The book was insightful too for its criticism of the legal system and the materialism that pervades our culture. I was a child in the 80's so that time is largely removed from my memory. I've also been to New York only once. I still connected easily with the plot and characters. To see critical reviews complaining about issues such as these is sad. If you can't read a book about a place you've never been or an era before your time then you're missing the point of reading.It wasn't long after I read this that the George Zimmerman - Trayvon Martin tragedy occurred and the fictional events depicted in this book served as an important reminder that I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Does that mean I think George Zimmer is innocent? It means I don't know and I don't think we'll ever know, regardless of what the legal system decides.Without wanting to spoil anything in the book, I honestly found the journalist Peter Fallow the most despicable character in the book. Reverend Bacon was about as vile. None of the characters were really likable and many were deplorable but I think this added to realism of the story. In real life people are usually not very likable; just as in the book, I find most people to be self-serving jerks.I also appreciated how the story unfolded from the vantage points of multiple characters. Each character had his own piece of the story and his or her own cliff hanger moments. The plot was artfully crafted so that no character's actions would spoil the cliff hanger where we left off with another character. That takes skill and care as a writer.This was a fun book to read with several insightful moments that, for me at least, spurred critical thinking about our legal system and culture. What more would you want from a book?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Conspicuous consumption, shoulder padded-blazers, a roaring bond market, and other hallmarks of 80's culture seem dated enough today to be comical, and The Bonfire of the Vanities is very much a novel of its time. So what's to recommend this portly tome to readers 25 years later? Some of the same traits that mark all great fiction, yet which are particular strengths of Wolfe's: a keen ear for dialect, an almost discomfitingly keen understanding of human nature, and finally, descriptive bon mots that cast the world anew while also giving a \\"Yes! That's _exactly_ how it is!\\" satisfaction.While the cultural trappings of mid-80's New York no longer apply, everything that makes this book move still feels bracingly current: the thrill and lust for power, journalism's drive for The Story, political machinations, the grimy real-world operations of the law, Society etiquette, racial tensions, and those errors in judgement upon which fates turn. The book is a colorful, vivid illustration of how the issues may change, but people stay the same.For the writer, there is much to relish in Wolfe's rich vocabulary and continually inventive turns of phrase. I found myself thinking of the old writers' adage \\"Show, don't tell,\\" and then thinking \\"But if you can do it this well, tell away!\\" The witticisms are too many to quote, yet too delicious to omit entirely. Speaking of an office building, Wolfe writes \\". . . a glass tower that rose up sixty stories from out of the gloomy groin of Wall Street.\\" Discussing a hung-over character who's attempting not to remember last night's follies, he says \\"Whatever he had done was submerged like a monster at the bottom of a cold dark lake.\\" In a trendy restaurant we hear the \\"aerobic voices of the young and swell,\\" and at a socialite party we envision \\"Two men and an impeccably emaciated woman.\\" There's a lot more where that came from, but I'll let you discover them for yourself."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe's books always impress me, and The Bonfire of the Vanities is definitely one of his best works, studying American culture and human behavior through the lens of a criminal trial in New York City.Sherman McCoy is the main character of the book, but the book also follows the Bronx assistant District Attorney and a newspaper reporter, whose fates intertwine with Sherman's after he is entrenched in the court case. Interestingly, the only true protagonists in the book, the Lamb family, are the only ones who do not get much time on the page beyond the initial accident. They become mere pawns in a much bigger game of egos, where justice is served (or not served) only based on personal gain or loss. The true fate of the Lamb family is hardly relevant to anyone.Wolfe brilliantly weaves an engaging story, and his prose are crystal clear and entertaining. The plot is enjoyable on the surface level, but the ramifications of everyone's actions will leave a reader thinking for days following the conclusion of this book. I definitely recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"There are a huge number of typos that are very distracting and frustrating. As stated by other reviewers, multiple words in a row are smushed together and there are random symbols floating around the pages. I recommend going to a used books store or something similar to get the book, because this version is not worth the money."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"For decades I have been told I should read Bonfire, and I don't know why it took me more than twenty years to get around to it. I lived in New York City throughout the 1980's (when I was in my twenties) and worked for both a Wall Street law firm and the District Attorney's Office, so the settings are very familiar, and I'm a Tom Wolfe fan, having read The Right Stuff and A Man in Full long ago. Wolfe is in top form here, and his cynical, microscope's-eye view through the dozens of individual set pieces is amazing. This book is a fabulous achievement. Long as the book was, I couldn't get enough of it, and there is no doubt that this fiction contains a lot of truth. So why only four stars? Well, its \\"truthiness\\" (a phrase coined by Stephen Colbert that Tom Wolfe undoubtedly wishes he had come up with) is part of the problem, particularly with the African-American and female characters. While the caricatures of black and female real-world actors (a thinly-veiled Al Sharpton, a real-estate-agent-I-have-known) are spot on, Wolfe nowhere conveys the essential humanity of either group: blacks are \\"the mob\\"--ignorant, manipulable, and dangerous, even if the victim of circumstance; women are shallow, defined completely by their sexual attractiveness and utterly dependent on the men. Bad enough on its own, what makes this particularly problematic is that the \\"truthiness\\" of the work as a whole risks leaving these bogus stereotypes in the reader's mind as true as well. It's all the worse because the book is so good. (Also, only four stars because of the abrupt ending; in A Man in Full Wolfe carries his vision of masculinity and heroism through a remarkably similar story, but completes his vision with more of the resurrection of his \\"hero\\")."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This is a great book about a prominent Wall Street financier who has the misfortune of becoming a political football after he is involved in a hit and run accident on a black youth in the Bronx. Wolfe once again captures all of his characters perfectly - all the idiosyncracies are there. How do I know this? Because we see ourselves in these characters. We think many of the same thoughts and only when reading Wolfe do we say, \\"yeah, that's how I am too\\" which may be a humbling experience.While an interesting plot in its own right, Bonfire of the Vanities is also a piercing commentary on race relations, class relations, and human relations. Wolfe has an uncanny way of getting into each characters head and the reader cannot help but empathize with each one.This is Wolfe's first fictional work and widely considered his best fiction (of only three though). I have also read I Am Charlotte Simmons and I would argue that Bonfire is not quite as good as Wolfe's novel about a small town girl in prestigious university. Since I have never been to New York City etc I could not connect quite as well with the characters as I could in Charlotte Simmons which was an eerily accurate portrayal of collegiate life."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This book really draws you in. The plot is intriguing, the pacing is flawless, and there are a great many insightful observations about society to be found between the pages. Too bad they did such an atrocious job with the film adaption."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe captures the essence of big-city racial and class conflict, plus greed, ambition, and self-serving hypocrites. His story concerns high-living banker Sherman McCoy, whose accidental exit from the New York freeway into the crime-plagued South Bronx leads to his mistress running over a young black man (who may have been looking to rob McCoy). Enter a questionable black leader, an unscrupulous vote-seeking district attorney, and a sleazy tabloid reporter, each of whom seeks to manipulate and play off events for their own aggrandizement. The story has few admirable characters at any level, not in the Park Avenue mansions, the courts, nor the tough streets. Equally lacking are social codes of decency and honesty. The story covers New York in the mid-1980's but one senses it applies today as well.Wolfe provides a powerful tale, one with some parallels to the Tawana Brawley hoax that occurred not long after this book arrived. The book drags a bit in a couple places (thus four stars and not five), but Wolfe provides a powerful message."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Regarded by some as the essential literary representation of 1980s America, \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" was written during the economic boom and urban crime waves of that decade and published almost as the stock market crashed in 1987. It follows the lives of a group of characters who express New York City's ethnic, socio-economic, and political rivalries through their involvement in a highly-publicized case of hit-and-run. A car belonging to Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue, one of Wall Street's most successful bond brokers, accidentally strikes a young black man in the Bronx. With the injured man in a coma, Harlem preacher, politician, and general rabble-rouser Rev. Reginald Bacon sees an opportunity to advance his agenda -by delivering the racially charged case to ambitious District Attorney Abe Weiss and to unscrupulous tabloid journalist Peter Fallow. Prosecutor Lawrence Kramer jumps at the opportunity to bring down a wealthy WASP in the name of equality. And streetwise Irish lawyer Tommy Killian may be McCoy's only ally in a city where truth and justice take a back seat to just about everything.\\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\"' flaw is ironically the source of its strength. The book is over 600 pages long. It follows too many characters and spends a lot of time describing the world from their point of view. The book's insights rely on its many perspectives, but at the same time, the descriptions are cumbersome. Tom Wolfe generally does not cast his characters in sympathetic light. His willingness to call it how they see it draws the reader into the story out of an almost perverse curiosity. The blunt talk and peek inside the worlds of city politics, tabloid journalism, criminal law, and Park Avenue lifestyles keep us interested. The story is found in the self-serving hostilities and interdependencies of New York's many factions more than it is in the sequence of events. And it's all thoroughly plausible, sadly."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I was put off this book for quite some time because of having seen the film, but, finally decided to give it a go (despite having a paperbackl edition with the film characters on the cover...) This book is an example of what a meticulous, fearless and talented writer of prose can come up with in response to the world around him. While being a great 'page-turner' as far as plot goes, Wolfe manages, through a complex web of ironies and double ironies, to examine humanity as a social creature in a certain time and place. He deals so breath-takingly honestly with his characters that many readers might blanche, and want to point fingers at the author, something Wolfe is couragous enough to bear, obviously. He does not set himself up as a prophet - like many modern 'social-awareness' authors - and I am sure does not absolve himself from many of the 'vanities' that are examined in this book. He tries to be honest, deal honestly with his characters and, thus, his readers, which is perhaps so strange in this literary day and age that it is considered reactionary. It is not. It is a novelist. I will certainly be reading more Wolfe, who has now become my favourite living American author."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Bonfire of the Vanities was the first Tom Wolfe novel I read, not knowing anything about the author, and I was not disappointed! Had I known the book was about an upper class investment banker in the eighties who runs down some black kid in the Bronx I would have never picked it up but once I started reading it the little plotline blurb seemed so insufficient to describe it.This book seems to have a real talent for spelunking into the darker unseemly depths of human society but at the same time you're staring at the pages half horrified you're also sucked further into the story trying to figure out the whys. I don't think I've ever read a book with a main character as unlikable as this one but at the same time there are moments when you're sitting back thinking how sad it all is, or smiling at some little trifling piece of humanity that shows through. All the characters are keenly humanized. Nothing is held back, and I believe that's the key to this book's success. It catches not only the great human struggle but also the great societal struggle as well with wondrous complexity.I'm in the process of reading this book the second time and I must say you do get something new out of each little scene the second time around. I really enjoyed this book for not only showing the negatives of the human experience but also little tinges of the positives in various poignant scenes."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"As certain legal cases continue to generate huge headlines with everybody fighting for their camera close-ups, it shows that \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" will never become irrelevant.The novel is an extremely fun read that eviscerates the New York of the 80s, as well as managing to stay relevant in contemporary times. Wolfe's novel peers through the windows of all the social strata to meld an infuriating tale of people pretending to look out for the greater good but only engaging in vicious self-preservation. There aren't many characters in the book whom I found especially likeable and some who I found palatable at first ended up disappointing me. Every twist in the story made things even more unpredictable right up to the epilogue, which I found to be a bit of a let down but a realistic one. My only real question at the end of the story was the subplot about the $350,000 that the Reverend Bacon couldn't account for; Wolfe seemed to drop the ball on that and I wanted to see where it would end up.This story was originally serialized in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine (!) in 1984-85 but by the time it saw print as a complete novel, it had changed quite a bit. Sherman McCoy was a writer in the serial, and was a Wall Street financier in the novel. Wolfe tapped into the temper of the times with that canny switch, and makes the putpouring of anger and resentment against McCoy that much more timely."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Many will remember the movie made of this.

Its success was cataclysmic and was due in part to its perfection in timing. It hit at the very moment when the self anointed \\"Masters of the Universe\\" were becoming exposed to the general public and the materialistic and hedonistic culture of the eighties was becoming transformed. (At the time we didn't realize it would be a trade of the Culture of Greed for the Ravenous Orgy of Greed in the nineties.)This book offered wonderful phrases such as Social X-Rays, Lemon Tart, and so many more that you will be amazed when you re-read it or read the book for the first time. It has a fascinating story that weaves together the cultures of privilege (for there are many) and the dregs of misery. Each and every character is presented as someone with his or her own delusions of self, hypocrisies, and contradictory motivations.Now, this is not a novel in the sense of Thomas Mann or any other psychological writer. This is a novel of social reporting that continues to stand the test of time and you will gain from reading it several times. However, do NOT under any circumstances think that the movie made with the same title as this book in any way represents the wonderful things these pages contain. The movie is a complete botch while the book remains a treasure."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Hands down one of the most enteratining novels that I have ever read, and definitely the best rendering of modern New York City in fiction!

I read a review of the book below and am wondering it it contained too much information and might have spoiled the ending, because right now I'm only halfway through the book. So far, the sense I get is that there are no good guys or bad guys, but there is right and wrong and each character spends time flirting with both sides. Sherman McCoy is a man who has all the trappings of success but his little empire is threatening to crumble becasue of his mounting debt, his affairs, and oh ya, a little hit and run accident that he should have reported to the police but didn't. McCoy, as a character, doesn't have many redeeming qualities. However, as political and cultural forces slowly unite to turn against him, I find myself rooting for him to stand up for all that is bad in society: the tabloid press, the Jesse Jackson/Al Sharpton types that don't really care about the truth and the district attorneys looking for politcal gain.Wolfe covers every aspect of this hit run, from its innocent beginnings to the outlandish policical case that it will turn into. Now 2/3rds of the way book, it seems Wolfe holds none of the characters in too much regard. Everyone from the victim, the accuser, the lawyers and the press are pandering to their weakest traits. I think that's where the title of the book comes from. What happens when you throw a bunch of people looking out only for themselves into one volitile situation. You get this book.Having now finished the book, I see why it is considered a classic. Wolfe tells a great story. Sherman McCoy is a bad man, motivated by money and seduced by younger women. But when he gets involved in the accident, he slowly begins to change. He is almost forced to change because all the other people involved in his life are worse than he is. Yet they aren't behaving badly. Wolfe just portrays these people for who they are. Kramer is the district attorney who seizes the case against McCoy as a way to make a better life for himself. He does what anyone else in the situation would do. Reverend Bacon is typical of the race mongering civil rights activistis who put themselves above those they supposedly serve. Peter Fallow is a journalist who would be nuts to refuse to cover a story that is given to him.I recommend this book because it points what can happen when selfishness overtakes people's lives. And it is an entertaining story that shows what happens when liberal politicians put their own success ahead of the truth."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe is a great writer. He uses language beautifully, develops characters extremely well, and creates good drama. I would, however, say that he is a better essayist than novelist and I would recommend The Right Stuff or The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test over this book because they are more focussed and he keeps his story together better in them. With that said though, I would highly recommend Bonfire of the Vanities. Wolfe describes the socialites, lowlifes, politicians, reporters, and other various characters who populate the New York scene and all of their particular vanities in great detail. They are believable, whether they are likable or not is really besides the point, and they come to life with their authentic dialogue and charater flaws. It is a satirical book written by a very observant author, so even those who have not been exposed to this culture is able to become caught up in it and find themselves fascinated by the whole scene. I would recommend this book to anyone who like social critiques, interesting characters, good writing, and a fast paced story."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The frank story delivered by Wolfe has a powerful message that rings true in today's society, it was just a little long - 700 pages (I often found my self sifting through meaningless paragraphs). Sherman McCoy, who is a rich Wallstreet aristocrat, runs over a Bronx city hoodlum after being threatened. It is a commentary of 1980s society, and can be extended into the present time. Materialism, egotism, hypocrisy...even the middle-class assistant D.A., Kramer, is subject to these human flaws as he uses the case for personal gain and glory, as does the DA in his re-election. McCoy sums up a major point in the book in saying to his lawyer, &quot;Your self -- I don't know how to explain it, but if, God forbid, anything like this ever happens to you, you'll know what I mean. Your self...is other people, all the people you're tied to, and it's only a thread.&quot; Of course, if this thread is cut, like it is for McCoy, what becomes of that &quot;self?&quot; Wolfe's story becomes a Greek tragedy on the major flaw of humans -- finding their identity in people, possessions, and power."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"A perfect attack on the pompous attitudes possessed by the rather &quot;well off&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I read this book. It is least boring of the two Tom Wolfe books I have read. Perhaps I will read it again some day."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"... this book has all the trappings of class while never surrendering its large-scale consumer appeal as \\"fiction.\\" BOTV has several dimensions - on one level, it's a satirical look at the dog-eat-dog world of upper-crust 1980s NYC, where power, greed and rabid statusmongering are the rule. Even if you just stay on that level, Bonfire is a great read - alternately very funny and sobering, though the prevailing dismal view of human nature may depress you.On another level, BOTV has something to say about American society, human nature and, I think, the nature of desires themselves. Even the most hard-nosed conservative will wince at Wolfe's unrelentingly cynical view of black \\"civil rights leaders\\" who invariably turn out to be corrupt (interestingly, BOTV has not a single positive black character - unless you count Lamb, who's dead). And even liberals like me cringe at his description of made-for-TV \\"mass demonstrations\\" orchestrated by know-nothing urbanites.Political sensibilities aside however, BOTV shows that even those who seem one-dimensionally \\"bad\\" to their antagonists often have at least a glimmer of decency. It's also a poignant commentary on what desires are real and which ones are products of the lives we lead; the hope for love versus the longing for exotic and dapper clothes, for instance. If you wanna think about it, this book can do us all a lot of good.... and heck, if you don't, it's still a good way to kill some time."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I was born &amp; raised in New York and lived there until 1987. This book perfectly captures the culture &amp; attitudes of the city, its shrill power politics and opportunism and hypocrisy.Wolfe has called this a &quot;social novel,&quot; a once popular form, now less so.The social novel is sociological, as opposed to psychological. It paints with a broad brush. Its &quot;main character&quot; is an entire city, or profession, or period in history (rather than the psychological novel's narrow focus on a single individual's inner thoughts &amp; feelings).This book is funny and truthful. And despite its thickness, a quick read, because it's also an exciting page-turner."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Not the world's best writer. Tends to beat things to death.

It gives agood characterization of the many types of people that you will find in New York City. You have the Wall Street types,you have a black activist,you have society ladies. The book stays bogged bogged down in this routine tom the point of being nearly boring.It becomes difficult to read after a point. I have read no more Tom Wolfe books after I read this one.Find this one in a used book store."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Buddhism has a term &quot;samsara&quot; which means the practice of grasping - for material things, fame, sex, etc. If it dominates your life it leads to severe disappointment at worst or an empty feeling at best. You just can't get a sense of yourself.And that is the tragedy of &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;. Sherman doesn't have a sense of himself after losing the fruits of his samsara - money, home, respect, family. He redefines himself as a defendant in the legal system. But is that adequate?And you can say the same thing about every character in the novel. Even the lawyer Kilian who seems to fare pretty well still isn't completely happy - he can't build his dream house.After reading this brilliant novel, you can't help but think about the &quot;meaning of life&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The much-celebrated novel is a fairly unique one in the landscape of literature. Its 700+ pages and style are, as explicitly stated by Wolfe in the intro, an attempt to return to the grander realism works of the past. He specifically mentions Anna Karenina as the great example of the novel that portrays a cross section of a whole society. Only this is rarely done today, so what we have is one of the only major cross-sections of New York in the 80's.However, this is a cross-section that is viciously sliced from the meaty flesh of New York society, leaving it gaping, bleeding and exposed, all in a highly satirical and humorous way.The main story revolves around a high-powered broker and his mistress who are involved in a hit-and-run accident which leaves a young, black &quot;youth&quot; from the Bronx in a coma. The scandal sweeps the city as an epitomy of the racial, economic and cultural differences (and inequalities), as a mob builds up around the case. In terms of the actual plot, there's nothing complicated, rather, its the eye into the eschelons of high, middle and poor society New-York-style that makes this entertaining and enjoyable.Wolfe exposes the massive slab of hypocrisy present in the society, from the DA who has idealistic tirades about his job (when it's really a vehicle for his extra-marital and political ambitions) to the British journalist who thumbs his nose down on all things American (while scurrying for his next free meal and alcoholic binge).As mentioned by many reviewers, there's nothing essentially new in the book - as Wolfe said, some of it feels like it's been ripped from the headlines, but in reality much of it is art imitating life. What I liked about the book is its message of vanity and indulgence, and how quickly those superficial bubbles can be burst in a crisis to *make* a person &quot;ordinary&quot; again. True to an almost century-old tradition in books, there are no real heroes here. But still, despite all the horrible things the main character has done, I found myself feeling sorry for him and somewhat admiring him by the end.Other complaints have been the superficial role of women in the book, but again, I think that's simply an extension of the superficiality of a section of society that spends more on a painting frame than a cop earns in 6 months.Overall, a great book that speaks without being preachy and has a lot of very funny moments."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This is probably *the* book of the 1980s - it explores the fragile, false world of Wall Street and Manhattan society with witty, cruel glee.A one-off freak accident lands Sherman McCoy in a world of trouble. McCoy switches from a life of unquestioned privilege and superiority, to fear and questioning when the facts and evidence come together to point the finger at him for a hit and run.Wolfe shows his brilliance as a writer with this book - his characters manage to be embodiments of stereotypes and complicated individuals at the same time. The reader feels sorry for un-likable characters. Little details build up - for example the male characters preening and deporting themselves in ways they think make them look strong, powerful and handsome, only when we are given another point of view we see that they just look silly and vain - the vanities of this book are many and varied (Savonarola, he of the original bonfire of the vanities, would probably be happy with the comeuppances this book provides).Ultimately, this book is a modern classic because it manages to successfully combine all the elements - explorations of society, equality and motivation that still manages to be a great story; sparkling and witty prose that is never really flippant. It is a book that makes you think and manages to entertain at the same time.It took me a long time to track down a copy of this book, but it was worth it - Sherman McCoy, his friends (so called), adversaries, and everyone in between, make a fascinating morality tale with a moral that manages to be blindingly clear and ambiguous at the same time."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe has a magical touch for breathing life into non-fiction, as in The Right Stuff, but in Bonfire of the Vanities, his skill as a novelist and a satirist is blatantly evident. This bleak and witty portrayal of New York life in the eighties is both hilarious and dark at the same time. Wolfe's characters represent the spectrum of human behavior, while his situations are riddled with ironies and paradoxes of truth about human existence. This book is most enjoyable, I would imagine, if you have at least some knowlege of New York, because much of its humor and depth stems from New York culture, but it is also true that New york is a micrchosm of american existence on a whole, so Bonfire of the Vanities may, in fact, be a universally American Novel. Whichever, it is worth reading if not only for the reason that it is funny, brilliantly written, and makes clear the fact that Tom Wolf's name belongs on the list of satirists that includes Jonathon Swift and Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Bonfire of the Vanities is one of the great page turners of the last half of the 20th century. Wolfe combines comedy with scathing social commentary, as a blue blooded Wall Streeter takes the wrong exit off the highway and two cultures collide with tragi-comic results. It was impossible to put this book down, even though it is quite lengthy. The beleaguered Bronx judge, the girlfriend, the Harlem reverend who thrives on playing the race card for his own greater glory and the slimy reporter are just some of the characters who ring true.For those who saw the movie, don't let that turn you off. The whole premise was changed and it was a typical Hollywood bastardization. Wolfe tried a similar sweep of the cultural landscape in &quot;A Man In Full&quot; but lost his way halfway through that book. There are no wrong notes in Bonfire; it's a snapshot of New York politcally and culturally in the late 80's, and it's amazing how little has changed in today's world."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"One often hears people describe this book as &quot;the definitive novel of the Eighties,&quot; and I expected it to seem as much when I began reading it in 2002. What I found was that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, much like &quot;A Man In Full,&quot; which I read immediately afterwards, this novel is simply about Americans. But unlike other popular American writers (e.g., Tom Clancy), Wolfe treats his characters as human beings with flaws, and no more control over their own destinies than the vast majority of the people of the rest of the world. I think what Wolfe is ultimately getting at is the &quot;arbitrariness of fate.&quot; Americans, as the last products of Western civilization, are conditioned largely to believe that if they only do certain things a certain way in life and make themselves believe in this way of doing things, they can exercise control over their futures. As such, Americans more than any other people tend to live &quot;in the future.&quot; Yet, as Wolfe so eloquently shows, myriad different unforeseen things can happen in anyone's life, including an American's, that can almost instantly shatter the illusions built up over a lifetime -- illusions that often lead Americans into complacency about themselves and the world. It is quite extraordinary the way Wolfe develops stories and characters. He is unusual in the sense that in his books, the &quot;good guys&quot; don't always win and the &quot;bad guys&quot; often come out on top. You simply can never predict what will happen, and that makes the stories so much more compelling and engaging. You feel like you are living within the &quot;real life&quot; of a given character when you are reading about him/her. I look forward to many more brilliant reads courtesy of Tom Wolfe."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The Bonfire of the Vanities, is an overwhelming insane story, but yet it has such a devout social commentary correctness to it, that to ignore it would be unjust.Wolfe creates an amazing story line, which throughout the whole book is very consistent, but yet at the same time drifting. Every character in the book is given their own personality, problems, and mini-story line, in essence their own book. As the story moves along everyone is pulled together in the overriding story line but yet again they stay consistent to their own stories. You end up watching every individual character play their own role and you ge tot know them more than it seems necessary, although in the end you realize why you needed so much detail.Not only does Wolfe provide lavishly entertaining characters, but also a strong commentary by the master himself. Every word printed in the book is a reflection on how Wolfe views the world, and the types of people we really are. Although never having visited New York myself, Wolfe creates more than realistic picture of how he and the rest of the world view New York. The rich vs. the poor or the black vs. the white. Everyone is placed in one group or the other whether they like it or even fit into it...Wolfe's commentary and vivid use of racist terms at times becomes hard to bare and understand. Although with out it, it would be just a simple book, never a bestseller. It is exactly this type of language that makes the book more than an interesting read, but also an insightful and provocative journey through the mind of Tom Wolfe and the world he sees."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This not only happens to be my favorite Tom Wolfe book, but my favorite book period. The plot is exciting and realistic. Readers will relate with every single character depicted here. And no one matches Wolfe's descriptive capabilities. What the rest of us would need a million words to say, Wolfe manages to express with a few key and very visual phrases. So far, there isn't a book I've enjoyed more."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Yes, this is a very good book. I was completely absorbed by it, but I didn't find it &quot;entertaining&quot; or funny, as most of the other reviewers seem to do. It's full of a dark sort of humor, but this didn't make me laugh very often. Most of the characters are as large as life and very &quot;real&quot; and that makes the story even more painful to read. After all, practically everything in this book goes terribly wrong, almost all the characters fail to realize their ideals, fail to transcend their own mediocrity and fail to live up to their own moral standards. They all leave a trail of victims in their wake. It's a sad story, really, which paints a very gloomy picture of modern society, a society whose members have such a hard time finding some meaning in what they do and what happens to them. The much criticized ending effectively deepens the pessimism, since it offers us a glimpse into the future: a tunnel without a glimmer of light at the end. I often asked myself if Mr. Wolfe sees any hope for us."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"One of the most important novels of the 1980s Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" gives us a very realistic portrayal of New York during that period.But realism, tinged by Wolfe's own outrageous characters, and his relentless satire. While there may be nice things to say about both, Wolfe needs to realize that sometimes, saying little is the best way forward.And yet,Wolfe fails to make a statement with the book. The reason he is not ranked with Swift as satirist is specially because of this. Swift had a vision, a way he wanted the world to be, and besides, he was far more imaginative than Wolfe could ever hope to be. Wolfe's satire is limited by his reportial aspirations; Swift went so much further and took his to an artistic, and almost prophetic level.And finally, Wolfe isn't even the best satirist in America. John Updike offers far more power in the last of his \\"Rabbit\\" novels, and does so as he provides other things.But as a novel, the book falls flat. The badly overdone characters work well when used for satire alone, but are too shallow and clunky to sustain a story as long as this one. Characters so one dimensional that they serve as excellent entertainment, but not if we are to gain any real pleasure out of the book. And the constant emphasis given things, as he did in his second novel, makes teh novel that much less appealing. Thomas Pynchon resorts to outrageous characterization too, but notice how skilfully that is done, how that feels like the magnification of a real person's feelings. Tom Wolfe, the other Thomas, can't do that, or will not do that.The best part of the book was the end, the only part that felt inspired and original. When everything is taken away from him and how he reacts, that was the only part of the book in which Sherman McCoy shows a side of him that's different from what he did before. You wish the whole book had been this taut and unpredictable."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I cannot believe that it has actually been over a decade since I read Tom Wolfe's THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES; it is a brilliant and hilarious entertaining work of satirical fiction, and a dead-on accurate social commentary of everything that made up the 1980's, commonly (and accurately) known as The Greed Decade. This includes the incendiary racial conflagrations that had been simmering throughout the 1970's that finally began to unravel during the 80's, aided and abetted by an increasingly sensationalist media that practiced underhanded &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics in order to keep the middle and working classes down by improperly (and sneakily) shifting the discussion from class to race.Wolfe captures all that here, albeit in a lighter tone, by following four separate tracks concurrently, and how they all come together: Financially successful but amoral and philandering nouveau-riche bond trader Sherman McCoy, professional successful but financially wanting assistant prosecutor Lawrence Kramer, professionally unsuccessful and perpetually inebriated British-born tabloid 'journalist' Peter Fallow, and socially powerful (but under-respected) self-proclaimed African-American leader Reverend Reginald Bacon. The bonfire that their vanities create is fascinating; but what is best about this book is the insightful and real-to-life humor/social commentary that Wolfe weaves into the story throughout. If you're a relatively young reader who was born in the 80's and thusly do not remember it the way that, let's say, those of us born in 1967 do, then the reading of this book is absolutely essential to understanding all the different dysfunctional facets that made the 1980's the way it was.Do not be put off by the story's length (705 pages); it is so enjoyable and is such a compulsive page-turner that it is likely that it will only take you a week or less to get through it all. Pick this one up and treat yourself to the hilarious world of THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES---and if you must, rent the 1990 Brian De Palma-directed misfire and see just how totally inept Hollywood was in capturing this world. THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES has earned its proper place one of the greatest---and most important---works of fiction in the 20th Century.MOST RECOMMENDED; AGES 17 &amp; UP"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Great Book.

Richly drawn with a well-developed plot line and memorable characters (and caricatures), this is a book that should stand the test of time.What I enjoyed most about this book was how well the scenes, settings and characters were drawn by Wolfe. He has a gift for capturing the essence of a time and place...something he does quite well in \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" for different sides of New York City in the 1980s.This is a great and memorable book."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Has anyone else noticed that in just about any movie made in the last 10 years, whenever there is a bookshelf in the background a paperback copy of BOTV is on the shelf? Why is this? Are there that many copies in used book stores that prop masters have no choice but to select it, or was some contract signed that would ensure that it got more movie shelf time than any other book? Granted it's a wonderful book, but that doesn't fully explain the phenomenon. Just something to think about."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe provides a very realistic look into life. Wolfe's style of writing is very refreshing: colloquial speech and dialogue make the characters very easy to relate to. Sherman McCoy is not your average blue-collar worker, and he may even spur jealousy and anger from readers. But it becomes difficult not to emphathize with him through his struggles and in the end. Wolfe also provides impeccable description of emotions and feelings, even something as simple as a hangover: &quot;The telephone blasted Peter Fallow awake inside an egg with the shell peeled away and only the the membranous sac holding it intact. Ah! The membranous sac was his head, and the right side of his head was on the pillow, and the yolk was as heavy as mercury, and it rolled like mercury, and it was pressing down on his right temple and his right eye and his right ear. If he tried to get up to answer the telephone, the yolk, the mercury, the poisoned mass, would shift and roll and rupture the sac, and his brains would fall out. (p.164)&quot;However, the arrangement of the chapters and different stories is very fragmented; there doesn't seem to be any organization other than, of course, a loose chronological unfolding of events. It is not difficult to keep track of what's going on, but it becomes very frustrating when attempting to try to tie every chapter or section to the others.Overall, this book is decent, but there may be a few major downfalls that will prevent everyone from enjoying it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"First off, let me say that this book really held my interest and I enjoyed it (I gave it four stars, didn't I?).Perhaps, though, I should not have read &quot;A Man in Full&quot; first. There are so many similarities between the two books that I found myself thinking that Wolfe re-wrote &quot;Bonfire&quot; to make &quot;Man,&quot; yet based it in Atlanta instead of New York.Let's see...both books had racial tensions, both concerned lawyers that only looked out for their own interests, both had a strong main character that eventually fell in the end, both involved a lot (and I do mean a lot) of spouse-cheating, both had political figures that were determined to get re-elected at any cost, both had characters that were oh-so-concerned with thrusting out their mighty muscles to impress the women...etc. etc. etc.A previous reviewer stated that she didn't understand why people did not like the protagonist, Sherman McCoy. Let's see...hmmm...he cheats on his wife, repeatedly...he's a jerk to his fellow co-workers...he has no thought to what the consequences of his actions could do to his young daughter...in short, he generally thinks with the, er, &quot;contents&quot; of his pants. Granted, Wolfe writes in such a way that you do feel sorry for Sherman at the end, but I think it's important to remember that if he hadn't been cheating on his wife with Maria, then he never would have hit anyone with his car and the whole situation would have been avoided (although granted that would have made for a much less interesting book).All in all, though, even if &quot;Man&quot; and &quot;Bonfire&quot; are similar, one cannot overlook the original genious of &quot;Bonfire.&quot; Wolfe's descriptives of different types of people (the &quot;Pimp Roll,&quot; for God's sake, to describe how someone walked) and the vicious observations he makes on society and its shortcomings (and believe me, no one is exempt, not even authors) aid in the creation of an intricately woven piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"New York, The Brits, the Yanks, Racism, Politics, Institutions, Money and People go all mixed up in this great book, so great that is a classic.

The novel is one of the best I've read in my life. The author has expertly developed a chain of ordinary events into a gripping tale.

It is dead-on social commentary and far closer to the truth than any piece of non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I have been a Tom Wolfe fan for over two decades but continue to think that his real talent is for the essay and not for long fiction. Like Mailer, he seems to be able to string words together with unnerring skill but has trouble sustaining a tight narrative. Mostly, for me, what kept this book from coming alive was my dislike for the main characters. I just didn't care what happened to them. Rather, nothing could be bad enough. This is pure prejudice on my part, but I can't get past it. I hate these folks - their lifestyle, their values, their friends, their work, their entire social world - and I really don't want to read about them. Certainly not read this many pages. Couldn't he have punctured the hero's little life in half the number of pages and not left the reader so numb?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"...but I easily could have. Bleah. Dull and racist. I am not much of a Tom Wolfe fan at this point, having read and been bored by both &quot;A Man in Full&quot; and &quot;Bonfire.&quot; I admit laughing at and being impressed by the vivid characterizations--the prose and powerful description does keep you going, but the plot definitely does not."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe's reputation as a good writer is one of those things that escapes me, rather like the appeal of figure-skating and the music of Dean Friedman. His fans claim him for a dazzlingly witty writer and an inventor of a whole new style of journalism - which style seems to me to be a pathological delusion that we are more interested in him than in what he writes about. His book on architecture is farcically shallow, and his major contribution to 20th century prose style seems to be the introduction of multiple exclamation marks to signify when he's being funny.So, no, I don't like him. Skip to the last paragraph if you feel you've heard enough of my opinion. The Bonfire of the Vanities was a major publishing event, as it was Wolfe's first venture into fiction; he had claimed for years that contemporary fiction writers had abandoned the idea that fiction had anything to say about the real world, ignoring the fact that a really _good_ novel like Pynchon's &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; is chock-full of information about military technology, the complicity of America in colluding with Nazi science (hiring the borderline war criminal Werner von Braun to work on the space program, for example) and historical examples of genocide. Hence, he turned out this galumphing &quot;satire&quot; in which a yuppie is prosecuted for knocking down a black man in his car. Wow. Like, daring. Bret Easton Ellis' &quot;American Psycho&quot; was a far more visceral registration of 80s greed than Wolfe had the nerve to dream up. The best thing about this book is that it gave rise to a very bad but far more entertaining movie.You may be interested to know that National Alliance, an extreme right-wing group devoted to raising the consciousness of the white race, list this book on their website as recommended reading, along with &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and the works of Alfred Rosenberg. You can even buy it from their online bookshop (National Vanguard Books). I'm sure Mr. Wolfe would not be happy to learn this, but if he were a better writer they wouldn't have found so much in his work to admire. Just thought it was worth pointing out."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Bonfire may be the worst book I've attempted to read in the last five years. I say &quot;attempted&quot; because I finally became so disgusted with the thought of wasting another second of my life reading this wretched book, that I at last put it down for good.To be fair, Mr. Wolfe has an excellent grasp of the 1980's in New York, and from my own experience his descriptions of bond salesmen are pointedly accurate (allowing for slight artistic hyperbole). Unfortunately, his characters so totally fail to captivate any sypathy/interest/buy-in on the part of the reader, that I when I would pick up the book to read a chapter or two, I found myself questioning my own judgement....&quot;Why?&quot; Some may say that the shallowness of the characters is exactly what Mr. Wolfe intended -- a perfect fit for the terribly cliche view of the 80's as the decade of materialism. I believe that line of reasoning is just a poor excuse for bad character development. I feel no sympathy, distain or otherwise care at all about any of the characters or what happens to them. The only emotion cultivated by this text is one of disappointment that I bothered to read most of it.Bonfire stands as the only novel I've started and never finished. I came to a point where I decided it was better to cut my losses and ditch the book rather than invest any more time in it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This book was a painfully unbalanced story to read because of the ridiculousness of the story. I rate it two stars because the author at least kept me going to see how it comes out in the end.Mostly it is a statement of the author's perspective of rich Wall Street, the poor Bronx, the sad shape of New York's criminal justice system [obviously pre-Rudy G.] and everyone else who sees life only as a game. Every character is either abusive of the power they have, or jealous because they have none. The only redeeming and real character in this book was detective Martin [and perhaps that is only because the author didn't have time to poke fun at him too... or maybe he did and I didn't get it.].The author tries to make a hero out of a drunk, two-bit reporter. He was actually nothing more than a pawn used by others to minipulate public opinion. The main character, Sherman, is a successful, high-powered Wall Street bonds trader. One would expect him to have more intellegence. Sherman makes a lot of unbelievably stupid mistakes in his personal life that are impossibly contrary to his successful professional life. We are supposed to believe that he can read into the minds of the international bonds &quot;crowd&quot;, predict market futures, and minipulate complicated billion dollar deals, but is manipulated by a sexy gold-digger just because of her Southern charm?Oh, yes, there was one other believable character in this book - Sherman's 6-year-old daughter, Campbell. Poor thing... her parents love her, but are so weak, she will never grow up normal.I admit, I didn't realize this was supposed to be a satire until I read the reviews on this site. Had I known, I never would have bought the book. There is no one in the book a reader can (or would want to) identify with or feel sorry for. Well, maybe Henry Lamb - but we never really know him."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"But it falls flat in the 90's. I grew up in NYC during the 80's and I remember the fear and the bizarre crimes that took place then so I understood the climate that the book was written in but Tom Wolfe just dragged everything out to the point that I had to simply skim it to get through it.I know many people loved this book but I really felt it was dated and the writing was bland."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Perhaps I expected too much after hearing so many good things about this book. But I found it one of the most dull works of fiction I've ever read. I admit that Wolfe does has a prescient insight into the 80's greed mentality. But the writing and his use of language is sophomoric at best. This is one &quot;best-seller&quot; that clearly plays to a mass audience, but completely will be forgotten with time."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"A poor disjointed sketch of New York.This book came to me with great recommendation.Terrible disappointment.Characters not developed fully but left up in midair.Lots of cliches.Describes Bronx like an out of towner from Utah or somewhere,typical white reaction to black abodes.If police story is what you want, read Joseph Wambaugh.Honest stories, not grandiose cocktails of Bond Millionaires and Attornies.For cynicism and society parties, watch Woody Allen.No one person ,not even Tom Wolf can sketch a true picture of New York.He has seen the tail of the elephant,the other blind men have seen the rest.New york is too big for writers to do justice."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I have not bothered to read the last 100 pages of this book because the firtst 450 are just filled with self-serving, hypocritical, lying ogres. Everyone is either living a lie, milking the system, or worse. If you want to read about a corrupt world, where idealism is dead, pickup this book and read away."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The book was defective. chapters repeated themselves or were skipped all together. Evidently there was something wrong with the printing of the book."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I re-read this book just recently and loved it even more the sedcond time. Bonfire of the Vanities is a marvelous achievement: By turns, it doubles you over with laughter, causes you to pause and linger over a sublimely-written paragraph and shocks you into confronting the realities of our modern day institutions. The language is not for the faint-hearted -- beware. But as social satire and commentary, you're likely to find few equals."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"An amazing romp through 1980s New York, Wall Street, the court system, and the lives of the rich and aspiring to be rich. Through the downfall of wall street trader Sherman McCoy, Wolfe brings the reader into the psyches of his characters, forcing one to sympathize with even the most despicable. In the process, he helps us to understand humanity. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Pivotal in the characterization of this book is the accuracy in which every thought, action and even accent is described. The author leaves absolutely no margin for your imagination to alter the experience of the story. This is why you are living the satirical story of Mr. Wolfe portraying New York by its essentials: power, racial issues and money. That's all there is to it.Sherman McCoy, whom you are given ample opportunity to hate, but really cannot hate completely, finds out that life is extremely fragile when you have everything everybody else wants. One misstep, or in his case one wrong turn in his pricey Mercedes, shows him literally and figuratively a more colorful New York than he has ever seen. Being terrified even on the 'safest' streets of New York, the Bronx appears before him like the nightmare he never had, accompanied by his mistress with the southern accent, Maria. Trying desperately to return to safe Manhattan, he is involved in a hit-and-run which is the start of a series of events that change his entire world. The mighty must fall, as seen from the Bronx. Justice must be done, seen from the assistant DA (who in fact has other motives). Headlines must scream, as seen from the press. All want a piece of McCoy, all want power, all want money.Everybody who reads this book cannot deny finding many truths in it, about America, about wealth and about life all intertwined in an exiting story. Herein we find the strength of storytelling of Tom Wolfe. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This book, written in the 1980s about New York of the early- to mid-1980s, while not fresh, is certainly not irrelevant. Most of the character types are clearly recognizable as extant forces in the city and the nation.The plot of the book is nothing remarkable per se. It takes a while to materialize and is mildly interesting, but nothing about it is especially clever. A bad, dumb, white guy -- rich and insensitive of course -- is screwing around on his wife with a golddigger. Through circumstances beyond his control he is involved in a seemingly minor incident that balloons up and takes over his life, making it, and him, into something very different, (and, we presume, better) than it, and he, was before. Along the way, some good guys pop up, some bad guys pop up, and some guys you thought were good but turn out to be bad pop up.Wolfe does a good job in getting into his characters' minds and letting us in on what they're thinking and feeling along the way. Wolfe's writing gets in the way of the story, however. He is overly descriptive of the surroundings to the point that one soon tires it -- at least I did. It came to the point that I skipped over entire paragraphs devoted to descriptions of furniture and wall hangings.Some of the more memorable parts of the book involve the parties the rich white guy and his wife attend, with hilarious, almost Vonnegut-like descriptions of the attendees' laughs. Wolfe also does his readers a service for a look inside the fourth estate. To those of us who think the news media have a particular axe to grind it is enlightening to see them cast as mere grubbers, each after his or her own moment of fame. (A phrase from another book -- The Martian Race by Gregory Benford -- comes to mind -- \\"the snout of the media pig had worked its way under the tent...\\")It is amusing to think that many of the events so central to the plot are now meaningless due to technology - cell and satellite phones, the Internet and cable news, and the widespread availability of credit cards, to name a few. All in all though, this is not a bad book. It is overly long and tedious in spots, but it's worth reading if for no other reason than it provides a look back into the marvelous '80s, and a reminder that human nature never changes."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"When you filter out all the noise (ethnic conflict, unbrideled wealth &amp; priviledge, Wall Street greed, extramaritial affairs, etc), this book is really a simple tale of human sacrifice. The main character (Sherman McCoy) is deliberately sacrificed by the powers that be (the NYC political establishment). This sacrifice is a means of achieving &quot;steam control&quot; by staging a sideshow to placate the &quot;righteously angry&quot; minority groups threatening to rise up and topple the status quo. Even so, its a fascinating story. Especially interesting is McCoy's transformation from a spoiled, arrogant Master of the Universe to a scrappy fighter whose only goal is survivial. Wolfe is obviously trying to tell us something about our future with this tale, but I'm not quite sure what."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"As I first began reading the book several years ago, I thought it was quite intriguing and well-done. As the book went on however, I realized none of the characters were three-dimensional. The situations in which they were placed could certainly happen, but the complexity of character doesn't equal the plot structure. It was worth reading, but it's not something I'll ever return to."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe creates the characters, situations, plot and prose to make even the weathered reader gasp.After reading A Man In Full, this book was again a triumph of the emotions, thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I can't help but be amused at the irony of how this satirical masterpiece, among whose targets is the ridiculous overpoliticization of our age, tends to be viewed by its admirers and detractors alike through ideological blinders. Some view it as an attack on the &quot;Decade Of Greed,&quot; as if that basic human frailty could be confined to a single period of time. Some see it as a jeremaid against liberalism, as if the more asinine PC platitudes of the Left somehow discredit the entire liberal enterprise. Some view it as a repudiation of the wealthy, although Wolfe shows in agonizing detail that greed, lust, envy, ruthless ambition and pathological self-absorption can be found on all the rungs of the socioeconomic ladder. Others think it's strictly about New York, and in one sense they're right; but most of the foibles depicted in &quot;Bonfire&quot; can be found in Anyburg, U.S.A. Others grouse that the characters are too morally ambiguous: McCoy is too much an admixture of hero, villain, and victim for them to know how to respond to him. And where's the happy ending?Look, the whole point of good satire is to shed light on the more pathetic aspects of the human condition, not to grind specific social, cultural, or political axes or to prescribe panaceas. What &quot;Bonfire,&quot; like all good satire, does is force us to confront the demons in our own hearts and minds and reexamine our motivations and actions. Wolfe's book has something to offend (and challenge) everyone: rich folks, poor folks, blacks, whites, Jews, Christians, agnostics, New Yorkers, non-New Yorkers, liberals, conservatives, politicians, journalists, lawyers, cops, crooks, bums, husbands, wives. This novel transcends time, place, and ideology. It's one for the ages."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tantalizingly fascinating, The Bonfire of the Vanities is a deeply detailed and yet enthralling account of the entwining ways in which the forces of opportunistic politics, ugly racism, greedy Wall Street, gullible public sentiments, sinister profit motive and compelling lust interacted in New York City of 1980's. It is an outstanding work of fiction so vividly depicted and so richly crafted that you might feel yourself in the middle of action. The author's creativity with words and ideas while narrating very plausible events and developments adds remarkable color and candor to the plot. Phrases such as \`laboratory of human relations', \`big breasted eyes', and \\"master of universe', are so apt in their effect that you find yourself longing for more.At the script level, The Bonfire of the Vanities is a tragedy of a Wall Street bonds trader whose sheer misfortune causes his downfall though he does not endear himself to the readers by his philandering and vain ways that he feels he is entitled too. It also is the tragedy of an unfortunate black boy who gets killed for no fault of his, of a spouse whose only fault is that she has aged the best way she could and a 6 year old girls who \`loses' her father to bizarre sequences of New York life. At a broader plane though, The Bonfire of the Vanities is the tragedy of the \`Greatest City on the Planet', a city that has scaled every possible height and yet whose inhabitants have not overcome even the very basic vices that plague the human race. Powered by the avarice for lust, weaved around the gluttony for pride, fired by the envy of the have not's and the wrath of the racially deprived, New York is tortured by the sloth of conscience. Rarely has this tragedy been better depicted than in this landmark novel."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Although I never lived in NYC, and know little about the markets, I knew the characters Wolfe has created. The most dispicable character in my humble opinion, are the two politicians, and the character of the Rev Al Shapton, who is a quasi politician. Wolfe candidly describes the problems of the courts, the justice system and we the people with all our faults and blemishes.As Clarence Darrow once said about his two thrill killer clients,\\"even rich people are entitled to a defense.\\" I do not find Sherman as a hateful character. Perhaps because I do not find fault with someone who makes a lot more than I, or someone who is unfaithfull. The only flaw I find is my failure to understand how some one is \\"master of the universe\\" can turn into the mush Wolfe makes of him. There were a few moments when Sherman shows his \\"manhood\\". But most of the time, he seems a quivering mass of tepidity. (if there is such a word.)This novel was written before the incident at Duke, where the local DA, for political purposes, tries to convict the Duke La Crosse team. The real villians of the criminal justice system are no longer the Bull Conners of the past, but the elected DA's other public officials, and yes, the minorities who blindly follow people who are not their saviors, but self promoters. I think Wolfe was brave enough to write this story keeping political correctness out of his work. Wolfe has described our society with the shades drawn up. The novel reminds me of thelong running TV series,which somehow managed to be a comedy. I think it was sucessful because it showed everyone's pretensions, faults, and contradictions of personalities and groups.Nobody, from parents, gays, and all ethnic groups were treated equally.Compared to most of the trash that is written today, this novel is probably going to last beyond our generation. It is an accurate description of our times. The language uses 4 letter words accurately, as used in life, not for the sake of foul language, or sex to spice a story with sophomoric writing, for sophomoric readers, and publishers who promote and encourage writers to produce trash, instead of art.If you are looking for a book with a hero, don't read this. There are few real hero's in real life, and there are none to be found here. In the end, perhaps Sherman, becomes a hero because he apparently learns something he didn't know when the novel begins. Finding knowledge in a pile of poop is something most people never learn."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I found the book enjoyable once I got over Wolfe's promiscuous use of exclamation points. I found the characters to be jerks, but aren't we all."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe really caught the \\"mood\\" of society when this book came out. After re-reading, the book is as \\"on the money\\" today as it was when written. Buy it and read it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"New York City in the Big '80s is the backdrop, lead actor, and punchline of this fantastic, sprawling, richly detailed and realized debut novel by famous New Journalist Tom Wolfe.\\"Punchline,\\" you might ask? Well, consider that the book was published just before a bond seller named Michael Milken galvanized the city with his sordid and high-profile arrest and just before a New York State schoolgirl named Tawana Brawley dropped a racially-explosive bombshell regarding her apparent victimhood at the hands of whites. In the book the bond salesman is named Sherman McCoy; the \\"victimized\\" student is named Henry Lamb. You kind of get the feeling Wolfe here was trying out something called \\"New New Journalism\\", i. e. reporting on the story before it even happens.Beyond its headline-stealing, the book is a rich stew of dramatic juxtaposition, political and social commentary, characterization and caricature, all boiled in the broth of a New York Wolfe toiled in for years and had researched at length for this novel. At times it reminds you of that famous New York-based TV series that came after, \\"Law & Order,\\" with its in-depth examination of what goes on in a Bronx courthouse as a DA and his minions examine the Lamb case and what to do with it. At other times it reminds you of that other '90s TV series set in the city, \\"Seinfeld,\\" with its amusement at people's baser selves and its development of an insular lingo. As he strides among Manhattan's upper-crust set, McCoy sees women as either older \\"social x-rays\\" or younger \\"lemon tarts;\\" partiers ask for sparkling water, not Perrier; and interior designers shudder at the memory of mirror overuse, a. k. a. \\"Mirror Indigestion.\\"Most famously, Sherman styles himself a \\"Master of the Universe,\\" the phrase that stuck with people most here. Sherman's hubris is the source of much of \\"Bonfire's\\" first-half satire; his downfall and discovery of a certain dignity provides \\"Bonfire's\\" second-half uplift.\\"Bonfire\\" doesn't focus solely on McCoy. There's a prosecutor named Kramer who shares his boss's longing for finding someone known as the \\"Great White Defendant,\\" a big-name criminal suspect who isn't black and poor. There's also Peter Fallow, an alcoholic reporter who finds his feet covering the Lamb case for the sensationalist New York Post, em, I mean City Light.Floating around the edges of the story are other characters whose minds we never get to enter. One, Reverend Bacon, is a black minister and pressure-group leader who steals money from a white upper-crust church and waves off their complaints, telling them he's their \\"prudent broker...who can control the steam\\" of the inner city. He's the one who works up the people when McCoy's case comes to trial. Bacon's resemblance to one Al Sharpton may or may not be incidental: Sharpton was another real-life character who didn't raise his profile to a national level until after \\"Bonfire's\\" publication. Wolfe isn't afraid to push racial buttons, or skewer targets of varied ethnicities, to make his points about the baseline dysfunction dogging NYC.The book doesn't always work at the same high level. Kramer starts out a pretty interesting character before devolves into a one-dimensional horndog, while Fallow's comic inability to grasp basic American culture seems strained. There's a speech in the middle of the book by a novelist dying of AIDS who references Edgar Allen Poe's \\"Masque Of The Red Death\\" (Poe Towers is also the name of the housing project where Lamb is from) in a way that feels like Wolfe straining for the kind of literary affect he captures elsewhere in stride.The book scores so often you ignore the off-notes like you would a weak pun in Shakespeare. In McCoy, Wolfe creates a wonderfully perverse yet strangely sympathetic figure. You will hate him in the beginning, yet as he is pulled and twisted by the system that fed him for so long, you begin to care, and recognize in him something of a common humanity. I think it's this element that gives the book a hidden depth that stays with you after the laughs fade.For me, \\"Bonfire\\" is a richly rewarding reading experience, married to its time in a wonderfully redolent way yet not limited by it in terms of message. It's not like the kind of greed McCoy embodied went away with Ronald Reagan, Culture Club, and big hair, or that color-blindness now reigns supreme. I think mirrors may even be making a comeback. \\"Bonfire\\" is not only a laugh-getter and a reader roller-coaster; its social commentary remains sharp as ever."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe doesn't hold back on punctuation and it made me feel like he was next to me telling me this story. I also listened to a bit of it on audio and it was really good too.The book is about class issues in New York. Masters of the Universe versus ghetto kids. Great read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I have seen so many passing references to Tom Wolfe's first novel, Bonfire of the Vanities, as a modern classic, that I thought I should finally read it (I never saw the movie either); yet, I was worried that, in the 24 years since its publication, it might have become dated and irrelevant. I had no need to worry. The New York City and Wall Street of the 1980s has not changed much and with the focus of the 2008 great recession as a new point of reference, Bonfire of the Vanities has an immediacy that belies the passing of a quarter of a century. The characters and the situations related in the novel are contemporary, and above all, the book tells a very, very good, indeed exciting, story. It is easy to predict that Bonfire of the Vanities will remain in print indefinitely and will continue to be read by readers like me, who value good and pleasurable writing, centered around plausible and relevant plots. I now plan to watch the 1990 movie adaptation starring Tom Hanks."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Read or re-read this page-turner, novel of the complex ethnic and social structure of New York City, before the Wall Street bubble, and the reader becomes enthralled with the storyline.

It all blows up when one of the black guys turns out to be severely injured and the press, police and the mayor get involved in political issues involving race and class.

Let it be stated that I love fiction set in New York and the 1980's is a fascinating decade worthy of examination (and post-rationalization). The interlocking story is so well known now that I will not reprise it in this review. Suffice it to say that this is a tale of greed, morality, ego, \\"classes\\", and lost values.

I actually wonder whether this book would be printed today. Heaven knows, it isn't politically correct. Except for the hating white men, particularly wealthy white men, part.

So many elements of the 1980's are captured in this book, but the greatest feature is ego unchecked. From the opening scene where the mayor gets hit by a half-eaten jar of mayonnaise and all he could think of was, \\"who would bring a half-eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public rally,\\" to lawyers vainly feeling their muscles in the \\"tricep-ich,\\" this book pulsates with the blood of the 80's. Sherman McCoy - a WASP junk bond salesman, accidentally hits a black youth that was talked into trying to rob him in the Bronx. The narration is omnipresent which makes this book the power that it is. Wolfe acts as if God Almighty is writing this book and passing judgment all along the route. He has plenty of material to work with as the cast grows with each page. The ending is characteristic of Wolfe's work and the 80's.

TW at his very best. After re-reading it, I am puttin git on my Christmas list for some unsuspecting neices and nephews who have likely not read it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"It may take readers few chapters to acclimate themselves to the breakneck pace of The Bonfire of the Vanities, but the time is an investments that pays off in a wonderful, entertaining tale of an era that not too long ago provoked intense social discussion. Thomas Wolff's best seller evokes a period where New York City tried to crawl out of the fiscal doldrums of the mid to late 1970s. The Federal Reserve Board decided in 1979 to stop defending interest rates, which led to unprecedented trading in the bond market. Price was inversely related to interest rates, and firms that could price bonds properly in a time of fluctuating interest rates could make big money. Some of these professionals earned enormous amounts of money. This veneer of gold beside a decaying city provided the backdrop for Wolff's tale.The urban decay of the 1950s became an epidemic in the 1960s, then a fact of life in the 1970s. Cities may not have gotten worse in the 1970s, but its symptoms were more prevalent. New York City defaulted on some municipal bonds in 1975. It had a massive power outage in 1977, and Howard Cosell announced during a post-season game that the Bronx was burning due to a fire visible from Yankee Stadium. Though New York City has never been one to dwell on its historical sights, the seventies saw unprecedented dilapidation in Grant's Tomb and other landmarks. Most subway cars were plastered with graffiti.Within the city, small enclaves of wealth took foothold in areas such as Park Avenue and the Upper East Side. The Upper West Side had transformed from the area that Saul Bellow wrote about in the late 1950s to another yuppie haven. These residents still had many of the fears of the rest of the city that its former residents, who fled to the suburbs and elsewhere, wished to escape - particularly when they were not traveling in familiar areas. Sherman McCoy and Maria Ruskin exhibited those fears when they took a wrong turn off the Triboro bridge and ended up, probably, following the Bruckner expressway to somewhere in the Hunts Point neighborhood.The silence of the victim, Henry Lamb, is contrasted by the boisterous protests of Reverend Reginald Bacon, a character that Wolff merely borrowed from the Reverend Al Sharpton. Sharpton wasn't well-known during the setting of Bonfire of the Vanities, but he began to make a name for himself with his racially polarized stances on isolated cases of urban misunderstanding in the mid-1980s. Sharpton fed into sales of Wolff's book in 1987 when the reverend accepted the story of Tawana Brawley, and launched a furious campaign against the district attorneys of Westchester County for covering-up a crime. In fact, a hoax had been committed - and a jury ruled that Sharpton had known this, yet recklessly and maliciously attacked a junior prosecutor named Stephen Pagones for inaction. Pagones later won a substantial lawsuit against Sharpton, who never paid, claiming indigence.The victim's mother, Annie Lamb, was a member of Bacon's church, and came to the Reverend with the story of her son hit by a Mercedes and lying in intensive care while the driver of the car fled the scene. Sherman McCoy did flee the scene, because he thought the two boys were up to no good. It wasn't necessarily Lamb that put fear into Sherman and Maria; it was the large boy in the Celtics jacket who was with Henry at the time. The actions of the yuppies are not too far removed from what many people would have done in the same situation. A friend of mine told me a story about a carjacking in Overton - in Miami - which began when someone ran in front of the car, forcing the driver to slam on the breaks. The car was then attacked by several others in cahoots with the man who ran in front of the car to stop it. The moral of his story was that his father should have run the guy over and gotten the hell out. Nobody wants to be a hit-and-run driver, but nobody wants to be robbed, either. It is a thought-provoking dilemma.The Lamb Case was publicized by an alcoholic reporter in a small local paper that hadn't written a good story in several years. Peter Fallow was destined to be fired from the City Light for ineffectiveness at his job, and his personal life consisted of mooching free drinks and food at a local pub by finding a sucker to get stuck with the bill. If Fallow woke before noontime, it was because someone woke him up. This story was a remarkable boost to his career - in fact, we learn at the end just how far he could run with the story.A number of coincidences must occur before this case can get any traction - and, remarkably, they do! For example, Maria is having an affair with an artist, Filippo Chirazzi, while she is entertaining McCoy. This artist also knew Caroline Heftshank, one of the Brits who frequented Leicester's, a local hangout of Brits in America. When he failed to call Caroline, whose interest in the artist failed to match his interest in her, she told Peter Fallow about the artist's involvement with Maria and some conversations that linked Maria to Sherman McCoy.Nearly every character in the story has an ulterior motive, and how these play out is a remarkable social statement of the decade. The power-broker becomes a scared, witless dolt. The beauty with the brown-lipstick distracts the married assistant prosecutor. Even a simple matter of speech is laden with innuendo. Wolff captures the decade in one compelling, impossible-to-put-down story that ought to appeal to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I am not a literature buff.

What a treat. Some parts caused me to laugh out loud. I found the ending to be appropriate because it could very well be the true ending for a ridiculous case such as the one McCoy was in.

While some choose to focus on hating Sherman McCoy and what he represents, I choose to focus on the morally bankrupt media and &quot;Reverend&quot; Bacon aspects of this magnificent morality play. Today the media is driven by the credo &quot;while the facts may be interesting, they are irrelevant&quot; when a story such as this explodes across the headlines. Reverand Baconesque characters are given legitimacy and muggers are portrayed as altar boys and honor students in the media's zeal to create a story by tearing down heretofore legitimate institutions and/or people. While some readers complain about the ending of this book I do not. The book ends a lot like real life. There is no closure, there are no pat and easy endings. Only a struggle to get thru the day and the day after that. Sherman McCoy abandons all pretensions after hitting rock bottom and, instead of crawling into a hole and dying, he rededicates himself to redemption regardless of the cost. I like the man Sherman McCoy became."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I loved Liar's Poker, by Michael Lewis, and was told repeatedly to pick up Bonfire. I'm glad I did. I do have to agree with other reviewers which point to the ending's weakness. Wolfe did seem to just abruptly end the story. While it lasted, however, it kept me laughing..One thing, definately not for people who don't appreciate black humor..."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Outstanding! The story at first seems to meander, but even Wolfe's seemingly innocuous first 3 chapters serve their purpose. Sherman McCoy is such a completely self-centered, sheltered, wealthy individual that the mere sight of a young black male in his posh Manhattan neighborhood practically gives him a panic attack. Wolfe also skillfully shows how the sophisticated, Yale-educated stockbroker Sherman is reduced to a hormone-ridden high-school boy at the prospect of a secret rendezvous with his sexy, desirable young mistress, Maria. His bumbling phone call to his wife Judy prepares us for exactly how poorly he will be prepared to handle any events that deviate even slightly from his closed, insular life. The other 3 main characters are just as sharply drawn. Larry Kramer is the poor man's Sherman McCoy. Just as Sherman risks everything he has, including his marriage, for a woman he lusts over, Kramer does the same, risking the opportunity of a lifetime to act out on his! ! unfulfilled fantasies of &quot;the girl with the brown lipstick&quot;. Reverend Bacon, an obvious parody of Al Sharpton, is shown in all of his self-righteous posturing and slick insincerity (his motivations in &quot;helping victims&quot; are less than pure). Peter Fallow, the British tabloid &quot;journalist&quot;, is a first-rate opportunist who uses other people's tragedies to save his flagging career (he's desperate to get the &quot;Big Story&quot;, truth be damned, since he's about to be fired for his habitual drunkenness). His snobbery about the crude &quot;Yanks&quot; provide a lot of the humor; as much as he reviles Americans, he is not averse to mooching dinners and drinks from them. One of the funniest chapters consists of his dinner with Maria's tycoon husband. The finest creation of the secondary characters is Myron &quot;Mike&quot; Kovitsky, the no-nonsense judge who won't buckle under to the pressures of popular demand. His manner in dealing with the caged crimi! ! nals, for instance, is a classic: he gets down to their lev! el of cat-calling in his own unique, vulgar way. This stubborn trait never changes throughout the novel; he is perhaps the only truly noble character to be found. I wish there had been more memorable female characters; as it is, Maria is the only stand-out among the &quot;social X-rays and lemon tarts&quot;, including Judy McCoy (I would have liked to see her character expanded). Predictably, Maria plays a large part in the resulting comic tragedy and shows herself to be completely self-centered, utterly without a conscience and purely carnal in her instincts. Maria, not the sterotypical fragile Southern belle she at first appears to be, is not easily intimidated and proves to be much more of a ruthless cut-throat than Sherman the Scheming Stockbroker, who soon falls apart at work as well as in his personal life. The satire is first-rate, although some of the &quot;privileged party&quot; scenes are occasionally dragged out too long. Wolfe shows that there is no limit or except! ! ions to greed and opportunism in any class line, from the blacks in the Bronx to the WASP-y Manhattan socialites to the British tabloid &quot;sleaze journalists&quot;. Some people have suggested that the epilogue was a cop-out; I happened to like it, because it provided a bit of realism to the satire. Especially observe how Sherman, as an accused criminal, is the toast of Manhattan, and after his trial, appears to have been deserted."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This is arguably the best American novel of all time. I recently had the pleasure of rereading it, and was thrilled anew at the way the dirt of the American Way is so shamelessly and so gleefully exposed. Wolfe writes with such zest, such pleasure, you can almost hear him laughing as he types the last period. The modern pretenders to the throne, such as Stuart Woods (and his odious &quot;Dirt&quot;) et al., are hardly able to compare to the Walker Percy-like insight Wolfe has into the distinct voices that comprise America."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Wolfe's innovative descriptions of the '80s New York culture is the strength of this novel, yet is not enough to excuse the completely disappointing epilogue. Apparently pulled from another story, this ending contradicts all evidence and character development that 99% of the wordage strove to build. Attempts at making a statement about racism, politics, and justice is thrown out in leiu of a disappointing synopsis that downplays every sympathetic character while the story's villians prosper against all reason. The epilogue offers no resolution, and thus, makes no statement. Imagine sitting through every day of the O.J. Simpson trial and being deprived of a verdict. Fortunately, Wolfe's style makes the bulk of the reading easy enough to digest, but in the end you have to wonder why this book was ever written."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"UNTIL THE ENDING/EPILOGUE THIS WAS &quot;THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ.&quot; UNBELIEVABLY SUSPENSFUL AND INSIGHTFUL, MY HEART WAS ACTUALLY POUNDING WHILE I READ THE BOOK. BUT MR. WOLFE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED BEFORE THE EPILOGUE. TO THAT POINT A POWERFUL STATEMENT HAD BEEN MADE AND SHERMAN MCCOY AND HAD BEEN EXONERATED FROM A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT. AFTER THE EPILOGUE, THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE ENDING, ALTHOUGH IT IS OBVIOUS, THAT IN FEAR OF BAD REACTIONS FROM THE BLACKS, MR. WOLFE HAS WEASELED OUT AND MADE IT APPARENT THAT THE LAWYERLESS MR. MCCOY WOULD LIKELY BE UNJUSTLY CONVICTED AND SPEND 8 TO 25 IN JAIL AND MARIA, THE GOLDDIGGER AND REAL CRIMINAL WOULD ROAM THE WORLD UNSCATHED."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Damn it, Tom. You wrote the novel of the decade. Do it again! This work stands beside the works of Drieser, Fitzgerald, Salinger, Lewis, Heller, and Pynchon. That must scare you. Please do not be afraid: work, stand, and deliver. Do not be fear failure, for you have already had success which will far outlive you. Review: this was the &quot;novel of the eighties&quot; which will be &quot;studied&quot; as such. Mr. Wolfe's writings are an admixture of Sinclair Lewis and Hunter Thompson, yet unique. It is such fun to read and, then again, to re-read for texture and content. If you have seen the movie, please forgive the author for &quot;selling the rights&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I've only read the first 100 pages and the book is excellent.

If you appreciate puzzles you may like this version, but if you actually want to know the story as Tom Wolfe intended it, you should skip this version and anything published by General Books LLC."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Prior to actually reading it, my understanding of Bonfire was that it's one of those \\"must reads\\" for any self proclaimed American bibliophile because it is a landmark piece of cultural satire. Now that I've read it I can say that in no way does this book live up to ANY of its hype.Although this is not the first time this has happened, it never ceases to irritate me when I walk away from a book with no actual \\"walk aways\\", ie, \\"what a GREAT story!\\" or \\"did not see that twist coming\\", or \\"I need a moment alone...those sex scenes were ridiculous!\\" After finish Bonfire, my only thought was, \\"ok, so what?\\" The story takes place in NYC circa the 80's. The focal character is a quintessential, self made yuppie, Wall Street bonds trader whose life comes crumbling down after he's involved in an unfortunate late night encounter in the Bronx, apparently the borough from hell during this decade. What ensues is a strange smattering of social clich&eacute;s with little cultural context (I would've loved more references to the political and pop culture landscapes of the time) and zero character development. I suppose you could draw some parallels with greed of Wall Street then to the all out corruption of Wall Street today but when the author seemingly has no opinion about it, there is nothing the reader can do with it.In short, this is 685 pages you could be spending elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I am a foreigner, and after reading this book halfway, I asked myself, \\"Gee, is this the way New Yorkers talk? Using the 'F' word most of the time? This is not what I've seen on TV and in the movies.\\" Several scenes are also unconvincing. Top of the list is when Sherman McCoy tries to drag his dashshund into the rain but the mutt resists. Having owned a daschund before, I know it's not the kind of titanic struggle that Wolfe describes. The party scene where NY's socialites boorishly laugh \\"Hack hack hack Haw haw haw\\" is also incredulous. The author also injects too much details into both setting and characters. Even an ashtry is described vividly : \\".. and with his right, he put the cigarette out in a Lalique ashtray with a lion's head sculpted on the rim.\\" The plot (which revolves around a hit-and-run accident) is too weak to carry the weight of more than 100,000 words in its 680 pages. When I reached chapter 23, I skipped the remaining 8 chapters and jumped to the epilogue just to find out the fate of the protagonist. Wolfe's style of writing is not my taste."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This company was very fast in getting my book to me. I would absolutely use them again."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I loved the lampooning Wolfe did of the 1980s New York society life. It's hard for someone like me to imagine going broke on one million dollars a year, but it appears that in New York high society, it's very possible. The descriptions of the society matrons and trophy wives were hilarious -- that was pretty much my favorite part of the book. Although I enjoyed most of the character depiction, there were parts where the book really dragged. I hate it when I have to force myself to read the whole chapter and not skip pages because I'm afraid of missing something. All in all, a good book, but the endless depictions of New York City life and surroundings were a little much. In the end, I could have skipped not only pages, but whole chapters, because the outcome was nothing out of the ordinary."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This formulaic novel is fast-moving (except for Chapter 15.) It also provides insights on human nature and the sociology of New York City, circa 1987.Unfortunately, the plot breaks down near the end, in Chapter 31. The riot scene in the courtroom seems unrealistic, as does Sherman McCoy's too sudden transformation from petrified Wall Street elite to a guy ready to take on everyone in the Bronx.The story, which progresses steadily and surely through the first 30 chapters, comes to a too easily wrought end with the equivalent of a roaring car chase rather than by bringing all of the strands of the story together at trial.At the risk of seeming vain, and although still following the formulaic structure, I believe Wolfe would have been better served by the following outline for an ending:The case goes to trial ... Kramer argues the State's case ... Maria Ruskin testifies against McCoy ... Roland Auburn testifies against McCoy ... Killian plays the tapes ... Judge Kovitsky discovers that Killian and McCoy have tried to get a crucial tape of a conversation between Ruskin and McCoy into evidence despite knowing it was illegally made ... Peter Fallow makes headline news of all of this and Reverend Bacon states that vindication is at hand ... just when all seems lost for McCoy,Henry Lamb awakens from his coma, and being the honest, college-bound kid he is, testifies that Ruskin and Auburn lied about how he got hurt ... the rest of the newspapers and TV stationsin NYC jump on this news, crucifying Fallow's reporting, Bacon's posturing, and Kramer's baseless prosecution ... now comes the verdict: not guilty ... Maria Ruskin is convicted of perjury and perhaps it looks like she'll lose her fortune gained from marrying the geriatric and now-deceased Arthur Ruskin ... Auburn is also convicted of perjury, his plea deal is cooked and he is sent to Rikers for all of his prior offenses ... Fallow is fired and finished in journalism: he returns to England to rot in his alcoholic stew ... Kramer keeps the job he so hated before taking on the McCoy case, never again the star in the D.A.'s office and with even less of a chance of getting a job like the high-paying kind in a Wall Street firm he so envies; Kramer's nascent affair isn't discovered, but the girl with brown lipstick won't have anything more to do with him ... McCoy no longer must fear being thrown into Rikers, but his marriage is destroyed; McCoy's ability to regain his former stature on Wall Street and look at life from the point-of-view of an American aristocrat is irreparably compromised; McCoy's 8-year-old daughter is really the only one who still believes in him just as much as in the days when he thought himself a Master of the Universe ... can there really be any winners after The Bonfire of the Vanities?As it is, Wolfe's novel is surely more than passable entertainment, but misses the mark as one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century because of its formulaic structure and subpar ending."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The subject of The Bonfire of the Vanities is Tom Wolfe's creative and perfectly illustrative descriptive writing. For example, the author refers, in one scene, to a character wearing a \\"'F--k You' necktie.\\" The main enjoyment in crawling through this 700-page beast, is awaiting each next colorfully described scene.The marketing for this novel, and the aura that surrounds it, bills Bonfire as capturing the 80s. There were some period elements such as the media-circus of hot lawsuits. It also had scenes, such as the McCoy's offices for bond-trading, that felt 80s. But you can more efficiently immerse into that period by watching Network and Wall Street. Plus, the scenes with aristocrat McCoy and hotshot Assistant D.A. Kramer, were written in a style that reminded me of film from the 50s.The transformation of Sherman McCoy is not well-developed. When it arrives it comes as a shock.There is engaging drama and interesting plot, but nothing occurs of great significance. Only at one point, when a character describes an Edgar Allen Poe poem, does the novel rise above the milieu of its multiple intersecting plotlines.The book is a large investment of your time. Do great descriptions and fun plots make it worth it? I think so, but only minimally so."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Wolfe tells a great story, keeps it moving, and fills it with wonderfully cunning and deceitful characters."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I used to live in New York City, so I thought Tom Wolfe was right on target in describing its politics and different social scenes, and satirizing them. However, I couldn't relate to any of the characters; they were far too stereotypical and not enough like real people for my taste. You had your token Irish cops and pols, your token Italian pol/mafiosos, your token Upper West Side Jewish intellectual lawyers, and your token doofus WASP stockbrokers and socialites. I wouldn't be surprised if some people found these depictions insulting. Maybe I'm personalizing this, but it's also almost as if Wolfe is saying that if you don't fit any of these stereotypes, you can never be a true &quot;hip&quot; New Yorker. I would have found this book more interesting had the characters been much more complex."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This edition, all in italics, is full of typos because it is the result of scanning Bonfire of the Vanities and then reprinting it using OCR (optical character recognition) software. I'm no lawyer, but this seems really sketchy. Regardless of the legality, the typos and italics make it hard to read. Don't buy into this scam."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"It's not often that you could say that a book changed your life, but Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities did just that for me. I was a college drop-out doing nothing with my life and one day my sister gave me this book. I'm not a big reader but I could not put this book down. I became completely involved with the great characters in this book, young attorney, Larry Kramer, writer Peter Fallow, Reverand Reginald Bacon, and of course, Sherman McCoy. Wolfe wrote in such terrific detail that you feel as if you'd known these characters all your life. I started talking about them in conversations like they were close friends of mine. The story itself is incredible, taking you through the highs and lows of four main characters with Sherman being the tie that binds them all. Now, as for the life-changing part, I knew very little about the stock market, but after seeing the high-life that Sherman led, the luxury car, the Park Ave. Co-Op, and of course his lovely ladies, wife Judy and mistress, Maria Ruskin, i knew thats what i wanted for myself(except for the mistress, of course). So, I took a couple of classes, read a few books and I passed my stock broker exam on the first try. Wall Street has been great to me--I have a job I love, great friends and durroundings and I met my wife at my firm. In short, I have never been happier and I have Tom Wolfe and his tale of a wealthy financier to thank."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I ordered two books (after hearing a review on NPR) for guys who travel a lot. NO way can I give them a book nearly two inches thick, almost 700 pages, and weighing a ton. So sad."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Best description of this book is that of bridge between the genre novels and literature. It is not very good literature nor is it as bad (some might say less interesting) as genre novels. The characters and character descriptions are overstated and could very well have been written by anyone after reading 10-15 crime thrillers. The redeeming feature of this book is the work Tom Wolfe put into collecting a lot of information about a particular period in a particular city, varying from inner-city housing projects, jail cells, attorney's offices and high society life.The story is that of a fundamentally decent white male getting caught up in a minor traffic accident and getting exploited by the society around him. A criticism I have is that the characters who donot belong to the traditionally wealthy (means non WASP men according to the author) are portrayed as upstarts resentful of old wealth and wanting to bring them down to their level. For some reason there is not a single character in this book who want to rise up and be equal to the traditionally wealthy by honorable means."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Yes, the plot drives itself.Yes, the chracterizations are often vivid, entertaining, and thought-provoking.Yes, the style and is agreeable and never too inconsistent with any given character at hand.Yes, Wolfe shows and conveys his knowldge of the socio-economic stratums of America in book form. His insights into the relations between these groups and within them is noteworthy. He's well-travelled.But, the novel is essentially nihilistic - yes, grandly and lavaciously nihilistic, but nonetheless nihilistic.It is also too long. The writing helps justify the length, but the plot, the wonderfully simple plot does not!And I'm not one for &quot;gender studies&quot; but the depiction of women in this novel is weak, marginal, and miserable.I don't feel as if I wasted my time reading Bonfire( I skipped over the depressing last fity pages) but I feel Mr. Wolfe might have wasted some of his talent.And what of the loose ends of seemingly important side-plots. It smacks of the dissappointment, I felt after reading his &quot;A Man in Full.&quot; So much story, so little ending.It's well worth the read, and is a modern classic, but some classics have flaws (like the times in which they are based) and they bring down this novel.It at least brought me a little down."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I remember this book caused quite a stir in the late 80's. Reading it now I enjoyed it very much. It's certainly not a defining, breathtaking, world changing book (back then everyone was fawning over it) but it is quite good for what it is. I don't think the point of the book was for you to feel sorry for Sherman McCoy or anyone else for that matter, but simply to see what can happen to someone who has his life utterly destroyed. I like these stories (check out &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;) and consequently I liked this book."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today. A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel. Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story. There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people. Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions. The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene. The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high. Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.

There wasn't much point in finishing it. I love long books, but this one was pointlessly so. Wolfe goes into a lot of useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot.

What with the 80's wall street narcissism, the abundance of shoulder pads, the European opulence in decorating styles of the elite, the computer screens with \\"green\\" writing, the use of pay phones, the idea that brown lipstick could ever be remotely sexy. Yet despite all this, the book still feels incredibly relevant in today's times. Actually even more relevant as America wakes up to a crisis of confidence in Wall Street.Almost all characters in this book are contemptible, save for maybe the Lamb kid (although even his wholesome personae is overblown), the little daughter, and the defense lawyer. Yet none of these people are the stars of the book. The real players: Sherman, Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow are incredibly smarmy in their respective fields. You can't root for any of them. Did you want Sherman to win his case or not? Wolfe clearly had a real disdain for these characters and so too did I. But I kind of liked this. I couldn't root for anyone and it kept me on my literary toes.The only observation that kept running through my head while reading this book was that Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow all had to metaphorically or actually tear down alpha male Sherman in order to feel better about themselves. To that end, I think this book is just as much about American male egotism as it is about anything else.All in all, a great, worthwhile read (and BTW, the first Wolfe I have ever read; I might have to venture further into his collection)."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe is a master storyteller in this gripping novel.

They're irrelevant, so leave them out. I wish that the author had spent a little more effort on the ending, which is incredibly disappointing, with no real resolution.

I understand that it has become a cliche to say that the novel is better than the movie. In this case, however, the disparity is so great that I would actually recommend you see the movie."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"On the plus side, The Bonfire of the Vanities compares well with Balzac's stuff. I mean, the methods are similar. The story follows several very different characters living in New York, and each scene is detailed, particularized, analyzed, painted with a very fine brush. Many layers of New York's society are represented. There are no moral messages, no lessons to be learned, just life in New York in the late 'Eighties or early 'Nineties at its most intense, presented as \\"business as usual,\\" with corrupt politicians, lascivious prosecutors, moronic members of the jury, conceited stock market honchos, cynical lawyers, less-than-bright policemen, political opportunists, socialites, priests, opera singers, real estate agents with five thousand dollar manicures, rich faithful wives who deserve to be strangled, only it never occurs to anyone to strangle them, mistresses on the make, petty criminals, silly immigrants, bone-headed journalists, feminists of both genders, racial and ethnic tension - and on and on. The book is really a lot of fun.On the other hand, the opus falls just short of making its author, well, \\"the Balzac of our time.\\" No scene is picturesque enough to be called cinematographic, and for a novel 800 pages long that's a bit, well, loquacious (on the author's part). The author tends to explain too much, and fits people and scenes together in such a way as to promote his own outlook, leaving the attentive reader no choice but to examine it. Upon closer examination, one realizes that Mr. Wolfe's main purpose is to show that people in general are vile, selfish, obtuse creatures (without exception); that life is a pretty ridiculous affair; and that any joy a person ever derives from living is brief, accidental, and usually comes at the expense of others. To put it plainly, THERE IS NO GOD in this novel. It was written by a fierce atheist. There is neither faith, hope, nor love in it. None. Life is algebraically plain and tedious.(I realize I said earlier there were no moral messages in the book. There aren't any. The above is an OUTLOOK, not a message).Literature thrives on extraordinary situations in which characters are inspired to perform extraordinary acts. The element of surprise in Wolfe's novel is purely circumstantial. Folks have no fre will in this story. (All atheists are determinists more or less by definition, I suppose).In the past, I've had some interesting experiences related to the publication of this novel. Two years after it came out (in the early 'Nineties, I believe), the news finally reached the Philistines, and by Philistines I mean those representatives of the middle class (and, sometimes, the upper middle class; I have nothing to say about the actual upper class since no one, not even the representatives of the said class themselves, can figure out what the hell they're up to, what it is they do all day, and what their problem is) ... uh ... where was I? ... Philistines ... those representatives of the middle class that once in a while make a half-hearted effort to appear CULTURED, which, in their view, means catching a program on the History Channel once in a while and telling others that they're reading \\"this book, it's actually pretty good.\\" They never seem to finish this book. I mean, they sort of struggle through the first twenty pages, and then skim through the rest, and make plans to read it properly when they visit Aruba next year, or some such. They're always too busy, they never have any \\"free time.\\" One gets the impression that if they stopped being busy for a moment, civilization would just collapse and never recover. Anyway, this dude had a copy of \\"Bonfire\\" in his briefcase and was telling me (his colleague) how everybody had recommended this book to him. He was going to read it when he had some free time. He actually DID take it to Aruba (there was also a wife involved, I believe). He came back, I believe, without having finished it. A year later he died. He was a good guy, too. Reading just wasn't \\"his thing,\\" as Philistines like to say.Anyway, when \\"Bonfire\\" came out, the hype was considerable, which for me is nearly always a turn-off. And then the movie came out (which, incidentally, was far more politically incorrect than the book, and the choice of actors and actresses was just UNBELIEVABLE; I loved it). So I put off reading \\"Bonfire\\" until, oh, I don't know, maybe after 9/11. By that time, home video games had become astonishingly popular, and crime rates started dropping everywhere across the nation, including New York (for which then-Mayor Giuliani took all the credit, of course). When I finally got to read it, the novel struck me as a bit dated. Not that any issues described in it with a flourish, social and otherwise, had become a thing of the past. The overall societal set of problems had shifted a little since the novel's publication, that's all.The story is constantly balancing on the edge of political correctness, even though it never goes beyond the boundaries, not once. Even so, few other authors would dare show a book that probes so many \\"untouchable,\\" \\"sacred-cow\\" issues to an editor, and few editors would touch a book of this sort with a hundred-foot pole. The advantage of being Tom Wolfe, I suppose, is that during the decades he spent being a journalist and creating his own style (starting back in the '60's), the man gradually accustomed everyone to the fact that he says outrageous things and gets away with it. The degree of outrage has increased over the years, and today Mr. Wolfe can get away (I would imagine) with saying pretty much anything, because he knows that no one will take it (or him) seriously.It is worth remembering, while reading this novel, that its author belongs to the glorious school of Southern authors with New York careers: the crux of American literature. God bless."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I read and enjoyed this book previously in the late 80's. The passing of a further twenty-five years or so have brought it some clarity. I've got to highly recommend it, although there is one flaw that SHOULD push the rating just below 5 stars. More of that later.Sherman McCoy has it all. He makes a million dollars a year selling bonds for a top Wall Street firm. He lives in a 14 room, one-apartment-with-servants-wing-to-a-floor building on Park Avenue enjoying picturesque park views. His devoted wife--a little older than him and not as attractive as she once was--has carved out a career as an interior designer published in Architectural Digest, and his idealized 12 year old daughter attends the toniest private school with it's own shuttle that tools up and down Park Ave. gathering golden children in the promised land. Topping it off is his mid-20's mistress who he joins for the occasional impromptu tryst in another woman's rent-controlled apartment ($333/month)that the mistress--trophy wife of a self-made Jewish gillionaire--coopts from her for $750/month.Sherman's (SHUHMAN, the mistress calls him through her South Carolinian accent)fantasy life begins to come unravelled when he misses a turn off to Manhattan and ends up in the Bronx one evening after picking up his paramour at Kennedy airport. He goes from missplaced to lost and stops at an on-ramp because of an abandoned tire in his path. Two black youths appear from the side and a larger one come towards him somewhat quickly. This is the point where a spoiler opportunity presents itself to me, I'll resist the temptation, but the upthrust is that one of the youths gets struck by Sherman's car and the balance of the book is devoted to the downward spiral in Sherman's life this produces.The only flaw in the book occurs when detectives first visit Sherman's apartment to get a look at his car as a function of their hit-and-run investigation. The struck youth went to the hospital with a wrist injury, is treated and leaves with undiagnosed head trauma that later produces a coma (ultimately fatal). He told his mother he had been hit by a Mercedes with a license plate beginning with an R and a second number with a full ascender (my words, not his) like an \\"I\\" a \\"P\\" or an \\"F\\". After a self-appointed civil rights leader/preacher looking for a fast buck produces PR that takes talk of the accident to viral extremes, the police launch their investigation that leads them to Sherman's (and 500 other) doors to examine their cars. With so many possibilities, the police are just looking to eliminate the cars with no physical damage.Sherman blows the interview and arouses their suspicion. His behavior is not only ridiculous and outrageous, it's also unbelievable. Here he is, a self-styled \\"Master of the Universe\\" (as a bond salesman) and he can't act cool in a not even unexpected situation? Here, the author almost lost me. I was very disappointed.But he had to do this to produce the rest of the action of the book, which was well drawn and monumental. The author's gift of language, or characterization, or descriptive narrative--I could go on--are beyond comparison. This is a masterful story-teller at the peak of his powers.For those of you that look for \\"messages\\" in better fiction, you see how revered American institutions can be prostituted and perverted by the whims of angry crowds and determined behind-the-scenes influencers. Courts aren't supposed to function like the one in the Bronx, but, in context, it seems the most natural thing in the world.This is not Tom Wolfe's best book, but it's better than just about anyone elses."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe is an entertaining book that earns the label of a \\"page-turner\\" through Wolfe's quality prose and ability to showcase the quirky parts of his characters. It's a good story with big implications, seen from the eyes of a handful of different New Yorkers. The best I can give this novel is good, but not great. It has good scenes and good subject matter, but never quite hits what it set out to.Wolfe gives you a taste of a lot of interesting things and characters that never get expanded on. When you read the two scenes with Bacon (Al Sharpton-lite) you're captivated by him, but he hardly appears otherwise except for somebody mentioning how terrible he is. We meet the judge Kovitsky early on and he's equally interesting, and he goes unheard of until the climax in which he's supposed to be the crux of the finale. We don't find out that Sherman was once an idealist who wasn't consumed by money and social status until it's way too late to care. Sherman's turn from a wimpy yuppie into an \\"animal\\" at the end came off really lame. So now he isn't afraid to lie...wait, hasn't he already lied to everybody he's encountered up to this point?Wolfe can craft a line with the best of them though, and his humor and descriptive ability usually keeps his stuff afloat when he lacks in other departments. One of the best parts of the book was the dichotomy between Kramer and the women he lusted after. When he was staring down Maria as they interviewed her and his inner dialogue hinted that she might want him, and then we find out that she thought he was a creep was a beautiful notion about how a lot of men think and women's reaction to that. Also when he's rambling to The Girl With the Brown Lipstick about the trial and he thinks she's enthralled with every aspect of it, come to find out at the end of the scene she thinks he's a typical New York male that only talks about themselves. Subtle nuances like this made the book worthwhile despite being bashed over the head with the fact that Jews, Italians, Blacks, Irish, rich people and poor people are different. Wolfe also made it a point to note that everybody who worked for the justice system was bald or balding.I would have liked to have seen the story go to trial and seen Killian and Kramer going at it with Kovitsky playing mediator. I wanted to see Sherman watch Maria testify under oath and I wanted resolution. I guess I can't fault Wolfe for his ending though, because it's his story and that's how he chose to write it. I can say though that the ending felt like a cop-out and a let down. The book was worth reading and a good addition to the Tom Wolfe canon, but not his best work."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The Bonfire of the Vanities is the second Tom Wolfe book that I have read. The first was I Am Charlotte Simmons, which although flawed, I enjoyed. Still, this book (along with two other Wolfe titles) sat on my shelf for quite a while, intimidating me due to its thickness, as I like books that I can read through quickly. When I finally began reading this one, I found that in spite of its length, I was able to proceed quickly.The Bonfire of the Vanities is the story of three men. Sherman McCoy is a high-salaried bond trader living with his wife and daughter in a Park Avenue apartment. In spite of his job and status, he finds himself worrying about money as it flows out as quickly as it comes in. His obsession is being a \\"Master of the Universe.\\" Sherman is also romantically involved with Maria Ruskin, the young wife of an elderly businessman.Larry Kramer is an assistant district attorney working in the Bronx. He also lives his wife and young child, but his conditions are much different. His tiny apartment would fit into McCoy's living room. Kramer experiences a combination of envy and disdain toward other lawyers with high-paying jobs at big firms, as he would like their salaries, but feels he is on the moral high road as he helps serve the public.Finally, there is Peter Fallow, an alcoholic British journalist for a tabloid. Fallow has been down on his luck, and his main goal each day is to find ways to get free meals. Fallow tries to dupe his boss into thinking he is being productive, and also desires a lifestyle beyond his means.The thread that ties the three characters together begins when McCoy and his mistress are involved in an accident where he may have hit someone while driving in the Bronx at night. He is conflicted over whether to report it, while his mistress says to forget about it as they don't know if anything actually happened. It turns out that they hit a young black man from the projects who was living a clean lifestyle, leaving him in a coma. Community leaders put pressure on the police and legal system to go after the perpetrator. Fallow is the reporter who breaks the story, while Kramer is the ADA in charge of prosecuting the case. When witnesses lead the investigation back to McCoy, the case becomes about race and social class.In telling this story, the author presents a vivid description of New York during the 1980's. Having never been there, I can't judge whether this description is accurate, but it added a lot to the story. Also, the characters are very well fleshed out. Each has his own flaws and virtues, which evolve over time. The arrogant McCoy and the idealistic Kramer from the beginning are definitely depicted differently at the conclusion.Overall, this was a well-written novel, and I will be dusting off and reading A Man in Full and The Right Stuff (eventually)."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"For me, at the beginning there was an intrest in how all of these people related together. What could a Bronx defense attorney have to do with this guy that makes a ton of money on Wall Street?Sherman McCoy had a demanding presence throughout the book. He is the elusive millionare that everyone wants to be. He seems to have everything...what could possibly go wrong?Then there is his mistress. She is cheating on her husband, but seems otherwise harmless. It turns out she just may be the sneakiest of all.I cannot believe how the justice system was run in this book. What Kramer did was crazy. I felt it really gave me an inside look at what really happens and how people try to win over their consituants. Poor Sherman just got lost in the shuffle. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This was my second Tom Wolfe book and I enjoyed it even more than the first, being \\"A Man In Full\\" It amazes me how Wolfe can introduce so many characters from so many places and then some how tie them all together. This book may anger certain readers with the frequent stereotypes used by Wolfe to show New York prejudice but they are essential in understanding New York city. I personally enjoyed the theme of how many whites were afraid of blacks and were scared to travel to what seems like another city in Harlem. Wolfe also addresses the situation within the poverty stricken ghettos of New York. This book paints an accurate picture of New York sex and class and the divisions within them."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"The Bonfire of the Vanities clearly made several strong points about racism, sexism and capitalism in America, but I personally enjoyed the attention Wolfe paid to developing the characters and situations each character was in. All the plot lines are just built up by the indepth description of how each character was involved. The reader is never left wondering why the characters are doing what they are doing, but everything is very obviously connected by Wolfe's previous narrative that it gives the reader something to look to for clarification. Specific events such as the mayors obsession with mayonnaise \\"who in the name of God would bring a half eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public meeting?\\" or Sherman's confusion in the Bronx \\"Who on Earth would take the trouble to shove a chair in a chicken wire fence in this neighborhood?\\" also shows the actual character's detail orientedness, and perhaps shows that focus on detail is an inherent human flaw."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This is the only book I took with me on a three-month trip to Europe. It was plenty. A huge, beautiful, juicy paean to New York, to Americans, and finally to Sherman himself, Bonfire grabs the reader and doesn't let go. I would ration myself, a chapter a day, because I didn't want it to end. Then I reread the whole book on a six-hour train ride and didn't even mind the motion sickness.Whatever you do, don't see the movie, or you will forever be tormented by Bruce Willis as a dissolute London reporter, Tom Hanks as the quintessential 80s bondsman who's lost his way and Melanie Griffith as...well..who knows? Read this book as fast as you can and then read it again. It's like time travel back to the era of &quot;Greed is good&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"...this is the book you should take. The characters are so entertaining and the plot(s) so interesting that it will divert you and keep you engrossed all the way to Hong Kong. The only drawback will be when you have to stifle your laughter! The mixture of types that make New York what it is are all depicted with wry humor and a keen eye for fakery. No one sees through people's social poses like Tom Wolfe! He even presciently created the character of Reverend Bacon before our real life version, Al Sharpton came on the scene."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Using Wolfe's cake analogy, this book is one hell of a serving of a multi-layered cake. It is funny, farcical, tragic, satiric and informative. We are giving the wonderful New York landscape at its panoramic best, even to its underbelly in The Bronx Courthouse.Sherman Mc.Coy becomes a victim of vicious circumstance, not only that we are given a glimpse into the machinations and manipulations of those who take advantage of his unfortunate position.It is a morality tale, but one is left wondering what Sherman, a Master of the Universe, invite this upon himself: basically not listening to his better instinct of immediately reporting an accident to the police. He had become blinded by his love in an extra-marital relationship.A real treat to read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Bonfire of the Vanities has long been hailed as one the greatest (the greatest?) American novels of the 1980's, and its accolades bear little use repeating. Nevertheless, a new look at this classic novel provides ample proof that while many aspects of society have changed in the nearly two decades since Bonfire was published, a great many other have, sadly, not. Just add Starbucks, the Internet, and cellular phones; you'll find that the world described by this novel is very much alive in Gotham today.Literary celebrity and brilliant self-promoter Tom Wolfe did meticulous research on both the upper crust and under belly of Reagan Era New York City to craft this incisive, complicated, dense, and comic tale of racial unrest, political bickering, and blind sighted American bourgeois insularity. Darting from the dilapidated housing projects of the South Bronx to the gilded penthouses of Park Avenue, Wolfe spins his tale around the fictional personage of Sherman McCoy: a WASP wall street powerhouse, a self-described \\"Master of the Universe\\", and a man who due to an accidental and tragic visit to the South Bronx ends up igniting the collective and seething racial and socioeconomic tensions vibrating beneath New York's polarized population. Mr. Wolfe has painted a rich and multifaceted ethnic landscape to navigate, avoiding any and all simplistic cultural syllogisms in lieu of both character and cultural specificity, with all of the complexity and contradictions that come with it. Though it has a Dramatis Personae the size of a Dickens novel, none of the characters are turned into caricature; indeed, every individual is sympathetic in Wolfe's world, though none are overtly heroic or free of troubling ethical transgression. It is a testimony to Wolfe's skill as a writer that, though this southern WASP in the famous white suit bears little relation to many of Bonfire's most colorful characters, he always presents them with conviction and believability. His detailed descriptions of various social and professional rituals at various levels of New York life give the reader the detail needed to invest imaginatively in the lives of the many characters populating Bonfire's New York. Whether it be the perpetually caffeinated barking of a Wall Street Investment Firm's trading floor, or the grinding, discouraging monotony of the legal machinations in the South Bronx courthouse, the reader is no doubt given the impression that this is how it really was. The zenith of this is an extended chapter in which Wolfe intricately (and often hilariously) describes an uber-posh dinner party at a palatial 5th Avenue apartment. One can almost taste the foie gras pate and Dom Perignon.A lesser writer could let all this detail weigh him down and cause an otherwise interesting book to have all the buoyancy of sunken treasure chest. Bonfire's prose eschews this particularly precarious trap. The narrative often oscillates between traditional 3rd person description and 1st person expression. Depending on which character is being focused on at any given moment, their own point-of-view on the narrative is seamlessly woven into the prose allowing the story to take on an emotional immediacy and deeper sense of perspective. Most importantly, the plot itself is a thoroughly designed piece of machinery that allows Wolfe to go on his descriptive tangents without harming the book's internal feng-shui. Indeed, the story's momentum is built on this specificity. While the general points in the storyline could be churned out in any Law & Order episode, Bonfire's power cannot be reduced to a simple plot description. It is not about the guilt or innocence of it's characters. Instead, the author is putting a whole era on trial. No doubt Wolfe does have an agenda (it would be foolish and impossible to imagine any writer worth his salt without one) but it only is apparent in an overarching view of the work as a whole, and is never overtly didactic.This being said, Bonfire of the Vanities is a book about the dangers of a stratified society, in which an egregiously affluent echelon of the population ignores the clearly deteriorating circumstances of less-fortunates around them. Equally dangerous are the politicians, public servants, \\"community leaders\\" and \\"journalists\\" who, in order to appease the mob and advance their careers, exploit these deeply troublesome socio-economic tensions with shallow displays of self-righteous verbosity and hyped-up social hysteria. What makes Bonfire such a classic is the way Wolfe presents these social problems as a result of the elaborate Rube Goldberg device that was (is?) contemporary American metropolitan society. This is illustrated with astute clarity by his representation of established government bureaucracy's engagment with the ever-churning melting pot of American culture, as typified by the extremely volatile ethnic smorgasbord of New York City. Running parallel and counterpoint to this is the way the Press uses these often complex problems to advance it's own agenda and increase it's profit-margin. The characters and plot of the book move like a machine, each person doing what is generally expected of him given his social position, occupation and (less so) personal commitments. Nevertheless, the problems of the characters, both lowly and highbrow, are not easily resolved. The real culprit is the excesses of the 1980's, and they have never been presented with as much clarity, insight, heart and humor as in The Bonfire of the Vanities. Of course, the lessons of the book were hardly learned, and America today has yet to escape the problems that Tom Wolfe so exquisitely and satirically addresses in this masterwork of the contemporary American novel."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I think that one of the most startling things about this novel is that, for everyone who reads it, there is a different pivotal image, a separate moment in the book which forms an axis for the work. For me, it's Sherman McCoy's phone conversation with his estranged wife, in which he talks about the days when, as he went off to work, he would turn on the street under the window where she was watching, and give the black power sign. It meant, to this white son-of-a-lawyer, that he wasn't going to get sucked into Wall Street, that he was only using it; that it wouldn't change him.Fast forward a dozen or so years, and Sherman is 38. He's one of New York's leading Bond salesman, a self-titled Master of the Universe who makes a million dollars a year (and that isn't enough), barely sees his wife, and is cheating with another man's gold-digging spouse. As a matter of fact, when we first meet Sherman, the only redeeming feature he has is that he does seem to really love his five-year-old daughter.Sherman is not the only disgusting character we find as our story opens. There's the mistress, Maria, who laughs at her husband from the confines of her sublet rent-controlled love-nest. The wife is bitchy enough to lose sympathy with the reader despite her husband's philandering. There's the alcoholic tabloid journalist, who is an expert at getting other people to pick up the tab. And there's a thinly veiled reference to the Rev. Al Sharpton, just to complete the picture. When the book opens, the only character with whom the reader can sympathize is Larry, a lawyer who chose to work in the Bronx D.A.'s office because he wants to &quot;make a difference&quot;.And yet, the reader is sucked into the lives of these people. At first it may only be for a tittlating look at how bad bad people can be, but very soon (Wolfe doesn't tease us long) we stay to find out whether our characters will get caught for the crime they have committed; finally, we stay because we have come to admire Sherman McCoy.It is a testament to Tom Wolfe's abilities that by the end of the novel, we have come to completely different views of most of the characters in this novel. The wife isn't bitchy, she's just dissatisfied with a life that she didn't set out to get. The mistress isn't harmless, she's a viper. The reporter will print any lie to increase the drama of the crime he's uncovering; the lawyer will justify anything to catch his &quot;Great White Defendant&quot;.Sherman begins the book by telling us that he is entitled to his penthouse, his sports car, his mistress, his Saville Row suits. He finishes it standing alone, unable to afford a lawyer and &quot;dressed for jail&quot;. But he's standing, and once again, he's raising a fist in the air, determined to overcome."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"In *Bonfire of the Vanities*, pop journalist Wolfe takes a sneering satirical look (from a surprisingly European point of view) at American culture and all of its absurdities and obsessions. New York is treated as the microcosm of 80s America with all of its fads, rivalries, economic woes and class inequality mixing together uneasily and then exploding. Sherman McCoy, the supremely irritating central charater, is a fresh-faced adolescent of 38 years who just doesn't get the fact that the world is a harsh, dangerous place--that is until he becomes the fall guy in a politically and racially charged scandal. Peter Fallow (by far the best character in the book)is a delightfully cynical and misanthropic British journalist who observes the parade the do-gooder activists, slick political manipulators, confused cops, thuggish cops, skeletal society ladies, urban punks, garish architecture, trash culture and trendy clubs with an acid wit and always a few stiff drinks under his belt. If they ever make a real movie out of this book (the existing one doesn't count) PLEASE get Jeremy Irons to play Fallow. Some people see this book as some kind of right-wing propaganda. It isn't. Wolfe, despite his own more or less conservative views, allows the story to tell itself without a lot of interpretation from above. Each character is a complex individual with his or her own unique motivations and mixture of vice and virtue. We spend time inside the minds and private lives of a wide variety of people and are allowed to make our own judgements about who deserves what measure of praise or blame. If there is any prejudice in the book it is against people who simplify complex issues. Wolfe's world, like the real thing, is brimming with paradox."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe was once asked if the novel is dead. He replied that it's not quite dead, but it's on life support. He thinks the biggest problem with modern novels is that the novelists don't bother to do adequate research on their subject. How can one write a novel about India, for example, if one has never been to India? In Bonfire of the Vanities, Wolfe has done the research and has created an exact representation of modern city life in America, complete with politically self-serving DAs, civil rights demagogues, and pompous gold-coast dandies.Wolfe is obviously a keen observer of detail. This skill combined with his mastery of the reportorial style of writing make for a great novel, and a great expose' of the hustlers and opportunists that use the system for their own self-interest. I think of him as a modern-day Sinclair Lewis, who once said that he never passed judgement one way or another, he just reported what he observed. Since most of us have probably never been in a high-rise apartment on Park Avenue or a housing project in the Bronx, it's interesting to read Wolfe's detailed descriptions down to the type of wallpaper and table centerpieces. All of this works to pull the reader into the scene, the only excess possibly being his proclivity for over-reporting clothing styles. Wolfe shows his love of clothing by using esoteric terms that probably have no meaning to the average reader.Wolfe's scenes are so realistic the reader can imagine himself being in the action. I felt Sherman's fear in the Bronx jail cell. I felt his shame when lying to his wife about his relationship with Maria. The characters and dialog are so real, even though the reader may not live in that social milieu he can identify with the situation. The action moves at a rapid pace. Wolfe doesn't get bogged down with excessive narrative. He lets the characters speak for themselves--truly the mark of a great novelist.I love the way Wolfe has the Brits comment on Americans. It's refreshing to see ourselves from another perspective. How funny it is to hear Peter Fallow complain about our \\"ridiculous country\\" and our lack of social graces, all the while sponging off of rich Americans at every opportunity.This book is timeless. I read it for the second time recently and found it as enjoyable as the first. At the end I felt myself wishing for several more chapters. Bonfire of the Vanities should always stand as one of the best examples of American literature by one of our greatest writers."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Bonfire is my all-time favorite book and, in my opinion, Tom Wolfe is an absolute genius. A lot of talented authors tell us very good, sometimes great, stories, but few people have the genius to cut through all the trappings and see life exactly as it is. Tom Wolfe exposes the excesses of the 80s gloriously in this book. Okay, all the characters were hateful, but how could they have been otherwise? The only problem I found was the ending--I would have liked to have seen a little more resolution, but that doesn't detract from the book's perfection. My only real complaint is that Wolfe never gave us anything else to equal the sheer genius of Bonfire."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Lot of useful reviews here. No one mentions Wolfe's 24-page introduction, 'Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast,' which is excellent in itself as an overview of the alleged death of the novel, The New Journalism, non-fiction v. fiction &amp; his own evolution as a writer. The introduction is worth a read on its own if you're a journalism student, a would-be or actual writer or just interested in the publishing world. As for the rest of the book, it's excellent. Wolfe is a master of the set piece, the extended vignette beautifully observing a situation or person. He is not so good at endings, which is why I picked four stars rather than five. I felt identically about his later &quot;A Man in Full,&quot; and it didn't stop me enjoying the heck out of the book. If you enjoy his fiction, his non-fiction is well worth checking out as great examples of very controlled, observant reporting &amp; writing. I particularly enjoyed &quot;From Bauhaus to Our House,&quot; an extended essay about modern architecture, and &quot;The Painted Word,&quot; ditto on modern art."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe knows how to do his research. In his earlier, nonfiction works, he demonstrates his capacity to observe and synthesize information from even the most chaotic of situations. This is his first work of fiction, and his critical and all-absorbing eye works overtime; no detail is too small, no element is too minute. This work is saturated with timeless authenticity. It is intricate, impressive, and exhaustive.Exhausting, too.I admire the virtuosity of this book -- its scope, ambitions, and insights. But these admirable qualities are subsumed by an avalanche of detail. Wolfe amassed a titanic amount of information about New York in the 80's, and instead of carefully parcelling those tid-bits out in a way to delicately suggest the satire he is aiming for, he decided to include every, single, solitary thing he learned. The story here is secondary to the scenery.Speaking of story: Sherman McCoy, \\"Master of the Universe,\\" a Park Avenue bond trader with a massive bank account (and an ego and debt to match) is embroiled in a political whirlwind when he and his mistress are the cause of a possibly fatal accident in the Bronx. McCoy's world is knocked out of whack when he finds himself at the mercy of fame-hungry D.A.s, money-hungry opportunists, power-hungry politicians, and gossip-hungry journalists. It's the story of a world full of fools and blow-hards who spend most of their energy trying to be (or at least appear to be) otherwise.The satire is acute and on-the-nose, but it also centers around a cast composed entirely of unlikeable characters. Everyone from the naive McCoy to the pompous (and shady) Reverend Bacon, from the hypocritical attorney Kramer to the pickled and brined journalist Fallow: they are well-rounded, mostly believable, and mildly intriguing, but they also reek of their various vices. Because of this, when Wolfe attempts poignancy, it comes across as vacuousness. When the satire tries to be tongue-in-cheek, it is instead elbow-in-rib (and not very subtly, either).The biggest flaw in the novel is that Wolfe has tried to make far too many points, and he takes too long to make them. He puts his two cents in, but it looks like twenty. The story isn't bad at all, and the turns it takes are certainly entertaining, but it is a wearisome read. When all is said and done, I feel like I have learned more about political in-roads, journalistic deception, and financial loopholes than I have about real people, much less those all-greed, all-Me people of the 80's, at which Wolfe's novel tentatively tries to aim.Again, this is a flaw of Wolfe's refusal to leave even the tiniest microbe of research out of his writing. A good knowledge of characters and setting is necessary to give a novel a solid pulse, a sense of liveliness, but any real and true pulse is usually hidden just beneath the surface. Wolfe has slashed the skin of his story, revealing its pulse in throbbing torrents. If I may torture the metaphor, he's cut a major artery of the tale in order to show us its life, and what he's done instead is cause his novel to die a slow and laborious death. We watch the book struggle and plod forward, valiantly, but by the end, all we're left with is a twitching mass that still wears a grisly death grin. The ending here is less an ending than it is Wolfe running out of research to employ. The pulse stops there."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Although several reviewers have claimed that elements of this novel have dated the essence of this novel will always be relevant. True this was written pre-internet, pre-Clinton, pre 9/11 but the vanities that drive the chattering classes, so perfectly satirised by the author, are an inherent characteristic of moneyed urban dwellors anywhere on this planet. The spiralling nature of the plot complements the authors heady character descriptions and set-pieces.I know several people who have read and hated this novel because of its ultimately bleak portrayal of humanity. I however found it marvellously uplifting (not to mention hilarious) and view the book more as a dark fable on the perils of ambition in a capitalist society. The reader should note that most of the novel's characters would be regarded as successful in their respective professional lives and that each of those characters have lost a little bit of their soul to get where they are. What Wolfe allows us to ponder is : Is this what it takes to get to the top?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"It's always fun to read a best seller from almost 20 years ago, especially one that was proclaimed as something of a classic at the time. It's even more enjoyable to discover that Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities proves worthy of its acclaim even with the absence of cell phones, email and instant messaging.I mention the technology only because such communications dinosaurs as pay phones play significant roles in the story of how an auto accident involving a bond trader and a pedestrian teenager gets complicated by his mistress, a political hack of a DA, the resentful prosecutor, a drunken opportunist of a reporter, society matrons (including the bond trader's wife), a media manipulating black activist/minister, egotistical Wall Street executives, courthouse lawyers and a wealth of other characters.The title says it all. No character in the book operates without his or her ego getting in the way of things and like a small fire that gets too close to the charcoal lighter and then the gas tank... well, you get the idea.Forget the nonsensical movie they made of this, as far as I'm concerned that film exists solely for the purpose of demonstrating that Tom Hanks can make a bad decisions once every decade or so. This novel is a delight, one that should be rediscovered by a generation of readers that was in elementary school back in the 80's."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"This is one of the best stories I've ever read. It's intelligent, hysterical, very cynical and yet, so very real. Not only did it capture my attention during its 700pages -to the point I just couldn't go to sleep - but also I actually felt sad once I realized there was no more book to read and that it was over. I had become so attached to the characters - it was almost as if I had become one of their friends - and also I went so into it that I was dragged into its own pace and timing. In the end (don't freak out, I'm not gonna say how it ends) I realized that I 'd become agitated myself as action took place at such a high speed -as if I had been there all the time: if a book is capable of making a person perspire and agitate in his armchair and laugh loudly and histerically, so hard that he is unable to continue reading, then it must be a masterpiece. And this is most certainly one."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"A farm kid from Upstate New York, I grew up thinking of New York City as a place to be afraid of. I never went there, of course, but according to TV -- well, excluding Seinfeld -- and the movies, it was a jagged skyline towering above a huge steaming cesspool, where it was always nighttime and horrifying things happened to people. But as I got older and bored with my home county, that image began to appeal to me, and it's ultimately what brought me here.It was that same city -- the dim grimy hole of crime and perversion, the New York of the 1980s -- that appealed to Tom Wolfe and inspired him to write 'The Bonfire of the Vanities.' Born into a genteel Virginia family, Wolfe has always been obsessed with race and class, and 'Bonfire' depicts a divided city: ethnically, politically and geographically. According to Wolfe's demographic map, in Manhattan below 96th Street is the insulated upper class of WASPs, who rarely set foot on the streets of their city. They live far above in high-rises and get ferried to and from work in taxi cabs. Also on the island are the Jews, who, after generations of struggle hold most of the positions in the city government but find power slipping from their grasp as New York demographically darkens. Then there are the masses of impoverished blacks and Puerto Ricans holding the upper half of Manhattan and nearly all of the Bronx and Brooklyn. It's clear from early in the novel that the future of the city is theirs: Riverdale is \\"a little freeport\\"; Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope \\"Hong Kongs\\"; the Bronx County Building is repeatedly called \\"Gibraltar.\\" For now they're getting chewed up by the justice system, but inevitably they'll organize and take the city. Acting as a buffer are the Queens-based lower-middle class Irish and, to a lesser degree, Italians who run the police and hold minor jobs in the city courts. Finally, there's the bohemian British expatriate community, in control of much of the city's press and motivated mainly by their contempt for Americans.In terms of plot, Bonfire is the story of Sherman McCoy, a Wall Street bond trader from Park Avenue on the Upper East Side, born rich and getting richer. One night, while escorting his mistress from LaGuardia airport in his Mercedes-Benz, McCoy gets stuck in the wrong lane on the Grand Central Parkway and finds himself in the South Bronx. There he gets into a hit-and-run with a black high schooler that isn't entirely his fault. A good chunk of the book just consists of McCoy trembling over whether he'll get caught. But the boy's mother goes to the Reverend Bacon -- an Al Sharpton-style rabble-rouser who bends idealistic rhetoric to the purposes of intimidation and extortion -- and Bacon goes to the police.The case lands in the lap of Lawrence Kramer, a Bronx assistant DA (one of hundreds) feeling trapped in his job and small apartment, sick of anonymity and tired of prosecuting young blacks and Puerto Ricans. However, Kramer doesn't fully realize what he has until Bacon's lawyer brings the story to Peter Fallow, an alcoholic English reporter on the verge of losing his job. When it breaks in the press, the police trace the crime back to McCoy and the car accident off Bruckner Boulevard becomes a collision of every faction in New York City. Black and Puerto Rican protestors storm Park Avenue. McCoy is dragged into a jail cell in the Bronx. The justice system revels in finally having a WASP in its teeth. Faced with a rallying block of minority voters, the Jewish politicians have no choice but to condemn the rich bond trader. McCoy hires a street-smart Irish attorney named Tommy Killian, who acquaints him with the seamier sides of the law. Ultimately, McCoy lets himself sink and embraces the violence and seediness of New York City.If done as a drama 'Bonfire' would be painfully overwrought. But Wolfe is a satirist, and the book's outrageousness is all for the sake of comedy. The opening chapter with the mayor, the descriptions of high-class parties, of the protests, of the all-out brawl in the courtroom, of just about every scene involving Killian, are so over-the-top that the reader has to laugh. The book is also a kind of prophecy: in the '80s, an encounter like McCoy's \\"fracas in the jungle\\" probably seemed inevitable; the contradiction of the city's incredible wealth and unfathomable poverty was too great, it had to be resolved somehow. From Wolfe's perspective, as the white working class bled out of New York, the democratic process would leave the blacks and Puerto Ricans in charge, exposing the elite to the raw reality of their \\"Third World city.\\"Of course, as I -- and countless others who've come to New York with the vision of a drippy, neon-lit metropolis -- found, that prediction proved completely wrong. In the '90s, crime was fiercely suppressed. The rich whites are richer than ever. New York has another Jewish mayor, now in his third term. Black and Puerto Rican communities are caught in a pincer between gentrification and the influx of Dominican, Mexican and Chinese immigrants. And while few neighborhoods have a strong Irish character anymore, and Italians are ceding their old strongholds in Brooklyn and Queens, the city has a growing population of white working class Eastern Europeans.Which brings us to the question of the book's literary merits. Wolfe declared in 1989 that he'd revived the great realist tradition of the late 1800s and early 20th Century. But Bonfire is too much a portrait of a specific time and place and not enough of a novel. The book's leading men -- McCoy, Kramer, Bacon, Fallow -- are more or less the same character: vain, arrogant, sleazy, hungry for glory. Reading their interior monologues is a bit like watching a puppet show where all the dolls have the same voice. Some Internet troll will probably argue that Wolfe was trying to show the universality of certain human tendencies, but it's idiotic to think that people from such disparate backgrounds would have identical personalities. McCoy's third act conversion to a tough guy comes off as childish, and the plot is altogether too dependent on coincidence.New York is amorphous and unpredictable, and any book whose main virtue is describing it accurately is doomed to be short-lived. 'Bonfire' is like an old Polaroid: blurring, curling at the edges, slowly turning brown and falling apart -- a reminder of the impermanence of things and of how shallow pictures really are. Like me, most people who glance at it today probably do so out of nostalgia for the dirty, gritty old city. Topical writers like Charles Dickens and John Steinbeck have endured because of their wide appeal and deep humanity. But Wolfe's writing isn't as powerful as Steinbeck's, and his characters lack the warmth and charm of Dickens'. Even though Dickens' London and Steinbeck's California have long vanished, in 100 years -- assuming anyone is still reading -- 'Great Expectations' and 'Of Mice and Men' will continue to enjoy broad audiences. But as Tom Wolfe's New York fades out of memory, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities' will likely do the same.(...)"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"I ended up reading Bonfire after reading \\"Man in Full\\" and \\"I am Charlotte Simmons.\\" All three have a similar style and feel about them. I thoroughly enjoyed all three, including Bonfire. The difference in Bonfire is that at first I didn't care for any of the characters. In fact, all the main characters leave a bad taste in your mouth. Later, as the plot unfolds, some of those feelings change. It is a tribute to the author's excellent writing and grasp of human nature that even though I disliked the characters, I was drawn to them and their story. Its like a New York version of a Greek tragedy except it unfolds over the course of a majority of the book. The characters seem real--the story seems real and you end up rooting for the protagonist despite his many flaws. This is the Great American Novel--the kind that is rarely written these days.

Although Wolfe is best known for his &quot;new journalism&quot; stethopscopic view of America in works like &quot;Electric Acid Cool Aid Test&quot; and &quot;The Pump House Gang,&quot; his first foray into the land of the novel is novel indeed.Bonfire is a hybrid of novel and journalism with a pinch of Woody Allen. Wolfe's &quot;social X-rays&quot; scavenge cosmopolitan Manhattan cocktail parties as the vultures of the downtown poverty industry exploit a yuppie faux pas that sends his Boomer hero into a crashing Sartrean abyss.Angular as a spaghetti Western, zanier than Monty Python, and truer than Sinclair Lewis, Mr. Wolf's excursion as a novelist leaves us wondering why he doesn't do more."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe, most noted for his off-beat brand of journalismin the 1960s and 1970s is brilliant in his assualt ofNew York City politics and lifetsyles as he saw them in the1980s.

Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?\\" (from \\"Vanity Fair\\", W.M. Thackeray, 1848)In \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\", Tom Wolfe explores the theme of vanity. The exploration is set against an intricate plot in which the lives of upper class and lower class, Wasps and Irish, Jewish and Negros are set on a collision course following a random twist of fate by the book's protagonist -- Sherman McCoy, the aristocratic bond salesman.But the exploration of vanity is not limited to the rich and wealthy. Wolfe delves into the vanity of the everyman: from the assistant DA absorbed in his physique to the English journalist who is ashamed of how his blazer is becoming \\"shiny\\", even a crack dealer, who goes through 2 pairs of Reeboks a week.Thakeray explored the same theme in his work \\"Vanity Fair\\". While Thakeray writes in much greater detail and in a more florid style, Wolfe writes in the vernacular, liberally using language to bring to life the myriad of accents of modern day New York. \\"Talking\\" becomes \\"tawkin\\" for the Irish, \\"Sherman\\" becomes \\"Shuhman\\" for the southerners, etc etc.Bonfire was pure entertainment.

Although it does have to do with the \\"upperclasses\\" versus the \\"lowerclasses\\".If you think that's boring, I promise it's not! Tom Wolfe has a great writing style that uses lots of exclamations! I loved it, it's the first book like that that I read, and it really adds humor to the situation, so that it's not a serious, boring novel about the black/white divide, but rather a funny look at a serious problem in the States today.So, if you're not intimidated by a book with more than one thousand pages, definitely read this book. For me, the more pages, the better, because I hate to see a good book end."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of the Vanities","review":"Is Bonfire of the Vanities a period piece? When reading a book from a previous time period, one might begin to ponder that very legitimate concern? It is, but it isn't. Allow me to elucidate. Bonfire garners irrepressible staying power as a scathing, sardonic, and witty treatise exposing the greed, glamour, decadence, and moral decay of the 80's not unlike The Roaring 20's of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. By no means is Bonfire in the same boat as Gatsby, but nonetheless, it's in the same ballpark, if you will.Having never read Tom Wolfe before, I must say that I came away quite impressed and entertained by his singular ability to instantaneously transfer from one character's perspective to another at the drop of a dime(e.g. going from Reverend Bacon in the decrepit racially-charged milieu of The Bronx to Sherman McCoy in the plush comfortable confines of Park Avenue). Wolfe's merciless satire and scathing cynicism lends itself to all of his eccentrically diverse motley cadre of characters. As a testament to Wolfe's eclectic acumen, the author definitively nails the veritable cornucopia of targets ranging the gamut from the sheltered luxury apartments, entre nous lavish fetes of the social elite X-Rays of Park Avenue, the high-pressure environment of Sherman's Wall Street, the dog eat dog baseness of Vogel & co. at The Bronx PD and jail, the unmitigated political pandering of Weiss and Kramer at the DA's office, the Machiavellian glibness of Peter Fallow of The City Light, and, last but definitely not least, the self-serving specious \\"racial activism\\" of Reverend Bacon.The vastly paradoxical upshot of it all is this my friends: Although this extraordinarily divergent melange of characters exists in strikingly unique socioeconomic environments, they all, however, undoubtedly contribute to the prodigious confluence of flagrant self-absorbtion, blatant egotism, deplorable moral degradation, pernicious greed, and the despicable venality that cryptically ties all of them together into one infinitely vacuous morally depraved vacuum categorically devoid of any semblance of moral absolutes. Ahh...the irony of it all! Wolfe's ingenious penchant for piquant characterization and witty dialogue makes for a smooth and fluid read that entertains as well as educates. Bonfire IS a period piece, but it remains just as provocative today as it was upon its release.

It was more like a chore that required a lot of discipline to continue reading.

He should have - the scenes that include exotic dancers in this book are the only memorable ones. These only take up about 25 pages or so, however, and the rest of the book is forgettable. The characterization is shallow and fails to pull you into the story. There is never really any sense of danger throughout the book; it is the most moodless book I have ever read. The endless references to spells are tiresome. No settings are successfully created. The female leads in the story prance about in the buff for almost the entire book. It is as if the plot is so weak that the only thing that the author can do to gain the readers attention is to describe someone discarding their tunic every chapter. Believe it or not, fellas, it loses its appeal real fast.Conan is scarcely recognizable, has no wit, and is basically a big guy with a big sword and a big libido. It may well be that Green has matured as a writer since penning this book, but I'll never trust him with my time again.

I both dug the thing and was sorely disappointed at the same. The layout is fantastic -- the chosen pictures extraordinary with old-panel word balloons remastered -- with an excellent combination of old school artwork and new. The typeface is also well done.However, when one gets into the nitty gritty, one'll be finding himself going \\"Huh??\\" quite often. And this is mostly the fault of lousy proofreading. To be sure, a comics novice would most likely in no way be able to pick up on a lot of these blunders. But being that I was heavily into Marvel Comics in the 70s and early 80s gave me a good vantage point from which to judge.IRON MANLet's start with my favorite hero, Iron Man. For the most part, the writer (Andrew Darling, one of several contributors) did a good job. Obviously the writers cannot cover every tidbit of a character's career or the volume would be over 1,000 pages, possibly more. Some things do have to be omitted. But most of Shellhead's key moments made it into print. The main proofreading blunder in the Iron Man section (a two-page spread, by the way; I'd expect no less!) was in the \\"Old Flames\\" segment at upper right. Long-time Tony Stark girlfriend Bethany Cabe is listed, but there's just one problem -- it's not Bethany pictured. It's [volume 3] Tony Stark girlfriend Rumiko Fujikawa! Doh! Rumiko didn't make the list but should have -- easily so over very briefly-noted-in-IM-lore squeeze Sunset Bain. In addition, you can see the influence that current Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada has; in the \\"Essential Storylines\\" segment, Iron Man vol. 3 #27-30 are listed. Guess why? Quesada wrote 'em. No true-blue Iron Fan would list those issues if they had to name three \\"essential\\" Iron Man stories. Unbelievably omitted is the one storyline virtually all Iron Fans would list as a must-have: The Armor Wars (Iron Man #225-232). And one of the \\"essential\\" stories contains a glaring error: Iron Man #153-156 are listed as \\"alcohol stuggle issues.\\" URRNT! Not even close! Those are pretty much one-shot stand alone issues at a time when the title was in creative team transition (David Michelinie and Bob Layton, Iron Man's best-ever creative team, were exiting).WHO TO INCLUDE?There was also the head-scratching topic of who was included in the book, and who wasn't. Recent (and lame) Iron Man adversary Tiberius Stone made the book, but, for example, occasional Shellhead foe Midas -- who was an enemy of several Marvel heroes -- did not! Huh? This was also a common complaint among the myriad Amazon reviewers. Another that stuck out for me was the ridiculous inclusion of a character named Bloodhawk who appeared in a mere two issues of the Avengers back in the late 70s. C'mon -- aren't there much more worthy characters out there??RETCONNED OR NOT?A little-known Marvel character called the Rocket Racer stood out for me. First, it states his first appearance was Amazing Spider-Man #172. I used to own that issue as a boy, and read Spidey's then-battles with the skateboarding crook. Here's what got me about Racer's entry: It states he \\"was a scientific prodigy\\" who \\"developed a superpowered skateboard which was cybernetically controlled...\\" Now, there's a thing in comics called \\"retconning\\" where sometimes a hero's (or villain's) origin is \\"redone\\" to make him/her more \\"up-to-date\\" for a modern audience. It's also sometimes done to correct mistakes a writer made in the past, or simply to allow for what a current writer wants to do with a hero/villain. Now, I don't know if Marvel retconned Rocket Racer or not. If they did NOT, then his origin is completely erroneous. If anyone reads those Spider-Man issues from the late 70s, you'll see that the Racer was just a common thug (but not necessarily an evil person) who made a deal with a guy called the [Terrible] Tinkerer. The deal was that the Tinkerer (a mechanical genius) would develop the Racer's skateboard and glove rockets for 50% of whatever the Racer managed to steal in his crime sprees. Chances are RR was retconned, but then why include the original first appearance without noting that his origin had changed in the summary text? It would leave interested comic collectors who may go out and search for the relevant comics scratching their heads!SPEAKING OF FIRST APPEARANCES...Another thing that was inconsistent was the noting of characters' first appearances in the Marvel Universe. Notwithstanding the Rocket Racer above, I noticed that the writers tended to always include a character's first ever appearance in their bio, despite the fact that they may have changed names and/or appearances [possibly] many times. For instance, Mach-4's first appearance is noted as Strange Tales #123 from 1964. However, Mach-4 is a very recent character. Rightly noted in his bio is that he started out as a character called the Beetle, who indeed surfaced around 1964. OK. All fine and dandy. However, when you read the entry on the Speed Demon, his first appearance is listed as Amazing Spider-Man #222 (1981). Later in his entry you read that he started his career as the Squadron Sinister's \\"Whizzer.\\" I have that very issue! And it was Avengers #70 from 1971! So, why do the encyclopedia's authors utilize first-ever appearances pretty much 95% of the time despite what a character eventually became ... but in Speed Demon's case (among a few others) his first appearance is listed as his first appearance as Speed Demon -- when in fact he started out a decade earlier as The Whizzer?SPEAKING OF THE WHIZZER...One of my favorite Marvel super groups is the DC Justice League analogue Squadron Supreme. This group exists in the Marvel Universe on a parallel Earth called \\"Earth-S.\\" The leader of the group, Hyperion, has his first appearance listed as Avengers #85. Not noted is that the character Hyperion's first appearance was actually 15 issues earlier in Avengers #70, just like the Whizzer/Speed Demon above. (The Squadron Sinister was retroactively patterned -- see \\"retconning\\" above -- after the Squadron Supreme by an evil higher-order cosmic being ... Marvel writers apparently decided that a good group of these heroes wouldn't be such a bad idea!) In mainstream Marvel continuity, the Squadron Supreme at one time attempted to use their powers to take over their world in what was essentially a benevolent dictatorship. When they realized this wasn't a good idea, they dismantled their programs and became \\"ordinary\\" heroes. Eventually the team was whisked away from their world (to ours) by their arch-enemy; when they made it back years later, an oligarchic compendium had assumed world control, and in a 1998 special edition issue the situation was left as the Squadron continuing to fight this compendium for the world's freedom. So it says in Hyperion's bio. However, when you read the Squadron's own bio in the Encyclopedia, it says at entry's end that \\"the Squadron has now successfully liberated their own world from the grip of various monolithic corporations ...\\"!! So which is it, Marvel?? One entry says they're still fighting (the correct entry) and another says they've won already! It's doubtful I'd have missed a follow-up issue detailing their victory over the oligarchy as I'm always on the look-out for Squadron Supreme storylines, natch.1941: A GOOD YEARIn the most egregious example of lousy proofreading, the year \\"1941\\" appears an inordinate amount of times as a character's first appearance. This was the year in which the famous Captain America made his first-ever appearance, but other characters ...? On page 229 of the book, both the villain Proctor and hero Prodigy's first appearances are listed as 1941! Prodigy is even listed as having his debut in Captain America Comics #1!! Proctor's first issue is correct (Avengers #344) but that issue appeared in the 1990s, not 1941 as listed!! There were several other characters erroneously listed as having their first appearance as 1941, but I didn't write their names down and I can't recall all of them at the moment. Nevertheless, the year 1941 wasn't the only boo-boo; the dates of many characters' debuts were botched. One I recall immediately was Kitty Pryde's from X-Men fame. Her debut issue number is correct, but the year listed is 1994. The correct year is 1980!CONCLUSIONFairly new comics fans will take delight at this book. Older fans will still dig it, but as noted will wonder how a work of this magnitude managed to get published with all the errors -- especially when Marvel bigwigs Tom Brevoort and Tom DeFalco were contributing writers!!"},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"In the style of their 2004 publication, \\"The DC Comics Encyclopedia,\\" Dorling Kindersley have released \\"The Marvel Encyclopedia,\\" a guide to the characters of the Marvel Comics universe. DK are no strangers to Marvel's universe, having frequently released \\"Ultimate Guide\\" books covering the histories of Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Hulk, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and next year, Ghost Rider. But how does this tome, touted as \\"the definitive guide,\\" stack up?The sheer number of characters included is absolutely massive, with over 1000 separate entries for characters that span the past and present of the Marvel Universe, and even occupants of other dimensions, timelines and alternate universes (such as MC-2 characters like Spider-Girl, or occupants of the future of 2099). Each entry is headed with a table that provides a quick hit of info from the character's vital stats to their real names, first appearances and powers. The body of the entry provides an abbreviated origin and history for the character, bringing things up as recent as possible at the time of writing, and includes at least one image of the character. Standard entries are a paragraph long - of such a size that, barring larger pictures, about six can fit on a single page. At no time does such a thing occur, however, as entries range from being this size to quarter-page, half-page, full-page, and for the most notable characters and teams like Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, double-page spreads. Entries are signed with the initials of their writers - contributing Marvel editors Tom DeFalco and Tom Brevoort, X-Men: Ultimate Guide writer Peter Sanderson, and other scripters Michael Teitelbaum, Daniel Wallace and Andrew Darling, who have all contributed to other Dorling Kindersley comic guide books.The bulk of characters chosen for inclusion seem to have been fairly heavily based on the 1980's edition of Marvel's own guidebook publication, also written by Sanderson, \\"The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe,\\" (leading to one or two odd naming conventions, such as the original Captain Marvel being listed as \\"Captain Mar-Vell\\") with more entries added for characters created since then. The range of characters is simply astounding, from the company's figureheads to hilariously obscure nobody do-nothings, which gives readers unfamiliar with the depth and breadth of the Marvel Universe a brilliantly expansive look at its past and present.For regular Marvelites, however, some choices are sure to be questioned - and since I am a Marvelite, here's a couple for ya. Why does Energizer, of kid-team Power Pack, get her own entry, while none of her team-mates do? Why does obscure Golden Age monster It, The Living Colossus, get an entry when the most famous of such creatures, Fin Fang Foom - active in comics as recent as six months ago - does not? Where is the entry for the biggest X-Men villain of recent years, Cassandra Nova? Why does major cosmic villain Thanos receive only a standard-size entry, while no-namers like Bi-Beast, Chemistro and Plant-Man get half a page? All those things said, however, this is very much the complaint of a man who might know a bit too much for his own good. I also own the DC Encyclopedia, and, as I know a lot less about that universe, so I can't make these complaints about it - but I guarantee that major DC fans will have said exactly the same thing about that book. It's a case, I feel, of being a little too close to the subject matter.What is certainly NOT a subjective issue, however, is the topic of errors. Such a publication will always be susceptible to mistakes, and more than are comfortable have crept into the finished product. With men such as DeFalco, Brevoort and Sanderson penning entries, one expects... well, perfection, frankly. These are chaps who know it all. And in fairness, the entries scripted by them are the best of the book. It is those by the other writers that have proven the weakest link. In fairness to all involved, however, there are very few outright ERRORS in the book - there are just instances of outdated information. For example, the Space Phantom's entry recounts his origin as an alien from the planet Phantos, which was retconned out as of 1998. The Mandarin and Blacklash are stated to be alive, when both have been dead for over half a decade. The Mole Man's real name is listed as \\"Unknown,\\" when it has been known to be Harvey Rupert Elder for about eight years. Emma Frost's entry is probably the most embarrassing example of these - it only goes as far as her involvement with Generation X, neglecting to mention the fact that she has been a member of the X-Men for five years, is now romantically involved with Cyclops, and has acquired the power to transform into diamond.Then, there are the real mistakes, which are distinctly minimal, but present nonetheless, with the entry for \\"Warlock\\" being the worst example. In the Marvel Universe, there are two characters named \\"Warlock\\" - the genetically engineered cosmic hero ADAM Warlock, and the New Mutants ally and member of the alien race called the Technarcy. The entry for Warlock covers the former, but throughout the book, references to the Technarcy alien suggest that the Warlock entry is for him. Furthermore, both characters are connected to two separate characters known as \\"the Magus\\" - one is the evil future self of Adam Warlock, the other the father of the alien Warlock. The same error occurs - the article is about the alien father, but other articles indicate that it is about the evil future self.Outright mistakes most frequently come in the form of pictures, however - once in a blue moon, an entry is simply illustrated with an incorrect image. In most cases, you can understand the goof - for example, Aquarian's entry being illustrated with an image of Zodiac member Aquarius, Happy Hogan's entry picturing CRUSHER Hogan, or Nightshade's entry being paired with a picture of the OTHER character called Nightshade - but that doesn't excuse it. Warlock and the Magus's errors are compounded further by these - although the man illustration of Warlock's entry is right, an inset image depicts the alien Warlock, while the Magus's entry is completely screwed up, being decorated with a picture of neither alien nor future self, but DOC MAGUS, a completely unrelated character from Spider-Girl's universe!!With DeFalco as Consultant Editor, I have no doubt that most if not all of these mistakes would have been caught had there been a little more time for production, but it seems very much as though the book has been released now to get it out in time for Christmas, and to in turn capitalise on the current bout of high profile popularity Marvel is undergoing thanks to their huge Civil War crossover event.But seriously, folks - in spite of the flubs I have noted here, please, please remember that for every one entry that slips up, SCORES more are spot-on perfect. I genuinely recommend the book, for new readers and those wanting to learn more, if nothing else. For dyed-in-the-wool Marvelites... well, it was never going to be better than the OHOTMU, was it? Heck, even that had its share of mistakes."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"The Marvel Encyclopedia is a heavy, heavy book rich with tons of information about characters and of course great art for each character. The problem with this book is like everyone says - it has tons of errors, is not always up-to-date, and is missing a lot of key characters (which is strange because there are so many minor characters there).In almost every entry, they'll talk about another character (e.g., for DIRE WRAITHS, they'll talk about ROM), but every time the other character they mention isn't in the book (ROM isn't in the book, of course). We're not talking about a couple of characters -- we're talking tons of major characters. This does get really, really annoying.But the pro is that this book is still a fun read (it may be heavy for a bathroom book, but it works). If you're a comic collector or looking for a gift for a comic collector, this is a must-have, especially at Amazon.com's prices (I wouldn't pay the full price for it at Borders or Barnes & Noble). I would get the DC COMICS ENCYCLOPEDIA before this one, because that one was edited much better.Am I annoyed by the extremely sloppy editing and way this book is put together? Yes. Do I regret buying the book? No. It still gets 4-stars for being such a great book chock full of interesting info. It doesn't get that one extra star for being a little bit annoying."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"Well designed, nicely laid-out with a generally high standard of artwork (although some of the older material is of a much lower resolution than one might expect to see these days) and certainly good value for money in terms of how much book you get for your buck.But this encylopedia is depressingly full of errors, both typos and factual inaccuracies, particularly in the choice of illustrations, their annotations and the various character summaries. Some of it might be obvious only to fanboys (no-one other than a reader of \\"Alpha Flight\\" would know that the entry for Laura Dean is accompanied by a picture of Zuzha Yu), but even novices will wonder whether entirely human crime boss The Rose should be described as having \\"feathers\\", why the main illo of Johnny Storm has him wearing a backwards 4 on his chest, or why an \\"eleven-year-old\\" Jean Grey is depicted as an infant.Unlike previous reviewers, I think the balance between well-known and obscure characters is about right. No single volume could ever reasonably cover every Marvel character. But the structure of what's here is questionable. Looking at associated entries, it becomes obvious to the reader that The Sworsdman has had an extraordinarily convoluted history, yet his own description is suprisingly terse. Damien Hellstrom gets two separate entries (one as Hellstorm, another as Son of Satan) that are virtually identical, yet the authors seem to have gotten hopelessly muddled on the difference betwen Adam Warlock and the New Mutant called Warlock, to the extent that the latter has been overlooked, despite the fact he's cross-referenced in other entries.This book certainly should have been more thoroughly proof-read before publication, but the fact that so many points of Marvel lore got past Tom Brevoort and Tom deFalco (who was Marvel's editor-in-chief when much of what's described was in print!) is unforgivable."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"As much as I love this book it seems to have some pretty odd errors in it.

It can be readily improved nonetheless and its still a necessary reference work for anyone interested in the Marvel universe."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"The first thing I did when I opened the Marvel Encyclopedia is to test out its thoroughness. Back in the 70's, the Human Torch has his own, short-lived title which as I recall were just reprints of his 1960's adventures from the pages of Strange Tales. In one of these issues he battles perhaps the villain with the worst name in history, \\"Paste Pot Pete\\", an utterly laughable villain. Still, he's suitably obscure enough for my test so I hurriedly paged to the \\"P\\" section but alas...no Pete. But then I recalled that he later changed his name to the vastly superior moniker of The Trapster. I had a second chance! I turned some more pages, and there he was...The Trapster, AKA, Paste Pot Pete. The book did not let me down.The Marvel Encyclopedia is published by DK books and is simply Marvel-ous! If readers remember those old handbook to the Marvel Universe comics that the company did in the 80's, this book is like taking all of those issues and combining them all into one huge 352 page book--an ultimate resource for fans of Marvel Superhero comics. Besides being thorough, the other thing I looked for was the information being current. I'm happy to say that the editors and writers, including former Marvel Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco, have scored here as well. The book is updated to include Marvel's most recent major storylines including Avengers Disassembled and House of M, as well as the events leading up to the current Civil War storyline.The book lists over 1000 Marvel heroes and villains in alphabetical order with notes about their background and powers, notable storylines, as well as their first appearance. Minor characters like Eel, Feral, and Terminus get about a page while major characters such as Spider-man, Captain America and Wolverine warrant a full, two-page spread. Again, the book shines here in being complete and thorough. Captain America's listing takes readers from his origins in the 1940's, to his eventual thawing out in the 60's and becoming an Avenger, and right up to recent storylines like \\"Winter Soldier\\".Even long deceased characters such as Mantis and the Swordsman are included. There are a few quirks, however. While the encyclopedia does include Spider-man 2099, no other 2099 characters. Likewise, and thankfully, the New Universe and even the \\"Ultimate\\" line have been omitted. There are some other omissions that are curious such as Rom The Space Knight but in a book of this kind of undertaking, there are always going to be a few omissions and errors that pop up.The book features a gorgeous wraparound cover by Frank Cho and the interior uses art directly from the comics by a host of Marvel artists throughout the past four decades. Thumbing through the book is like looking at a photo album of old friends, as you will find characters (like Paste Pot Pete) that you have not seen in many years. The Marvel Encyclopedia is a must-have item for Marvel fans and makes for a great gift item.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"I'm not a die-hard Marvel fans by any means, but I've read my share of their comics when I was younger.Usually, I've always sticked to mini-series or Graphic novels, well, any story that would begin and end in itself, without me having to follow its conclusions on a lot of other books.In doing so, I develeloped great admiration for the writers and artists of these comics. Men like John Buscema, Neil Adams, George Perez, Gerry Conway, David Michelinie, Roy Thomas, John Byrne, Jim Starlin... well, you got the picture.So, an encyclopedia like this suits me perfectly.

So when I saw that DK was putting a Marvel one together, I was looking forward to it. Well, it delivers for the most part. In my opinion, I think they left out too many characters. The DC one was more thorough. But all the impotant characters are in it. The art work is straight out of the comics. Everything is formated very nicely, and it's also better than any of the Marvel encyclopedias before it. For the price you can get it for on Amazon, it's a no-brainer!"},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"There are some essencial missing characters in the book, like Peter Parker's clone Ben Riley and Van Helsing - he is just mentioned, and the is a little description about his daughter.But if you want to know about the principle ones, or the ones already movie stars, you will be satisfied, since there are two pages about each of them (i.e. spider-man, hulk, all the x-men, etc...)"},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"Who is Black Bolt??? Who were his partners. Did Marvel ever do any cowboy comics? This baby is jammed-packed with tidbits about more Marvel characters than I knew existed.

THough I'm more familier with the marvel universe it seemed the DC encyclopedia was more up to date with fewer clerical errors such as mislabeled pictures. Also the entries in the DC encyclopedia were more comprehensive which on comparison of the two I realized was because it had smaller print allowing more information. So really the Marvel Encyclopedia is good for a reader that doesn't have a huge body of knowledge of the MU but readers looking for an encyclopedia as well put together as the DC encyclopedia will be dissapointed which is sad since contributing writers were greats like Tom Defalco, Tom Brevoort, and Peter Sanderson."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"There isn't enough information on individual characters.

Want to get that out of the way first. As a basic reference source it's excellent as a geeky coffee table book it's pretty much without peer. It's on my desk at work and at least once a day I get into a vigorous debate or pleasant conversation about Marvel and Marveldom. On a personal level, as the only guy in my neighbourhood who collect all of OHOTMUDE (seriously, the comic guy got one copy of each issue and kept it behind the counter for me), it's just a fun read.Unfortunately, while it could have been much more than that, it's really just a fun read.There are numerous typographical errors, about one every two pages or so. Either the origin issue is wrong, a word is badly misspelled or, as is the case with the entry for the Soviet Super Soldiers, the majority of the illustrated heroes are labelled as \\"Undefined\\" when even this casual comic book fan can remember most of the names. It just didn't go through a final editing spit-and-polish and it shows.Definitely a book that belongs in the collection of your average comic book geek, but it could have been quite a bit better."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"Great book for anyone.

So as all these Marvel movies come out I am one who wants the back story or information on where the story goes next. Where does someone like me turn in these times of crisis with 30 plus years of comics to catch up on? To the Marvel Encyclopedia of course. There are great looking pictures and descriptions for each character or group and the bigger the character or group the more pictures and information on back story is available. It is impossible to get all those years of comics into one book for sure but this is a great place to start for someone who isn't sure where to start but has a new interest.

It's a great collection."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"In this age of wikipedia, you need chutzpah to produce a book with \\"encyclopedia\\" in the title. This is especially true when your book is as full of errors, typos and omissions as is The Marvel Encyclopedia.I think the omissions are the worst thing about the book. I was disappointed to find some of my favorite characters did not have entries. ROM, X-23 and the Micronauts were all missing. Others characters were included in a group's member listing, but did not have their own entry or even an illustration (e.g. many of the earlier Guardians of the Galaxy). A few characters had an entry inappropriately small compared to their importance to the Marvel universe. Thanos, a major cosmic villain, had the smallest entry size (about 1/8 of a page or smaller).My other major complaint is the sloppiness of the illustration editing. Often images are mirrored with hilarious side-effects. Nick Fury's main illustration has him wearing a patch over his right eye. The Human Torch is wearing a backward's 4 in one image. I know that images are often reversed to produce a pleasing layout and to draw the eye through the copy flow. For example, you might want to avoid pictures of people looking off the edge of the page. But you wouldn't want to sacrifice subject matter for the layout!The layout decisions made in this book make me think the layout and editing were done by people so unfamiliar with the subject matter they could not even identify when reversing an image might detract from its meaning or importance. This book, like most DK books, was published in China. I wonder if it was also layed out and edited over there (despite the claims on the credits page, which list prominent Marvel editors)? This would certainly explain the poor editing quality and silly layout choices.Overall, a fun book to thumb through, but frustrating and disappointing once you start looking at it closely. NOT worth the money."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"I loved the DC Encyclopedia and expected the Marvel Encyclopedia to be of equal quality, so I bought it without even cracking the spine. I would expect this to be incomplete and it is: after all, there are just too many Marvel characters for one affordable volume. But in too many instances it's also inconsistent (some entries are up to date while others ignore the events of the last year or two), flat out inaccurate or incomplete. The weight that key characters are given is also arbitrary: why does Thanos (a current, key villain in many titles) get 1/6 of a page when Jarella (the Hulk's dead girlfriend from the 1970s) gets half a page. Ridiciulous. They obviously never handed this to a fan to proofread - an easy and obvious move."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. Many facts were wrong such as first appearances of many of the characters as well as powers were entered incorrectly. Also some major characters had a small amount of room while almost no-names ad half a page. I realy enjoyed the DC Cmics Encyclopedia that DK put out. The Marvel book really let me down.

Marvel IMO has the most extensive comic books characters, both hero and villain, ever written. This encyclopedia will open your eyes to all of those characters, educating you on just about every little detail you need to know about them. I was truly excited (and fascinated) upon receiving this book. Although I read a lot of comic books when I was a child, I was totally unaware of the other characters. This book gave me an insight of the extensiveness of the Marvel World. It is truly a work of art. One of the books you must have if you're a big comic-reader (and will read from time to time)."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"The Marvel Encyclopedia is a fantastic compilation of the characters inhabiting the Marvel universe. It was interesting reading the backgrounds on the wide array of characters as well as where they first appeared (what issue, year, etc.). The more popular characters (Wolverine, Venom, Spiderman, etc.) are usually given one to two pages for their own history and rightly so. There's more of a following and interest in someone like Venom's history as opposed to a lesser known villain that lasted 3 issues in 1974 (and thus is given a postage stamp-sized blurb). Also, I would have to say the deal on Amazon was great. It was $26 here versus a $40 price tag I saw at a local chain book store."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"this book is full of cool things and i really like it and i just love this book . it is so fun to read."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"My son Jarett is 8 yrs old and very much into marvel super heros and especially the villians!!!

For example, what happened to Mary Jane Watsons mother!!!! But the best part is my son carries this huge book around wherever he goes. He reads in the car back and forth to karate practice and even sits on the couch and reads instead of TV or nintendo DS all the time!!!! He has not put it down since he recieved it.

I am, however, a fan of several animated TV shows that feature Marvel characters(X-Men, Iron Man, Spiderman & His Amazing Friends, etc). I wanted to know the back story on them, so I got this book (along with the DC Encyclopedia).The characters are featured in alphabetical order. We are given a brief but detailed history along with at least one illustration. There is also a profile that lists their \\"real\\" name, occupation, height, weight, eye/hair color, & a list of their powers or talents. The more prominent the character, the larger their layout is.The hardcover is fairly large. I have looked through it several times & have learned a lot. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the DC version seemed to be a little more thorough. For instance, it includes each characters hero/villain status while the Marvel book doesn't. For a non-comic fan, like me, that info would be nice to have up-front."},{"Title":"The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe","review":"The Marvel Encyclopedia is a good quick-reference for those not very familiar with the comic world. For those who have been avid comic book geeks for years, the information in the Marvel Encyclopedia is not likely to be detailed or thorough enough to satisfy their curiosity. Most characters don't get more than a paragraph of information, and even the most popular characters (i.e. the Fantastic Four) only get one page that is at least half images of the characters from various story lines. The images are great - no complaints there - and it is nice to have info on the more obscure and forgotten characters that may have appeared only once in the 80's.

I am leaving this review to warn anyone who is learning this subject to runaway very fast from this book, you won't learn anything and you'll suffer... There are many better convective heat transfer books out there. The only good thing about this book is the numerous references to other books.On a last note: If you're learing this subject don't believe the reviewers that gave this book five stars, they must be paying off a debt to Bejan or have 30+ years experience in convective heat transfer!"},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"I get the impression that the reader from NH is the only reviewer to have tried to solve some of the problems in this book. There is no possible way to solve these problems. They are on subjects and situations not covered in the book, and even if they were, good luck in understanding Bejan's writing. He skips massive steps, giving only solutions and equations without explanations. Not everyone like reviewer Jeff Booth was born understanding convective heat transfer, so some of us must learn from books. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one. I only hope that Dr. Bejan reads these reviews and that they discourage him from making another failed attempt at text book writing."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"Bejan's book may look polemic because all the topics in convection heat transfer he had to review, and sometimes correct some &quot;historically assumed&quot; mistakes. There is detailed physical explanation of every phenomena. There are very few good books in heat transfer in the market. This is the best."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"Bejan's CHT book gives an innovative exposure to convective heat transfer. The Scaling analysis, which is explored throughout the text, unquestionably sets this book apart from its competitors. On top of that, the book also brings the latest developments in Constructal theory. I strongly recommend this book to grad and undergrad students interested in convective heat transfer."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"This is an excellent book. I have benefited a lot from this exceptional book for years. I have been using this book as a textbook in my Convective Heat Transfer course which I am offering constantly every year.It is a well written and designed book stimulating creative thinking. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"With this book, Bejan makes convection heat transfer \\"streamlined\\". Powerful --yet simple and handy-- tools such as constructal theory, scale analysis, intersection of asymptotes method, heatlines, etc., are presented and used in the book to provide readers with a deep understanding of how and why things are happening the way they are. The author's viewpoint on the field is refreshing and original. This is the one book that I would recommend to graduate students interested in convection heat transfer."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"This is by far the worst textbook I have had for any class. As a graduate student in mechanical engineering I suggust anyone who thinks to use this book to avoid it. Bejan is the most arrogant writer I have ever seen. He cuts the most complex areas of his proofs out of the book, plus there is not a single example in it. THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"The quality of the book was great. It looked new. Apparently it was sent to me from South Korea but it got to me in two or three days which wasn't bad at all. The book itself is a valuable resource on convection heat transfer. Adrian Bejan uses approaches quite different yet easier to understand that most or all other popular books on the same subject."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"I never got around to buying this textbook, but I did borrow the 2nd edition of this text from my convection professor as I was studying for the ph.d. prelim exam this last Spring. I read through much of this book very thoroughly and developed some strong feelings on the quality of the text. I feel Professor Bejan, in writing this book, assumed the readers had some background in the subject (or were mathematically curious on their own to fill in many of the gaps he left). I say this because Prof. Bejan is often very brief in the derivation of equations and simply states in words what must be done to manipulate governing equations into the forms he presents. Though this may even be a pedagogical tool of his. Nothing proves his point better than having to go through the math on your own and matching what he's said will happen. Though getting stuck on some small mathematical simplification is very frustrating for someone new to the subject and for that reason alone, this book should almost necessarily be accompanied by with some other classical convection textbook (i.e. Burmeister'sConvective Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition, Kays & Crawford'sMP for Convective Heat & Mass Transfer, or even Incropera & Dewitt'sIntroduction to Heat Transfer).But for what Prof. Bejan might be lacking in the derivations, he makes up for in stunningly clear insight and unbeatable discussions that he arrives at (often through his scaling treatments -- more than once during my prelim exam I found myself quoting the scaling analysis from his chapter on natural convection). Prof. Bejan has a unique philosophy on engineering mathematics and it is, like I've said already, a truly excellent complement to everything else I've read on the subject of convection heat transfer. I don't think this text is suitable for reference in an undergraduate class or for one who needs an introduction to the conservation laws. But any graduate student with a focus in heat transfer owes themselves to find a copy of this text and read through it."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"A.Bejan gave to the field of thermal sciences a new breath. His particular touch and way of thinking leads to unexplored scientific and technical territories. Due to its original spirit for thermal sciences and, more generally, for physics, the book, Convection Heat Transfer , presents the essential keys of the field for the engineering students but also for researchers. I usually recommend this elegant book to my students."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"The best book I own. I have people lining up outside my office to borrow it. No kidding, it is that clear and concise. The development of scale arguments is without parallel. The number of extra tidbits all over the place continues to come in handy. I can't tell you the number of times I was able to skip some simulation by using some Bejan.PS - The reader from NH is a whiner! Get real man, do a little thinking on your own.PPS - Lienhard &amp; Lienhard have posted their general heat transfer text (3rd Ed.) for free download off the MIT site. Their book is also a real winner."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"I am a mechanical engineering graduate student specialized in heat transfer. For the courses I have taken in convection and also for my research, the Bejan book was and will be as a very useful reference. The analysis and simplicity of the book helps a lot in understanding the physics of convective H.T. The best parts of the book are though, the detailed scale analysis for each phenomena. No empirical formalae in this book, without physical interpretation."},{"Title":"Convection Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition","review":"This book is revolutionary. It has clearly dispelled the age-old tactics and misinterpretations most widely presented in books of fluid mechanics and heat transfer of today.This book is 'must-read' for every aspiring student in the field of fluids and thermal sciences."},{"Title":"Her Secret Children (Silhouette Romance #1648)","review":"Vicky Sutton thinks that she will never have children.

What she finds there is something else instead."},{"Title":"Her Secret Children (Silhouette Romance #1648)","review":"\\"Her Secret Children\\" is the first book that I read by Judith McWillians and the first Silhouette Romance that I have read in a very long while. In this book American Vicky Sutton learns that her frozen eggs were given to an English couple, the result is twins. Wanting to see her children, Vicky goes to England were she meets James Thayer, thier father.While I liked the plot I have admitt I wished that the story was given more time to develop.

Zane ruined any chance of her agreeing to ever marry again.So when the lawyers contacted her about her eggs being illegally used to produce children without her consent she was at first angry, then on second thoughts, estactic.She had a son, Edmund and daughter, Mary Rose by an English aristocrat who does not want to share his twins with her.James Edward Andrew William Thayer was not about to share custody of his babies with some American mom. Then Vicky shows up claiming to be Ms. Lascoe [her lawyer] and she invades his domain.Suddenly things get changed - Vicky faces down the pompous Nanny and insists that James can see his children when he decides not when Nanny says.She interfers and agrees with Aunt Sophie that she should be allowed to wear her costume jewelry outside the home if she wants.Vicky also does the unthinkable - she show interest in James collection of rare maps.

The illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard appear to be original from the copyright date of 1926. By the publication date of 1995, Pooh and his friends had a new, more cartoon-quality look and this book would have benefited from an update there.Pooh meets Eeyore as the two are out and about and Pooh notices immediately that Eeyore's tail is missing. He offers to help his friend and seeks out Owl to get advice. Owl suggests a sign, offering a reward. Christopher Robinson, he says, is the one to write it. When he shows Pooh the signs outside his own front door, Pooh notices Owl's unusual bell-rope. It's Eeyore's tail! He takes it back to Eeyore and Christopher Robin reattaches it, much to Eeyore's delight.The sturdy board book pages are a plus, as is the very simple, basic text. It has made me laugh my entire life, to read \\"Christopher Robin nailed it in its right place again.\\" - certainly a funny reminder that Pooh and friends are stuffed animals. The text is minimal, making this a good book for beginning readers. I love Winnie the Pooh, but I'm not a fan of the illustrations in this one.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Eeyore Loses a Tail","review":"This funny and sturdy board book is a great introduction to Winnie-the-Pooh and his world of mischief and misunderstanding. In this story, Winnie points out that to Eeyore, the pessimistic donkey, that he lost his tail, and then goes off on the search for it. The story ends happily with the help of Pooh's best friend Christopher Robin and the Owl. This story is very simple and shorter than a lot of other A. A. Milne's stories, but it is accompanied with nice illustrations and is a good introduction to words for a beginning reader. I would recommend it to a parent of a very young child as an inexpensive way to enlarge a budding reader's book collection."},{"Title":"Mandarin gold;: A novel","review":"This fiction, built around the history of the British Empire's long Far Eastern flirtation with drug running, is a terrific and informative read.Jardine and Mathieson, the now respectable Hong Kong banking house, got its start in the banking business: shipping boatloads of opium from British India, to the Chinese, against the wishes of their emperor, but with the support of the British government.Pablo Escobar, eat your heart out.Poor old Pablo had to fight a bloody war with the Columbian government and its ally the US DEA, to stay in business and eventually bit the dust in a bloody shoot-out with Columbian and US government agents.A hundred years earlier, all J & M had to do was have a quiet word with the British Foreign Minister, Palmerston and the Royal Navy did J and M's dirty work to ensure that the product got through to their Chinese customers, blasting ancient Chinese junks out of the way in the process.This is Leasor at his best, combining fact and fiction to give the reader a good page turning read and some historical insight into the bargain.The fictional and historical characters are interwoven seamlessly as are social structures, making an excellent plot ring true.The stultifying power structure of Chinese society at the time is excellently represented.Buy and enjoy it. Its an absolute steal at the price."},{"Title":"Madeline Vionnet","review":"Gorgeous photographs, beautifully written, great explanations and patterns, too!

Almost all of the sites are listed on other tourist sources, and the majority of the 'off path' information consists of individual restaurant and B&amp;B reviews. Almost of all of those are pretty glowing and effusive, and read like advertising copy.The Green Guide has a lot more information all around and is better laid out for a very similar price."},{"Title":"Quebec Off the Beaten Path, 4th (Off the Beaten Path Series)","review":"Only being able to spend a few short days in Quebec City, this book gave me insight to all of the great little places to go. I loved all of the historical information. However, I wish it gave a few more restaurant suggestions because there are so many good places to eat in Quebec City."},{"Title":"Offshore Pioneers: Brown & Root and the History of Offshore Oil and Gas","review":"For anyone interested in the beginnings of the marine oil and gas industry, Offshore Pioneers provides a good general history. Since this book was commissioned by Brown &amp; Root, you should expect a certain level of bias. Brown &amp; Root's achievements are obviously highlighted while their defeats are understandably downplayed. This history includes the significant roles of other participants, though mainly in relation to Brown &amp; Root, either as competitor, customer or co-venturer. Beginning with the first baby-steps in offshore exploration (long platforms connecting shore to site), this history lesson progresses to the innovation and ingenuity necessary to explore and exploit hydrocarbons from new environments, such as Lake Maracaibo, the Bay of Campeche, California (short lived program though it was) and the North Sea. As an offshore service analyst, I constantly seek out information on the industry, whether current or historical. Brown and Root did play a large role in the development of the offshore oil and gas industry, from constructing the first platforms out into the Gulf of Mexico, engineering massive North Sea structures, laying pipe in several environments, building construction barges and performing project management. My father had worked for the company for 25 years, and I had already developed an appreciation for their can-do attitude and willingness to work in any environment. If you're looking for a history of the industry's humble beginnings, this is a great book to read. However, Brown &amp; Root ceased being a major force in the offshore energy industry during the 1980's, so don't expect to find any recent history in this work."},{"Title":"Offshore Pioneers: Brown & Root and the History of Offshore Oil and Gas","review":"This is the history of Brown &amp; Root's Marine Division. Drawing heavily from their knowledge of building warships during World War II, Brown &amp; Root installed the first oil platform out of sight from land off the coast of Louisiana for the Kerr Magee Oil Company in 1947. This was Brown &amp; Root's entry into the offshore construction market. They kept building and installing platforms in increasing depths of the Gulf of Mexico as well as venturing into offshore spots around the world, such as off the coast of Alaska and the most famous offshore location of the North Sea. The book details many of these large well known projects as well as Project Mohole, the cancelled program to drill into the Earth's core from an ocean drill ship. Brown &amp; Root was a participant in this project. An interesting book for anyone who has worked in the offshore oil industry or has an interest in it."},{"Title":"Offshore Pioneers: Brown & Root and the History of Offshore Oil and Gas","review":"Offshore Pioneers describes how Brown and Root was willing to take on all manner of applied engineering and construction challenges as oil and gas production moved offshore and into harsher and harsher conditions. The authors follow the industry and document how Brown and Root demonstrated a can-do culture that still exists today as the Company responded to solve oil companies' problems with engineering skill and by extending known practices."},{"Title":"Offshore Pioneers: Brown & Root and the History of Offshore Oil and Gas","review":"I discovered that this book existed when the Houston Chronicle mentioned its coverage of the Ixtoc blowout/oil spill in the Bay of Campeche relative to the BP blowout off Louisiana. And, I was glad to find it and read it. I actually worked in the Brown & Root marine division as a structural engineer for about a year in the early 1970's. So, I knew some of the key players in this book and am familiar with some of the specific history covered. Also, a couple of my college classmates worked for B&R; in the international offshore pipeline construction area.I have to admit that reading this book made me wonder if I made the right decision to leave B&R; to work for another engineering consulting company. I could see that staying with B&R; Marine Division meant that I'd have to move around the world to move up the organization chart and I wasn't sure I wanted to do that. But, reading this book reinforced what I surely knew then - that what B&R; was doing in offshore structures was about the most interesting and challenging possible work for a structural engineer. As this book clearly describes, much of what B&R; was doing in this area was cutting edge and unique. I remember the situation being such that for a lot of offshore work, only B&R; or McDermott were candidates because they were the only companies in the world with the engineering knowhow to do it. And, I was offered a job at McDermott and I considered them to be a half step behind B&R.; Engineers such as Jay Weidler, Al Crossman, Larry Starr, Max Koehler and Stan Hruska were truly exceptional talents and their expertise shaped this history of extraordinary accomplishments.But, as far as this book goes in terms of being a history of the key events, there is a glaring omission. Because of their dominant market positions, Brown & Root and McDermott were charged with bid rigging/price fixing relative to the offshore platform business. I vaguely remember the project engineer I worked under telling me once that he thought B&R; and McDermott kind of \\"took turns\\" winning certain bids because both companies were so busy it didn't make sense to go all out to compete hard to win each bid. That sounds reasonable unless you realize, as I didn't at the time, that it's illegal as hell. So, B&R; and several executives were indicted in 1978, the company paid a big fine and, most shockingly, the president of B&R;, Foster Parker, committed suicide. A pretty big deal by almost any standard and not the kind of thing that could be omitted in any \\"history\\" book. I guess this book was commissioned by B&R; or some people from B&R;, so overlooking how this amazing technological edge led to something so sinister and embarassing is understandable as long as you accept that the authors are more PR flacks than real historians.So, I enjoyed the book for the reasons I listed, but I hated the fact that some very interesting aspects of the whole history were strategically omitted. If you're interested in a \\"house organ\\" style history of the development of this technology, you'll almost surely enjoy this book. If you're looking for the whole story, this won't be it."},{"Title":"I Know A Story","review":"I remember years ago as a child my father bringing this home as a discarded book from the school he worked at. I loved reading this as a child. I used this to reinforce reading with my kids and they loved it as much as I did. I am so glad it is available as a used book on amazon as my kid's have been vying for my copy of this book. Beautiful pictures and great stories for the young reader. I Know A Story is the first in the series. I also recommend It Happened One Day and After the Sun Sets. These books are also good to read to your young one. Makes reading fun for the reader and the listener."},{"Title":"Film Noir Reader","review":"I'm including reviews of both \\"Film Noir Reader\\" and \\"Film Noir Reader 2\\" in the same review until Amazon gets the two books unlinked.FILM NOIR READER (1)\\"Film Noir Reader\\" is a collection of 22 essays about film noir, written between the mid-1950s and mid-1990s by a diverse group of film theorists, including a few essays by the editors themselves, Alain Silver and James Ursini. Some of the essays are illustrated with black-and-white photographs. Mr. Silver takes the opportunity of the book's Introduction to deliver a scathing rebuttal of French critic Marc Vernet's views before commenting on the book's content.\\"Film Noir Reader\\" has three parts: Part I is \\"Seminal Essays\\", which include 8 essays written 1955-1979. An excerpt from Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton's seminal 1955 book \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\" is included, as well as Paul Schrader's essential 1972 essay \\"Notes on Film Noir\\". Other essays discuss film noir's visual style, existential motifs, and there is a very interesting essay by Paul Kerr on the circumstances that caused B movies, including B-noirs, to flourish in the 1940s. Part II, \\"Case Studies\\", includes 8 essays about specific films and directors, all but one addressing films of the classic noir period. Essays are dedicated to directors John Farrow and Anthony Mann, while others discuss the films \\"Phantom Lady\\", \\"Angel Face\\", \\"The Killers\\", \\"Night and the City\\", \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\", \\"Hickey and Boggs\\", and \\"The Long Goodbye\\". Part III, \\"Noir Then and Now\\", includes 6 articles that seemed not to fit into Part I or Part II, including a few about neo-noir films. Karen Hollinger discusses the effects of first-person male voiceovers on the images of female characters in classic film noir. Others essays explore films that feature fugitive couples, noir television series, neo-B noirs, and Jeremy G. Butler writes about \\"Miami Vice\\".The date of first publication is clearly stated for all essays in Part I, but I found myself wondering when some of the other essays had been written. Publication information, including dates, are provided for each essay at the end of the book's Acknowledgments. There are some interesting and essential essays in \\"Film Noir Reader\\", and some less so, but the book provides a nice collection of opinions and observations on the style that are great food for thought for noir fans and scholars.FILM NOIR READER 2\\"Film Noir Reader 2\\" is a collection of 24 essays, written 1945-1999, that attempt to define the film noir sensibility and explore particular films and facets of the style in depth. This book shares the same format with the first \\"Film Noir Reader\\": Essays are arranged in 3 parts. Part I contains \\"More Seminal Essays\\" that augment the defining material in \\"Film Noir Reader\\". There are 8 essays, written 1945-1988, including a surprising article written by Lloyd Shearer for \\"The New York Times\\" in 1945. A year before French film critics identified and began to discuss the film noir style, Shearer plainly recognized a distinct trend in Hollywood toward \\"lusty, hard-boiled, gut-and-gore crime stories, all fashioned on a theme with a combination of plausibly motivated murder and studded with high-powered Freudian implication.\\" Pretty neat definition only 4 years into the noir movement. And Shearer goes on to ask \\"why at this time are so many pictures of the same type being made?\\" Funny that his article should be reproduced in a book that is still trying to answer that question 60 years later. Shearer's article is followed by French critic Nino Frank's 1946 essay in which the term \\"noir\\" was first applied to film. For all the talk of film noir having been created in the minds of critics after the fact, it's apparent that these writers comprehended the existence of film noir style as it was being created.Part II is dedicated to \\"Case Studies\\". It includes 8 essays that discuss \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" (1946 & 1981 versions), \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\", \\"The Big Heat\\", \\"The File on Thelma Jordan\\", \\"Pushover\\", the neo-noirs \\"Mississippi Mermaid\\" and \\"Badlands\\", as well as the films of directors Alfred Hitchcock and Samuel Fuller. There is also an essay by Francis M. Nevins on films adapted from the works of Cornell Woolrich and an essay by Robert G. Porfino on jazz music in film noir. Part III, \\"The Evolution of Noir\\", is an eclectic assortment of 8 essays. Topics include: noir science fiction, British film noir, abstract expressionism in film noir, female protagonists in neo-noir, and tabloid/crime photographer WeeGee's (Arthur Fellig) relationship to film noir, including discussion of the 1992 film \\"Public Eye\\" that was inspired by his career. Film professor Philip Gaines provides an outline of his film noir course, with recommended films and suggested reading. I'd like to mention, in response to Linda Brookover's essay on WeeGee, that although WeeGee's talent for self-promotion was equal to his gift for photojournalism, his photographs were not unique. The work of many excellent and tireless crime photographers adorned the pages of daily newspapers in the 1920s-1950s. Some of them can be seen in the \\"New York Noir\\" gallery of the \\"New York Daily News\\" archive at www.dailynewspix.com . Tabloid photography is usually overlooked as an influence on film noir, so I'm glad that Ms. Brookover has addressed that oversight, even if I don't entirely agree with her assessment."},{"Title":"Film Noir Reader","review":"Barring an English translation of Borde and Chaumeton's seminal Panorama du Film Noir Am&eacute;ricain, this collection may well be the most valuable Film Noir reference available. It gathers nearly all the most important essays and articles of the last 40 years, including the introduction to the above-mentioned work by Borde and Chaumeton, Paul Schrader's &quot;Notes on Film Noir&quot;, Raymond Durgnat's &quot;Family Tree of Film Noir&quot; and Higham and Greenberg's &quot;Black Cinema&quot; chapter from Hollywood in The Forties. The collection is exceptionally valuable, if rather poorly edited; I wouldn't suggest throwing out one's original, dog-eared copies of the items mentioned above. The book also suffers from a difficult-to-read sans serif typeface. Still, you're unlikely to find all these valuable articles together in any other book. That alone makes it a valuable buy."},{"Title":"Film Noir Reader","review":"Silver and Ursini's 1996 anthology has quickly become an essential tome for students of film noir everywhere, and with very good reason. Divided into three parts - \\"Seminal Essays\\", \\"Case Studies\\" and \\"Noir Then and Now\\" - it offers a comprehensive selection of essays defining the genre in general and exploring specific instances and variations over the last 70-odd years. Even without the other volumes, this is pretty much all a college-level film student could need or desire for building a solid understanding of the genre and appreciating the central debates it's aroused. General viewers/readers, however, can probably do without the specialist jargon, arcane hair-splitting, and density of argumentation that ultimately consume any academic discipline, and the personal attacks: a large part of Silver's introduction is, astonishingly, dedicated to poleaxing other writers - quite pointedly, Marc Vernet, in whose misspelling of Silver's name Silver reads a dark tendency towards pre-judgment and other fatal flaws in Vernet's critical apparatus, such as a solipsistic arrogance that can presume to correct anomalies it does not understand. Whatever, Alan. Sorry - Alain. If you're writing your own academic essays, or enjoy probing the neuroses of disgruntled academics, then that kind of thing might be useful to you. But general readers will be much better served by one of the dozens of non-academic survey volumes, such as those by Barry Gifford (God forgive me, Alain, I know you hate him so), or, if they're feeling more adventurous, Nicholas Christopher's \\"Somewhere in the Night\\" which gives a fluent and accessible exploration of film noir by using the American city as a way into it."},{"Title":"Film Noir Reader","review":"This is a very good anthology of noir criticism. It contains three of the first assessments of noir in English, by Higham, Durgnat and Schrader right next to each other - boom, boom, boom - so one can see the criticism of noir developing before one's eyes.The rest of the essays/arcticles are mostly very interesting. There is one on John Farrow, who is usually overlooked, so it is good to see his films grouped together and examined. The essay on Anthony Mann's noirs is quite strong, and Ursini's article on noir TV, shows such as &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; and &quot;The Fugitive&quot; is very interesting and makes one wish that there were more written on this part of TV history.I think this would be an essential part of any noir fan's library."},{"Title":"Film Noir Reader","review":"Perhaps I expected something more. The essays in this book are often repetitive and non-progressional in subject matter. The softcover version of the book has stills that are more brown and white than black and white... For my money, I am a bigger fan of Hirsch's &quot;The dark side of the screen&quot;. It is a well thought, well researched look at noir with a cohesive structure. This all is not to say that a majority of the essays in the Reader are not helpful. Of course it is great to read Schrader's piece and some others which deal with nice specifics (how economics affected growth of B genre, lighting, etc.) but at the end of the day I feel too many of the essays are only about defining the genre (or not genre) rather than delving into other things. Also, I probably will buy more books by these authors simply because their care for noir is so true and strong..."},{"Title":"Film Noir Reader","review":"It's what in academia is sometimes disparagingly called a \\"non book,\\" a collection of essays with a few contributions by the editors. In this case, it happens to be quite a good non book. The contributors seem to know what they're talking about. Some of the essays are older than others, so it's not exactly a snapshot in time, but that's not bad in itself. The focuses run from early gangster films through the so-called neo noirs of the 1970s and after. (They're the ones in color.)Here is how Todd Erikson describes the jelling of the genre.\\"What made the noir films of the forties such as Double indemnity, The Killers, and Out of the Past so revolutionary in their day was that they distorted the viewer's psychological reference points by establishing a new set of generic codes. This new set of generic codes incorporated iconography from the detective and gangster genres, the distinctive narrative voice (or attitude) of the hard-boiled writers, and the first-person sensibility of the expressionistic subjective camera, through which the underworld could be experienced vicariously by the viewer.\\"Now, that's writing that both informed and informative. The prose is not for the casual viewer. It's not for tabloid fans. It's a little challenging. You have to think twice about \\"generic codes\\" and \\"iconography\\" and \\"expressionistic,\\" but it condenses a good deal of data in a relatively small space.I'm hardly an expert on the subject of film noir and I admit to not having read this book from cover to cover, page by page, all 327 of them, seriatim. But it's not that kind of a book anyway. It's more like an encyclopedia than a novel. You don't gobble it all down, you have to dabble in it.I was grateful that it wasn't one of those heavily philosophical treatises. I wasn't overwhelmed with aesthetic theory. If Derrida and folk of that ilk showed up, I happily missed them. \\"Phenomenology\\" popped up once in a while, true, but at least I know what that means -- at least I THINK I know what it means. I have a feeling that if you asked 100 philosophers to define \\"phenomenology\\" you'd get 100 different definitions. At any rate, I found I sometimes stumbled (or levitated) but it wasn't like running into a brick wall. There are a good number of illustrative photos, mostly frames from the films, that help the reader along.Some of the essays are particularly useful. Paul Schrader concentrates on two elements of a production that help to define it as \\"noir\\". Fir instance, the use of lighting dramatic enough to distinguish it from, say, a television situation comedy. He even goes to the trouble of explaining key lights, fill lights, back lights, and kick lights. He doesn't assume you already know what they are. I rather like being treated as someone who knows practically nothing, especially on subjects about which I know practically nothing. The second focus of his attention is camera angles and placement within the setting, which he reasonably treats as equal in importance. Of course Schrader acknowledges the importance of other noir elements, the femme fatale, the revenge motive, the fatalism, and the rest."},{"Title":"Film Noir Reader","review":"I give this book two stars instead of one because it fills a gap in my film noir book collection, but I have to say it has dated badly. I bought because I loved Alain Silver's book Noir Style, which is a collection of black-and-white stills from film noir classics, with marvelous commentary. But the Film Noir Reader opens with a collection of essays from the 1970s that display everything bad about the 70s, academic, pretentious, pompous, over-anxious to establish a high-brow status for a low-brow art form (at least it was then). In the 2nd and 3rd sections, the \\"up-to-date\\" essays, we get, for instance, an analysis of the TV show Miami Vice in terms of its film noir elements...

Her brother Harold and his wife Marilyn wanted someone to go with them on their summer vacation to help with the children,Stephen 8, Patricia 5 and a neighbor's child 4 yr-old Timmy. The reason they needed help was because both Mr and Mrs Rutherford were in golf tournaments, and they couldn't take their young children who would be bored.So Sara took the job, but her first encounter with Daniel Timmy's uncle wasn't a good one, and although he said he was sorry, he continued to antagonize Sara.From the beginning I knew it was because he was in love with her, but he was determined not to fall into what he considered a trap.

Herrmann, PhD, MFTAuthor of \\"William Everson: The Shaman's Call\\"This is one of my favorite books! In my late thirties, I carried In Midlife around with me in my briefcase. I would pull it out to read it over and over again. In Midlife signaled Stein's first seminal emergence as a writer. Here, he speaks of midlife's passage as: \\"a crossing-over from one psychological identity to another\\" (3), and having it at your arms reach can helped you understand what you or a friend or a family member or a client is going through during this tumultuous period. About the midlife state of affairs Stein writes: \\"The midlife crisis typically brings about the astonishing recognition of our own hidden-away madness. Midlife crisis turns persons inside out and tears up their crafted worlds\\" (1). In this \\"dark night of psychological crisis, when the light of day is eclipsed,\\" he says \\"the figures of the psyche stand out and assume another magnitude. Dreams can strike like thunderbolts and leave you shaken to the core. It is in this night that Hermes comes forth and does his work. His myth speaks of the soul's awakening and emergence\\" (4). As an archetype of transformation, Hermes has much to do with awakenings, inventions, gifts, and grief. Stein writes: \\"When the soul awakens at midlife and presents its gifts, life is permanently marked by the inclusion of them. Taken in, they become the hallmark of your life, the core of your uniqueness. Refused, they can haunt your days and may undermine all your toiling\\" (5, 6). Following the passage at midlife, one has to move through a painful period of midlife \\"liminality,\\" an anthropological term which \\"meaning \`doorway' or \`threshold'\\" (8). \\"In the state I am calling liminality,\\" Stein writes \\"a person's sense of identity is hung in suspension. You are no longer fixed to particular mental images and contents of yourself or others... the prevailing feeling is one of alienation, marginality, drift\\" (8, 9). Transformation in midlife involves a \\"crucial shift from a persona-orientation to a Self-orientation\\" (27). \\"To do this thoroughly and decisively,\\" Stein asserts \\"the person needs to \`find the corpse' and then to bury it: to identify the source of pain and then to put the past to rest by grieving, mourning, and burying it\\" (27, 28). Finding and burying the corpse consists of a long process of letting go of ego defenses, fear of the unknown, and stubborn refusals to heed the call to wholeness. Yet, once the call to wholeness is surrendered to it brings with it a sense of renewed energy and a repudiation of the past. \\"This is where we stand and how we see when we are in liminality. Persona is mere persona, only a hollow mask full of lies and preposterous posturing, to be ridiculed and mocked, as the soul looks out from its position of submersion in the depths of liminal experience\\" (55, 56). Stein's writing on the midlife passage helped me immensely during the writing of my book on Walt Whitman, particularly the last passage I quoted. This is the experience Whitman describes precisely. Stein is a master at explaining psychological phenomena that apply to patients in analysis as well as to poets, artists, and creative writers. He has a way with words that rubs off on one. In the Jungian and post-Jungian literature he is certainly one of the best. This book is sure to speak to anyone interested in the psychological and mythic dimensions of the transformative journey of individuation as seen from the inside out."},{"Title":"IN MIDLIFE : A JUNGIAN PERSPECTIVE","review":"I love that Stein recognizes and articulates that something strange is going on within us at midlife. He chooses Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" to explore Odysseus' travails as one would a dream sequence. He sees Hermes as the god to help with the transition across this boundary (midlife). Midlife is not a little confounding and Stein presents the symptoms and some prescriptions using the mythical backdrop. Hermes (or Nature or God) is having a little fun with us, though from our vantage it does not feel so fun.The frustrating thing about midlife is that it is unique to the individual and thus defies generic solutions. Stein paints with a broad brush that allows the reader to get out his or her own little brush and do his or her own work. Another example of such an effort can be found here:Midlife Themes: A Self Study"},{"Title":"IN MIDLIFE : A JUNGIAN PERSPECTIVE","review":"As midlife appears to be an unavoidable passage in all cultures of the world, (gratefully so), this compact book is packed with the insights midlifers need to reflect upon it with wisdom and patience.

Now, as a suburban mother, I identify with the mothers whose lives- dashed hopes and dreams - and those of their husbands and children are so vividly described in McDermott's uncanny way of creating a visual and lyrical snapshot of suburban life in the sixties.Alice McDermott really gets it right. Early love and the inevitable loss of it colors the way we think for the rest of our lives. The memories this novel brings back to me are so strong that this is one of the few books I re-read every few months."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"I loved this book! I graduated from high school in 1959 and this book took me back, no doubt about it. I knew a couple of girls who got pregnant while still in school, and it was as terrible as is depicted in this book. (Thank goodness for progress and change.....) This book has very strong, well-developed, definitive characters, especially the young narrator. I can still feel the book as if I lived in the neighborhood......"},{"Title":"That Night","review":"Rick and Sheryl are high school sweethearts involved in an intense love affair. When Sheryl discovers that she's pregnant, her mother sends her away, not even giving Sheryl a chance to say goodbye to her beloved. When Rick comes to find -- he hopes to rescue -- Sheryl from her mother's home, a fight ensues. The narrator is Sheryl's neighbor, who was a little girl at the time of the fight, and who found Rick and Sheryl's relationship utterly romantic and fascinating at the time. Her memories of the fight, and of that summer, are long-lasting, and she describes those memories in that way that makes them seem to glow a little more softly as the time has passed. The book recaptures lost youth, and at the same time makes us realize that our youth is truly irretrievable. I love this book even more now than when I first read it in 1987! (FYI, the book is by Alice McDermott.)"},{"Title":"That Night","review":"If there is a synonym for splendid, it is THAT NIGHT. Reading this superior novel is like taking a journey down the suburban sidewalks of youth, cracked and weathered, but familiar. It is a journey through the high school yearbooks of everyone you have ever loved, their photos smiling out at you in that moment right before the shutter clicks and adulthood begins. McDermotts story is one of first love, between teenagers, told with such an urgency that any &quot;adult&quot; love we may stumble upon later in life pales in comparison. The author writes with a keen eye for detail and a highly tuned ear for the sounds of growing up, and growing away from those we have loved. When this book breaks your heart, and it will, it does so without the sentimental trappings of so many love stories. If you don't love this book--I'll take it off your hands."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"This book is fantastic; definitely McDermott's best. Readers who compare it with the movie aren't really being fair, because the movie changes the end of the story completely, though I have to admit that if I hadn't seen the movie, I would never have read the book.First of all, as an English major and fellow writer, I have to say that the writing here is fantastic! McDermott is poetic, eloquent, and has an uncanny knack for creating believable characters in a time and place that felt all too real. Although I was not alive during the 1960s, McDermott fully realizes not just the protagonists of That Night but all the less central characters as well. Many stories are told in this novel, and in the end the collective storytelling method comments not just on two ill-fated teenage lovers, but on a time, a place, and an entire era that has since passed.My advice is this: read the book AND watch the movie. Both realize McDermott's vision in totally different ways, though the book feels more true-to-life concerning the nature of first love."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"Have you ever felt that instantaneous smile that stretched upon your face, that unexplainable feeling deep inside yourself that makes you glow on the outside? Have you ever been in love with someone that everything else around you seems like a blur? Well, that is a description of the strong the bond of love is between the two main characters (Sheryl and Rick) are in the novel \\"That Night.\\"The story takes place in the summer of the early 1960's; in a typical long island suburb. On a street where every house was the same, where everybody in your neighborhood knew all there was to know about your family. The novel is narrated by a young girl who is Sheryl's neighbor.Rick and Sheryl are two young teenagers who are deeply in love with each other even though Sheryl's family struggles with her decision of dating Rick. Sheryl escapes the reality of her father's death, and turns to Rick for comfort. \\"She had not been spoken to so directly, had not had anyone but Rick so directly meet her eye, since her father had died\\" (126.) After the horrifying news of her father's death Sheryl yet to finds out that she is pregnant with Rick's child. In the 1960's it was frowned upon if you were with child, but not married. As an embarrassment to her own town she is sent to Wayside, a school for troubled girls. \\"She took control of her daughter's tragedy in a way she had been unable to do with her own and turned the anger she had learned, the nastiness, to what would have seemed to her to be good use. For in these matters, it was well accepted at the time, the girl must disappear and the hoodlum boy never know\\" (53.)This novel explores a troublesome time that Sheryl dealt with and then learned to overcome. \\"If you knew everybody you loved was just going to end up disappearing, you'd probably say \\"Why bother, right? You'd probably even stop liking people if you knew it wasn't going to make any difference, they're just going to eventually disappear\\" (71.) I enjoyed this book because it really made you look at life more seriously and made you stop and realize that you have to p ay for the actions to do in life."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"Several reviewers have expressed disappointment in That Night because it only vaguely resembles the film of the same title. Indeed, the novel and film are very different--the filmmakers seemed to have used the novel as a departing point, not an outline. But the book clearly deserves to be judged on its own merits; it is unfair, even irrelevant, to discuss the book in terms of its film counterpart.That said, this is a beautifully wrought novel that explores a subject that has been mined endlessly by artists--the doomed teenaged romance. But the beauty and confidence of McDermott's prose (the opening paragraph is gorgeous and evocative, setting the tone for the rest of the novel) penetrates the seemingly mundane subject to reveal the intensity, the sadness and irrevocable loss, represented by Sheryl and Rick's relationship. The novel elaborates upon a specific moment, a memory, the kind of memory that grown adults attempt to 'shake off' and laugh at later in life, but which they carry in them anyhow.That Night encompasses themes too complex, too full of beauty and sadness, that cannot easily be translated to the medium of film, but which are done justice to by McDermott's surefooted prose."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"Well, this is a quite wonderful book that traces and retraces the events of one night in a suburban community. Small in scale, the book imbues the setting and characters with poetry, heroism, grace and tragedy. No detail is too minor; the creak of a jacket, the shape of a bruise, the way Sheryl's front teeth overlap \\"like dealt cards.\\" On this night when a lost boy and a grieving girl are elevated to mythic proportions by her absence and his assault on her home, the fathers become giants and the mothers form a Greek chorus of wailing commentary. It's an accomplishment to transform the mundane into the passionate, and McDermott has accomplished it, here."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"Alice McDermott once again proves her best-selling author status in her novel THAT NIGHT. McDermott represents her original style of writing and her different point of view of important issues faced by the youth of today and yesterday. In this novel, she expands on a subject that is sometimes overlooked or shoved under the proverbial rug. This subject can be summarized in two words, teenage pregnancy. She uses her off-the-wall style of writing to enhance the importance of this subject and yet at the same time show the humorous side of it by portraying the story through the eyes of a child. Alice McDermott's purpose in writing the book That Night was to explore the other side of a teenage pregnancy, the side that deals with the emotions and feelings of the teens. She foreshadows the pregnancy by portraying the boyfriend as a hoodlum to begin with, so the pregnancy is believable and the relationship between the two teens is credible. Judging from the story, McDermott's values are somewhat flexible. She shows the relationship between the two kids as young and immature, yet she seems almost as if she condones the pregnancy. McDermott shows a moderately unbiased view towards the subject she writes about by continually shifting the focus to the young child through which the story is told. This act nonchalantly brings about the first person point of view from which she tells the story. McDermott's style is uniquely set apart from any other novel in its class. She jumps from present, into past, into present again, but she doesn't lose the attention of the reader somehow. Her tone is very laid back and conversational, yet she still shows her point of view in a very realistic manner. The story of two young teens in a passionate love affair really catches the attention of the reader. McDermott's use of symbolism in using two passionate teens to represent the hot summer nights is extraordinary. McDermott shows the irony of a little girl relating the story of a teen in the middle of a life decision that she, although much later, will have to face in her future. The diction used by McDermott proved also to be original. She depicts the little girl as being more mature than she really is by relating the deep and intelligent thoughts through the 8 year old. Her diction, although original, is somewhat unreal. McDermott fails to have the little child converse with anyone and also fails to give her a name. Granted, this fact may have some valid reasoning that is hidden among the suspense of the fighting and mystery. McDermott has the plot unravel in an odd sequence, which enhances the element of suspense in the novel. She uses intense imagery to display the raw emotion taking place in the novel. Descriptions of the fight are prevalent throughout the novel because the whole plot of the story is based around the one night when everyone's emotions went wild and the explanation of why this happened. I believe that Alice McDermott has her very own style of writing and she has a very effective style of writing. Although I may not always agree with the way she introduced an idea or event, I highly regard her opinion and accept that she has reasoning for writing the way she does and introducing things the way she does. Her literary tactics are completely her own and they do an excellent job of making the reader think and contemplate on a new level. Her use of retelling the story through the eyes of an unbiased child is genius. By relating her novel in this means also heightens the innocence factor of the novel. That Night by Alice McDermott confirms this author's ability to bring forth a novel of such character and originality that it can become a best seller. Her other novels also attest to her brilliant writing style, however odd it may seem. Making a best sellers list usually requires large amounts of experience, but Alice McDermott accomplished this status twice within only a few years of a published career."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"I did not find this to be the best of Alice McDermott's works, but I did enjoy it........Rick and Sheryl are high school sweet hearts.

I wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"I've just re-read this book after almost 20 years and found it as fresh and original and as moving as the first time. McDermott's style is sparse yet rich - if that sounds like a contradiction, think of a short poem that evokes an entire world in a few lines. This book does the same, in prose that sometimes can be read like a poem, in less than 200 pages. It is carefully constructed, moving back and forth in time and among the characters, something other reviewers found confusing; I suggest they stick to what's on the bestseller rack at their local supermarket to avoid over-exercising their brains. I also find the suggestion annoying that the book is somehow not as good as the movie because it avoids all that Hollywood balderdash about love being so strong that a guy will do anything to get back together with the girl taken from him \\"to spend the rest of his life with her\\". Instead of this sort of \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" trash the book shows us - lets us experience - the much more moving, bitter reality of life, both in the masterful descriptions of the suburban families on and around \\"That Night\\" and in what becomes of the two protagonists in the years that follow. Highly recommended to anyone interested in great literature; NOT recommended to anyone who has seen the movie and now wants to relive it by reading the book or who wants to read \\"a nice romantic novel\\" - that's not what this is, as one disappointed reviewer noted. To him/her my advice would be, if you want to get drunk quickly, try bourbon instead of champagne."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"Once again,McDermott's verbal mastery takes you to the place of which she writes as clearly as if looking through a window on the scenes she describes so vividly. However, compared to &quot;Charming Billy&quot;, this piece is disappointing. While very well written descriptively, I found it slow. The opening act caught my attention and I continued to read hoping for more of the same alure...it was not to be found. I actually skipped paragaphs and entire pages and was able to continue as if the skipped parts were of no importance to the story at all. While I would recommend Ms. McDermott's work, I would not recommend this particular book."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"Like all great writers, Alice McDermott takes the ordinary and makes it extraordinary.

Children lie to each other about who does and who does not know how babies are made. Women spy on the house of another woman they don't much care for. And perhaps most shocking of all, Mrs. Carpenter sits in a chair that she purchased with no intention of sitting in. It sounds like suburbia to me. But in Alice McDermott's That Night, these actions are highly transgressive acts that violate the limits of the characters' previously circumscribed roles in the neighborhood. For men, that means not leaving your yard and barely saying hello to anyone. For women, the role is that of the stay-at-home gossip, fantasizing about widowhood and asking, about Sheryl's mother Ann: \\"What can you do for a woman like that?\\" What cataclysmic event incited these changes? A boyfriend wants to talk to his girlfriend. He and his friends confront her mother. Violence ensues, jarring the denizens of this neighborhood out of their own despair over the \\"difficult, enduring stuff of daily life,\\" (36) and for a while, the community is transformed. Soon enough though, men go back to barely acknowledging each other, and \\"that night\\" becomes little more than a touchstone for the neighborhood gossip. This is suburbia according to McDermott: a tragedy happens in the lives of people you barely know, and at first glance it appears that the neighbors are rallying around the sufferers, when in fact, suburbanites need the pain of others to distract them from their own voids, and get a secondary benefit of always having something to talk about.Our source of information about \\"that night,\\" (a phrase invoked throughout the work to the point of heavy-handedness) the narrator, informs us \\"even children know you cannot separate the tale from the teller.\\" (157) While this maxim seems self-evident when one is reading works such as The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, or the more recent, Middlesex, it certainly gave me pause when I read it in That Night. What are we to make of this statement, when McDermott does not let the narrator be known by us? Clues are sprinkled throughout as to what this person has been up to since \\"that night,\\" but they don't add up to a character I can put my trust in, essential in a work where the narrator is the empathic vessel through which the reader witnesses all of the events of and surrounding \\"that night.\\" She tells us about Sheryl's relationship with Rick; she tells us about Sheryl's experience in Ohio, and she is absent from both scenarios, as well as many others she also tells us about. This \\"ability\\" of the narrator to report on events that she did not attend led me to wonder whether or not as an adult she was imagining/inventing an entire sweeping context for a traumatic event she witnessed one evening during her childhood. Continuously, I asked myself: how would the narrator know this? I understand that sometimes the reader must accept the conventions that a novelist employs, but I felt here plausibility is under too much of a strain.Eugenides avoids this trap in Middlesex by engaging us with a narrator we know a lot about - we know who Cal is, what he would or would not say, how he would act in a given situation - and by making him essential to the action of the story. McDermott doesn't even give her narrator a name. And yet, at the end of the book, much attention is paid to the demise of her marriage, and the selling of her parents' house. I found this to be a very curious choice on McDermott's part: why develop her character in the last chapter of the book when there was so little development before this point? Then I got to page 164, when the narrator talks to Rick, now a defeated man, who has come to look at her parents' house. She \\"asked him, \`Do you know why she [Sheryl] moved away?' There was a coy hint of gossip in my voice....\\" The narrator is happy and quick to open old wounds for Rick. Whoever the little girl was that witnessed \\"that night,\\" she has become one of the adults around her at the time, a person obsessed with one small event emblematic of the misery of other people. Sounds like a suburbanite to me."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"Come on, people, get over yourselves. You could find a hundred lovely writers out there, and while McDermott may be one of them, it doesn't mean there's anything particularly interesting about this book. It's filled with such melancholy and self-importance about subject matter that is really cliche at this point. Lovers torn apart, young children in the neighborhood wondering how babies are made, teen pregnancy. It's like something a junior high class might read.McDermott might be trying to pull off something magestic here, but it just comes off as weird. Why is this first person narrator, who isn't even a main character in the story, wandering through these people's lives like a ghost, and killing them all off? That's right, when McDermott runs into a situation that's rather dull, which is often, she gives us a little aside about someone's child dying. It's manipulative and cheap writing."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"I was eager to read the book after watching the film on BBC2 (England). I expected the novel to be more descriptive, imaginative and more three dimensional than the film but found it to be quite sketchy and without fluidity. It jumped from past to present and from scene to scene quite disjointedly and I found it difficult to continue reading for I felt like I'd read the same paragraph over and over. As a result of this the only characters which seemed to convey themselves as three dimensional were that of Rick and Sheryls'. There didn't seem to be any revelation at the end of the story, I guess with having knowledge of that era that it would be quite obvious in the way things ended, with broken teenage love and little thought for the result of that. Quite disappointing overall, though worth watching the film."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"i had to read this book in school. it's horrible. it's annoying. There is no point to the story. It isn't even fun to read. I would keep reading, expecting something great to happen, but nothing ever happened. i skimmed the last 25 pages--it was that boring. there are quite a few typos in it as well. everything about it is pure cliche. the first few pages are good, then it stops. it's like, mcdermott had imagination when she began writing it, then she went braindead. i would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"The movie \\"That Night,\\" was a wonderful love story between the town sweetheart and the rebel, taking place in the late 1960's. Sheryl and Rick were the ideal couple, except for the fact that Sheryl's family and town had a big problem with Rick. As told by the watching 10-year-old neighbor Alice, she follows the relationship as if it were her own. The book on the other hand should not even be touched. It had no connection to the movie's main theme of love.In the movie, the more Sheryl and Rick's love grows, the more the townsmen start to hate Rick and his bad-influence friends. When Sheryl becomes pregnant and is forced to leave Long Island and move to Ohio, Rick is heartbroken. Alice then secretly helps Rick find Sheryl and rekindle the love they once had. The book \\"That Night,\\" by Alice McDermott takes on a whole other scenario, which was not significant in the movie. This makes it confusing to the reader. \\"That Night,\\" in the book refers to the night Rick and his friends came looking for Sheryl and got into a huge fight with the town husbands. \\"That Night\\" in the movie refers back to the night where Sheryl and Alice snuck out of their homes and met up with Rick. The book throws the reader off, with all the flashbacks and referring to the night of the fight. You can't feel the characters in the book, or even try and relate to them. You have the usual love story with twp kids in love and a town trying to break them apart. The author shows no connection to this problem, or what actions they took to try and fix it. Instead, the narrator, Alice, referred back to the fight way too many times, and after a while, you lose interest. In the movie however, you can distinctly identify the problem, and relate to it. Rick's love for Sheryl was undying, even when she did get pregnant and had to move away. You physically saw the tight bond between them and the measures he took to find and save her.I definitely give this book two thumbs down. It was too confusing for the reader and you weren't able to personally connect to their relationship. I do not recommend it to anyone who liked the movie, or just wants to read a nice love story. I recommend the movie more than anything, which was great. It showed the unlimited measures one guy took to see his true love again and spend the rest of his life with her."},{"Title":"That Night","review":"For some reason, people keep recommending this book as a romance. This book mocks romance with all the cold-blooded WASPy detachment of its setting. The only interesting thing about it was that there was a character with the same name as me, which is rare, but that's not a good enough reason for anyone else to read it."},{"Title":"The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition","review":"This is a great little book. Unfortunately it covers the peroid just prior to the peroid that I was concerned with. It is concise and clear and would be of value to any one studing that peroid of time. Sue Coon"},{"Title":"The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition","review":"This book is hard on the eyes.I read part of it and gave up. All the graphs are printed in blue and uses different types of shading to show different regions. The font size is about 8 or 10. The size of the book is ackward more like what is suited towards an advertising pamphlet. Quite clearly, Penguin is being super cheap about printing this book. It was published in the last few years so I'm totally confused what's the issue here. I mean come on. I can print full color pages on my laser printer for about 3 cents a page. Why can't a big fancy publisher like Penguin do a decent job printing a book?Buy a different book, your eyes will thank you!"},{"Title":"The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition","review":"As an avid devourer of both history and maps I can say that this book fills a certain niche within my appetite that has not been addressed by either thick historical reference materials or other historical atlases.Specifically, the strength of this book (whatever its other failings are) is that it does the best job I've yet seen of presenting a TRULY DYNAMIC VIEW of the area in question. [For caveats as to its limitations, skip to the bottom of the review.]This means that, after the early stuff is gotten out of the way (your neolithic revolution and other early times for which our information is sketchy, which involves leaving out a lot of time), we are treated to a map of the same area at regular ~50 year intervals. [The actual intervals between maps actually ranges from 15 to 100 in some cases, but ~50 is probably the mean.]Now I own a few other historical atlases, many of which come highly recommended (The 2005 Oxford Atlas of World History, for example, as well as a few other comparable atlases), and while they are valuable purchases in their own right, they do not present a detailed DYNAMIC view of any part of the world, let alone sticking with one piece of it. The Oxford Atlas presents 'The Roman Empire' in two (admittedly large) pages that are supposed to take us from 500BC to 400AD, accompanied by three maps. While the simple narrative tells us what happens within that time period, we do not get to SEE what happens. Another atlas presents one very large and well detailed world map for every 250 year interval - empires pop up from nowhere like dandelions and are gone by the next map as if they never were!In contrast, McEvedy's work sacrifices global scope and global time to present a limited frame of reference (Europe, North Africa, the Near East/Iran and half of the Eurasian steppe) and gives us a blow-by-blow account of what exactly was going on. We can actually see Rome growing over the course of 20 or so maps covering a thousand years, not to mention the ebb and flow of the various other historical peoples that shared the stage with Rome. [This doesn't take into account the pre-Rome maps that make up the other half of the book.]I have yet to encounter any other series of maps, in proper historical reference materials or in other historical atlases, that provide this glimpse into a dynamic world that changed with each human generation (as all human communities do, whether we know it or not). [If anyone else knows of such a series of maps, by all means post a review listing the title.]As an amateur scholar who prefers to get proper historical information from thick, specifically targeted thousand page works, I can definitely say that there is no substitute for the visual information that maps can provide. I've lost count of how many pages have been wasted attempting to explain in (many, many) words what could have been presented instantly and without confusion by a simple well drawn and well-excised map - in fact I've yet to encounter any proper historical work in which the use of maps has been what I'd call adequate. Every targeted proper history should have a section of dynamic maps as comprehensive in time (50 year snapshots) as McEvedy's work, and without all the clutter added in. [If the entire historical narrative never even mentions cities G-Z, why are cities G-Z included in the maps at all - to make cities A-F difficult to find?]Finally, McEvedy certainly has a way with words, as well as a sense of humor, which makes the narrative, simple as it is, more enjoyable then your average millenium trudge.Having said all this, however, one should keep in mind that this Atlas fills a specific and so far unmet need - without competition in that specific realm it stands unparalleled. When measured according to other parameters that are already serviced by other products, this Atlas is average at best.Factors to consider:1) Can only be classified as the most basic of introductions to history - the historical narrative is very very simple, easily outclassed by other atlases, and is primarily meant to simply accompany the maps and explain any apparent anomalies. This is not a book with which to learn history, but to offer a supplement to the amateur historian that simply isn't available elsewhere (at least not collected into one convenient place that I am aware of).2) Limited in geographical scope. Relatively clearly stated at the outset. I, personally, would love to see the same treatment given to the rest of the world (either as a whole or by region or both), but this has not been attempted. [Cursory book store inspection of the regional Penguin Atlases, such as Africa or Egypt or Greece, suggest that they have moved away from the dynamic presentation of many maps towards a more narrative approach.]3) Lack of detail. This is not a standard reference work - it is not a book with which to look up specific facts or places or cities. It details the movements of large numbers of people who are defined in cultural/linguistic terms - it is a work of demographic history, and in terms of such, excess detail would indeed simply get in the way of the purpose of THIS work. Other Atlases and dictionaries have already provided reference services.4) The author is not precisely a neutral party. Whil McEvedy's specialization involves demographic history, in which I do not doubt he is both objective and an expert, he is not afraid to stake out a position on other issues in history about which he may not be such an expert. If certain historical controversies tend to set you off (such as the Aryan invasion conroversy), then you may well be set off by some of the random comments interspersed throughout the book. McEvedy's opinions clearly represent that backlash against the historical-PC movement (or whatever it might be called), in which there have never been any real Dark Ages anywhere at any time (as this would insult the people who lived at those times, making them seem inferior), and in which large regions were never invaded by other people (as this is a threat to the patriots of [Nation X], however long ago it didn't happen), or if they were invaded the 'invaders' were really friendly and nice and accomodating (not ambitious, opportunistic and clever thugs, because thugs are never smart), or that the invaders clearly made no useful or worthwhile contributions to subsequent cultural development (because aggression and invasion are wrong, and the perpetrators should not be encouraged by admitting that they were anything except pure destructive evil). Of course such theories began, some time ago, as a response to the old conservative position in which fresh blood and racial superiority demanded that invasions determined everything (because muscles are good), that the conquered people were weak, stupid, insipid and given to orgies and all manner of archaic and disgusting customs (and probably used masking tape to fix their glasses), that the conquerors were massive and virile noble savages (full of honor and repute and definitely not a collection of rapists and murderers), and that the conquered people were usually dissolved in the pure elixir of new blood (or at least kept where they belonged, in slavery).Seen in the light of past and present exremisms, McEvedy's comments are pretty tame, and more of a calling for balance between various hypotheses (which, when left to themselves, tend to become hyperbolic). In any case such few comments as exist are not integral to any theory presented by McEvedy, and are really no more than asides to the work - most authors would excise such unnecessary and provocative comments, but McEvedy has not. The comments are almost meaningless to the purpose of the book, so you can easily take the maps and forget the narrative completely, and still come out ahead, regardless of your position.In summary, and speaking as an amateur historian, this book is an amazing kind of supplement that I have yet find anywhere else. It is not, however, a comprehensive introduction to world (or regional) history, and it is not a general reference work."},{"Title":"The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition","review":"I defy any other historian to compress so much raw material into such a concise but precise volume. The language is a pure joy: Caesar's son being \\"tidied away into a small box\\"; Nero \\"dying by his own shaky hand\\"; the \\"proud and prickly\\" Great Kings of Persia. The book (and others by the same author) is also refreshingly politically incorrect: unashamedly European in outlook, rightly contemptuous of less civilized polities, unafraid to defend the Indo-European conquest of Iran and Northern India.Best of all, the maps are a succulent treat: I remember tracing them out by pencil when a student (that was the first edition) and being caught out by my history master - leading to a heated debate on the origin of the Etruscans.I have now gone through no less than seven copies of this book (first or second edition): three given away to enlightened friends, four disintegrated through long re-readings in the bath.A Gibbon for the IT age."},{"Title":"The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition","review":"I must say, this is one of the best summaries of the ancient world that I have read in a while. The text is detailed yet concise, and even humorous at times. It and the maps do a good job recording the rise and fall of many of the ancient states. My only complaint is that some of the text is outdated; the 2nd Edition is from 2002 but it fails to incorporate some of the newer discoveries. The text on the Indus Valley Civilization (discovery of only two cities) and the Aryan entry into India (states definitively that they invaded and destroyed the IVC, when this is questioned) are the most blatant examples. Still, most of the text and maps are very useful and still current. If you like ancient history, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition","review":"I just love the way everyone criticises this book and still gives it 5 stars. Yes , the maps do not even show the major rivers which were often the tribal frontiers; and yes many important early sites are not shown on the map at all - so you can not use the atlas to plan your vacation!I note that knowledgeable historians nit-pick the accuracy from time to time but, for myself, the ordinary punter, the book is simply stunning. Firstly the scope covers a mere 40,000 years of mainly European and Middle Eastern history. From the stone age to Byzantium. Secondly you get a swift and understandable summary of all those peoples you should know about but don't; the Medes, the Cimmarians, the Ostrogoths and hundreds of others. Thirdly, as well as the military and political history which helped create the world of today, for just a few quid you get a history of population developement, a history of trade and the story of the development and spread of both language and literacy. Wow!On top of all this, the book is written in witty and self-depreciating style, explaining carefully where the evidence may be contradictory or simply absent. The book is even updated to include some DNA evidence and doubtless there will be a lot more in future editions.So 5 stars plus it is."},{"Title":"The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition","review":"This entire series is superb and is absolutely essential for any lover of historical atlases. I have been an owner of virtually all of them for at ten years and I can honestly say that they are most read books of all that I own.The reason is their unique portability and scope. Most historical atlas are huge, heavy and expensive. They are difficult to read unless you are sitting at a table and very difficult to carry. This limits their utility (even though I still love them). Most history books have lots of dense detail about one nation or one period. Virtually none cover the broad sweep of an entire region over centuries.This atlas covers Europe, the Middle East, western Russia, the Horn of Africa and the Indus River Valley. It starts in 40,000 BC and finishes in AD 362. In all, it has a more than 50 maps. The frequency of the maps increases as we get closer to the modern era.Like all Penguin Historical Atlases, it is small, light, reasonably priced and incredibly broad in scope. These atlases offer a unique perspective on history than is otherwise impossible to achieve. Their size and weight make them perfect for travelling. Whenever I go on a trip, I take the most relevant ones with me. That way I can brush up on my history of the region.The format is extremely useful. Each two-page layout represents a specific time period. On the right is a historical map. On the left is a very brief overview of the important events that happened since the previous map. Each event usually consists of one paragraph or at most a few paragraphs, just enough to peak the interest. Most of the maps document boundaries and note a few key cities or battlegrounds. Occasionally, the maps focus on population, religion or economics.What is most fun for me is to trace the history or one nation, province or sub-region through the entire atlas. In just a few minutes I can learn as much as spending days reading an entire book. You can also see how individual nations interact with each other, a subject often left out of typical history books."},{"Title":"The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History: Revised Edition","review":"This is a well-produced historical atlas, and a good reference work.

I liked that the maps themselves are simple gray scale and not all the colors that can get confusing when you deal with smaller nations and tribes but overall I think they lacked some detail.

Anyone who has visited (or plans to visit) southern Spain will be thrilled by the account of Irving's trip, but I'll go further: you need not ever go there to enjoy this classic work of history and humor.Irving stayed at the Alhambra for three months in 1829 and jotted down notes concerning its history and legends. Early in his visit, Irving was accosted by Mateo Ximenes, a credulous and indigent \\"son of the Alhambra\\" who soon proves a worthy and endearing companion, a guide to secret chambers, and a conveyor of whimsical traditions. A couple of years later, while in London, Irving wrote \\"The Alhambra,\\" describing his idiosyncratic hosts, recounting the millennium-old history of the Moorish occupation, and transcribing fresh versions of the palace's medieval legends and myths, many of which resemble stories from the \\"Arabian Nights.\\" The first edition appeared in 1832, a second American edition was published four years later, but Irving extensively revised and enlarged the book in 1851, incorporating material unavailable or unknown to him in the 1830s. This last edition is the one most commonly available today.The result is easily Irving's most accessible book, filled with wit and anecdote. Alongside the history of the Moorish kingdom of Granada, Irving intersperses tales (both historical and mythical) of enchanted caves, imprisoned princesses, and buried treasure. His admiration for Islamic heritage is obvious throughout: \\"The Arab invasion and conquest brought a higher civilization and a nobler style of thinking, into Gothic Spain.\\" And he regularly denounces the prejudices (both medieval and contemporary) \\"so strongly characteristic of the bigot zeal, which sometimes inflamed the Christian enterprises\\" and which have prevented his fellow Europeans from studying a rich and justifiably proud tradition.As Irving accurately summarizes, Moslem Spain was \\"a region of light amid Christian, yet benighted Europe; externally a warrior power fighting for existence; internally a realm devoted to literature, science, and the arts; where philosophy was cultivated with a passion . . . and where the luxuries of sense were transcended by those of thought and imagination.\\" Plus, the Islamic \\"occupiers\\" and Christian warriors certainly knew how to tell a good story. This book will delight both history and literature buffs."},{"Title":"The Alhambra (Home and school library)","review":"I don't always like to read classics, but when a friend of mine suggested that I read this book, I decided to try it, and I am very glad that I did.

The stories and legends are also wonderful and fascinating. An antique copy of this book is one of my most treasured gifts."},{"Title":"The Alhambra (Home and school library)","review":"Many Americans know Washington Irving as the author of \\"the Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". Few realize that he was also a world traveler, scholarly fluent in Arabic and Spanish and something of an Hispanophile, to the say least.Irving's book is largely responsible for the widespread romantic image of Spain. It is a collection of observation, history, fairy tale, written in Irving's unique blend of romanticism and healthy skepticism. It is roughly framed by his journey to the Alhambra and his departure from it, an in between we are given a tour of the grounds and hear a few tales (including tales of Moorish ghosts on headless horses) which are roughly intertwined as in the Arabian Nights. Indeed, this little book is the 'Arabian Nights' of the west.Before visit the Alhambra read this book.

As is to be expected with any first story outing, about 1/3 of the collection either under-achieves, or over-reaches, but one can't help wondering if that only seems true in light of the incredible depth of the author's talent.

Unfortunatly, the library will have to replace this worn out, but wonderful audio version with the lifeless version now offered by Harper Audio. The reader is lifeless and dull, reading the text so quickly and without expression that I think maybe he was reading it against his will. It's AWFUL. Read the book rather than buying this rotten version. OR - go to the library in hopes that they still have the audio book read by Michael York. He reads with such warmth and caring that I felt that C.S. Lewis was sitting in my car next to me gently explaining things."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is one of the finest Christian thinkers of the modern era and this is one of his best works. He takes the task of explaining why Christians are Christians and makes it seem easy.

If you have trouble understanding your faith, or explaining it to others, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S.

Here are some phrases lifted from those reviews:- \\"Mere illusion\\"- \\"Mere delusion\\"- \\"Pseudo-reason\\"- \\"Less-than-sound arguments\\"- \\"Author had no deep understanding of religion, science, or logic\\"- \\"Easy to refute\\"- \\"Pop talk\\"- \\"Extremely flawed philosophy... false reasoning\\"- \\"Disappointing and childish -- arguments that I used while in grade school and discarded soon thereafter\\"(The last one is my favorite, by the way. The reviewer possesses such a towering intellect that as a child, he surpassed the adult Lewis' powers of reasoning. Either that, or the adult Lewis' powers of reasoning were at the level of a typical child's).It comes as no great surprise that most of these reviewers did not actually present any refutations of Lewis's supposedly badly flawed, ill-informed, and reason-free arguments. A very few of them did give counter-arguments. I leave it up to you to read them and decide if those arguments provide crushing blows to Lewis's logic - as the reviewers obviously believe they do - or if, in most cases, they were in fact anticipated and answered by Lewis in the book.If you are an atheist, certainly you will not agree with Lewis' thesis. But spare us the childish one-star reviews -- particularly those of you who haven't even read the book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have read many books to explain Christianity and this one has a special place in my heart.I am an avid golfer and had taken many golf lessons early in my golfing exploits. I then purchased a book called, \\"The Little Red Book\\" (no kidding) written by the infamous Harvey Penick (now deceased). The instructions and antidotes in \\"The Little Red Book\\" were entertaining, simple and straight to the point. After reading this book, I gradually started lowering my score and had much more fun playing golf.So... you might say... who is this nut case, does he know he is supposed to be reviewing \\"Mere Christianity\\" by CS Lewis.... My point... The Little Red Book is to Golf as Mere Christianity is to our Christian walk. CS Lewis manages to eliquently speak from his gut about his own Christian belief. His thoughts are not mere rumblings of someone high on God, but rather a thoughtful discussion about his faith. Not just what he believes, but what that belief looks like in acting out his human existance.As many other responders have written, CS Lewis was an athiest... Something made him change his mind.... And this book exposes his exact thought process. This is a great read for existing Christians, a great read for new Christians, a good read for philsophers and was very enjoyable.We lost a great writer when we lost CS Lewis!! I imagine he is sitting with Jesus in heaven talking up a storm now."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you don't think highly of CS Lewis, you will after reading this book. Renowned worldwide as the most important Christian apologetics book of the 20th century, this book approaches the Christian faith in a simple, enlightened fashion that will take even mature Christians on a journey of discovery. Starting at the very basis of theism, moving on to monotheism, and finally to Christianity, this book works through Christian doctrine and beliefs in a logical, analytical manner that is both easily readable and profound. Himself being a former atheist, Lewis shows how uniquely logical our faith is. While no book can save someone on its own and it would be blasphemous to claim such, I will readily say that any logical, intellectual challenger of Christian faith will be challenged by this book to re-examine Christian faith for what it really is. Recommended to believers and non-believers alike!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have read 'Mere Christianity' and have also listened to the six hour Harper Audio cassette reading by Geoffrey Howard.With 'Mere Christianity' C.S. Lewis employs a methodical logic that not only encourages people to focus upon and embrace the truth of Christianity - but he enables people to do so from a vantage point that is safe from being undermined by the misleading, but largely transitory influences of the present day, those which arise from the existence of 'chronological snobbery' as he once described the \\"uncritical acceptance of the intellectual climate common to our own age\\" in 'Suprised by Joy'.When it is realised that C.S. Lewis was acknowledging and warning others about such malign and skewed influences over sixty years ago - at a time when the farcical nature of what we experience around us today at the beginning of the 21st century would have been barely conceivable - it is clear that the prophetic nature of , and truth contained within, Lewis's work affords it a credibility that is 'chronologically impregnable'.Fundamentally, C.S. Lewis was a defender of Christianity and the message of the bible. That message is a truth that is applicable to all humanity and to every past, present and future era. Thus the inspiration behind his work means that, by definition, Lewis's brilliance is enhanced and the truth and meaning of his words are, in the long term, made absolutely secure.To paraphrase something someone once said (exact quote not to hand) about the ideological mistakes that humanity has insisted upon making over and over again throughout history, particularly during the past century - 'whatever direction mankind chooses to follow, he will meet C.S. Lewis on the way back'. 'Mere Christianity' makes me realise why this is true."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis' exploration of the truth of Christ taught me one thing - conversion can and does happen on a regular basis! After lending the book to a friend of mine, he declared his belief in Christ just a few days later! How can a single book create such passion? I saw similar effects with the Left Behind series, as well as with The Passion of The Christ film, but I really believe that Lewis was a true pioneer in this realm. For people that are just starting down their Godly path, this book is an extremely helpful tool. (...)"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S.

Very handy to have all of these classics in one volume. Easy to read print also makes it hard to put down!! If you've long enjoyed the works of C.S. Lewis, or if you are new to him (like me!), you will not be disappointed with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is the first book on Christianity that I've read back in high school. It raised more questions in me than answers at the time but I was changed after reading it. Lewis has a talent in making his readers want to learn more rather than just take his word for it. This was liberating for me who before that always felt like the truths of Christianity must be either believed on faith or rejected outright. That they could be defended gave me hope that perhaps this faith was more than just a foolish hope at best. This is definitely a book that I plan on rereading sometime when I get the chance."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It first seems intimidating: seven spiritual works by the 20th century's foremost Christian intellectual, in one volume. But reading \\"The Complete CS Lewis Spiritual Classics,\\" you realize Lewis' strength came from a worldview consistent as the Christian faith he embraced and lived. The books' sequencing testifies to this; its' fictional works stretch and strengthen points made in his spiritual works, themselves brimming with allegory to explain his apologetics.\\"Mere Christianity,\\" transcripted from Lewis' WWII radio talks, distills the faith and its morality independent of denomination. He establishes themes reinforced throughout the other books: moral, independent law guiding the universe, understanding God's relationship with man (the process of repentance and forgiveness), Christians seeing Earth as enemy territory to win for their Leader, the \\"good infection\\" and process of perfection Christ begins when we let Him.\\" He also aligns sin with pride, accurately calling it the greatest root of all sin (\\"Pride made the devil the devil.\\"). In this context it's the perfect introduction.\\"Screwtape Letters,\\" (arguably Lewis' most famous book after the \\"Narnia\\" series) reverses \\"Mere\\"\`s tenets to near-hilarious effect. Yours truly's earlier \\"Screwtape\\" review still holds. But suffice it to say Screwtape's instructions and warnings to apprentice devil nephew Wormwood on using a man's new found faith for his downfall provides \\"milestones,\\" \\"sudden turnings\\" and \\"signposts\\" to warn against what Screwtape calls \\"the safest road to hell.\\"Themes of each book interlock through fantasy, apologetics, or instruction, fleshing Lewis' personal faith and storytelling mastery. Lewis' fantasy \\"Great Divorce,\\" describes the damned's day trip from their \\"gray city\\" (Lewis' hell and purgatory) to Heaven, trying vainly to bend its citizens' new lives and beauty to their old faults and imperfections. \\"A Grief Observed,\\" meanwhile, is Lewis' heartfelt, resigned response to life and God following his beloved wife Joy's death. Lewis' \\"The Problem of Pain\\" rests between and threads each, as he reasons out human grief and discomfort in a world created and maneuvered by a loving God. Lewis confronts and asks us to confront these issues, whether waking from his guided tour of heaven with George MacDonald (in \\"Divorce\\") or praying for and re-imagining his late \\"H's\\" soul and memory.\\"The Abolition of Man\\" is shortest, comprising two Lewis lectures. But it nearly serves as series summary and mission statement. Lewis cleverly sees through a school textbook's mistaken semantics into a study of natural law (the Tao), objective beauty and truth independent of beholder. This divine, guiding law fuels the tenets in \\"Mere Christianity\\" (and Screwtape's Satanic reverses of same), Divine will God uses to chasten in \\"Problem of Pain\\" and hasten through speeding His nature and process in \\"Miracles.\\"Joined together, these spiritual works make you wonder if Lewis hadn't all along decided he'd use his gift for compelling fantasy, analysis and allegory to tell, then validate Christ's story through his own. Read together if you can, (separately if you must), they'll provide the Christian leader and apologist sword and shield to lovingly understand and defend his faith (and allow Christ to change him). For this alone these books are essential to any faith-filled library, with this collection a compact, cost-effective means to acquire them."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The first thing that hit me about this book is that I need to dog-ear every page, underline, highlight and make more notes than the margin provides. This is a book that needs to be read again and again, there's so much in the book. It's for all types of Christianity and puts those feelings and thoughts that we've all had into clear, concise King's English. I've only read it twice, and feel as though I've gleaned a small amount of the concepts of the author. It's easy to read, but you will want to savor and let a lot of your thinking that the book provokes, settle in."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Being a former athiest, I appreciate all of the arguments that can be made against Lewis' apologetics. That being said, I feel that it is impossible to convince someone through reason and logic, who has already convinced themselves otherwise through reason and logic. Either God gave you the convictions/morals you have, or mankind developed them to cope with survival on Earth. It really remains the Holy Spirit's responsibility to convict men of the truth. On that note, if you are already convicted, and take comfort knowing that beleif is still reasonable, involving your brain as well as your heart, this book speaks volumes. For those who've read it and object to his stance on evolution, or universalism, remember that He is still a man, and subject to error. I personally don't have a problem with those two beliefs. To sum it up, this book is perfect for someone who just responded to an altar call."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This box contains some of the best known theological works by C.S. Lewis. Six paperback books in a case. It is a shame that it doesn't include Surprised by Joy in which Lewis tells about his spiritual journey. It would have been a valuable addition to this pack. But other than that, great set. Read them to strength your faith or to learn something about Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a great investment. Not only does it help my theological understanding of what Jesus Christ has accomplished for us on the cross, but C.S. Lewis' writings expands my imagination and love for God's creativity! What a glorious picture of the Lord's love for us through the gospel of Jesus Christ. I recommend this book to anyone looking for answers about God and wanting to grow in their knowledge of Him. Although the book is thick, it's easy to read in small chunks. Don't let it be intimidating. It has become a restful read for my soul, yet also thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis' masterpiece \\"Mere Christianity,\\" which was adapted from a series of radio talks he gave in the 1940s, is both a convincing case for the truth of Christianity and an important reminder of its importance in our own lives. Preferring to forgo denominational debates and dogmatism, Lewis instead offers a case for the basic, essential tenets of the Christian faith.Lewis accomplishes so much in this valuable book. To start off, Lewis establishes the existence of God via a convincing presentation of the Morality Argument. He argues that humans all have a basic moral code which we know that we should follow but which we know we fail to follow. God, argues Lewis, provides the explanation for this prescriptive moral law that we find ourselves obliged to obey. Near the end of the book, Lewis delves into the more difficult topics of theology including the nature of the Trinity and God's relationship to time. He handles these difficult topics remarkably well with his engaging style of writing.But more than providing a convincing case for the truth of God's existence and Christianity, Lewis also provides a very powerful explanation of morality. He discusses moral issues that are relevant both for people in general and for Christians in particular. These chapters about morality are simply excellent. Even though they aren't apologetic in nature, I found Lewis' exposition of morality very useful and so persuasive that I think it will have a positive impact on my own life. Near the end of the book, Lewis gives a very convicting argument for the importance of taking Christianity seriously.Mere Christianity is easy to read, and Lewis' style of providing simple analogies makes complicated topics intelligible and interesting. It may not be a heavily referenced or scholarly tome about Christian apologetics, but it is a convincing, clear, and simple defense of mere Christianity and of Christ's importance in our lives. Overall, \\"Mere Christianity\\" is a fantastic book that everyone, believer or unbeliever, should read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I listened to this book on cd which I have found is a great way to get insirational advice everyday and further myself as a person. I loved C.S Lewis's Mere Christianity. It gives a educated view into why he believes in God and more specifically the Christian God. He is a great writer and the book is very intellegent. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is a master at both presenting his defense of the Christian faith as well as offering practical guidance on subjects of charity, faith, and love. Regardless of your religious background (or even lack thereof), C.S. Lewis gives practical, genuine, and inspiring arguments regarding his faith in Jesus Christ that will motivate and encourage both the fainthearted Christian as well as the seeker of God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"'Mere Christianity' is one of Lewis most famous apologetic works. Written off his radio program with the same title and lectures given therefore, the book in essence is about the 'mere' or essential Christian doctrines in what Christians in all places and at all times agree on. There is much common ground between Protestant Evangelicals, Catholics, and even Eastern Orthodox believers here; yet, not exstensively so.Many readers find his moral arguments one of the most compelling arguments for the existence of God. While written over a half century ago, many Churches to this day still use his book in Bible studies and Sunday School education.His famous Trilema argument is still widely used (Jesus is either Lord, liar, or lunatic)and his discussion on the body of Christ and the diveristy it holds is a great balance between a 'totalitarian' religion or an 'individualistic' Christianity. His discussion on 'begotten, not made' and the 'Trinity' is insightful and written for the laymen.While this is not my favoriate Lewis book, it still warrants five stars because of its ability to still reach the average person, well placed arguments, and influence it has had on the Christian community."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was very much looking forward to borrowing this book, held by many as the be-all end-all of Christian apologetics, from my brother. In many respects, I was very pleased with what I found -- Lewis is a very strong writer, with a clear voice, clear non-ambiguous argumentative style, and it always seems as though he's speaking with you, rather than at you. He's not a preacher or an evangelist -- he's a man who just wants to put what he believes out there in the open, take it or leave. At several instances, he acknowledges the boundaries of his words: for instance, in his chapter on faith, he says \\"I am not asking anyone to accept Christianity if his best reasoning tells him that the weight of the evidence is against\\" (p. 140), recognizing the possibility without being condescending to the person who holds it. For bringing logical, rational thought to an area of thought of dominated by televangelists and mindless cliches, it's a breathe of fresh air to see somebody actually arguing on basic principles for their beliefs, and accepting that if somebody disagree that is fully within their rights as well. It's something I wish more people would do, and if reading this book is a good way to promote that, I recommend this to everyone.I suspect this book with be regarded the strongest by Christians who wish to strengthen their beliefs, and will be a useful tool for people who wish to come into belief but don't know quite what that entails. For the wavering Christian, I don't think you can do better than this book: it's well written, clear, and so far as I can gather from the lauding, accurate to its source, the Bible.That said, I was surprised at points -- given how highly regarded this book is not only as a theology book, but as a apologistic/philosophy book -- to see some of the arguments used. He has many good points, of course, which I should not overlook mentioning. His argument against the problem of evil is nearly classic -- I've seen it quote a couple dozen times. One does not know evil, he argues, unless he measures it against good, just as one does not know a crooked like unless he sees a straight one. Far from a universal truth (opinions on good and evil differ) but a strong point about the subjectivity of the argument. His arguments for Christian charity and the value of deliberation are likely to strike a strong chord with all.But I think there are some shortcomings. He uses the example of witches to show that people do not disagree directly on morality unless they disagree on the facts (witches were believed to be \\"people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them amd or bring bad weather\\"). But there are many instances where the facts are clear but people directly disagree about the moral implications, aren't there? How about masturbation? Or homosexuality? Or animal rights? Or abortion? Certainly with the first two the facts are amply clear, but there appears to be a great moral divide -- some feel these are moral permissable, and others feel they are a moral abomination. Why isn't the inner voice clearer on these obviously moral issues?He argues for the Christian devil by taking the Dualist point of view (there is an absolute good and an absolute bad power, equally powerful) and reducing it down to a more Christian-friendly idea (there is an absolute good power, and a rebelling, but lesser powerful, evil power). I was left with the impression: What of the person who simply believes the devil isn't a necessary being? He never directly argues for a devil, or defends against critisisms of the Christian conception of the devil, both of which are critical elements in any argument which comes to his conclusion.His argument for Christ as the one and only Son of God goes basically along these lines: if somebody makes a claim about who they are, they are either correct or crazy; since Christ claimed to be God and appears to be a good and rationally sane person, he cannot be crazy; therefore he is the God. I know this isn't the only reason C. S. Lewis believed what he believed (although it's the only one cited), but I honestly could not believe reading this in print. If Gandhi had but claimed to have been God, we would be praising his name? Come on...His forays into God-time logic are interesting. I disagree with his assessment that \\"Everyone who believes in God at all believes that He knows what you are and I are going to do tomorrow\\" (p. 170). I'm a theist, and I believe no such thing; it's is entirely incompatable with free will, which I hold to be a self-evident truth. Perhaps this was a reasonable statement at the time, but even the last few theist debaters I've seen haven't held such a view, usually limiting God's omniscience to present state knowledge rather than pre-cognition. Granted, one was Muslim, but doesn't he fall under Lewis' statement as well?Lewis is usually very good at his choice of analogy, although I found one oddity later in the book (if they hadn't been in consecutive chapters, I may not have noticed it). He argues that individuality cannot be maintained through collectivity, as if life became one in the afterlife, because a drop ceases to be a drop when it is placed in an ocean. He then argues that individual *can* be maintained through collectivity, as in the trinity of God, because they are merely dimensions of the same thing and dimensions are distinct. But couldn't one just as easily argue that the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ lose their individuality, like a drop in the ocean (God), or that people in an afterlife maintain their individuality in a collective afterlife, just as dimensions keep their individuality when more is added?Anyway, enough brain fodder. Recommended reading.Matthew D. Johnston"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"CS Lewis' apologetic classic, Mere Christianity, while dated in many ways (the basic content was formulated in a series of BBC radio broadcasts in the early 40s), is probably the best short and sweet introduction to the ideas of Christianity that you could ask for. Lewis was a fantastic author of both fiction and non-fiction, and his writing here is joy to read: lucid, humble, direct, and unpretentious, all at once. He communicates complex religious ideas to the common person gracefully, and somehow manages to avoid sounding like he is ever talking down to them. This is undoubtedly one of the primary reasons why this simple work has influenced so many people: it is approachable, but it isn't watered-down, either.Another reason this work is so remarkable is because of how unconventional it was, for its time: rather than engaging in the kind of circular argumentation that Christians are commonly (and rightly) mocked for, Lewis attempts to build a philosophical case for the truth of Christianity from the ground up. With nary a bible verse citation or argument from design/revelation in sight, he begins, first, with the basic universal moral code found, in one variation or another, in all societies around the world, throughout history, and from there works his way up to the existence of a God. Not the Christian God, mind you, but merely a purely theistic conception of God. From there, he analyzes further types of religious ideas, rejecting what he views as false ideas as he goes along, until he comes to the basic concept of the God of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob, and from there begins to explore genuinely Christian religious concepts. The idea here was that one could arrive at a belief in the truth of Christianity through the process of reasoning alone. Needless to say, this remains hugely influential.Well, so far, it sounds like I really like this book. So why only three stars? It is because Lewis' reasoning is often fallacious. Other reviews have gotten into specifics (the fallaciousness of the argument from universal morality, the fallaciousness of the liar/lunatic/lord argument, etc.), so I'll spare the recap. Needless to say, however, because of the weaknesses in this work's central arguments, I remain an unconvinced atheist. Nevertheless, this book is profoundly well-written, historically significant, and some of its ideas have made for interesting discussions with Christian friends. So I'm rating this three stars. This isn't anywhere near the best Christian apologetic available on the market, but you can't beat it as an introduction to the field of Christian apologetics. If you're Christian, you've probably already read this and most likely adore it. If you're a non-Christian, it might give you some interesting ideas to chew on for awhile, even if it isn't enough to sway your belief at all."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Even though this was written during a very different time and in a different culture, it is very understandable and easily transferrable to now. Every now and then there is an English reference or a WWII reference that some younger readers might not get. But Lewis does an excellent job presenting the logical case for Christianity so that it can be understood by all. Great read for non-believers who are interested and also for believers looking for ways to answer questions they have or that their non-believing friends they are witnessing to might have."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" doesn't really break new ground in original Christian thought as much as simplifies some observations of Christian strictures. It's not a guide to prescriptive living as much of an insight to what a rationally minded Christian intellectual thinks about his religion. I suppose I approached this book with minor expectations of life altering thought. That's not what I got out of it, but instead was reminded and reaffirmed of some beliefs that lay dormant but still deeply entrenched. Lewis's observations are simplistic but deep. For that fact, Lewis earns quite a bit of admiration for turning the complex into easily digestible reading is a daunting task.I found the book getting interesting about mid-way through. The first half was almost too simplistic. Lewis has some perceptive observations of society's obsession with sex (without being prudish), forgiveness being difficult to put into practice, and the ability of God to change a person but sometimes not in ways that person would expect or be comfortable with. Of particular note is Lewis' observation of when a person is brought closer to God. It is not when everything is going right in life and church visits are consistent, but rather when one is brought to question and search on their own, when life is challenging and belief is challenging. There is a lot of truth to Lewis' writing but some of it rings through clearer than others.Life altering book...not so much. A Good reminder of God...yes."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Ten years ago, when I was relatively new to active Christian faith, I tried to read this book. I was bored stiff! I suppose that I wasn't on the leg of my spiritual journey where I needed it or could understand its importance, because now I have read it hungrily and joyfully. I've marked pages for review and have begun developing lessons for future use in sermons and Bible studies based on ideas I found in this book.My advice to the reader is this: If this book seems boring or irrelevant to you, put it back on the bookshelf and get it out again only after a few years have passed. You might eventually perceive the treasure you have in this little volume."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A wonderful book! I would only like to point out one thing that I don't think other reviewers have mentioned - Lewis' explanation of what it means to \\"love thy neighbor.\\" Lewis points out that we can love people without being blind to their faults and sins; indeed we can love them without liking them very much or at all. It means to wish them well and to hope for their final salvation. I also appreciated Lewis' advice to those who cannot find feelings of love for God in their hearts: \\"Act as if you did. Do not sit trying to manufacture feelings.\\"That is terribly important advice for people like me - who want to believe in God, but have had no \\"Road to Damascus\\" bolt from lighting hit us. We live in an age where we are constantly being told that feelings are everything. Lewis tells us to forget about our little feelings, to \\"act as if\\" even when we don't feel like it, and in time we will receive God's peace.This is a Christianity for grownups, not the sentimental fluff handed out to so many believers."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Too often, prominent Christians in popular media and culture are haranguers, holier-than-thou types whose attitude and temper set a far different tone than the message they are purportedly trying to convey. Such people may not reflect the opinions and attitudes of a majority of Christians, but the amplitude of their voices often drowns out the gentle whispers from kinder souls whose Christianity is far nearer the ideal Christ preached.Sound and fury truly signify nothing when it comes to religion, though; rather, it is the simple and gentle truths that prevail over time. And in this book (which has stood the test of time and will likely remain one of the definitive Christian texts for all time), C.S. Lewis aims at just that--simple and gentle truth, backed up by commonsense, reasoned arguments.With nary a whiff of fire and brimstone, Lewis leads the reader through what amounts to a theological funnel towards those simple truths. Beginning with general arguments for why God makes sense, Lewis goes on to describe what Christians believe, how Christians ought to behave, and what steps an individual ought to take to remake his or her life in line with those principles. And Lewis is, in many ways, an ideal guide for that spiritual journey, for he himself traveled the route from atheist to Christian to explainer of Christianity for the masses.The only real problem with this book is that, in his efforts to explain Christianity to the masses, Lewis occasionally leans too heavily on the popular wisdom of the masses--in particular, the popular wisdom of his late 1940s English audience. (In truth, this is perhaps a four-and-a-half star book, and not a five star book, for this very reason.) In his efforts to, for instance, lay out his opinions as to why marriages should have the husband as the head, he leans too heavily on popular convention and the prejudices of his day, and not heavily enough on the \\"treat other people as you would want to be treated\\" message that is one of the pillars of Christianity.But don't accept or reject this book based on Lewis's views on marriage; as he himself readily admits, sexual morality isn't the foundation of Christian morality. Rather, the foundation for Christian morality is the battle all people must fight against pride. Pride is the insidious force that makes some political leaders hold themselves accountable to no one, while making some religious leaders believe that they alone are qualified to pass judgment on their fellow man; it is a force we all must contend with, both leaders and led alike. And Lewis's chapter on pride, entitled \\"The Great Sin,\\" is alone well worth the price of the book. It is this chapter and others like it that provide the true worth of this book; they remind us that we all must continually struggle to improve ourselves and to remake ourselves, and that the times when we are at our most self-satisfied are the times when we are most at risk."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have long since had all of the selections in this but found the collection a great way to send them all at once without sending a specific one -- with the intention of insuring that specific one was not obviously the book meant to be read. Imagine sending \\"A Grief Observed\\" to someone you hope may not need it any time soon! The small editions of individual books are far easier to bring to class in a briefcase and it does not feel like a sin to mark them up with notes -- while the more beautiful collection feels like it should be kept in perfect condition."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Other reviewers have explained well why this collection deserves 5 stars. I'd only like to add that the publisher makes (or at least did make) each of the included books available as a C.S. Lewis Signature Classic, as part of its Signature Classic line of books. So there are other works by Lewis that classify as Lewis classics, or even as classics, period. An example would be \\"Till We Have Faces.\\" But this is quibbling. To include all of the classic Lewis works in one volume would require, not a coffee table book, but a book the size of a coffee table. This is a great collection, nicely bound, on good paper with clear type and a readable font size, at an unbeatable price. I wouldn't take it hiking, but it's no bigger than many textbooks, atlases, picture books, etc."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a 'very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to 'experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.The book looks at beliefs, both from a 'natural' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, 'When I was an atheist...' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the \`leave it to God' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God's own personality. Lewis' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God's is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the \`new man' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.'Mere Christianity' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - 'The Case for Christianity', 'Christian Behaviour', and 'Beyond Personality'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"For those struggling to understand the basic beliefs of Christianity, this is the best place to start. Lewis avoids speaking above the reader, and instead, brings Christianity to a level that anyone could understand. His use of everyday images and comparisons often brought a smile to my face. He leaves the reader with a better sense of Christianity and more importantly, a better sense of his or her own beliefs. Added bonus: it is short and to the point."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"From an intellectual point of view, this is by far the greatest apologetic work I have encountered. Now, it doesn't mean I buy it hook, line and sinker, nor does it mean that because it is intellectually sound it is 'true' in the deepest sense of the word.But, in terms of Trinitarian Christian orthodoxy as I have come to understand it, Lewis simplifies an extraordinarily complex subject to its basics, thus the title 'mere' Christianity. He cuts off the tendencies many of us have to go off on tangents about things that really don't matter in terms of the Gospel message and excise them at that point.For those who think Lewis is deluded, consider his qualifications at Oxford. He is an erudite writer who has a gift for analogies and thought provoking insights that really help the reader grasp what Christianity really espouses."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is an amazing book by one of the most iconic writers in recent history! If you or a friend is wondering if there is a God and if there is, is He the God of Christianity- you need to read this book. C.S. has a fabulous writing style that explains Christianity so well."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis did a wonderful job explaining what and why Christians believe what they believe and also references other religions and explains how they believe on the same topics. Many christians know what they are supposed to believe but never understand why. Once I picked this up, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is based on a series of speeches CS Lewis gave on the radio during World War II, to present Christianity to his fellow Brittons. Adapted to book format, those speeches are a precious treasure for any person genuinely interested in Christianity, or plain spirituality and religiousness.I cannot say enough about this book; it is witty, deeply intelligent, fun to read, never preaching, always convincing, and above all, Lewis always talks to you with honesty and not a bit of condescendence. He presents his arguments in a very clear, concise, and precise manner. The whole book gives you a lot to ponder about and that is true even for people who have already studied Christianity quite a bit, as I did. Never before did I see such a well executed introduction to Christianity and what it really means to be Christian.I think so much of this relatively little book that I think it deserves a place in the Bible. Think me crazy, but this work is definitely more valuable than a certain amount of text in the Bible as it is today (and I mean no disrespect by saying this).The best thing about \\"Mere Christianity\\", out of all the other things I can't mention here, is that it never gives you the usual dumb perceptions of Christianity, it always makes a lot of sense, and intrigues you. It's a delight of the brain and soul, and heart, to read the words of a most intelligent and faithful man like CS Lewis.I went for this book because I really wanted to understand Christianity better, and perhaps even find some faith of my own, and even though I didn't think even this highly praised book would help, it did, but not exactly how I expected it to help. It helped me to see how intelligent Christianity could be, and how much sense it could make. Now I may not agree with everything Lewis talks of in that book (the nature of sexual desire, for one) but on the whole this is a book you will never regret reading.Strongly recommended to anyone with an interest in Christianity, religions, spirituality, and Truth."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This collection of religious topics gives great insight into the Christian religion.

Lewis was for this time. For example, in one chapter he was talking about how the devil likes to get Christians to be critics when it comes to churches. The devil likes Christians to go from church to church evaluating rather than worshipping. How true it is today even more so than in Lewis' day. The chapters are a couple of pages each with titles that speak to the issue addressed. I enjoyed reading this book not in order but as my curiosity wished.

Otherwise, get the box set."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have read and heard so many stories about people initially skeptical about religion, especially Christianity, who then seek to prove that Christianity is false and end up becoming converted themselves. C.S. Lewis is such an example but his impact reaches much further than many others that I have studied. Many non believers claim that Christianity is just another fable or myth that evolved from and incorporated ancient, pagan beliefs. Lewis, a professor of Medieval and Renaissance Literature once said (and I paraphrase): I have read countless myths, fables and legends and I can firmly say that if one studies the story portrayed in the Bible, I cannot honestly say that it is not a myth, fable or legend. In \\"Mere Christianity\\", he philosophically rationalizes his conclusions regarding his faith and how that faith affects humanity. To the diehard denominationally minded Christian, this layman's treatise might initially be disregarded as ecumenical or sparse. But to anyone who has studied or read moral philosophers and apologists through the centuries, one will find here a well thought out explanation of Christianity by a mind that is brilliantly trained in criticism, philosophy and literature. It is a simple and honest read and reminds me of America's Ralph Waldo Emerson with its flowing style, straightforward examples and practical explanations that grasp some of the most important questions that the human race has ever dealt with."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I like it that this book has all the classics of c s lewis ,however a warning should be given of how big and heavy it is and maby a sugestion of a book holder similar to a music stand to hold itcould be suggested.thank you"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.

This book was recommended to me by my siste4r-in-law, who is a young presbyterian minister in a wealthy part of california.This book screams apologetics. Apologetics has it's place in the realm of christian thought. Mr. Lewis is a profoundly creative person, and he uses his creativity to it's fullest in forming analogies that may or may not be accurate regarding many of the things that both christians and non-christians alike find puzzling or hard to wrap their heads around regarding the christian faith. However, most of the things discussed, and Mr. Lewis admits this freely, also may or may not be true. This doesn't make them useless, they may be very helpful ways of looking at many issues, the point is that their truth or falsity simply doesn't matter in the long run. For example, we may not be able to understand the true nature of the mechanism of salvation, and since the bible doesn't volunteer that information we are free to speculate wildly regarding that mechanism, but our speculations don't make a difference; it is enough that the mechanism (though we don't understand it) does in fact WORK in us.That's the thing, however, about apologetics. It can be fascinating, fascinating even unto the point of dominating the minds of the faithful as a pastime, but that can be troublesome because when you spend too much time with it it can distract you from study of the things in the bible that ARE quite clear and ARE things that god wants us to spend time pondering, studying, meditating on, talking about, sharing, learning, and so forth. C.S Lewis is, self-admittedly, not free to speak authoritatively on theology and exegesis. The things in this book that spring from the creative mind of Lewis, the things that have made this book a classic, the things that can't be found in other books, his quaint observations, his speculations, his easy to digest analogies, those things aren't NECESSARY to anyone's faith, spiritual growth, life. Everything that anyone needs to know about anything comes from the theologian and the exigete. That doesn't mean you spend no time on anything else, or that you become one or the other, but it does mean that you spend at least some time learning at the feet of masters in those fields, and the type of apologetics at which C.S Lewis excels in this work can tempt one to think that to spend time learning from this book is the same thing as growing in faith, and it is not.It is an entertaining read, however. The man is obviously intelligent without speaking down to his readers or using pretentious and difficult to understand language, in fact, anyone can read this book, understand all of it, and enjoy it thoroughly. I enjoyed it. This is a book you read along your faith journey, but then put aside and move on to bigger and better things. As Lewis says himself in the book; If the analogies and explanations of any given concept or issue in this book are helpful to you in your faith or in conceptualizing parts of your spirituality, then feel free to use them, if they don't work for you, feel free to toss them out and don't think about them. What I will add is this; whether you like and use his explanations or not, do not allow yourself to be misled into thinking that it makes a great deal of difference whether he is wrong or right."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is one of the best summaries of the essentials of Christianity I have read. Lewis avoids all the common pitfalls in the usual presentation of the gospel. Some people emphasize doctrine and theology to a tiring degree, others focus primarily on getting close to God and focusing on your relationship with Jesus, and another group of people incessantly preaches how we must live and what we must do as Christians. But all of these positions polarize the truth - mere Christianity expresses all of these aspects at once, without contradiction. True doctrine is only attained by communion with God, and this results in a holy, Christian life.Mere Christianity is so powerful because it harmonizes all of these aspects in such a glorious manner. You read his defense of the existence of God, move through his explanation of the basics of Christianity and Christian conduct, and then finish with his thoughts on the Trinity. You never get an impression of imbalance, or of partiality to some &quot;pet doctrine&quot; as Christian authors often have. All of it is written in his typical even-handed, charming, down-to-earth fashion. This would be my top recommendation for an enjoyable summary of Christian doctrine and practice."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend who claimed that it provided a very logical defense of Christianity. After reading it, I concluded that if this is the reputation that this book has, then it is certainly undeserved. I gave this book 2 stars instead of one only because Lewis is a decent writer. He is clear and easy to understand. Other than that, however, the arguments in this book are very poorly reasoned. Below I have provided just some out of numerous examples of Lewis's fallacious arguments.1) Lewis discusses what he calls the \\"Rule\\" or \\"Law of Right and Wrong.\\" On p. 5, Lewis states that in regard to this law \\"everyone knew it by nature and did not need to be taught it.\\" On p. 12, he says that \\"I fully agree that we learn the Rule of Decent Behavior...as we learn everything else. \\" On p. 29, he talks of the \\"Moral Law which He put into our minds\\" and on p. 56 that \\"He left us conscience, the sense of right and wrong.\\" So which is it? Do we know this law automatically by our nature? Do we learn it? Or does God implant this knowledge into our heads? Logically, it cannot be all three. Obviously, Lewis cannot make up his mind.2) In chapter 2, Lewis makes the point that morality is not a mere social convention; that moral laws \\"like mathematics, are real truths\\" (p. 12). On this point, I fully agree with him. However, mathematical truths, like all scientific truths, are established through logic and/or evidence. Moral truths have to be established in the same way. Yet Lewis doesn't even offer an argument for the fundamental moral \\"truth\\" which he endorses. On p. 20, he states that \\"...all you are really saying is that decent behavior is decent behavior. You would have said just as much if you had stopped at the statement, \`Men ought to be unselfish.' And that is where I do stop.\\" So Lewis openly admits here that he has no reason as to WHY you ought to be unselfish. This is no coincidence since no valid reasons exist to be unselfish. Unselfishness does not simply mean being benevolent and fair towards others. A morality of unselfishness means that one ought to be unconcerned and indifferent to one's own life and welfare - \\"...a really humble man...will not be thinking about himself at all\\" (p. 128). Practiced consistently and as a matter of principle, unselfishness can only lead to self-destruction. Is this an exaggeration? I'll let Lewis answer this question for me. On the last page of \\"Mere Christianity,\\" he states \\"Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favorite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end.\\" If anyone reading this would like to learn about a rational morality that is logically derived from facts, then I would highly recommend the introductory book \\"Loving Life\\" by Craig Biddle.3) On p. 69, Lewis expresses frustration that when most people think of morality, they think of \\"something that interferes, something that stops you having a good time.\\" Yet, he has a whole chapter devoted to the alleged \\"virtue of chastity\\" and on p. 202 he suggests that masturbation is a sin. Also, on p. 86, he claims that \\"the only safe rule is to give more than we can spare... If our charities do not pinch or hamper us, I should say they are too small. There ought to be things we like to do and cannot do because our charities expenditure excludes them.\\" Now, if people accept this view of morality, then Lewis has absolutely no reason to be indignant that people view morality as \\"something that interferes\\" and \\"stops you having a good time\\" because that certainly IS an accurate assessment of Christian morality.4) On p. 55, Lewis states that \\"A man can accept what Christ has done without knowing how it works: indeed, he certainly would not know how it works until he has accepted it.\\" This is total nonsense and completely backwards. You do not have to accept a theory first in order to know and understand it. The proper course of action is to learn what a theory states first. Only after you know and understand it should you then decide if you will accept or reject the theory based on the logic and/or evidence that either supports or refutes it.5) The most muddled chapter in the whole book is chapter 8, \\"The Great Sin,\\" which is \\"Pride or Self-Conceit.\\" The Christian opposition to pride is not simply an opposition to self-conceit, but an opposition to self-respect, dignity, and self-esteem as well. Lewis makes this explicitly clear. On p. 125, he states that \\"Pride can often be used to beat down the simpler vices. Teachers...often appeal to a boy's...self-respect, to make him behave decently: many a man has overcome cowardice, or lust, or ill-temper, by learning to think that they are beneath his dignity - that is, by Pride.\\" If Lewis were talking strictly about self-conceit, then he would have made a couple of valid points in this chapter. Unfortunately, he lumps together very different and even opposite things all under the banner of \\"pride.\\" There is a fundamental difference between, on the one hand, arrogance, vanity, and self-conceit, and on the other hand, self-respect, dignity, and self-esteem. The latter set of qualities are have to be earned through being a decent person and are psychologically healthy, yet Christians, or at least Lewis, not only think that they are essentially no different from the former set of qualities, but that they are sinful as well.It didn't surprise me that Lewis failed to make a logical case for Christianity since most Christian claims and Christian principles simply defy logic and can only be accepted on faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis has been compared to such robust Christian and literary personalities as Chesterton and Samuel Johnson, and like them it's impossible to sum him up in a single sentence. Well -- Lewis was a fascinating man. I doubt he would have had his virtues if he had not had his contradictions. But all personal opinions about the man aside, this book is not Lewis at his best. Conceded, he had an extraordinary gift for metaphor, wrote with disarming clarity and lucidity, and, as far as I can tell, really strove to live a life of spiritual regeneration. These elements are present in this book, but cannot redeem its gross failing to make Christian orthodoxy appear logical. [You can interpret that remark however you like.] As Hardy (I believe it was) said of Cardinal Newman's _Apologia_, the argument is admirable and would compel assent if only one could accept the initial premises. I give it three stars because it is better than a lot of stuff that gets published, it's become sort of a classic and deserves a point for that, and, finally, it does have its &quot;moments&quot;; but I can't give it any more because of the frankly elementary lapses in reasoning, and because its reputation (IMHO) far exceeds its worth. Here's a tear-out guide to your likely reaction depending on your faith or lack of it:1) Theologically conservative Christian, esp. evangelical Protestant: You'll love this book, if you haven't already read it.2) Other Christian: You'll find much of value and might even be swayed toward Lewis's orthodoxy.3) Lapsed Christian and/or &quot;seeker&quot;: This could signal your reawakening, like the _Hortensius_ to St. Augustine -- depending on your previous reading and experience. But you're not likely to be *wholly* won over.3) Hardened atheist: You'll be confirmed in all your worst opinions about the intelligence of Christians.4) Agnostic: Your results will vary."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I know many people adore this book and are very hostile to low-star reviews so I want to be very careful to explain my viewpoint in a way that is fair and reasonable.SECULAR HUMANISTI am a Secular Humanist. That means I believe in truth, testing beliefs, evidence, ethics, growth, enriching human life, and enriching the world for future generations. I tell you this to assure you that I believe in many positive things and generally have a lot of hope for humanity and a lot of appreciation for positive instruction. For this reason, I appreciate a lot of the positive instruction that Lewis gives in Books III and IV. I am glad he has a positive attitude and these two sections of the book may very well do some good.However, I also believe in the testing of beliefs. I do not accept anything without question and any of my beliefs is always open to question. That does not mean I believe in nothing strongly. I very much do. But you can always change my mind with a reasonable argument or evidence. I'll never cling to any belief with complete unmoving certainty. As limited human beings I am convinced that we could never have any such invincible beliefs.With this foundation, I read the first two sections (Books I and II) of Lewis's book. Here is what I found:INNATE MORALITYIn Chapter 1, Lewis makes the praiseworthy analysis that all human beings have an innate morals. He shows this with undeniable examples. Essentially he shows that we all wish to be moral. Whenever someone calls us immoral, we instantly try to set our reputations right again. We may do this by apologizing and admitting wrongness or we may do it by defending ourselves and showing rightness. But either way, we are concerned with being in the right again. Either way, we are all concerned with morals.However, at the end of this otherwise laudible chapter, Lewis makes a sudden, weighty, unjustified assumption: we largely do not meet the demands of our innate morals. We are inherently immoral. Examples he uses are \\"you were unfair to your children when you were tired\\" or \\"you broke a promise because you were busy\\".The first assumption that Lewis makes here is that these occurences are common. I really feel they are not. I think it is rare that one breaks a promise and that it is usually on accident.The second assumption that Lewis makes is that these occurences are altogether terrible and deserve the weighty sledgehammer of a label \\"Immoral\\". I disagree here also. These are just mistakes. Mistakes that are altogether largely not our fault. They are tied up in the limitations of the human body and mind as well as the sheer difficulty of dealing with the natural world.MORAL LAWBut suddenly we have bigger problems because Lewis is making even bigger assumptions. Not only is he saying that we have innate morals (as he so eloquently argues for in the first chapter). He is assuming that these innate morals arise from a crystal clear Moral Law that all humans know. So not only is he saying we have moral sense, he is saying that every human situation has an obvious moral choice that every participant in the situation should know. The reason we humans do not always choose the obviously right choice dictated by the Moral Law is because of our selfishness.Let me give you some examples which bring this assumption into question.A man holds a gun in each hand to the heads of two other men. He asks you which of them should be killed. He will spare the other. Which do you choose?A man is standing in front of an oncoming car. If you jump in and push him out of the way, you will be killed. Both of you have families of equal size. So whichever of you is killed, their family will suffer. Which do you choose?Here is a final one that is probably closer to reality. You find that your country is filled with people who *appear* to want to kill you at any time. For example, you are members of different hostile social groups. You don't know for sure whether they are going to kill you but they could at any moment. Do you respect their right to human life and risk the lives of your family by not attacking? Or do you act on an unverified suspicion and risk attacking potentially innocent people but protect your family?The \\"obvious\\" choice of the Moral Law is not so obvious in these examples. Because either choice will cost someone. All difficult moral choices are like this and they are much more common than people think, especially in our complex global society. They are difficult choices because we don't have enough information to clearly choose one side over the other.Typically when people make different moral choices they do so because they have different information. Not because one is following the \\"Moral Law\\" and the other is not. Both people would follow the same innate morality given the same information (this has been demonstrated in scientific studies). But due to the vast complexity of the world and the limitations of our perception, we simply do not always have the same information as other people when making our judgments.DETRIMENTAL TO MORAL PROGRESSPeople like Lewis, who try to oversimplify the inherently complex global situations facing our world do much more harm than good. The most moral person would actually first recognize that they do not have all the information to make the perfect moral choice and probably never will. This person would recognize that it is their moral duty to question their own first assumptions about the situation and gather evidence to hone their perspective.I think it is clear that belief in an immediately clear Moral Law is actually detrimental to moral progress. Because what it actually does is cause people to believe that their first assumptions are the correct ones and then fight for them uncompromisingly. We very rarely have enough information for our first assumptions to be correct, especially in complex global situations. These situations involve need-to-know history and psychology of the conflicting parties before one could even fathom making an accurate moral judgement.Even in our everyday lives, with conflicts between just two people, two separate human lives can be so complex that one could not possibly make a satisfactory moral judgement without carefully examining both sides of the story. But the way Lewis talks, he seems to think that everyone just instantly knows what is happening and what the correct moral choice is. Lewis seems completely ignorant of the necessity of dialogue and careful examination to resolve moral issues between peoples. He thinks everyone should just \\"know\\" the \\"Moral Law\\".THE ORIGIN OF INNATE MORALITYUnfortunately, we are hardly past the first chapter but I am running out of room for my address of Lewis's assumptions. I've not even gotten to the part on page 29 where Lewis makes the unjustified leaps from \\"[there must be] Somebody or Something behind the Moral Law\\" to \\"[it is] Somebody\\" to \\"[it is] God\\". I agree that there is somebody or something behind innate morality. But Lewis hardly did any evidence examination to determine that it was Somebody. He just assumed it with very little justification.His perfunctory \\"herd instinct\\" argument starting on page 9 is hardly adequate to refute the belief that morality emerged from evolution. He is going to have to do more work than that to convince anyone with an understanding of natural selection that morality isn't an obviously valuable selection trait for evolution. I think there is clearly more evidence that it is \\"Something\\" (natural selection) behind innate morality and not \\"Somebody\\". Evidence for this goes back as far as Darwin himself who convincingly argued for it. Just search \\"Evolution of Morality\\" on Google.CONCLUSIONSSo I think no one here would deny that the concept of a crystal clear Moral Law is at the heart of C.S. Lewis's philosophy. And I don't think any reasonable person would deny that I have cast serious doubt on the reality of that concept.Probably my biggest criticism of Lewis is that he styles is writing in a way to make it appear to be unbiased reasoning when he is actually making many biased assumptions about the superiority of Christianity. And what is worse: unlike an honest philosopher, Lewis never states these assumptions explicitely. He seems to just make them and hope you don't notice the philosophical slip. Or maybe I am being too hard on him and he is making these assumptions unknowingly.In any case, this book is misleading for Christians because it gives them the illusion that they have objectively considered alternatives to their faith when they actually haven't. Lewis presents straw man versions of the real alternatives to Christianity (there is no mention of Secular Humanism, for example; maybe he just didn't know about it).And finally, as a critically thinking person, it was very frustrating for me to read Lewis because of his relentless onslaught of untenable assumptions to support each successive idea. It was like watching someone try to build a skyscraper out of driftwood. And I hope that's not too harsh. But that was my honest experience."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"After having only read the first five chapters of this book, I can already conclude that in my opinion, this book fails miserably at presenting a logical argument for the basis of Christianity. Lewis employs one logical fallacy after another in the first few chapters to prove that there is some Universal code of conduct (whether we follow it or not is our own personal decision). He claims that set A of morals obviously is \\"more correct\\" than set B of morals, as set A models itself more closely to the Law of Human Decency. His argument is strongly based on his belief that morality does not change over time, nor does it differ in any significant way from culture to culture.This is simply untrue, and his entire argument can so easily be disproved that a child could come up with sufficient counterexamples. Two quickly jump to mind... Firstly, attitudes towards homosexuality (homosexuals are abhorrently immoral in the eyes of Christians, but homosexuality was considered a blessing in the eyes of North American Indian religions). Secondly, attitudes towards drugs (Christians seem opposed to drugs and view drugs as being immoral, whereas many other cultures embrace drugs and find them to be a wonderful tool of knowledge). Who is to dictate which culture is more right in this case? Christians would obviously state that they are correct, seeing as homosexuality is condemned by the Bible. However, to say that Christians are correct would be to use the assumption that Christianity is correct, which is what Lewis is trying to prove in this book. You cannot use an assumption to prove an assumption! (The sky is green. Hence, the sky must be green.)Lewis' logic often resembles something akin to using examples to prove a point. Anyone who understands basic mathematics would realize that examples are utterly insufficient in proving a theory. I can easily say that 0 + 1 = 1 and 2 + (-1) = 1, hence any two numbers added together must equal 1. But clearly 3 + 3 = 1 is a ridiculous statement to make.Thus, sadly, there is little point for me in continuing to read this book, as Lewis will be extending his argument for Christianity based on his earlier arguments, which I believe I have sufficiently disproven.I give this book two stars because despite the fact that I think Lewis' arguments are flawed, his writing style is excellent.I realize that some of the Christians here will mod down this review as being unuseful, but just because my views disagree with yours does not indicate that my review is any less valid, important, or useful than your own. There is no harm in disagreeing and I hope I inspire at least one of you to read this book more critically and formulate your own arguments for the validity of Christianity. I read your reviews with an open mind. I hope that you will do the same with mine."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is an excellent read. Lewis manages to speak intelligently on a subject which is mostly surrounded by bluster and dogma. His logic is ultimately incorrect, however, and he makes numerous uses of the Extended Analogy fallacy. Still, it was an enjoyable read and it got me thinking. Though I do not agree with Lewis's conclusions, I enjoyed the road he takes to get there."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I had heard so many good things about this book, and have known of its sacred position amongst countless Christians (of which I am.) However, I was disappointed with this book.Sadly, C.S Lewis opens this book by attempting to prove God through logic. While I think Lewis makes some pretty good arguments (though you won't find much in these arguments that you've not heard before from other great thinkers), that does not mean they are bullet-proof arguments. Many will think of Lewis's arguments as greater than they really are, simply because he is able to adorn it with a very powerful and fanciful command of the English language and imagery (But that should not be unexpected, as he is a literary scholar from Oxford.) One thing that is always shocking to see is that a great deal of many Christians boast of how you can prove God through philosophy. But, many are not willing to accept you cannot. You cannot come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ through 'Mere Philosophy.' You can only come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ by having a revelation of Christ in your heart because the gospel has been proclaimed. Despite this, Lewis attempts to prove God not through the power of the gospel, but through man's ability to reason. The gospel message itself seems like but a 'Mere Ornament' by which Lewis decorates his Christmas tree (philosophy).Lewis also goes about describing the Christian life and doctrines, and what it means to be a new creation and other such things. But, despite talking about Christian things, he tends to lean on logic and fanciful parables than on Scripture. Lewis puts some things remarkably well, and has some great insights to these things. But, it is burried in a bunch of things he need not have said.Also, Lewis in this book only claims to being able to defend and talk about the Christian position as is generally embraced by all of Christiandome. And usually, he does not deviate from this pattern in his book. However, when it comes to doctrines concerning free will and evolution, he seems to deviate from the purpose of the book. I believe in free will, and I do not believe in evolution, but, Lewis talks about these things as if they were commonly embraced by Christiandom at large. When in fact, many branches of Christianity do not believe in free will, nor do they believe in evolution.There are many other flaws with the book, of which I will not get into. If you have not read this book, do consider reading it, as it is one of the most popular books written in the last 100 years. However, you would probably be better off getting a copy from the library than giving amazon.com money for this. You could find a better book out there to put on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis is skilled with the language, so the book is a pleasure to read.

It is simple to understand, and offers a lot of decent information for those not of the Christian faith. The one issue I seriously had with this book is the enduring belief that women must submit to men (first their fathers, and then their husbands), period, without considering a few important facts.To begin, \\"women\\" were married off (at best) to men twice their age. Of course they should listen to their husbands, they're mere teenagers! Being married off at this age was only logical, since the average woman was broken and worn by the age of 30; men can reproduce at any age, as long as they still have some level of libido. Furthermore, if anyone has problems with these girls being married off to men twice their age, would anyone feel any better if she were married off to another teenager?I didn't think so.I am a Christian, and I prefer to look for logic behind the words of the gospel rather than follow it blindly. I very much feel C.S. Lewis is guilty of the latter."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This was the first book by C.S. Lewis that I read. I have now read about 10 of this great author's works.

This is a life changing book to read..."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity was originally a series of radio broadcasts that Lewis began in England during the Second World War. He later made some revisions and collected these broadcasts into four books: Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe, What Christians Believe, Christian Behavior, and Beyond Personality: or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity. These four books were compiled into what is collectively Mere Christianity. What Lewis attempted to do is give a summary of the basic tenets and spiritual understandings of Christianity. This book, because of its basicness, crossed over the lines of Catholic, Protestant, and the subdivisions thereof. As stated in the foreword of the text, the impetus for this series of talks put on by the BBC was in reaction to the despondency with which many Britons were confronted in the course of beginning another World War. Lewis used wartime analogies in many places in his work. When reading Mere Christianity one cannot help but notice how it is placed in this interesting historical context.The title of this work serves it well. Mere Christianity touches on the basis of much of Christian thought. It shows Lewis's intimate understanding of his faith and his ability to articulately communicate this to his readers/listeners. While, as with any other work, I did not find myself in one hundred percent agreement with every single statement, far more often than not, I could not help but sense a growing enlightenment of God and the principles of Christianity as I read. After reading some of his other works, Lewis has again not disappointed me in the least with Mere Christianity. The book is easy to read and filled with wisdom."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A great place to start for anyone interested in learning about Christianity. This book strikes an effective balance between religion and theology. A thorough knowledge of the Bible is not necessary to get a lot out of this book. Lewis's writing flows easily and is very conversational (most of this book was originally broadcast as radio talks), and he has a wonderful way of illustrating his points with helpful examples."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"For all of his well deserved reputation as a brilliant thinker and writer, C.S. Lewis demonstrates it best by resisting the urge to 'sound brilliant.' In the three books that comprise \\"Mere Christianity,\\" Lewis shows off his mastery of discussing the simplicity of the gospel in simple terms without losing one iota of his intellectual or philosophical punch. Quite the opposite is true, in fact -- his lack of ostentation only adds force to arguments about a subject which shouldn't be all that complicated, but for some reason always seem to come out that way.One of the reasons Lewis was able to achieve this balance was that the book is actually derived from transcripts of a series of radio talks which Lewis presented in England during the WW2 years. As a layperson, lacking advanced theological training, and speaking to an audience of laypersons, Lewis delivered his talks with none of the jargon that typically accompany this type of discussion. In fact, when the talks were \\"cleaned up\\" and adapted into book form, Lewis intentionally chose to retain the folksy, familiar manner of speech that had characterized the original presentation.Lewis tackles a broad variety of subjects without hinting at too many \\"doctrinal distinctives,\\" things that tend to be particular to one denomination or another. His focus was on the common ground that the great majority of Christians can agree on. I was particularly impressed with his powerful apology for the existence of God. The classic ontological and teleological arguments are laid aside as Lewis proves with undeniable clarity and reason the logical necessity of God based on the innate human sense of right and wrong. Even the hardest skeptics will be challenged by this simple yet brilliant presentation. Whether you're a believer or a naysayer, this book will expand your mind."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"By any measure, this is a classic work of twentieth century apologetics. Lewis does an effective job of exploring the moral argument and then moves forward into presuppositional arguments. You may or may not agree with Lewis -- many fundamentalists struggle with his positions, as of course do atheists -- but anyone interested in questions of God's existence and nature will do himself a favor in reading this book.Discussing his own journey from atheism to Christianity, Lewis relates: \\"... in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist -- in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless -- I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality -- namely my idea of justice -- was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.\\""},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Here we see one of the most brilliant minds of the last century explaining his distaste with the Christian religion and how he came full circle to eventually embrace it. Lewis' stature can not be questioned; a man of seemingly limitless intellect, he found himself the lynchpin for many a Christian with questions and many a seeker with doubts. Lewis was an agnostic until mid-life when his unending search for truth and meaning brought his path alongside J.R.R. Tolkien's. Over time Lewis had gone from atheist to theist to eventually embracing the message of Christ. He could hardly believe it himself!This work is a classic. Originally compiled from a series of radio programs in Britain, it has been a best-seller ever since and impacted millions of lives. His insights into Natural and Moral law as well as virtue are mind-expanding to say the least. I will not presume to explain Lewis' arguments better than he, so just buy the book!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you remember the Tardis, the transportation machine that Dr. Who used to move from one time dimension to another, you will remember that it appeared to be a British telephone booth but, once inside, you found a huge multi-faceted complex. C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity is like that. A simple approach for believers or non-believers begins as a simple fireside chat about the existence of God and, if He exist, what His relationship is to Creation and the creatures. But once Lewis has captured your interest, you will find that there are many levels of focus in our search for God and that sundry evidences of God are right under our noses in a very matter-of-fact pattern. Lewis guides us through, if not an absolute tour of a search for God, a comprehensive survey of the basic questions most people ask about God and His nature. A great beginning book for seekers and skeptics.

In our day and time it is amazing how much Christians disagree, but Lewis seems to put all of this behind him.

Although the book is very deep and to many people a &quot;brain fryer&quot; I encourage all people to read this book especially children and most of all scoffers.

And I recommend it to all Christians, young or old, mature or not. I even recommend it to non-Christians. C. S. Lewis was an atheist before he came to Christ, so he understands and has worked through many common intellectual barriers to Christianity.But more important than that, C. S. Lewis has an uncanny knack of being able to simplify some of the more difficult to grasp theological concepts of Christianity, breaking them down into more simple ideas which are more easily understood.My only caution is that one must understand that this was originally a radio broadcast, which Lewis then wrote out and published. In some sections he takes a little more time to explain/explore things which he couldn't quite go into so much detail about on the radio. This makes for, I think, a more conversational tone of writing, which is very easily read. But also, this was originally published in the early 1940s in England, which means that there are certain cultural (English) and sociological (note the World War II influences) references and metaphors/analogies which can take a post-2000 mind a couple of extra seconds to translate.That said, the issues C.

He doesnt get into semantics as much as I thought he would, and is a great read for anyone interested in experiencing different world religions. \\"The Worlds Religions\\" by Huston Smith is also a great read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"GREAT TEXT FOR SEEKERS & NON BELIEVERS. CLEARLY DEFINES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND OTHER RELIGIONS."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The late C.S.Lewis in Mere Christianity displays all his talent for logic. He proves that you don't have to check your brain at the door to be a Christian. He gives a logical and detailed look into Christianity, its theology and its nature. A must read for Christians and non-christians alike.A philosophical triumph.This is not the preachy bible stomping tellings of an evangelical preacher. He is instead a master of logical aurgument, which he expresses with an eloquent tongue and witty charm.I can't recommend this book more if one enjoys a good philosophicl or theological read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Firstly, ask yourself, \\"are you satisified with the current philosophical world view?\\" Do you think Postmodernism protects your human rights? Does it criticise violence such as Sept 11 or the encroachments of Ashcroft? Why not? Can it say with confidence that GE food, famine, war, or globilasation are beneficial or not? Does it really beleive in itself? Modern philosophy is failing to provide a framework to the world we live in. If you think otherwise you should read more Derrida and Lacan to clear your head... now there is a contradiction!If the pomo assertion that truth is false is itself falsified, is found to be a deadend, then we are forced to look back at where we erred...Mere Christianity is an introductory work and as said below it is a complilation of talks given on radio, thus, the language is occasionally unnuanced and the arguments not as solid as could be.Nonetheless, CS Lewis has given us a classic, a thought provoking piece that gave me some new perspectives and concepts to address old issues with. It is a wonderful read.The biggest problem with the book though is the idea of \\"Mere-ism\\". I feel too many people read this work and use it as a licence for undefined nebulous Christianity, which is what Lewis warned against when he said that people must move out of the corridor of the house and choose a room. Choosing a church group that prides itself on faith in the corridor is not choosing a room.On the other hand, to the agnositics and others out there who might have been dissapointed with Mere Christianity, do not conclude that this is the pinnacle of Christian thought. It is an attractive primer but not all that there is to be said...Christianity has suffienct depth as you are prepared to explore.Two coversion stories of academics that spring to mind are:Seven Story Mountain by Thomas Merton (Communist to monk)Apologia pro vita sua by John Henry NewmanRebuilding a Lost Faith by John L. Stoddard is very good.If you want some modern philosophy to supplement the atheist humanists you are fed at college try the Cambridge don:Elizabeth Anscombe (Modern Moral Philosophy)You could also read David Hume and see if you really do agree with his atheist conclusions!Or you could try the highly amusing GK Chesteron (Everlasting Man, Heretics, Orthodoxy, The Thing), Oscar Wilde, Evelyn Waugh, Gordon Greene, or Tolkien.The Encyclical on Faith and Reason (Fides et Ratio) is worth looking at also."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis's prose is always easy on the brain. This is not to say that it's language for simpletons; it's simply easy to read. He handles complex subjects deftly through well-crafted example and analogy. Mere Christianity is, very roughly, his explanation of what Christians believe and why they believe it.While I enjoyed the book quite a bit, and came away with some new and helpful ways of thinking about old ideas, Lewis's arguments lack robustness. Often, I think they have enough to do the job of simple explanation, but when it comes to the most important doctrine, that of Incarnation, he accepts it with a handwave that had me scribbling in the margins and knitting my brow.I can't imagine reading this book and being converted. Despite that, I'm happy for having read it, and would recommend it to those who aren't seeking a robust proof or a converting experience."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a must read for any Christian who is tongue tied in his witnessing, and for an non-Christian who honestly wants the best reasons to believe.Anyone who is honest with theirselves after reading this book will have a lot of soul-searching to do...enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If I could have everyone in the world to read one book (besides the Holy Bible) it would be this one. I don't think anyone has ever discussed the logic and philosophy of Christian thinking the way Lewis does. Much of what has been written on Christian apologetics since has been a ripoff of this book. I can't wait to get to heaven to talk to C.S. Lewis. If you are a Christian or are someone interested in learning more about Christianity, give this book at try. It is very easy to read. It is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S.Lewis has some very good arguments, and illustrates them very clearly with parables or images. He makes you think a lot, and you face what he says in everyday life."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"CS Lewis has done it again. I have read this book twice now, and each time I read it I get more out of it. He is very logical and explains his points very well.A must for anyone's library."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book willnot only clarify any doubts in your heart about God's word, but will also change your way of living in God's grace. Buying this book is a necessity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is a succinct, articulate and compelling explanation of Christianity. Lewis has made the work easy to read and understand without resorting to over simplification. Ask your friends, children or relatives who say they do not believe in God to read this convincing work before stating their beliefs with any fervor. Trust me, you will be doing them a great favor!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Explains so many deep concepts very clearly. Anyone interested in understanding Christianity should read it, even if they're not interested in becomeing a Christian."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A logical presentation with vivid illustrations! Easy to read and understand. The reader is being guided step by step to comprehend the essences of Christianity. As a lively adaptation of this serious series of radio talks during the second world war when enmity was the core mentality, Lewis has successfully touched the heart of his readers with love and humility. He is particularly keen on giving his readers freedom not to read a certain chapter if they think the topic is irrelevant to them, thus making them even more eager to find out what is irrelevant. He also admits that some of his ideas are just guesses and some of his illustrations are limited, thus making him even more sincere and likable. Both Christians and \\"Christians-to-be\\" (as perceived by Lewis) will enjoy reading this concise and cogent case for Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book helps understand that God sees the world, time, and other things differently than we do. Solid answers to tough questions. Worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book when I was 17, in high school. I remember sitting on my bed, reading the last few sentences when Lewis talks about surrendering everything to Christ. Words can't describe."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book has stood the test of time and is worth reading to get an excellent perspective on life and Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is the greatest book ever. After reading this book I thought I must read another by this man, and now I have read 9 of his books and I am working on reading everything He wrote!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I like reading books on apologetics. It's one of my favorite subjects. I also really dislike buying a book and getting halfway through it and realizing it has nothing to offer me. To avoid this, I always get online and read book reviews. I also find top 10 lists very helpful. I will google something like \\"top 10 Christian books\\" or \\"top 10 books evangelism.\\" After doing this for a while, I noticed something curious. \\"Mere Christianity\\" by C.S. Lewis is almost always near the top of any top 10 list. And it's usually number 1. I avoided reading this book of a while. I thought, \\"Well I know C.S. Lewis is a great writer. He wrote the Narnia series. But it's just so old, it's probably dry, high theology.\\" Finally, I broke down and bought it, drudgingly. As soon as I began reading it though, I was immediately mad at myself for not reading it sooner. It is by far the best book on Christianity besides the bible itself. Lewis is so humble in his writing, but is clearly one of the most brilliant minds ever. You will find yourself following a line of thought and then suddenly he'll end it with something absolutely profound. He does it over and over again throughout the whole book. This book will bring you closer to Christ whether you're a beliver or not. If you're a Christian it will challenge you and help you to grow stronger in your faith. If you're an athiest or agnostic it will blindside you and cause you to question your logic.Just go ahead and read it. I've read it three times in a row."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a figurehead in modern Christian Theology for the everyday Christian. It makes an attempt at explaining why Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior of humanity through a well thought out series of consecutive arguments. C.S. Lewis' background as a lawyer is clear in his writing style, and his never ending analogies are frustrating to a reader who has doubts and disagreements with the logical thinking, but overall he argues his points well. This is no \\"Lion the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\", -the delightful children's fantasy novel that brought Lewis much of his fame- do not expect to be entertained by this book, it is much closer to a pro-Christ lecture. If you are a Christian this book will lend you relatively sound support for your beliefs, if you are a non-Christian this book will give you insight into the Christian belief system and with a critical eye you may find some of its holes. Many parts can be read and respected without the acceptance of Christ as Savior, such as my favorite chapter discussing pride, \\"The Great Sin.\\""},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"An excellent book on apologetics. Very deep but it deals with the complex subjects of Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"a great book on cd for driving time.

Merry Christmas! This complete C.S. Lewis collection represents the perfect gift for holiday giving."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I loved this classic hardback edition. I wanted to reread \\"The Great Divorce\\" and compare it to recent findings regarding the plasma universe. Uncannily, Lewis wrote the literary equivalent of what is now being discovered in quantum physics."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity was recommended by a friend and does not disappoint. Not for the \\"new\\" or \\"baby\\" Christian, but thoughtful study and insight for a more mature pilgrim. As to the seller, service was prompt and condition of the book was excellent! Excellent shopping experience!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is excellent at explaining the foundations of Christianity. Lewis does not single out any particular denomination, or even mention them for that matter. He simply tries to explain the basis for Christian beliefs that all denominations have in common. The books helps Christians understand the reasoning for certain doctrines, and non-Christians understand why Christians believe what we do. Lewis explains his reasoning in a clear and easy to understand manner. I also believe this is one of those books that can be read over and over, and the reader discovers something new each time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is an incredibly talented author! He is such an inspiration and brilliant human being with a mind focused on Christ and a life to mirror it. This book has helped to uncover the truths of Christianity and fully establish Jesus as the one true God. C.S. Lewis eliminates other religions as he takes you into a philosophical and spiritual debate where faith and fact come together in Christianity and the life of Christ."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"For anyone wanting to understand the very basic ideas of christianity, this book will not disappoint you. Lewis uses logic and reason as a way to relate the fundamentals of Christianity so that a belief in things, seen only with faith, can bring a peace that can surpass all understanding."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I find his books to be great insights into being a Christian. Had read several of the books in previous years wanted to share his writing with friends. \\"The Great Divorce\\" is such a clear picture of hell. I highly recommend the set."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is great for believers and unbelievers alike. CS Lewis has a way with taking the complicated out of the way and boiling truth down to anyones level"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"CS Lewis Signature Classics is a great book. I find it very handy to have all the books in one place. It made for a great gift."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book by C. S. Lewis was adapted from a 1943 series of radio broadcasts. It is a wonderful work in Christian apologetics.To form the information obtained in this book Lewis interviewed Christian believers of all kinds; Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican, etc. His purpose was to find those points that nearly all Christian religions agree upon. He sought to avoid controversies in order to explain those things that are common to all Christians in all places and times.Lewis takes an amazingly academic and intellectual approach to Christianity. In fact, the first half of the book does not talk about Christianity. He starts with the question of, is there right and wrong? From there the book leads the reader on a rational and systematic path that is full of intellect, reason and common sense. Each point builds on the undeniable conclusion of the previous point.By the middle of the book the reader is convinced of a one true God and His son. Lewis continues his logical approach to culminate with the sound conclusion that Heaven exists, and the only way to it is through Christ.This is one of the most amazing apologetic works written. It is perfect for intellectual, nonbelievers that suppose Christianity is the product of dimwitted simpletons. In this book Lewis does not use the Bible or doctrine to prove the existence and God and Christ. Lewis uses logic, philosophy, science and modern reasoning to prove that their can be no commonsense alternative to the existence of one true God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of the best books to read if you have no faith or want to deepen your faith. CS Lewis is one of the premier Christian writers of this century."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Books arrived in good time and in excellent condition. The cover designs are wonderful."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have heard for the last five years or so that C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity is an essential read for every Christian, but now after having read it, I whole-heartedly agree! I might go so far as to say that for Christian and Atheist alike it is valuable. Lewis' logic is incredible! He carefully reasons out the stance of the Christian mind everywhere regardless of creed or affiliation.Mere Christianity is actually a set of talks given originally on British radio. Lewis discussed in three books or parts the following things:* Right and Wrong - a clever discussion of Man's moral law* Christian Beliefs - the logical reason for the existence of a God and its alternatives* Christian Behavior - the essence of Man's moral law* The doctrine of the Trinity - God as we believe him to beI thoroughly enjoyed Lewis' discussion of Man's view of right and wrong. He presents it as a code of morals that everyone should adhere to but doesn't. Oddly enough, as I read Lewis' reasoning, I saw myself in a new light of logic and was able to reflect on the humor of my own state without condemning myself for weakness; I merely felt the desire to be more informed. We are the mortal man and Lewis says:\\"We do not merely observe men, we are men. In this case we have, so to speak, inside information; we are in the know. And because of that, we know that men find themselves under a moral law, which they did not make, and cannot quite forget even when they try, and which they know they ought to obey.\\"Not only was I enlightened to the state of Man and his logic as far as religion is concerned but was also able to see concepts of religion piece by piece. I was forced to evaluate my own comments and previous religious discussions from logistical standpoint. Christianity really does have more logic than I have previously given my faith credit for. It isn't just believing. It is seeing that all alternatives do not hold the creditable reasoning that the existence of a God and a greater plan do.Overall the book was entertaining and fun, thought provoking and engaging, though sometimes a little more thought-provoking than I had thought to give. I enjoyed it! Make sure that you take the time to evaluate yourself while reading it; it will surely enlighten and improve upon your own genius. It certainly has changed mine."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a very thorough collection. It's worth the price just for 'Mere Christianity' and 'Screwtape Letters.' Definitely a great read for someone wanting to see Christianity in a more profound and thought-out way. I bought this book for someone I know who's asking a lot of questions about my faith. I was just going to give it to them to read but they thought C.S. Lewis was 'just Narnia' so I decided to read it before I tried to make them. I'm defnitely glad I did because not only will it help him but it also taught me a lot that I didn't know before. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The shipping was super fast and the book is great. It was in great shape. I have read this book already before purchasing and think it is a must own for all Christians. It begins with basic, simple teachings of the Christian faith. From this book you can work up to many more complicated, philosophical and scientific expressions of the Christian faith. Great apologetic!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Some clear aspects of Lewis' journey to faith are seen in this timeless testimony to God's grace in today's secular swindle. As the title suggests, the author's target reminds me of that old camera I carried with a wide angle lens attachment. He accepts a large and varied audience and links them together as \\"Christian\\". In the end, however, much like his mentor Chesterton, he comes back to the basic Creeds as they emerge from Biblical truth. A worthy read for one honestly searching for truth in an age of fruitless reason without the joy and peace of God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is one of the most widely read books in the Christian world. I would consider myself to be a stand-up Christian; Christianity is the main focus of this book. Though many of my friends and family have read this book and told me to read it, I procrastinated until now and I regret that decision. It gives great insight into the beliefs of all Christians everywhere. The author's experiences in religion and writing come together in this book to give the reader a wonderful uplifting experience.While reading the book I felt as if C.S. Lewis was reading it to me himself; it is very first person and written from a Christian's stand point looking out. If you are a Christian you may question what it is you believe or why it is you believe what you do. Though he does not dwell on beliefs of others, you may find that many of the truths he believes in, you also believe in, even if you have thought otherwise. The author takes himself and his opinions out of his writings and writes commonly know facts so that his readers can form their own ideas and opinions.He shares many convincing thoughts in this book that I had never thought about, for example: \\"Christ suffers something for nothing he even offers everything for nothing. In a sense the whole Christian life consist in accepting that very remarkable offer. But the difficulty is to reach the point of recognizing that all we have done and can do is nothing. What we should have liked is that God count our good points and forget our bad ones.\\" I believe that when we strive to do what is right we will find that God indeed does forget our bad points, just like we forget our own mistakes in time.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone trying to figure out who they are and who they really want to be. It is a very in-depth book with wonderful insight, the only downfall I would say is that the chapters don't seem to have much to do with one another."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Beautifully written arguement why Christianity is logical and intelligent. A great read for those who need to acquire a better understanding of Christian Faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I would give this about 50 stars if I could.the best description of how a Christian, who is trying to \\"put on Christ\\" should act. Explains loving your enemy, pride, judging, becoming a better person and so much more in just the most awesome way ever.(Sorry if I sound like a teenager, I'm not. It's just that wonderful)Listening to this in my car truly changed my life. I want to give it to all my friends and even total strangers.The narration is almost as good as the content. It's a stodgy British guy, which is totally perfect.A few choice quotes:\\"a man who is getting better understands the badness that remains in him more and more. A man who is getting worse understands his own badness less and less.\\" and \\"good people know about both good and evil. Bad people don't know about either.\\"This I've got to paraphrase - every choice, every action, makes an impact on \\"the central man\\" which is slowly \\"turning into either a heavenly creature or a hellish creature.\\"\\"All of the worst sins are purely spiritual. . . which is why a cold, self-righteous prig who goes regularly to church, can be much closer to hell than a prostitute.\\"\\"Men judge each other on our external actions. God judges us based on our moral choices.\\""},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I had read two of C.S. Lewis' works- Mere Christianity and the Chronicles of Narnia-and wanted to read more of his books.This book is great in that it contains some of classics like the Screwtape Letters, Miracles, etc. in one edition.I have not completed the entire work yet, but have enjoyed what I have read so far. C.S. Lewis is one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century and you will see why when you read some of his literary masterpieces contained in this edition. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book breaks Christianity down into easy to understand terms. I wish someone had put it into my hands as a teen or twenty-something. Lewis is such a deep thinker that it took getting through the first two chapters before I began to grip what he was saying. Since reading it, I have given away several copies to seeking friends. It is a favorite."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Perhaps I can best sum up my feelings about C.S. Lewis's magnum opus, Mere Christianity, by stating that if I could place one book into the hands of every human being on the face of the earth, besides the Bible, and have everybody read it, I would hand out copies of Mere Christianity. It would be an easy choice, too. No book, that I have read, better explains the gospel, Christian orthodoxy or the case for Christianity than Lewis's classic work on apologetics.Mere Christianity was first delivered as a series of lectures over the radio during World War II, these talks later became the basis for three published works - The Case for Christianity, Christian Behavior, and Beyond Personality. In 1952, the three works were combined into one book, Mere Christianity, and no book has more impacted Evangelical thought since.In the Preface, written in 1952 when the three works were combined, Lewis explains the purpose behind the book:\\"The reader should be warned that I offer no help to anyone who is hesitating between two Christian \\"denominations.\\" You will not learn from me whether you ought to become an Anglican, a Methodist, a Presbyterian, or a Roman Catholic. This omission is intentional (even in the list I have just given the order is alphabetical). There is no mystery about my own position...But in this book I am not trying to convert anyone to my own position. Ever since I became a Christian I have thought that the best, perhaps the only, service I could do for my unbelieving neighbours was to explain and defend the belief that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times.\\"Hence, the rest of the book is spent \\"presenting an agreed, or common, or central, or \`mere' Christianity.\\"The book is divided into four sections, the first of which leads the reader to the conclusion that there is a universal moral code, or standard, which is written on people's hearts. Lewis calls this the Law of Human Nature which \\"tells you what human beings ought to do and do not.\\" Lewis carefully builds his argument through the chapters of this section and, in the end, leaves no doubt in the reader's mind that there, indeed, must be someone or something that placed this law in mankind's consciousness. He then demonstrates that, even though all mankind is aware of this law, we still choose to disobey it on a regular basis and, furthermore, are completely unwilling or incapable of obeying it all the time.Lewis makes it clear that this does not prove the Christian God. Instead, he states, Christianity can only begin to make sense within this context. He concludes:\\"When I chose to get to my real subject in this roundabout way, I was not trying to play any kind of trick on you. I had a different reason. My reason was that Christianity simply does not make sense until you have faced the sort of facts I have been describing. Christianity tells people to repent and promises them forgiveness. It therefore has nothing (as far as I know) to say to people who do not know they have done anything to repent of and who do not feel that they need any forgiveness. It is after you have realised that there is a real Moral Law, and a Power behind the law, and that you have broken that law and put yourself wrong with that Power - it is after all this, and not a moment sooner, that Christianity begins to talk. When you know you are sick, you will listen to the doctor.\\"In another section of Mere Christianity, \\"Christian Behaviour,\\" Lewis discusses moral rules and behavior, where he likens moral rules to \\"directions for running the human machine.\\" He states that morality \\"seems to be concerned with three things.\\" He writes:\\"Firstly, with fair play and harmony between individuals. Secondly, with what might be called tidying up or harmonizing the things inside each individual. Thirdly, with the general purpose of human life as a whole what man was for: what course the whole fleet ought to be on: what tune the conductor of the band wants it to play.\\"He continues, \\"You may have noticed that modern people are nearly always thinking about the first thing and forgetting the other two.\\" In this section are short chapters covering a variety of virtues and issues including social morality, chastity, marriage, justice, prudence, temperance, charity, forgiveness, pride, hope and faith. In each chapter Lewis discusses topics with his typical wisdom and keen insight.The genius behind Mere Christianity is that Lewis is able to explain the important and essential doctrines of the Christian faith without using religious jargon or technical theological terms. This makes the book accessible to the most uninitiated in Christianity. Lewis also superbly lays the foundations of Mere Christianity in the opening chapters. Using reason and philosophy, he scales the heights of truth, all the while making sure to climb at just the right pace that simultaneously ensures he challenges his readers without leaving them behind."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is amazing. In the opening pages, C.L. Lewis grabs the reader and pulls them in!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"And you are an avid reader of CS Lewis you will not be disappointed at this collection of truths. He makes one feel a sense of obligation to be a better person, a more informed soul and a true desire to share in the journey of knowing such salvation. From start to finish the origin of his storytelling can only be described as breathtaking!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"These books are wonderful and a \\"must have\\" for any C.S. Lewis fan. They are light weight and easy to handle. The print is very small so I wouldn't recommend this particular set for anyone with vision problems. The type is double spaced though, making it easier to read. If you are looking for a gift for a devoted Christian, this set of books would be a safe bet."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The breadth and scope of this book are truly staggering. Lewis, a former atheist, tackles virtually every major issue one could think of pertaining to Christianity (his starting point is actually philosophy and natural law) with precision and clarity. His style is very readable and replete with profound imagery that adds layers of meaning to his writing (I will grant that some of these illustrations are a bit dated, but the brilliance is still there). Lewis writes with honesty, humility and simplicity. This book is teeming with information, and an intial reading will only begin the process of gleaning the treasures this volume contains. It is a book I have found myself returning to again and again to re-read sections or parts I have highlighted. I would go so far as to contend that virtually anyone who reads this book will be challenged or transformed by some portion of it, regardless of their beliefs. It is truly that remarkable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Excellent format, however a bit oversized for my library. Lewis has been a favorite for a long time. Good to have the entire Classics in one volume."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"this book is great because it is all in one, and also has a nice clear font with a good size. The actual writings of CS Lewis are amazing."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"An awesome, moving, collection of books. I am a changed man for reading his works."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have not finished reading the whole thing, but I have read three of the books included already. This man was a genius."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"For some reason Harper Collins specifically arranges for Canadians who buy ebooks via the Amazon.com website to get higher pricing and exclude them from sale pricing. I can't imagine why, it takes no more to deliver to us wirelessly and I'd have to assume our converted US funds are just as good."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I thought this was going to be much better than it was. I had high expectations because of the good things I've heard about CS Lewis but I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Everything was shipped timely and in good condition as promised. Would purchase again."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"By &quot;mere&quot; Christianity, Lewis means that he is writing about the fundamental issues that all Christ-based religions can agree upon. It is written in a conversational tone, with few references to particular bible verses. An outstanding work. This was written 50 years ago but is timeless and accurate today."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book has changed my life in such a positive way. I really questioned my own Christian faith before reading this. Finally, it all makes sense!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A friend of mine told me this was the best defense of the Christian faith from this century. He lent me a copy. I left it in the front room and a room mate read it and then expressed an interest in becoming a Christian. This is mostly effective for intellectuals. If you want to lead people to faith this is probably one of your best bets."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis (my favorite non-fiction author) has written an excellent defense of the Christian faith. This book is the foundation for modern apologetics. A must read for Christians in a modern intellectual society."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"the content of the book is undoubtedly good. However,the edge of the book is rough due to bad cut.I returned the book and got a new one but still the publisher did not inspect properly this book condition before they release it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Wow, what an inspiring book, I surely needed it. For those of you who are perfect, you don't need to read it.If there was one book, besides the KJV bible, that I would recommend reading, it is this one."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I accidently wrote 2 reviews for the same book. Heh heh...ignore."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Reading this book one is struck by the author's style, so much a product of his time and place. Lewis had a good intellect and a good command of his subject. But this is not a textbook, nor is it even an examination of the fundamental beliefs underpinning Christianity. It's a pep rally intended to persuade the uncertain that Christianity is the one true religion and correct in all its basic assumptions. As such it must fail because this can only be determined by faith.What is so fascinating is how Lewis develops his mild-mannered sweet style, a voice so unassuming you would forgive him anything. He is always refined, logical, and methodical, sometimes painfully so. Thus, when in the middle of a rational sentence you find a phrase like, \\"Every time an English child sticks a fork into an electrical outlet, ten Chinese men laugh uproariously,\\" one simply nods one's head in agreement.Sadly, this charm does not qualify as intellectual honesty, what Lewis is passing off as rigorous logic would get him thrown out of a freshman year philosophy class. He uses misdirection regularly, sometimes flat denial, other times simply skirts by issues, and even defines things by their opposite!When I watch an unctuous televangilist banging on the bible and asking for money, I know I've got a huckster who, in another life would have been a used car salesman. What makes this book so incredibly dangerous is that its lunatic message is delivered with grace, dignity, and erudition. The man with the briefcase steals more than the man with the gun."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A friend recommended this book as something that would encourage \\"logical\\" belief in God. I doubt he read it himself, first.Most of the claims he makes are based on assumptions, which makes for very frustrating reading."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Author's argument for belief in God apparently is derived from what he sees is our innate knowledge of the law of right and wrong. I'm confused as to why christian apologists often assert this as something obvious, when it seems to me to be anything but obvious. Ants behave for the good of the colony rather than for their own benefit. Does that mean that ants know right and wrong? Or are some socially co-operative behaviors simply instinctual? Of course much of our moral behavior has been taught to us as well, which helps to explain why there are such vigorous disagreements as to what is right and what is wrong. But what I DON'T see about morality is what the author asserts, i.e. that we all agree on the same morality and that the existence of this morality is spooky and mysterious.Of course christians will claim that this is a wonderful book and the fact that non-christians don't &quot;get it&quot; only goes to show that they must be non-christians. But isn't the point of the presentation to persuade? On that score a cannot rate this book very highly."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book builds up chapter by chapter as sort of an argument for Christianity. The first chapter tries to argue that all people, for all time in all cultures, all have an inante sense of Moral Law, and despite minor differences, everyone has the same Moral Law, and that therefore, there must be a God.I find it incomprehensibly narrow minded that Lewis feels the only explanation for humans having common, cross cultural behavior, is a God. I was hoping for this book to keep me interested for quite a while, but instead I'm getting a rehashing of Descartes, and no credit is even given!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of several Christians, including some who seemed quite intelligent. I was therefore surprised to find, upon reading it, that the basic argument Lewis makes is a mess of holes, even by the standards of religious apology.Lewis attempts to present a logical case for the existence of a Christian God, starting with general premises and building to greater religious specificity. But even his very first, most general premises are weak, almost foolishly so, and wouldn't convince anyone who wasn't already psychologically committed to being convinced. And many of the subsequent elements in his argument are also patently flawed. The net result is a chain of logic that is broken at many points, starting with the first link.So why did I give the book three stars? Because while not providing any rational defense of Christianity--if such is even possible--Lewis does provide some nice insights, including folksy but penetrating formulations, of fundamental Christian beliefs. So, from my perspective, the book can help someone understand what Christianity is, but it certainly won't convince anyone who is thinking clearly to believe."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis does a diservice to Christianity in this book. His views are narrow and his explanations both condescending and banal. The statement that Jesus can be only the son of God, or one of a demon is ridiculous and serves only to keep himself feeling safe. He ignores scripture by stating this. &quot;All things I have done, you can do also and more....&quot; He ignores what does not fit his preconceived notions and speaks primarily to and for old women wanting the assertions that they have always believed in validated by an intellectual. He takes no risks in this. He does not stretch his mind, or the reader's imagination. It's old dogma spoken in a modern and rational language. It's dull in the extreme."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I don't want to appear as an ally of Satan (God forbid!), but I don't think this is the impeccably argued treatise so many people think it is.It appears to be a work of propaganda more than a work of philosophy. I have in mind, particularly, the giant switcheroo pulled on the reader between Book I and Book II.Book I is a reasonable discussion of the \\"moral sense\\" or \\"moral law\\" in human beings, something which made a great impression on Kant and, more recently, on Anthony Flew. From this, Lewis argues himself to a position which he himself calls \\"theism,\\" and at one point warns the reader that any discussion of Christianity is \\"a hundred miles off.\\"Well, it's not.Flip the pages to Book II, and suddenly you are plunged into the thick of organized religions -- how some of them are pantheistic, etc. etc. And then we go right into the question of Jesus Christ. Lewis famously insists that Jesus was (a) God himself in human form (b) a loonie or (c) something much worse, such as an emanation from Satan.In my opinion, he ignores the gospel record. If you pick up Mark and read it dispassionately, you will discover that Jesus was a faith-healer, an exorcist, and a miracle-worker. According to Schweitzer, he predicted his second coming within the lifetime of his disciples. I don't need to pick one of the cards which C. S. Lewis tries to force on me; I simply note that he was wrong. (Lewis does not even mention this problem, technically known as the \\"delayed parousia.\\")This is not a convincing book, and I will continue to regard Lewis as a second-rate author."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Although technically well written, Lewis' argument stumbles from one questionable assumption to the next. The result is a sad parody of logical thought.For a Christian this book is a gift, it reinforces faith that already exists. For those on the edge of faith, Lewis might be the push they are searching for. Other than that, it is unlikely to have any lasting effect on the reader."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is without doubt the finest Christian apologetic who ever lived. While reading &quot;Mere Christianity,&quot; I could not help being impressed with his persuasive writing style and heart-felt conviction. Upon closer inspection, however, subtle ambiguities come to light. Though they are too numerous to mention here, suffice it to say that Lewis relies on emotion rather than logic and empiricism to reach his &quot;logical&quot; conclusions. On the positive side is his irreproachabe sincerity: C.S. Lewis is one of the few men who give Christians a GOOD name. Regardless of his faith, he was a lion of a man and scholar, and his kind is sorely missed. Too bad he, like so many others, preferred comfort to the Truth."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is just more of the same explanations people have been making to justify the existence of god for centuries. There is nothing new in it. It offers no new light on the question of god. I find it interesting that so many people are converted to Christianity by this book. Lewis just drove me that much further from believing in a god, whether Christian or otherwise."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In C.S. Lewis' defense, I believe his chauvinistic comments are caused by his age and traditional views regarding the bible's interpretation, and not so much because he thought of women as worthless. Despite that little \\"rough spot\\" of his, I thoroughly enjoyed C.S. Lewis' writing style and ideas regarding the common grounds between the Christian denominations. If only more of us realized that we are to think for ourselves, and realized that religious divisions over what is, actually, very similar is hindering our understanding of God's love for us and our ability to love thy neighbor. Personally, C.S. Lewis REALLY hit me home when he talked about pride as a pretty significant sin. I'm guilty.There are many, many good messages out there, but they are lost due to dry writing and heavy concepts. C.S. Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" does a great job of sharing his insight and research to either draw people back to their faith or inform others that want to learn about some basic Christianity. His simplicity is simply the art of taking heavy concepts and relating them in digestible chunks.

Lewis, the author. Without a shadow of a doubt, this book addresses questions that nearly every single person who either believes or disbelieves in Christianity has had at one time or another. For that alone, this book is a must read.But Lewis does an amazing job of presenting very logical and compelling arguments as to why Christianity's answers not only makes sense but appear to be logical conclusions to questions of God, evil, love, purpose, etc. (Just like any good argument, there are, of course, shades of gray that many individuals will cite as \\"proof\\" that Lewis is wrong however most arguments of such have even darker shades of gray, due to the infinitely evil of \\"close-mindedness.\\"In terms of writing, Lewis is clear, concise (most of the time, :), and, above all, profound.

I recommend this book without reservation for believers, but I'm not sure all the reasoning here is completely cogent for nonbelievers, or the best place for a nonbeliever to begin looking for God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In this book, the great Christian apologist, C. S. Lewis, sets forth to explain the beliefs that have been held in common throughout the ages by nearly all Christians. Lewis was a respected literature professor at Oxford University and a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien. He became famous during his Christian radio broadcasts on BBC during World War II. He has written many books on Christianity, but this is one of his very best. Using simple language, he explains that God must exist. With reason, he explains the various tenets set forth in the Christian religion. This short book, can serve as a great beginning for someone who is trying to invoke reason in the Christian faith. A great defender of the faith, Lewis frequently debated atheists, and helped people to accept Christ when faulty reasoning might have temporarily been in their way. Read this, and find yourself becoming a better evangelist, by learning answers to many questions that seekers might ask. This is the first C. S. Lewis book to read. After that, you may be hooked."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Review of the Box Set: 2 starsBut for now, I'm reviewing this box set. I can't speak for everyone, but in the box set that I received, the pages in every last book were frayed and uneven, as though they'd been cut with crayola scissors by someone with a very unsteady hand. If you can, get the books from some other source.I really like these books, so this was a -major- letdown to me.Review of Mere Christianity: 4 starsI had to get to this book eventually. In apologetics circles, it's considered a classic. Strong-worded enough to be assertive, and yet still vague enough that it can be used by both Catholics and protestants alike to defend their faith.I have to say straight-out that I consider most of this book to be a masterpiece, even though I generally balk at anything even the slightest bit vague. I had a few issues with the book from time to time, but none of them is anything major, and I can deal with them quickly in just a few paragraphs, while also covering the stuff I particularly liked.Lewis is as much of, if not more of a popularizer than he is a theologian, so his prose and patterns of speech are nice and casual; usually easy to read, even when dealing with very complex subjects.He first talks about natural law, the difference between right and wrong, and the reason for that difference. No disagreements here. Next, he discusses conceptions of God and our relationship with him. Still no complaints. Lewis is frequently amusing throughout these parts, as well as edifying. Many of his comparisons are obviously intended to be humorous, while still being entirely true and correct.Next, he gets into the meat of morality, and several key sins, such as sins against the virtues, social morality, sexual morality, offenses against marraige and so forth. All good and important topics. The one problem I have here is that he describes sexual immorality as one of the \\"least bad\\" sins. It's not. In fact, it can be one of the most dangerous mortal sins, not because of its inherent severity, but because of its inherent draw, and the complexity of the issue, which often makes it hard to comprehend why it's wrong. The problem, of course, is that sexual immorality devalues another person for your own pleasure, and when you start devaluing people for pleasure, it's -very- hard to stop, until eventually, you devalue everyone, and the only person you care about is yourself. Sexual immorality, in other words, can lead to the mentality that other people exist only to give you pleasure or satisfaction, which is as far removed from Christian charity as you can get.Next, the book gets into more of the virtues, as well as the vice of pride. I didn't think Lewis sufficiently pinned down just what exactly the sin of pride -is,- what makes it a sin and when, but I'm always looking for greater specificity in things like this.Book four of Mere Christianity gave me, I think, the most problems. Let me see if I can outline them.1. Lewis seems to think being nice is an inherently good thing. I can think of many situations where this wouldn't be the case, like a drill instructor, or a parish priest during his homilies. I'd have defined the difference between \\"nice\\" and \\"good\\" a bit more closely first.2. There's something of a division within Christianity on the subject of whether the resurrected saints are completely different people, or whether they're the same people; just resurrected with a better chance to live their lives well. I'm of the latter school of thought. Lewis, it seems, is not. Related to that...3. Lewis seems to imply that we need to sacrifice everything we've ever known, including our personhood, permanently, in order to make room for God. This is a misunderstanding. God is infinite. If we needed to \\"make room\\" for him, we could only do it by ceasing to exist. He seems to go back on this somewhat in the final chapter, but there's still the sense that the sacrifices of Christian life are permanent, not temporary, and that's not how I read Romans 8:11. I've always taken that verse to mean that all the things we have to give up in this life; \\"kill\\" here on Earth for the sake of doing right, will be restored to the saints in paradise, once the risk of sin is past.Still, as I said, none of these issues is too major, and none really tells too badly against this book. Additionally, there's an analogy near the end of the book which, in my view, is potentially better than even the book's author seems to realize. He describes the Christian faith is a sort of seed of evolution, like lumps on the back of a horse, which will eventually turn into wings, and give it the power to outstrip all the other horses in its ability to leap over barriers. However, until they become functional wings, you won't notice much difference in its ability to leap barriers.Now, the reason I say this is an even better analogy than he may have realized is that really, if a horse had incomplete, wing-like lumps on its back, it would, for the moment, be -less- capable of leaping over barriers, since it would be weighed down by those lumps. We often feel ourselves weighed down by the burden of having to do right; the difficulty of moral values in the face of an enemy who cheats repeatedly, and the realization that we can't achieve victory on these terms. We may even blame our faith for it. However, if we stick it out, if we wait a while, those burdensome lumps will become beautiful wings, and will become, not a hindrance, but an advantage. This, I think, shows some of the potential of this analogy. It's beautiful.If you want a basic grounding in Christianity, you could do a lot worse that to pick this book up and leaf through it. It's got a lot of good answers, which you might just need someday when your kids start asking you big questions about life and the faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"We read this book for my bible study group. There were mixed views on it...I myself wasn't a huge fan of the book for a few reasons. This book is based on radio broadcasts by Lewis a long time ago, and as a result a lot of the things Lewis discusses don't account for recent developments and modern day things that affect Christianity. Also, I felt like Lewis was a bit closed minded in his scenarios and theories about Christianity. However, I have heard people say that they converted to Christians after reading this book so maybe there is something I am missing. It isn't the best book for a discussion, its probably better for reading for yourself. The book does discuss interesting topics and like Christianity and Marriage, Faith, Hope, etc. Overall, although I didn't like it too much, i don't regret reading it either, so maybe that says something for the book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a great version of Mere Christianity. Since it is based on a radio program, it is easy to read. I like the changes and notes CS Lewis made after the initial printing.Two ideas that have stuck with me:1. The fact that we all know what we *ought* to do is one way to prove that there is a supreme being.2. All ideas about God are just that. If you like it and it works for you, good. Use it. If you don't, well then, it's time to go back to prayer and Bible study."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you are looking for \\"proof\\" of the existence of God, or that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, no book on earth will give it to you. We all have our own journeys to -- or away from -- faith. The atheists who wrote reviews of this book, however, can no more prove the non-existence of a Supreme Being than those of us who have come to believe can convince them. If, however, you want to read a brilliant treatise on one man's faith -- beautiful in its simplicity and truly inspirational -- you cannot do better than \\"Mere Christianity.\\" As a Roman Catholic who was away from the Church, and from God, for over 30 years, but who spent those 30 years in constant questioning and searching for the answers, this book was a blessing to me.

But Lewis absolutly out did himself in Mere Christianity. I wish every nonbeliever would read this book to learn a bout the basic teaching and theologies of Christianity, and that every Christian would read this book to find out how much they really have in common with each other. Beautifully written. A true classic for all time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Sometimes a classic is remembered only as a classic and not for what made it a classic. Sometimes a generation passes and one of its greatest voices is remembered by name only. For some people, re-reading a classic may refresh their mind and heart with a book enjoyed long ago. For others, the classic book is a new conversation with timeless ideas. Mere Christianity is a classic, and C.S. Lewis is still a great voice echoing to new generations.Mere Christianity was first published in 1952 as a compilation of books and responses to questions produced from a four-part series of radio broadcasts that Lewis gave during World War II; consequently, the book has four sections corresponding to the radio series.The short chapters in Mere Christianity are brilliantly written and enjoyable to read. Each chapter progresses through a tour of Christian beliefs and practices for the unbeliever who is honestly interested in understanding Christianity. Objections are dealt with as they logically arise. Throughout the book, Lewis is constructing a case to prove that Christianity is a logical response to the questions of our lives. Like a lawyer in court, he persuades us through the cumulative weight of his case, never getting ahead of himself. He also proves he is a master of the hypothetical example that clarifies a difficult idea. Mere Christianity is a treasure trove of amazing anecdotes that can be remembered and shared with those seeking answers about Christianity.The first section, \\"Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe,\\" begins by observing that a certain degree of morality is common among men. Nature has checks and balances that any culture can use to gauge proper behavior. The author calls this condition \\"Moral Law\\" and establishes that it must exist as an absolute standard. If no final standard exists, Lewis argues \\"there would be no sense in preferring civilized morality to savage morality, or Christian morality to Nazi morality\\" (p.25). Moral Law is shown to be the effect of a higher cause, which is tentatively called \\"God\\" at this point in the book.Section two, \\"What Christians Believe,\\" uses reason to eliminate competing views of God such as pantheism, dualism, atheism and other variants. The problem of evil is dealt with primarily by reason of universal morality or justice. Lewis asks for the basis of any claim calling God unjust if there is no absolute standard of just and unjust to begin with. Free will, mans' fallen condition, and the relationship between faith and works are used to show the necessity of the gospel. Only God, through Christ's sacrifice, could restore the relationship with man since, as Lewis says - \\"the worse you are the more you need it and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect person - and he would not need it\\" (p.60).The third section, \\"Christian Behavior,\\" explains that Christian duty and outward behavior is an expected consequence of the spiritual influence of Christ. The four \\"cardinal\\" virtues of prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude are observed as they occur both inside and outside of Christianity. The chapters on sexual morality and Christian marriage are very insightful and are as accurate as if they were written yesterday. Pride is called \\"The Great Sin\\" and is presented in a manner consistent with the Bible. Pride is the central problem in human history and is a spiritual vice from Hell, delivered to us by Satan who is also full of pride.The final section, \\"Beyond Personality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity,\\" is the most theological part of the book. Lewis stays close to the Bible throughout most of the discussion but does not use it as part of his case. Theology is shown to be both practical and important. The theological nature of Jesus is unique among all men since he was begotten and not just created. The book concludes by showing that what seems so simple and unlikely is, in fact, the most powerful force the earth will ever know. When the case built throughout the book is complete, we see that giving up our corrupted lives to partake in the perfect life of Christ is the most consistent and realistic response we could ever have to our human condition.Lewis writes from deep within his heart on all subjects. You may not agree with every statement made in the book, but you will laugh aloud frequently and understand \\"Mere Christianity\\" in a new way. Mere Christianity isn't \\"mere\\" at all."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you're looking for an in depth apologetic for the Christian faith, this is not it. If you are looking for a book which will finally convince you that there is a God, I doubt this book will do it either. Do not look for an iron-clad argument for Christ, for this was not the intent of the book, i.e. the title MERE Christianity. It is an introduction, and towards that goal, it surpasses all others.It achieves this through the clarity and power of the prose, the elegance of the analogy, and the refreshing angles on suppositional questions. For these reasons, this book is a must read for those exploring faith, and especially those looking for a framework on which to hang their Christian faith.As an agnostic undergratuate twenty years ago, this book served to rock my world view.

This evidence is in contradiction to the Bible.Mere Christianity's main premise is logically false. Natural Law. It can only be Designed law a Biblical perspective or Natural law an evolutionary concept. It can not be both and was not intended to be both. Mere Christianity was written from an evolutionary worldview..Take the blinders off. C.S. Lewis struggled with the same logical fallacies that today's Christians do. In his lifetime he never believed the Bible was the infallible divine word of God.Let his own words prove what is true.\\"If ... you mean simply that man is physically descended from animals, I have no objection\\" (The Problem of Pain, p.72)\\"I have therefore no difficulty accepting, say, the view of those scholars who tell us that the account of Creation in Genesis is derived from earlier Semitic stories which were Pagan and mythical.\\" (Reflections On The Psalms, p.110)."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The problem I've always had with Christianity (among other religions) is that it tells you what's wrong with you without asking for any feedback from you (unless your feedback agrees with Christian theology), then offers the \\"only possible way\\" to fix you. And should you feel that \\"the way\\" honestly doesn't make sense to you, you're told that's part of your problem. And further, that if you don't come around to \\"the truth,\\" the worst tortures await you.Does that tactic sound familiar? Think fascism, communism and every other flavor of totalitarianism. The tragedy of Christianity (and, again, of quite a few other religions) is that it turns the Source of Life and Love into just another dictator, and turns us into that dictator's eternally cringing underlings. That may be Christianity's idea of God, but it certainly isn't mine. And somehow I suspect it isn't God's idea of God either.I found \\"Mere Christianity\\" to be an excellent representation of Christianity. Other Amazon reviewers have already given examples of Mr. Lewis's convuluted logic in presenting his case. So I'll just add two more.Mr. Lewis says the one thing we must never do is see Jesus as merely a highly enlightened teacher. According to Mr. Lewis, we have only three choices, based on Jesus's life: that Jesus was either Lord, liar or lunatic.I honestly don't see why I can't have that fourth choice: to see Jesus as a highly enlightened teacher. But that's because I don't consider the Bible the inerrant word of God. I believe the gospels were written by very human beings who shaped a lot of it to put across their own agendas. Thus I don't see these recordings of Jesus's life as inerrant either--though I do see many, many examples of high-enlightenment in them.In Mr. Lewis's argument for Jesus being one of the \\"three L's,\\" he assumes that we've accepted--or must accept--the Bible as the inerrant word of God. But before you make a logical argument, you must be sure the people you're addressing are in agreement with the assumptions behind that argument--in this case, that the Bible IS the \\"inerrant word of God.\\"Mr. Lewis never bothers to do that legwork. What he does (as do, from my experience, most other Christians) is make assumptions FOR us, and then argue from there. Naturally, the arguments fall flat if we haven't accepted those assumptions in the first place. And because I haven't, the fourth choice opens wide and invitingly for me: that Jesus was a highly enlightened teacher.In the second example, Mr. Lewis extols the Christian doctrine of having sex only within marriage, and being completely chaste otherwise. To justify this, Mr. Lewis points out our sex-fixated culture and claims that this is the result of letting our animal drives take the lead in our lives. He asks us how we would view a culture that fixated on food (assuming the people of that culture weren't starving)--a culture which, for example, had the food equivalent of strip shows: audiences gaping lustily as a plate of food was shown on stage. Isn't our own culture's focus on sex just as pathetic?What Mr. Lewis overlooks is the fact that when we fixate on anything (again, assuming we're not starving for it), it's never about the thing itself but about OTHER issues going on inside us. People who continually overeat don't do it because they're biologically hungry. And people who continually focus on sex, even though they might already be having sex on a regular basis, are not doing it because they're biologically in need of sex. Again, there are other things going on which have nothing to do with sex.Thus, Mr. Lewis makes the following assumptions (as always, without consulting us beforehand on whether we agree with those assumptions): (1) Any focus on sex outside of the context of marriage is purely a matter of our sexual drive and has nothing to do with anything else going on inside us; and (2) the way we experience our sexual drive now is part of the consequences we suffered after our Fall.And with these assumptions, Mr. Lewis arrives at his \\"logical\\" conclusion: that the (as usual) \\"only way\\" to live happily and healthily with such a sex drive as ours is to observe the doctrine of absolute chastity outside of marriage.I suggest there are other ways. For example: to learn to be very conscious of what's really going on with you, and decline from using sex to act out your issues. Further, to resolve to always treat your intimate partner with honesty, consideration and affection, and never ever use him or her for merely your own gratification. For the result of using another person is invariably not only alienation from that person, but from ourselves.In any case, there's absolutely no truly logical argument that can be made for only having sex within the context of marriage, and being totally chaste outside of it. If you choose to accept that theology for your own life, fine. But don't ever try to make it seem logical, when it's really a matter of private faith.Several reviewers have stated that they began Mr. Lewis's book as a non-Christian and finished it as a Christian. I began Mr. Lewis's book as a non-Christian, and finished it absolutely affirmed in my faith, which is highly spiritual and sees God in the most unconditionally loving terms. I thank Mr. Lewis for that."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In this \\"Classic\\" defense of religion (Christianity in particular), Apologist-in-Chief C.S. Lewis offers a stunning smorgasbord of flawed premises, tortured logic, and non-stop non sequiturs. From a master wordsmith, jabberwockey."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have been surprised just how little CS Lewis bases his theology on the Bible. He has some interesting ideas, but often writes things that are confusing or just plain untrue. He writes as though evolution is a substantiated fact, but really it is just people's ideas and it contradicts the Bible. He bases a lot of his ideas about our behavior on what seems like a good idea, with no reference to the Bible. He doesn't give the impression that he was very familiar with the Bible. He appears to have been heavily influenced by human philosophies and tries to incorporate them into a religious framework."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The kindle edition is more expensive than the amazon.com-sold paperback! This a wonderful text, but I can't justify getting it in the kindle format if it's even cheaper in the more-worthwhile paperback format. Go buy the actual, physical text!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I am a former Christian who no longer believes in the concept of souls, god, hell, etc., and I readily revel in the wonders science uncovers everyday. Yet, I've had quite a few people recommend this book to me (to sway me, I suppose)--so I finally read it. (Although religious folks never read the stuff I suggest for them: do a websearch for Richard Dawkins'Good and Bad Reasons for Believing; it's a much shorter and easier read than C.S. Lewis' pedantic tome. Besides, C.S. Lewis was a Science Fiction writer, like Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard. I suggest you get your science from scientists not science fiction writers--but I digress.) This work of self aggrandizing philosophizing might possibly be a good book if your goal is to convince yourself (or others) that Christianity is the truth--but it's a really crappy book if you are actually interested in truth--the good kind...the kind with evidence that can be explained to anyone with just a wee bit of scientific knowledge--. Scientific truths are sort of like math--it's useful stuff to know--a great tool...but truth doesn't care if you believe it or not. You can believe that the value of pi is indeterminable and that the moon is made of cheese if you desire.Anyhow, let me sum of some of C.S. Lewis' nuggets of wisdom so you can assess whether this book is for you. C.S. Lewis has carfully studied the bible and Christian literature to discover what the worst sin of all is-- Just guess what the worst sin of all is, folks? It's not pedophilia, it's not starting wars by lying, it's not cruelty, it's not killing people because you've labled them evil, it's not child abuse--it's (drumroll please)--PRIDE. That's right--pride is the worse sin of all according to C.S. Lewis based upon his diligent study of Christian Doctrine. Now, to me, a person living many years after Lewis' death--I find this stuff inane. Granted, my I.Q. and education level is higher than most, but I once lapped up this stuff because, by golly, it never occurred to me that authority figures could be full of crap. At this wiser point in my life, I think that C.S Lewis was not only full of crap--but he exhibits pride to the point of arrogance in pretending to have reasoned his way to Christian truth. Do you notice, that like many cult leaders, he claims to understand mysteries of the universe without showing any evidence in support of his claims? Sort of like Hitler (another Christian, mind you), Osama, Marshall Applewhite,Charles Manson, Reverend Moon, and David Koresh (note: how telling that all gods, prophets, demons, devils, etc. are men--could this be a testosterone inspired delusion?).Let me share some other nuggets from C.S. Lewis--ah yes... here's a Christian favorite--\\"sinning in your thoughts is as bad as sinning in actuality.\\" Try selling that to a jury. I would prefer that someone imagine raping me than actually doing it...I suspect most would agree. Go ahead and imagine me in hell, just don't inflict it upon me (leave the smiting to your Almighty, please.) Actual rape causes pain, suffering, and possibly pregnancy and/or AIDS.If it's the same to god, he/she/it is insane. Here on planet earth, controlling ones actions takes precedence over controlling ones thoughts (which doesn't seem to be particularly effective-- especially when it comes to more primal thinking where evolution has ensured some particularly compelling thoughts. Check out Jimmy Swaggert...or homosexuals trying to think themselves \\"straight\\".)C.S. Lewis also tells us that soldiers should serve with gaiety in a war even though they are killing people. That's right, C.S. Lewis is a warmonger. Although Osama's followers served their god happily, I suspect most soldiers have to be pretty brainwashed to ignore the suffering they cause in the fight for some \\"ideal\\" or against some \\"poorly defined evil.\\" Killing people devastates the lives of loved ones no matter which god you pray to, and I can't imagine anyone finding gaiety in inflicting such suffering. (I bet non-atheist soldiers think god is on their side--no matter whose army they fight in. By the way, evidence confirms there are lots of atheist in foxholes. Also, there are lots of people praying for god to save them in many doomed situations (the Virginia miners). I suspect all doomed hijacked flights have plenty of passengers pleading for a safe landing--of course the hijackers are praying to their god for a successful mission and heavenly rewards. This god of C.S. Lewis' seems to pick and choose when it comes to prayer answering, no?Most of C.S. Lewis' advice seems aimed at men--sort of like the bible's rules about coveting wives and it's treatment of women as chattle. And not unlike the islamic view that tells guys that virgins await them in heaven--what woman wants that heaven? Religion is also a great way to control people without having to answer to anyone about the results (because they all occur in some nebulous afterlife). It doesn't seem to occur to most religious dudes that women are as intelligent (though often more trusting and gullible) than them. Who can blame them, of course, if their religion tells them that women are responsible for the fall of mankind and that god was created in man's image (testosterone proneness to wrath and revenge included)? Heck, the Mormon religion tells guys they get to be gods on their own planets--of course women are secondary and can only get to heaven via marriage and submission to their husbands. Bummer. And women seem to sin so much less then men; they hardly ever covet or kill, and they seldom rape or commit child molestation. And, most aren't particular prideful (the biggest sin of all, according to C.S. Lewis. The woman I know tend to be humble as a group and more placating and empathic then their Y-chromosomed counterparts. Heck, women never start wars, so why do men get all the goodies in the afterlife? Sounds like a scam to me! Women also seem to be the biggest consumers of religion, so if you get heaven bonus points for believing,women win there too.Maybe, Mere Christianity was wise for the time it was written. But the problem with all religious texts is that they expect you to squeeze truth out of ideals. All supernatural beliefs involve putting faith in something without being able to question it...test it...explore it...challenge it. It's all based on the same namby pamby evidence that we wouldn't even accept in a court of law--hearsay, testimony, feelings, inner knowingness, claims of miracles, revelations, guys who claim to be Gods, prophets, gurus, and bearers of secret knowledge. But if you try to test these claims--for example, say I ask a catholic to take the communion out of your mouth so we can analyze it for Human DNA...or ask a Mormon to test their holy undergarments in a double blind taser test, I am accused of arrogance. Could it be that the emperor is wearing no clothes and that's why he wants you to \\"pay no attention to the man behind the curtain?\\" Could it be that the zealots are trying to convince you in an effort to convince themselves? (If anyone has a supernatural claim such as the above or anything else that they can demonstrate scientifically, I encourage you google \\"JREF--million dollar prize.\\" Just state what supernatural thing you can do and prove it.All religions promise you goodies if you believe; they tell you you'll be punished eternally for being not believing the right untestable claim or a false prophet. They tell you that you are arrogant to ask questions...yet I think those who ask questions aren't arrogant; they're intelligent and often eager to share the information they've gained. Most scientists seem eager to share information with those who can comprehend it and test it. Most religious people hide behind \\"god's mysterious ways.\\" I think there are obvious reasons why belief in the supernatural (god, souls, hell, alien abductions, etc.) decreases as intelligence and education increase. But I also think that religious people have more kids passing on whatever genes influence religiosity (especially religous people who think god doesn't want them to use birth control.) I think relion makes people stupid and makes them focus on an afterlife at the expense of the only verifiable life they have. Scientists indulge them in these fantasies, mainly because religious people can be scary. I know I seldom speak out, but I'm not the kind to tell a kid there is no Santa either.But why do religious people imagine they'll feel something in an afterlife when they won't have a working brain to do so? Neurologists have well documented that consciousness occurs within the brain; no one has given evidence of consciousness outside of a body. Neurologists have pretty much shown that all consciousness, feelings, experiences, etc., are brain dependent. We can duplicate most every religious type experience with drugs and brain stimulation in various area. Brain damage can make people believe all sorts of really crazy things, like Capgras delusion, where one's mother and other close associates are seen as imposters (the sight and emotion part of the brain lose their connection). Or many of those experiencing dementia claim that the image in the mirror isn't them. Religion causes delusions too.Science, like knowledge and technology, evolves. Antiquated religious notions can't. I am just amazed that people who understand that the earth is spherical and orbiting despite our perceptions still invest so much in supernatural claims. And the problem with supernatural claims is that they tend to contradict each other and without evidence. The only way to determine one's superiority to the other is confirmation bias, it seems. If I want something to be true I am readily drawn to evidence which supports these desires. Humans are very great at fooling themselves--think of optical illusions.How can people who readily accept paternity tests, and fly in planes, and think test tube babies and cloned sheep are no big deal--people who use the internet--how can they still believe that \\"evil\\" and \\"good\\" exist outside the mind of human beings? Our technology and science would make us indistiguishable from gods to generations past (my dog thinks I'm god as far as I can tell) but still we make up our own gods, even as his/her role seems to diminish further with each new scientific discovery.Science is built from the bottom up--on that which works--it's honed, refined, and added to --no designer needed. Today's internet had no overlord planner--it evolved from the technology that came before. C.S. Lewis offers something that is untestable, and that you can only build more untestable, nebulous, knowledge on top of. It's a waste of time, I think, unless you're hoping to bolster your own tentative beliefs.Why do Christians always want people to read this book, but they never seem to read the imminently more readable scientists of our times like Dawkins, Shermer, Blackmore, and, for beginners, Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World? Truth is gathered from the evidence--you can't assume what it is and then try to make the evidence fit those facts. Atheists seem to be more widely read in both the religious arena and the science arena from what I can tell--I certainly am; whereas religious folks stick to the stuff that encourages their particular belief--just like the Amish stay away from the modern world and things that might tempt them away from their heavenly path. It seems a waste of brainpower which could advance knowledge. Moreover, it causes the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking to whither.If you are going to explore beliefs without evidence, you might also try try homeopathy, out-of-body transcendence, levitation, astrology, and satanism; check out the Koran; the bhagvad gita; fairies are fun too. Try out Zeus as your god for a week. Try fearing Hades and praying to Allah. See if you get better results than you get from your current beliefs. They are all equally likely from a scientific perspective. Yes, a lot of this stuff is old and discredited--but many people claim these beliefs to be true. How about alien made crop circles? If you base your beliefs on feelings, depth of belief indicated by believers, or fear of hell (by the way...everyone is going to hell in someone else's religion), what makes you and C.S. Lewis believe you've stumbled upon the undefinable, untestable, but actual \\"truth?\\" Pride? Arrogance? Stupidity? Youth? Brainwashing? Death of logic neurons in the brain? Were you suckered in by the promise of heaven and afraid to question due to a fear of hell?Consider this: no wise writer of religious texts thought to offer up some cool things that science later discovered on its own--no supreme being thought to include information about DNA, microbes, atoms, and solar systems in any of their religious texts. Kind of incompetent for an almighty. Sure you can bend vague prophesies and use formulas to find secret codes in the bible. Sure you can play your records backwards and hear demons supposedly. But that's not stuff smart people give credence to. We don't burn people because they are witches anymore and we don't perform exorcisms on people with Tourette Syndrome.And here's a final piece of wisdom from C.S. Lewis: Humans are unlovable -- \\"creatures like us who actually find hatred such a pleasure that to give it up is like giving up beer or tobacco ...\\" I don't know about you, but I find pleasure in none of these."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Some friends who found out that I was an atheist suggested this book. Being so highly praised in the Christian community, I decided to give it a try. It was soon apparent that the author had no deep understanding of religion, science, or logic.

Mr. Gresham lived with Jack from the age of 9 until Jack's death 10 years later. They were very close and Jack shared a great deal with him.After reading this book I had to find some of his writings and get to know this man better. I would reccommend that every Christian, and non-Christian alike, to read this man's writings. I am presently reading \\"The Problem with pain\\", along with \\"bits & pieces\\" of all the others I ordered. I feel so blessed to have been able to purchase two hardbacks, which are collections of his Classics. I discovered in the back of one of them a year of devotions. That was a nice surprise!I thought my faith was strong before, but since I've started reading C.S. Lewis' books, my faith have taken on a whole new meaning..I am sorry if I made this longer than you wanted and I fail to read the guidelines.M. Louise Fickett, OKC"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"These books do not outline Lewis's thought, nor do they contain all his best books (case in point, the thoughtful Abolition of Man is not included). What this set does is give a good taste of Lewis's notions of Christianity.In fact, this collection is perhaps more suited for non-theology-savvy individuals seeking to garner better understanding of Christianity. For example, Miracles still contains relevant arguments regarding doctrines like the virgin birth and the resurrection. The Great Divorce gives a brilliant and creative defense for how an all-loving God could ordain hell.C. S. Lewis's clear and witty style makes him a fast and entertaining read for virtually any reader."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Along with some of his other works, and despite a few flaws, C.S. Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" remains one of the more effective apologetics and evangelism tools available to use with those of a Western mindset grounded in science and logic.Besides one of his more famous quotes about what everyone must make of Jesus Christ--Son of God, fool, demon, or a great human teacher, there is another quote in the chapter on \\"What Christians Believe\\" that stands out as well. It has been well noted that the extreme doctrines held by some evangelicals actually encourage atheism--Lewis sets both the skeptics and extremists straight.\\"God created things which had free well. That means creatures which can go either wrong or right. Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong; I cannot. If a thing is free to be good it is also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, through it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata--of creatures that worked like machines--would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they must be free.\\"\\"Of course God knew what would happen if they used their freedom the wrong way: apparently He thought it worth the risk. Perhaps we feel inclined to disagree with Him. But there is a difficulty about disagreeing with God...If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for fee will--that is, for making a live world in which creatures can do real good or harm and something of real importance can happen, instead of a toy world which only moves when He pulls the strings--then we may take it it is worth paying.\\"Some areas where I disagree with Lewis are:1) That there may be life in other \\"worlds\\"2) His position as a theistic evolutionist3) \\"There are people in other religions who are being led by God's secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to Christ without knowing it.\\"Besides these criticisms, Lewis' writings have been used quite successfully as a bridge to help bring many to a skeptic to a saving knowledge of Christ. Lewis remains a timeless and unique legacy to our Christian heritage. Go beyond Narnia and try Lewis'The Screwtape Lettersas well!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"While it seems that many of C.S. Lewis' works have been compiled into collections since their initial publications, this particular collection might be one of the best available at the moment. That is, this collection might offer a comparatively larger bang for one's buck. Each of the titles contained within this single volume are more than worth their weight in gold, making the collection as a whole priceless. One should realize, however, that if the collective work is approached as one large, continuous reading, it might be seen as a tremendous undertaking. As large as the actual book might be, one should not be intimidated by its size, and feel comfortable tackling each of the separate texts as if it were independent from the larger collection if not only to avoid rushing in an attempt to reach its end.To avoid an unnecessarily long review, one might be best served, if at all interested, to examine the reviews available for each of the individual titles contained within this compilation. Beyond this it should be mentioned that while these are appropriately dubbed Lewis' signature classics, much of his work is omitted from this collection. A few additional suggestions if one is interested in this author are The Four Loves, Surprised by Joy, Letters to Malcolm, and God in the Dock among many, many others. Again, this collection is a legitimate bargain considering the wealth of knowledge it contains and the comparative price of purchasing each separately...or never inquiring at all."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a \`very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to \`experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.The book looks at beliefs, both from a \`natural' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, \`When I was an atheist...' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the \`leave it to God' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God's own personality. Lewis' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God's is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the \`new man' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.\`Mere Christianity' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - \`The Case for Christianity', \`Christian Behaviour', and \`Beyond Personality'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis has good habits as a writer. He tells you his assumptions, his biases and the steps in his logic. It is up to you whether you find his arguments convincing. In this book, he tries to show logically not only that a god exists, but that it is the Christian God in particular which exists. As we would expect, some arguments are better than others.Of course, people who already believe in the Christian God are much more likely to be convinced, but his arguments on the existence of God--particularly in sections concerning morality--are often quite strong. As the divinity of Christ is a much harder fact for some people to swallow, his proofs there also tend to be less convincing. Overall though--and I am a beliver--I found this about as good a &quot;proof&quot; of Christianity as there is.The book has aged well, and apart from what looks now like a quaint view of women and marriage, one could hardly imagine it was written in the first half of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis once wrote that the greatest thinkers are not only those who can explore complex abstractions or philosophical ideas, but also those who can write them in such a way as to be thoroughly understood by laymen; and Lewis himself is a master in this regard. Here in this attractive set, we have many of the most popular works of this atheist-turned Christian scholar. Though he was a scholar of medieval English at Oxford and Cambridge, Lewis is easy to understand, witty, and engaging. Reading his work is a real pleasure. Not only does it entertain you (it really does) but it forces you to think through 'deep' issues as well. Highly recommended for the atheist, the Christian and anyone in between!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book at first as a believer in the ethics and morals that Christianity teaches. However, AFTER reading the book what I got out of it was a sense of what the idea and logic is behind the Christian way of life. Lewis tends to be able to take the most controversial of topics and somehow make them logical and understanding. I recommend anyone that is even thinking about reading this book go for it. That means the most non-believing athiest, to the extreme radical christian. Reason being is not because Lewis tries to shove anything down your throat he just wants to look at things logicly and try to understand how and why human nature is the way it is. And what role Christianity plays into it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Known as one of the greatest Christian writers of the 20th century, of all time for that matter, Lewis' title would perhaps be better titled Why Christianity?

Thom Reed M.Th."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If atheists are looking for a book that will instantly turn them into believers then this is not it. Actually, there is no such book or tool or test. CS Lewis' Mere Christianity is rather the response to those who claim that religion is antithetical to articulated reason. For all those angry atheists who parrot the same arguments \\"What kind of God would kill his own Son?\\", \\"As long as Im a good person what difference does it makes whether I believe in God?\\" and the other usual mantras, this book quietly discusses them. A true, rational atheist may not agree with the book but must acquiesce that it is a disciplined, reasoned book that opens up the basic innards of the meaning of Christianity and dispels the notion that Christianity is just another superficial brain-washing belief system.Now, to a Christian reader this book is absolutely great because it puts into words what a Christ-seeking Christian has felt and known in his heart, mind and soul for so very long. Many times during my reading of the book, I had moments where I fully identified with what CS Lewis was characterizing with metaphors that are simple, elegant and dead-on accurate.Altogether, this book is a small, quiet earthquake."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The books grouped together in this boxed set are - taken together - unquestionably the greatest achievement in modern Christian apologetics. (If I hesitate to place them alongside something like St. Augustine's &quot;The City of God&quot;, it is only because their cultural contexts are so different that it would be comparing apples and oranges; not because I necessarily think Lewis's achievement is any smaller.) Years of exposure to their ultra-lucid and gracious discourse (such a tonic for the harangues of the televangelists!) - voluntarily sought out for the sheer pleasure of his elegant prose - gradually brought me from pugnacious atheism to (much to my surprise) a church pew. So if you're coming to Lewis with anything less than a hermetically sealed mind, be warned by my example. As he wryly puts it, an atheist can't be too careful what he reads.That said, from a consumer's point of view, I would only feel confident recommending this set to the converted Lewis-ite who wants a uniform edition of the central works. (Though the surprising absence of his spiritual autobiography &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; will need to be remedied somehow.) The artsy photographs on the covers are decent and the type is pleasantly sized (although a bit more watery than prose this solid deserves). The gift-giver who wants to introduce someone to the pleasures of Lewis would do better with the beguiling (and invitingly slim) single volume &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;. (Others would propose the popular and entertaining &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;. They might be right. But I stand firm.) Then - the following Christmas perhaps - &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, which explains what is being offered. And then &quot;Miracles&quot;, which satisfied me at least that it wasn't too good to be true. And only then &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot;, which wrestles manfully with the difficult, perhaps unanswerable stuff."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is perhaps the greatest Christian thinker of the 20th century. This book is one of his masterpieces. Basically this book is a reasoned explanation of the Christian religion. He covers the Trinity, the book of Genesis, etc. However, this is not light reading. Some books by Lewis (such as the &quot;Great Divorce&quot; and &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;) are very light and profound reading. Mere Christianity is not light. It's one of those books that you have to read one page three times before you move on. Lewis is not afraid to get deep and detailed in this book. There's a lot of philosophy in here which I like, its not just an &quot;I believe and that's that&quot; type of book. Really heavy, but rewarding reading."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In addition to his classic CHRONICLES OF NARNIA for children, C.S. Lewis wrote a number of highly respected theological works (both fiction and nonfiction) for adults. Seven of those works --- MERE CHRISTIANITY, THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, THE GREAT DIVORCE, THE PROBLEM OF PAIN, MIRACLES, A GRIEF OBSERVED and THE ABOLITION OF MAN --- have been collected in THE COMPLETE C.S. LEWIS SIGNATURE CLASSICS (though it is unclear what makes a given book a &quot;signature&quot; classic and hence worthy of inclusion in this collection).Lewis' work is as readable and thought provoking as ever, but this particular collection is better suited for a Lewis fan already familiar with these books than for someone new to his work. This is true for a couple of reasons. First, the book is coffee table-sized and rather unwieldy for reading purposes. Second, there is no new material in the book --- no scholarly essays or notes beyond those that appeared in previous additions --- which makes for a book more appropriate for display than for reading or studying. That being said, THE COMPLETE C.S. LEWIS SIGNATURE CLASSICS is a handsome book sure to be appreciated by any Lewis reader who would like to give Lewis' work a prominent place in his or her library.--- Reviewed by Rob Cline"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is an excellent collection of works by C. S. Lewis. It served as my introduction to Lewis's writings. I had never read anything by him before and was only familiar with his name and the title of one or two of his books. I was awed for the most part by his insight into Christianity and his intellect. As with any other author, there were some points on which I could not wholly agree, but in a far greater number of times, I found myself growing in my faith and deepening my understanding. This set consists of six books in all. The Problem of Pain is an examination of the purpose of pain in the world. The Screwtape Letters is a fictional collection of letters from a demon named Screwtape who counsels his nephew on how to draw a man away from God. The Great Divorce is a fantastic story of a spiritual being after death somewhere between heaven and hell. Miracles is an examination of what miracles really are and how they play a role in this world. Mere Christianity is, as its title suggests, an attempt to point out and explain the most basic tenets of the Christian faith. A Grief Observed is the journal the Lewis kept after the death of his wife. (I have written a more detailed review for each book under its individual listing.) I would highly recommend this collection to anyone. It is filled with spiritual insight and understanding."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is an excellent collection of seven of the major theological writings of the Christian apologist C.S. Lewis. I have used this book several times for a class I teach on C.S. Lewis. Rather than having students purchase multiple books, I help them save money by requiring this text.The dimensions of this book are indeed larger than standard book sizes. It is about the size of dictionary, an encyclopedia, or as other reviewers have mentioned, a coffee table book. It can indeed be cumbersome to tote it around and it may sometimes feel like you're reading an encyclopedia.However, that withstanding, I still think this book is worthy of purchase. First and foremost, the collection itself is, as I mentioned before, excellent. It contains all the major theological writings of C.S. Lewis--including both fiction and non-fiction.\\"A Grief Observed\\" is not as academic as the other non-fiction books included in this collection, and so it might seem a bit out-of-place. However, this piece of writing, which C.S. Lewis composed after the death of his wife, reveals Lewis' deep theological struggle with God and the problem of pain. It's a marked contrast from the book \\"The Problem of Pain\\" (also in this collection)in which he rationally defends the idea of an all-loving, all-knowing God despite the existence of pain and evil. In \\"A Grief Observed\\", we see where the rubber meets the road for Lewis. It's one thing to rationally defend a theological proposition; its altogether a different story when you have to work out that proposition in the context of an incredibly difficult and painful world.I highly recommend this book to both avid fans of Lewis looking for a collector's-quality edition of Lewis' theological writings and beginners wanting a good intro to his major works."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you're looking for a very interesting, enthralling book, this is the one. What I found so enjoyable about Lewis's style is how he develops such strong arguments promoting the fact that God exists by getting you to concede one small point at a time.This is the best Christian book I've read--almost more philosophical than theological. His short, essay-type chapters make this an entertainingly easy read. His arguments are strongly built and well founded.I'm a believer who sometimes runs across Atheists. I always try to explain why there must be a God; Mere Christianity makes it apparent that there is a God, purely from a logical perspective. Lewis proves it using the truth that lies in the guts every person.Bravo! C.S."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"With the release of the C. S. LEWIS SIGNATURE SERIES, which supersedes a previous box set of Lewis books, replaces a book from the original set. Originally published with THE ABOLITION OF MAN, as opposed to the (now included) A GRIEF OBSERVED, this rearrangement of this particular set is a particularly revealing little facet of what has now become a very profitable industry built on Lewis's name. With the public attention brought on by Lewis's marriage, there has been a marked increase and peaking of interested in Lewis's relationship to Joy Davidman. The original set presented a very clear and rational set of apologetics. It has now caved in to discinclude THE ABOLITION and replaces it with GRIEF. Please do not think I am criticizing either work, for both are very important books. THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY, the first book in MERE CHRISTIANITY, argues for a natural law, and ABOLITION expands and propounds on Lewis's ideas of the Tao, or moral law. These two works are best understood when read together, and it is unfortunate they dropped ABOLITION from it. While A GRIEF OBSERVED stands as Lewis's most personal and heart wrenching works (it is extremely beautiful), it seems out of place with the other books in this box set. Although this stands as an introduction to the causal reader, I think this particular audience would be better serviced if there was another set of works, such as THE FOUR LOVES, TILL WE HAVE FACES, REFLECTIONS ON THE PSALMS, LETTERS TO MALCOLM, SURPRISED BY JOY, and A GRIEF OBSERVED in one nice set. These better represent the period of Lewis's life that Joy had the most impact on, though LETTERS was published in 1963. It still saddens me that ABOLITION was eliminated. They could have made the set with seven books instead of six. However, the publishers did not. Instead of presenting Lewis's remarkable skills as an apologist, which was the original function of the original box set by presenting four nonfiction works and two works of fiction , we have a work from an entirely different period of Lewis's life. The new addition is best read outside of this set.That complaint aside, these books are central to understanding Lewis as a Christian writer, and especially as an apologist. Most people may know him from NARNIA or one of these volumes, and it is a good place for introduction into the mind and works of C. S. Lewis. All the books here are classics, from SCREWTAPE, MERE CHRISTIANITY, and MIRACLES, as well as three other works, all of which range from profound (the majority) to beautiful (THE GREAT DIVORCE), to the gut-wrenching (A GRIEF OBSERVED). Those interested in the works of this profound man would be amiss to be without this set."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is, if not the most successful apologetic book for Christianity, certainly one of the most discussed. Christians proudly point to it as an irrefutable argument for their faith. Atheists proudly point to their facile rebuttals as an example of how the 'best' logic that Christianity can muster is really no logic at all. Personally it has been a very important book for my faith life, but I see no reason why anyone should be brow-beaten into believing after reading this. Actually, that's not what C.S. Lewis had in mind when he wrote it.Several reviewers are quite right when they say that the internal logic may be consistent, but that's no indication that what Lewis says is true. All he meant to do was try to get the reader into the believer's mindset, to give an insider's view of why believers might find the tenets and premises of their faith convincing. Furthermore, Lewis wanted to keep things very simple, so that even the man on the street could understand complex matters of theology and practice. He did not want to write a philosophical tome, but an intimate conversation on the content and meaning of the Christian faith.This is a book which begs to be put in its historical context, that of World War II Britain. The message is aimed towards people who did not know if they would live another day, whether they were pilots in the Air Force or citizens terrorized by the London blitz. This DOESN'T mean he just wanted to give them something nice to believe in. He sincerely believed that he was giving them the truth. Who says the truth can't be comforting and inspiring? It is a perverse logic that says that truth must be something 'harsh' and 'impersonal'. What I usually see is that this is assumed without demonstration from the outset, and from then on religious beliefs are debunked as 'wishful thinking'.On Lewis' argument from good and evil: he DID anticipate the 'sociobiology' objection, but he called it the 'herd instinct' explanation and did not think it touched the real issue behind his argument (see pp.9-11). Of course the ingenuity of skepticism is unbounded, so again there is no reason why even the most tightly reasoned arguments should touch the hard-core skeptic. Her eyes and ears are closed. That is not to say that Lewis' argumentation is perfect. He IS dated in places, he DOES oversimplify at times (but keep in mind his audience) and some of his opinions on Christian behavior may more reflect the preset attitudes of an Oxford don than the spirit of the faith. Overall, though, his case for Christianity is lucid, warm and compelling.Even his most passionate despisers cannot deny, furthermore, that Lewis had a great talent for words, especially given that these chapters were originally radio broadcasts. His prose is a pleasure to read, warm, personal and measured, while sparkling with wit and just a hint of irony. You can almost see him smoking his pipe, rocking in his chair, exclaiming \\"who would have thought!\\" when he presents his case. This is a man whose faith went through enormous testing, and in fact Lewis never reached the certainty and ease of mind that he was looking for. He suffered doubts all his life, especially when his wife died. But he was always hopeful, in the best Christian sense of the word. He was confident that his trust in God would pay off. Now he knows, one way or another.In the meantime, those of us who have not yet crossed over that river can learn much from Lewis' wisdom. His insight into human nature was remarkably prescient and still speaks to our time. Even if you don't buy his 'God-talk', you cannot help but squirm under his cold, clear, microscopic gaze as he exposes the foibles, weaknesses and shortcomings that prevent us from being the kind of people we want to be. In the end, the legacy of C.S. Lewis is not that he gave Christians the perfect weapon to cajole everyone into the fold. It is his insights into our souls that really stand the test of time. If Christianity is anything it is a religion of relentless self-criticism, which if applied honestly will drive the honest seeker to the realization of sin, at which point God may work a miracle and give him or her New Life."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Recently, I've run into several people who say they find reading C.S. Lewis difficult. What??? C.S. Lewis had the cleanest, most lucid prose style ever known to English (His poetry however is another case).I guess I am left asking--like the Professor in Lewis's The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe--&quot;What are they teaching in schools these days?&quot;Now that that is out of my system:Mere Christianity is a fine book. It played a huge part in my own acceptance of Christ as my Savior. Lewis's arguments for the presence of a universal standard of behavior, of the presence of conscience/the Holy Spirit met me right where my atheistic/agnostic self had been living. &quot;If we do not believe in decent behavior, why should we be so anxious to make excuses for not having behaved decently?&quot;Lewis follows his opening argument by presenting what he sees as the basic Christian beliefs and the general characteristics of Christian living. In the chapter titled The Invasion Lewis states the position of the Christian in the world quite succinctly and eloquently:&quot;Enemy-occupied territory--that is what the world is. Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say landed in disguise, and is calling us all to take part in a great campaign of sabotage.&quot;Lewis's arguments are chock full of such vivid passages. His real strength is in the boiling down of his arguments. Lewis gets to the absolute core of True Christian beliefs and traditional Christian living.At the end of the last century the magazine Christianity Today called Mere Christianity the Christian book of the century. I personally think that this is a bit of an overestimation (the Bible speaks to all generations and is the book of every century), but Mere Christianity is indeed a worthy book.I give Mere Christianity my full recommendation."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is perfect for the life-long Lewis fan, or the new Christian. It seems more like a gift book that you place on the shelf in a public place, and do your \\"hammer and tongs\\" stuff with the paperbacks.The only problem I have with this book is the order of the contents. |The book does not have a rhyme or reason to the selection. There is a precise internal logic to So get the book, and then read it in this order:1. Start with THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS. This gives you a broad overview to Lewis's intellectual leitmotifs, his voice, and his typically wicked British sense of humor.2. The next book is ABOLITION OF MAN, which is a preface to Mere Christianity, and makes Lewis's case for moral absolutes. It is a mere three chapters long, but, like a good German chocolate cake, it is dense and filling3. MERE CHRISTIANITY is probably Lewis's second most famous book, and continues his discussion of moral absolutes, and the \\"mere\\" or \\"essential\\" elements of Christianity.4. PROBLEM OF PAIN is a smaller theological work and is the standard Christian work on dealing with this trick and sensitive issue.5. MIRACLES is a thicker and more esoteric books dealing with another \\"tricky\\" issue of Christianity. If you find this book too thick, then skip over it and come back to it later.6. After reading THE GREAT DIVORCE for the first time, I was surprised that more dictatorships have not banned this book. It is so true it hurts. It is about the divorce from God and life in Purgatory, and has nothing to do with marriage counseling.7. A GRIEF OBSERVED seems a bit out of place in this collection. I think it was included as a tie-in to the film \\"Shadowlands.\\" The book makes more sense when you actually are grieving than as a detached philosophical work.If you loved what you have read so for, then I suggested the following books for you next reading binge:* WEIGHT OF GLORY, which is a selection of scholastic papers, including his essay \\"Learning in Wartime.\\"* GOD IN THE DOCK, which is British for God in the Docket, God Takes the Stand, or God on Trial. It is also a selection of many of his cultural essays, so it has a \\"fruit salad\\" or smorgasbord taste to it.* CHRISTIAN REELECTIONS is the last of his collected papers dealing with various issues.His autobiography SURPRISED BY JOY was helpful, and should be read before PILGRIMS REGRESS. And after reading all of this, you can finally move on to the NARNIA books and the SPACE TRILOGY."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have no doubt that C.S. Lewis was a fine man and he certainly set out to achieve a noble goal here. Making the spiritual more understandable through the application of logic has an undeniable appeal. Unfortunately, his assumptions about some of the basic concepts of human nature look positively naive by modern standards. He comes off sounding like, as one of my psych professors was fond of saying, a \\"park-bench philosopher\\". Behavioral science just had not developed to the point it has today, so he had no way of knowing that his basic assumptions about some things he viewed as givens were, in fact, not given at all. In the end, trying to make the subject of religion something that one can put to the test of \\"logic\\" is an exercise in futility. That's why it's called faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book does little to persuade anyone, much less a firm atheist, to become a Christian. I have read good Christian apologetic books (The Case for Christ, for example) and in comparison this book fails miserably. Lewis uses silly arguments (Moral Law? Please) to try and convince his audience, but it merely solidifies the atheist's viewpoint that ninety percent of Christian arguments are far-fetched and preposterous. Most of the book is about how a Christian should live, but what good is talking about a Christian life if he can't convince the reader that Christianity is true?"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"not because it contains any profound insight but because somebody's going to eventually quote it and you might as well have read it. Just grit your teeth and bear with it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I wish people, eager to pronounce their faith in a god, would follow through with the necessary implications if it were true.Christopher Hitchens tellingly criticizes Lewis for being unable to complete a syllogism, and he is right on the mark. \\"Obvious\\" that the possibly fictional character of Jesus is not a madman, hence, the claims of the New Testament must be true? (Not much help in deciding between the competing claims.) If you accept that as logical, you can love this book without bothering to read it.Reading this book will waste precious hours of your life that you will never get back. If you had to choose between sitting through one of the atrocious movies based on his inane books, or reading this tripe, it would quite literally be a toss up.You will be more intellectually stimulated by thinking about this gem, from the late great Kurt Vonnegut:\\"I was the victim of a series of accidents, as are we all.\\""},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"After 40 pages, I stopped the misery of reading the works of an idiot. C.S. Lewis has never read the Bible. Jesus said in John 14:12 \\"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.\\"The words of Jesus are falsifiable. He said if you believed in him, you could do greater works than he did. Well, Jesus allegedly walked on water; multiplied loaves and fishes; cured leprosy and blindness,and raised people from the dead. Now, can you believers do those things and do even greater things as Jesus said in John? No you can't. Therefore, the Bible and the words of Jesus can be tested, and Jesus was either a lunatic or a liar. Prove it to yourself. Remember, without the Bible, there is no Christianity. The Bible is fraught with errors, contradictions, impossibilities, misquotes and lies.Jesus lied when he said he would return while some of his audience were still alive. Another lie!Additionally, C.S. Lewis writes 700-800 word paragraphs. The guy is no Shakespeare, but he couldn't pass high School English.Fortunately, I didn't buy the book. It was given to me by a friend who is grasping for something that lies only in the imagination of religious hucksters, pimps and sky-jockeys. Don't buy this book, give your money to help the disabled, poor and sick."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a great work out book if you are in to logic. Take this for example:\\"...Athiesm turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning...\\"It made me think for a while. At first, it made sense. As did the typical comparison Lewis made immediately afterward about if there was no light, \\"dark\\" would be meaningless.But then, I actually thought about it, and realized: if there was a or many gods, then the thought of a world without god/s would be meaningless, yet, it has meaning.In the same light, a world devoid of meaning could still contain the illusion of meaning, just as a world without divinity could still contain the illusion of one.So when one finds out that meaningfullnes is just an illusion, meaningless still retains a defintion since the experience of meaningfullness, even though it was never real, has been... experienced.To reiterate Lewis' argument, if the world was truely meaningless, then no one would realize the fact since meaning has never reached us. And that is true until you have taken the imaginative faculties of humanity. Meaning is purely perceptual, opinionated, biased. Sky diving can be extremely meaningful, but not to someone who hates it or does not care for the experience of falling. So taking the human mind out of the universe, it is entirely devoid of meaning.There are many other examples in the book I'm sure, I just flipped to a random page here and found an interesting sophism logic at work and thought I'd share it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded, good person. This book has nothing new in it. It is worthless. It is just another example of a poor deluded SOB trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering.This book is prosylazation. Prosylatizers, I have found, try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith, and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith. The truly faithful person does not prosylatize, for if one is secure in one's faith, why preach?

Guess what? It worked! I now more fully support Christian principles and have a clearer understanding of the power and vast applicability of this great religion. Only I didn't learn this from Lewis. His personal definitions of Christianity and interpretations of how Christianity should be lived may have adverse effects on society. Following are some of the highlights in his book that serve to reduce Christianity into something static and simplistic:1) Lewis states that God is seperate from the world. In fact, God is PART of the world he created, among each of us and in each of us.2) Lewis states that where Christianity differs from other religions, Christianity is right and they are wrong. This is unprecedented. And this is arrogance. There are many roads leading to the same end and each is valuable to its own traveller.3) Lewis states that the male in a marriage is the superior and has final say in making decisions. Perhaps this old fashioned thinking is due to the era in which the book was written, but unfortunately many Christians today still live by this.And there are many more examples like this. None of these are defining characteristics of Christianity. They rather serve to distort and undermine Christianity's true profoundness. Looking at many of the other reviews, it may be that the favorable reactions are mere affirmations of existing beliefs. In the interest of converting non-Christians (and from a philosophical standpoint), the logic in this book is poor and incomplete. In the attempt to define Christianity, I cannot judge Lewis' personal interpretation. Mine is just much different, and I can only hope that other Christians see the same."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Despite the fact that CS Lewis is presumably writing abt Christianity, readers should realize that he is also author of The Chronicles of Narnia and other demonic fantasies. And they should consider the following:Lewis was an unwilling convert. Lewis believed in the power and use of spells.Lewis says sincere unbelievers may go to Heaven. We're saved by works according to Lewis. Theistic evolution is taking place. Lewis believed man is an animal. He said descriptions of heaven found in the Bible are all symbolism. He said worthiness of heaven is based on \\"the beginnings\\" of inner \\"qualities,\\" not salvation. Lewis did not consider himself a \\"new man.\\" He believed there is a purgatory after death in which we will be purified. Lewis was a humanist, seeing man as being potentially good. He considered: \\"Badness is only spoiled goodness\\". CS Lewis: To be born again is still in the future; it is a continuing process not yet completed. He was a product of theistic evolution. Mysticism is a means by which one can leave \\"this world\\" before death. Lewis prayed for the dead. Says there is a purgatory which we must suffer after death. Said the work of redemption is continued by purgatory. There is no cumulative effect of trusting God. The earth was created by theistic evolution. There is no literal hell.It is a state of mind. If man is totally depraved, then Christianity is a form of devil worship. Our goodness is not that different from God's. The Bible contains myths. Humans attributed creation to God. Pure love from God is a future thing, not a present fact. Implication that Christ was a created being. Sixteen more such statements could be added."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Only C.S. Lewis could have written a book so thought provoking and yet so easy to understand. This book really brings home all of the basics of the Christian faith that we have all been taught since Sunday school. If anyone wants a better understanding of why they believe what they believe then this is the book for you. After reading this I not only agree with those who say Lewis was the foremost Christian apologist of the 20th century, but I also believe he was the greatest author."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a must read for all christians and those struggling with their christianity. Another book C.s. lewis wrote which Amazon has is also great \\" the Screwtape Letters\\"/"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It's hard to believe that I've had this book sitting on my bookshelf for nearly six years. Had I known what I was missing, I would have picked it up sooner. But as we Christians know, it all in Gods' perfect timing. I may very well have not been ready for it six years ago.This may be a small book in terms pages but it is packed full of wisdom. I often had to reread a sentence and even paragraphs before I was able to grasp what the author was trying to convey but it was well worth it.MERE CHRISTIANIT is for all believers no matter where you are at in your walk with Christ, as well as for seekers. All who read this amazing book will walk away a better person for it. At least I would hope they would. A great tool for all Christians.As a lover of music, I loved what C.S. Lewis said in the chapter ten, titled HOPE:\\"All scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, etc.) is, of course, a merely symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible. Musical instruments are mentioned because for many people (not all) music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly suggest ecstasy and infinity.\\"Music is a huge part of my soul, who I am.

Lewis is brilliant - and though he doesn't exactly promote this book as a work of apologetics, I think that is one of its greatest strengths."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Despite its critics, who usually don't successfully supply reasons or specific citations as support for their accusations, \\"Mere Christianity\\" continues to reveal just how deep faith in Christ is and how well it holds up against nearly all examinations and critiques (after all, it is faith, not scientific process or theory...theory also requiring belief...I digress).Lewis is clear, concise (for the most part) and takes the reader on a ride that tickles the mind while strengthening the soul.In essence, this book opens up a discussion about the legitimacy that faith, specifically in Christ, has in the grand scope of human interaction, culture and ideas.With the more recently and the less, to be honest, inspiring, \\"Simply Christian,\\" by N.T. Wright, Lewis will always be relevant to the thinking follower of Christ who will not become complacent in thought or life."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Perhaps an even better title for this CS Lewis masterpiece might be \\"Why Christianity?\\" In this slim volume, Lewis uses a chatty, accessible style to answer questions and explain his faith. The result is one of the best Christian apologetics ever. Less dense and dated that \\"The Pilgrim's Regress\\" and more broad than \\"The Great Divorce,\\" this may be Lewis' finest work--which is truly saying something.Not to give away too much of the content, but a favorite section is when Lewis discusses psychology and philosophy. As a Christian, Lewis gives one of the finest explanations for why we should not judge others; that we can only see their actions, not their inactions, and that we do not know others' genetics and life history. Only God does, so only he should judge. God may value someone who has had a cruel life merely refraining from an act of cruelty more highly that He values someone with an easy life performing a positive kindness!Lewis goes on to point out that those given great gifts are called on to use them more in service to mankind. Rather like the old Kennedy adage that to whom much is given, much is asked.Lewis is much more accessible that contemporary English Christian authors Charles Williams or Dorothy Sayer. Perhaps the only other modest-sized 20th century apologetic as sublime is Bishop Kallistos Ware's \\"The Orthodox Way.\\" Both share the simple brilliance of addressing the common beliefs of all Christians from ancient times, rather than trying to be sectarian or trendy.Whether you are a new Christian seeking answers, someone not yet accepting Christ but curious, or even an experienced Christian, this book will be a comfort and a source of much information.It might not be an exaggeration to say that if you only read one book for the rest of your life, excluding scripture, this should be it!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In the foreword it is explained that this book is not one of philosophical musings but a work of oral literature addressed to a people at war. It was originally broadcast by the BBC from 1942 to 1944, hence the gripping metaphors like the image of the earth as enemy-occupied territory. Mere Christianity is a book of plain but moving language.In Book One: Right and Wrong As a Clue To The Meaning Of The Universe, Lewis looks at the law of human nature (inherent knowledge of right and wrong), certain objections, the reality of the law and that which lies behind the law. Here he discusses the materialist, the life-force and the religious views of life.Book Two is a discussion on what Christians believe, in terms of the aforementioned occupied territory, a coming invasion, the penitent, and the practical conclusion. This section also deals with pantheism, dualism, free will, the divinity of Christ and God's intentions with the world.Book Three investigates Christian behaviour, in terms of the cardinal virtues, social and personal morality, morality and psychology, marriage, forgiveness, the great sin (narcissistic pride; in this regard, please also readPeople of the Lie: The Hope for Healing Human Evilby M Scott Peck), and what charity, hope and faith really mean.Book 4 is a captivating explanation of the doctrine of the trinity. I found this part very interesting and sometimes deeply moving. Lewis speculates on the nature of time, the nature of man and the nature of God, as the Father the source, the Son an emanation of the source and the Holy Spirit as the spirit of love between Father and Son. Lewis explains what he thinks is the process whereby the individual receives a higher nature. This change in consciousness (infusion of the Holy Spirit) leads to a transcendence of the mortal nature by transforming the individual into a child of the divine.He argues convincingly for personalities in God and God as the ultimate personality. I found this very illuminating, also in light of having recently read the books byDeborah Whitehouseand Alan Anderson on Process New Thought, especially their view of the personhood of God and panentheism as it emerges from the work ofAlfred North Whitehead.Mere Christianity is a most memorable work that expresses ideas that are relevant to our times. It is a very refreshing expression of a personal Christian belief system that could serve as a strong antidote to the dictatorship of dogma or the staid boredom often associated with 20th century religion in the West. Deeply illuminating, Lewis' words I am sure make many people reconsider important ideas that they had taken for granted.I am not sure how close Lewis came to the truth in every respect, but much in his vision is inspiring, noble and infused with a sense of logic and common sense. Lewis' writing has an uplifting effect on the spirit. I recommend Mere Christianity to all people of faith and those in search of meaning. One might not ultimately agree with everything, but the thoughts expressed here certainly make you think."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Arrived early. Very prompt service.

It was very detailed and specific in it's different chapters. But as a Christian or someone who is wanting to question Christianity this is a must read. It doesn't get better C. S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have always loved the writings of Clive Staples Lewis, ever since I first read his Screwtape Letters many years ago. Lewis is by my assessment the greatest mind in English literature in the past century. It is the way his mind works, even on paper, that I love the most. I eagerly await a collected lifetime works of his in the future.Mere Christianity is the published manuscripts of his famous WW2 radio broadcasts, and they have been on the market ever since 1944. Fortunate for all his Christian readers! Lewis has a way with words to make profound things seem simple. He is not hard to understand and his explanations use a lot of good everyday examples to illustrate his points. When he has made that point, he uses even more examples to make the point absolutely clear. Then he apologizes for any shortcomings!Mere Christianity is one of those books I have now read at least four times; it has that much impact. The only other books I have ever read more than once also include a trilogy by Lewis on adult sci-fi, so you can see my continuing devotion to things Lewisian.Lewis takes the reader on a journey of the mind in which we are given the explanation of human nature and why there is a supreme God. This is clear and convincing stuff, believe me. Lewis speaks of a sense of right and wrong as being inherent in all humans. We respond to a divine calling toward this sense, and out of it all comes our awareness of God and the divine purpose behind life. If you are an atheist you have no excuses after Lewis is through with you, or you shouldn't have any. There are reasons for things that happen in the world of human beings and every affect has a cause. Moral law and the interaction of God and man are indisputable. When it comes to a complete yet unambiguous philosophy on Christianity, Lewis pulls no punches here. Christianity is not an idea or another theology; it's a way of life. Using the basic Law of Human Nature, Lewis gets right to the point of why we were created, why every human understands why every other human acts out of moral compunction and responsibility, no matter his or her background, culture, creed, or other religious beliefs.We are all victims of a warped nature. It is natural to do what is wrong, believing it is right. It is, says Lewis, almost perverse to resist the temptations toward doing wrong. That explains the immorality and amorality in our world. And to overcome this warped nature, we must consult God. We must repent. We must be reformed into new creatures. That too is the central aspect of what Jesus does and is still doing. Regeneration by way of a substitution of Himself in our stead before the eternal God. Because he was God in the flesh (Emmanuel) who paid the price and offers forgiveness.This treatise is superbly quotable. For instance, Lewis tells us early on that \\"If we do not believe in decent behavior, why should we be so anxious to make excuses for not behaving decently?\\" People, he says, \\"know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in. in another example, when talking about good and bad people and why they behave thusly, Lewis tells us that ultimately, \\"Good people know about both good and evil: bad people do not know about either.\\"Well put, Mr Lewis.He then presents God as the Power behind this Law, and the facts supporting the laws. It is something that is \\"put into our minds ...a sort of inside information.\\" I would challenge any reader to defy what Lewis is saying here. You can't deny your own conscience without dire consequences.Creation and God is at the central core of Christianity. Evil exists because a dark Power (Satan) was once good but fell from grace. Salvation exists because a Good Power (Jesus, ie God in the flesh) intervened for us. The central Christian belief is that which surrounds Christ's claims to deity and saviorship. This \\"religion\\" is so unique and universal because of this.Lewis uses delightful and tidy illustrations for each and every point in his arguments. So much so that they actually don't sound like arguments at all but more like very obvious conclusions. How can any mind disagree? But he never condescends to the reader; rather he apologizes for any vagueness that may exist, and asks the reader to go on to the next idea or to drop any dissentions in an agreeable and peaceful way. Lewis is one never to force a point; his gentlemanly manner and childlike persuasion overrules that kind of squabble.Lewis goes for the jugular when explaining the biggest reason for man rejecting this singular view of God. Our pride gets in the way. It is the foremost of sins; if you don't think that, consider that Satan, once the most glorious of angels, fell because of his pride. We all tend to think of Ourselves, not God, as the primary reason for living. Our gaze, as the Bible clearly teaches, should always be heavenward. How well it has been said, \\"aim at heaven and you will get earth \`thrown in': aim at earth and you will get neither.\\" In a world wherein spirituality is not dealt with in a healthy fashion, the fool puts the blame for all shortcomings on everything around him, the disillusioned or dispassionate man says everything is nonsense and passing on to other planes of secular understanding, and the Christian says that \\"creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists.\\" Spiritually, we are all destined for another country, the heavenly country. We were made for another world, and only through responding to the Law of nature and the divine moral imperative (and the call of the Christian gospel) can we achieve that world.So much in the Christian life has to be taken on Faith. God offers some things, the necessary things, then asks us to trust Him for the unexplained things left over. Consider again that, in Adam and Eve, we rejected the perfect place and condition; so having come back begging to God for redemption, is it not appropriate that He forgives but does not have to explain everything? A wayward child does not ask for irreverent and superfluous details of his new home when he has been accepted back into it after his waywardness ends.There is a nice description of the deity of Christ here. God creates man, but \`begets' His only son. A cat begets a cat, a bird begets a bird, man begets a son or daughter like himself. God begets ... God. Full godship and power and glory and unity. That's Jesus. Thus the trinity (rejected by Islam and Jews) is acceptable. If several lines make up a figure and several figures (ie squares) make up a cube, so it is that several \`persons' make up a divine God. Anybody who wishes to argue away this reasoning be warned: the Bible proclaims it and who are we to say God is not able? There is also a nice description of time vs eternity. Lewis tells us that God dwells in eternity; hence He is outside our perception of the flow of time itself. This is important in thinking about this worlds and the heavenly world, especially where it pertains to prophecy and God knowing the future. It helps to explain how Christ died for those before him as well as those after him. He was, and still is, \`out of time'. Says Lewis, \\"If you picture Time as a straight line along which we have to travel, then you must picture God as the whole page on which the line is drawn.\\" In other words, God has no history, in the way that we know history. And when we inherit a portion of Christ (by accepting and believing in him as he asks us to) then we inherit eternal life in the most real way. This \`putting on of Christ\\" is the whole point of Christianity. Handing over our whole selves to God, through Christ, is both difficult and profoundly easy. Lewis explains this in a way that makes the issues simply profound and profoundly simple.The whole world, say the saints of the ages, is divided between Christians and non-Christians. If the difference is a mere faith in Jesus and what he claimed to be, then so be it. The world seems complicated by all its claims. A couple of more quotes from Lewis: \\"One soul in the whole creation you do know: and it is the only one whose fate is placed in your hands.\\" It is your own soul. \\"How monotonously alike all the great tyrants and conquerors have been; how gloriously different are the saints.\\"This, we have to suppose, is mere Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"My experience with Amazon reviews is that if anyone takes the time to review a book, it must be that the book is worth someone's while or it isn't.If you're thoughtful enough to look over Amazon reviews before buying a book, this is my chance at saying: this book is worth your money and more.C.S. Lewis's phenomenal contribution to the Christian literature does not have the stigma of a \\"know-it-all\\" professor's analytical, esoteric analysis on Christianity. Neither is it a pop-culture approach, one-size-fits-all solution to turn every reader into a convert.\\"Mere Christianity\\" is C.S. Lewis's brilliant attempt at untangling the basic misconceptions about Christanity, to render it into its basic components and tenets, so that even the most cynical may see the logic and truth behind his words.C.S. Lewis has a way of drawing the reader closer with his simple, honest tone. He doesn't act like the Oxford professor that he is. His words and tone add another dimension of reality to his words.As a Christian, I find it hard to invite non-Christian friends to church. But after reading this book, I've realized that the Christian faith shouldn't be shameful because it is a way of life as enlightening and noble as the oldest of philosophies.I recommend this book whole-heartedly to non-Christians who are curious about Christianity and even to cynics who need a leg up in life.I even challenge life-long Christians to devour book.You will never be the same."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I tried to read Mere Christianity once before.

Although I have been a Christian since childhood books by Lewis and Madelaine L'Engle have deepened my personal walk with God immeasurably. Mere Christianity is a classic discourse on why we are Christians, written in a thoughtful and timeless language."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Although C.S. Lewis was a devout Anglican, in reality, he had a very strange and bizarre combination of both Anglican and Roman Catholic theological views coupled to various mythologies.(Romanglican mythology?!), and it shows through in this book. This is still a wonderful, moving and insightful \\"christian like\\" book. Though I wouldn't really consider it a true protestant/puritan \\"christian\\" book even though its sort of close (but not really). I did not know this when I first read it. However, it certainly worked for me! It got me to re-accept Christ in my life and become a recommitted believer. It's pretty safe to say that this book has profoundly changed my life! The \\"Britishisms\\" in this book are a little too obvious (although he was, after all, a languages professor at Oxford). I am glad he discussed the theology of Chritianity in such a way as to make it more understandable to the average person like me. As he noted early in the book, he wasn't able to go into as much detail on every single subject in Christianity as he would have liked to. And yes, I would have liked him to, but then, I'm glad he focused on the most important, basic issues. He probably could have gotten far more wordy than he did. If he had, this book would have exploded into a giant, unwieldy tome and not the elegant and accessible little apologetic book that it is. It is interesting that no one else has been able to top it after all these years. This is a must read for EVERYONE no matter how cynical, incredulous, apthetic or jaded you might be! But keep in mind that it is a slightly skewed book and its views come from a tainted sect of \\"christianity\\" (mostly Roman Catholicism and to a lesser extent, Anglicanism) which are based around some mythological undertones."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"For those who are tired or simply bored of Christian books being all about feelings or experiences, this is the book for you. It presents a cogent argument for the author's faith, and the process by which he went about describing it is stimulating."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"First to answer the harshest criticism of this book. Several have charged Lewis with basing the book on something that science has since explained away-- our sense of morality. This is simply false. Science has explained aspects of our sense of morality but not all of it, and certainly not the core of Christian morality. There is no scientific explanation for why some lay down their lives for others. It is not (CANNOT!) be an evolved trait. Thus the core of Christian belief, the idea that Jesus laid down his life for us, is beyond what science can touch. Also, even if science reduced everything, it still would not touch the question of whether there is a mind behind everything. Science has its use-- but not for the biggest questions.This is an excellent, thought provoking, well written book. I agree that reading Lewis is like having a conversation. His voice comes through his writings so plainly. At this point when faith seems to be under philosophical attack (and some versions of the faith perhaps deservedly) this is an important book. The only other book of which I am aware that speaks with this kind of force and clarity is called The Strongest Defense of Christianity. If you've never read The Strongest Defense of Christianity, it's worth looking up."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of the best and most challenging books I have read about our faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is one of those books that needs to be on every bookshelf in every home and re-read every 5 years! I would also include \\"I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Athiest\\" by Geisler and Turek....awesome..."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"CS Lewis has knack for tackling hard complicated subjects with no easy answer and making them appear easy to follow. What really makes this book special is the way any reader of various reading background, whether highly educated or not, can read this book and come away with a new look and understanding on complex issues. Furthermore, you do not have to be a Christian to read this book. Lewis tackles issues that everybody, despite religious veiws, has to deal with.Subjects such as evil and pain suffering and why the exist are examined. Lewis shows that evil is not a dual entity with goodness. Just like darkness is not a dual entity with light, rather darkness is merely the absence of light. Light can be measured, darkness however cannot be. Darkness is only the absence of light. It is a little harder to visualize goodness and evil on these terms but Lewis does a great job of making the connection.This book is a fast read and is for people of various reading abilities."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I would definitley recommend this book to everyone, not Christians exclusively. I would offer one suggestion before you begin. This is not a book that you can read through easily and half-heartedly. I would seriously consider reading it more than once. The first time I read it, I thought it was great but I needed to read it twice to understand a lot. I would also recommend reading The Screwtape Letters as well as any other books by Lewis."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I first read this book a couple of months ago. I read it within a couple of days it was that good! However, I feel that I must answer the critics of the novel who say that it was illogical or did not offer a very good 'proof' of Christianity. Lewis, in this book was writing down in words what he had previously said on the radio. Inevitably, one would not be able to cover every possible angle when giving a radio interview. One of the other reviews stated that C S Lewis used &quot;emotion&quot; rather than cold hard looking at the facts of Christianity. By this, the author of the comment expressed that Lewis was being illogical and irrational. On the contrary, where logic falls down is in the relm of emotions, feelings and morality. &quot;Logical&quot; debates can be held day and night from now until the end of eternity and one may not necessarily come to an answer. Where others have looked at logic and failed (by failed I mean failed to give an answer), the use of emotions, feelings and morality in a logical manner must be the next course of action. Which Lewis does with great flare and a brilliant talent for the truth.The second objection that I have noticed in some of the critical reviews is that of the &quot;Analogy that fails&quot;. Lewis uses Analogies to try and demonstrate to the common man, who has had little or no experience with Christianity, what Christians believe. Often throughout the book, he states that his own analogies are not sufficient. One cannot criticise something that the author has already criticized about his own writing! That is illogical.Read the reviews, read the book. If done with an open mind, you will not regret it. 5 stars all the way."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read (and loved) the Chronicles of Narnia just before graduating from college. At that time, I was so non-religious I did not even recognize that they were an allegory for the Christian faith. I consider that C. S. Lewis was possessed by literary MAGIC when he wrote this series. His science fiction trilogy is interesting, but contain no magic. The religious irruption at the end of Perelandra is boring and irritating. I have since read nearly all of Lewis's works; and not just read them, but reread and seriously studied them -- especially Mere Christianity. Over thirty years ago I experienced an overwhelming sense of the presence of God that changed me from a perfervid atheist to someone incapable of doubting in God. However, I had become an atheist because so much of Christianity impressed me as ridiculous and offensive. I saw no necessary connection to my experience of God with the Christian version of God. I started reading C. S. Lewis to see if he could change my mind. He did not.There is only one God, but there are many human versions of God. Liberal Christians acknowledge that God inspires most religions; with the caveat that Christianity is nonetheless the only really true faith. (Liberals of all other faiths make the same claim). Conservative Christians insist that Satan is deceiving non-Christians and liberal Christians. They even deride Lewis because his notion of hell is not hot enough to please them. I try to be indifferent to the specific set of dogma to which people nail their God, providing that their faith serves to make them better people. However, even the very best Christians could be better people still if they became more skeptical of their dogma. Lewis condones the medieval execution of witches because people THOUGHT witches were \\"quislings,\\" and the hordes of bad people happily duped by Satan in Narnia were obviously Moslems. Refusing to acknowledge that the God who spoke to Moses was obviously a brutal, genocidal war god -- in no intelligent way reconcilable with Christ, the Prince of Peace -- gives grounds for justifying damned near anything, and has done so repeatedly throughout history. I am unapologetically irascible in denouncing these attitudes.Lewis tells us that prior to accepting Christ we are essentially false selves; so only Christians have become their true selves. Oddly enough, this is similar to what I believe; but I disagree that false selves have free will. Sin and evil are thus a consequence of a lack of free will, and the purpose of religion should be to teach us how to develop free will. My arguments for this are too complex to go into here. (For those interested, please read my book, Captain California Battles the Beelzebubian Beasts of the Bible).One of the Christian beliefs that I find most repellent and barbaric is the notion that Christ had to die on the cross to divert God's wrath from me; I am told that I am so guilty that I actually deserve God's wrath. Lewis admits to not completely understanding why Christ's crucifixion was necessary for human salvation, but tells us that we must believe it based upon the authority of the Gospel writers. What? People find Lewis's arguments convincing because he writes with the eloquence of a successfully lawyer - his eloquence masks the weakness of his reasoning. He complains that the Christianity many people reject is the Christianity of six-year-olds. Unfortunately, this is precisely the level of faith of an awful lot of Christians; and I am not convinced that Lewis's faith carries believers beyond adolescence."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"When I read MC in college, I remember being impressed with it, and felt for the first time my agnosticism being challenged. Imagine my surprise years later when I picked it up and found it sorely lacking. Trained eyes revealed that Lewis simply does not logically connect his conclusions to his premises. Oh, he makes gestures to that effect, but form alone does not a logical argument make. He avoids obvious objections to his arguments usually involving a POV beyond the immediate moment, so his arguments seem forced towards a predetermined end.To illustrate, consider this exchange from the section entitled &quot;The Reality of the Law&quot;:&quot;If we ask 'why ought I to be unselfish?', and you reply 'because it is good for society', we may then ask 'why should I care what is good for society except when it happens to pay ME personally?', and then you will have to say 'Because you ought to be unselfish - which simply brings us back to where we started.'But I am not forced to such a self-serving answer because the obvious response is that I care what is good for society because that tends to result in lots of things that pay me personally in the future, irrespective of whether it happens to pay me at the moment. Lewis' only response to this is to say that &quot;as an explanation of why we feel as we do about right ad wrong it just misses the point&quot;. This is typical of what one finds in the book - any counterexample to Lewis' theory is either ignored entirely, or dismissed out of hand as off point.I give Lewis credit for his effort, and to the ill-informed it might pose a challenge. But to the well-read and logically versed, it falls very flat, revealed as one long unsupported assertion. One can be forgiven for writing in almost every margin &quot;How does Lewis know that?&quot;. Just don't expect any answers."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Having spent nine years of my life as a Christian minister, I understand how Christians think. I read this book as a Christian in the early 1990's. I was never that impressed with it. Lewis makes what Christians consider to be good points. I once thought so too, but the more I matured in life, the more I grew away from faith and away from the silliness of this work.Lewis's \\"conversion story\\" is a complete joke. He was just another downhearted, unchurched atheist who got tired of materialism and decided Christianity's take on things was good enough for him. He was not what most materialists would consider to have been an enlightened atheist, just a smart guy who came to believe in Christianity. This is not at all uncommon. There are plenty of conversions and de-conversions every which way - into and out of all religions and philosophies.This is the type of book where if you are a believer, it sounds good because it's what you want to hear. But if you're not a believer, it is utterly laughable and ridiculous.Lewis just doesn't deal with apologetics. He doesn't define this god of his, just asserts him, and then tries to psychoanalyze why people reject him. He talks about Christians sinning and falling short of God, pride, and other human pitfalls, most of them unrelated to the existence of God altogether, but can't appeal to a knowledgeable atheist who understands that these things are natural characteristics, not divine.Lewis is content to believe that mankind is a sinful race, conceived in sin and headed to Hell. I repudiate this doctrine with all of my being. It is wrong altogether in this writer's opinion.The book is boring and essentially says nothing about why we should believe in the existence of some god, only why he thinks people don't. Like all god-believers, Lewis starts with an assumption and works backwards to prove it. I only gave this book 2 stars because thinking like a minister, some of the points once sounded good to me. In all honesty, it is barely worth that!(JH)www.ministerturnsatheist.org"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I bought this book hoping to find an intelligent defense of faith, given that the author is such a well respected fiction writer. Unfortunately, what I found were the kinds of arguments that I used while in grade school and discarded soon thereafter. If you've thought critically about anything at any point in your life, you're not going to get anything out of this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I reviewed this book earlier, and I must tell you that 16 months of maturity do a lot to alter a view. Mere Christianity is a book for the average believer who is just beginning his/her inquiry into why he or she adheres to Christianity, but it is by no means a sophisticated, well-developed argument in favor of Christianity. For example, the first part of the book deals with, among other things, an argument for God's existence from morality. Lewis claims that there is a moral law within each one of us that we feel bound to. This is not a moral law that we just &quot;decide&quot; to have, says Lewis, but rather it eminates from a source outside of our conscious self. Since we are not the source of this law and this doesn't come as some natural byproduct of evolution, therefore there must be a Lawgiver. Somehow, Lewis thinks that this amounts to a convincing argument for the existence of God. But any moral philosopher of significant caliber can pick apart this argument. Sure, someone could believe that there is a moral law and that God is the lawgiver, but from reading Mere Christianity, we can go no further than this. Not only does this not amount to a rock-solid argument for the existence of God but it isn't even a decent argument. Reading the passage over and over again, I kept looking for the A=B, B=C, therefore A=C syllogism that one usually expects with an argument using formal logic. Its almost as if Lewis speculates for a while about a divine moral law and proceeds on with his book as if he's proved that such a thing exists (and such a Lawgiver for the thing). If a theist wants a philosphically compelling argument for an objective morality, they must investigate the Thomist tradition of philosophy. If a theist wants to show that only this view of morality works, his/her best outlet is Alasdair MacIntyre's &quot;After Virtue&quot; which skewers the entire Enlightenment Project of justifying morality on &quot;reason&quot; alone from Kant to Kierkegard. He then shows how Nietzsche exposes the project for what it is, and why we must return to a Neo-Aristotelian version of a system of morality (and eventually a Thomistic account of morality) since this is the only real option we have unless we want chaos (e.g. Nietzsche).Another annoying tendency with this book is Lewis' overreliance on arguments from analogy. For instance, in his exhortation on the Trinity, he compares the relations between the different persons of the Trinity to three books stacked on top of a table. One depends on the other, and that one on the bottom one. But one of the dangers with arguing from analogy is making sure that the analogy is a good one. Oddly enough, the best argument for the Trinity I've ever come across is from Conversations with God: not exactly an explicitly Christian book (although extremely interesting).Overall, Lewis does ok for the general lay audience, but for someone thirsting for a compelling defense and offensive argument in favor of traditional theism and/or Christianity, one must look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I believe Lewis is a hugely overrated theologian; even a hugely overrated commentator. Here's one example:In Mere Christianity (Book 4, Chapter 10 'Nice People or Good Men') Lewis writes, &quot;There are people (a great many of them) who are slowly ceasing to be Christians but who still call themselves by that name: some of them are clergymen. There are other people who are slowly becoming Christians though they do not yet call themselves so. There are people who do not accept the full Christian doctrine about Christ but who are so strongly attracted to Him that they are His in a much deeper sense than they themselves understand. There are people in other religions who are being led by God's secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to Christ without knowing it. For example, a Buddhist of good will may be led to concentrate more and more on the Buddhist teaching about mercy and to leave in the background (though he may still say he believed) the Buddhist teaching on certain other points. Many of the good Pagans long before Christ's birth may have been in this position.&quot;Certainly a Christian may cease to 'act' like a Christian; but Lewis wrote that a Christian could cease to 'be' a Christian, thus revealing his total misunderstanding or total disregard of John 10:28,29. &quot;And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father's hand.&quot;In addition, given Lewis' heretical comment that \`good Pagans' could belong to Christ because of their concentration on Buddhist teachings about mercy, I now have serious doubts about Lewis' own spiritual regeneration.I would advise anyone to skip Lewis altogether and read someone who understands Scripture.

Instead I read very weak arguments easily refuted by any 1st year philosophy major. This book is convincing only if you already believe, in which case there may not be much point. Several times I literally shook my head in disbelief at the extreme leaps of logic (or more precisely, illogic) that he used to state his case. In spite of my hopes, I was not in the least bit challenged in my own belief (I left Catholicism for agnostic Buddhism about a decade ago). Anyone who has left Christianity and critically thought about that decision will probably already have figured out the points where CS Lewis goes astray. All in all, because of the way this book is hyped by Christians, I was expecting something much more convincing, or at least logic that was better constructed.

Lewis, hailed for his many great works, did not fall short with \\"Mere Christianity.\\" In fact, the book is considered one of the most prominent and well made defenses of the Christian Faith of the 20th century.In this book Lewis reveals a basis for Christianity that is undeniably rational and reasonable. His arguments are very easy and quick to follow, and laced with analogies that only strengthen his points. He is able take the reader on a road that very rationally reveals the truths of Christianity by starting out with a skeptic's view then using logic to go beyond that view. He then builds on this with clear facts and observations in a smooth manner that is intellectual and well-structured.Unlike similar works, he focuses his attention on the evidence of Christianity and uses that to lead up to the practice of the faith. He smoothly gets from point a to b, rather than diving right in and using a fire and brimstone approach.

Lewis' clear mind and articulate pen create a defense of Christianity that is not only convincing but thoroughly refreshing. He's a hero. If you read it, you will know why"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book after having a theological discussion with a friend of mine. He had said that his views were best expounded by this book, and so I picked it up to be fair. Unfortunately, Mr. Lewis hits the brick wall of logic pretty early on.The version I had was an older, used paperback that I have since given away, so my quotes are not exact. However, my memory of the errors is pretty sharp, and the issues I raise are actually in the book.Problem #1: In the introduction, Mr. Lewis essentially says \\"We must never let a potential convert know of the problems and contradictions in our religion until after he has been successfully brought into the fold. If we did let him know, he would never take Christianity seriously, and therefore would not convert.\\" A very astute observation on Lewis' part. He admits that his religion does not make any sense, and so the illusion of sense must be erected in order to convert anyone.Problem #2: Later on we get the infamous \\"Lewis Trilemma:\\" Jesus is either A) who he says he is (that is, God), B) Lying about who he is or C) insane, and therefore dangerous. Lewis seems to have forgotten that the Bible is a collection of various documents, many written decades after the events they purport to describe, and has been edited hundreds of times by people with very obvious political agendas (side note: contradictions in the Bible are very well known, and a quick Google search will yield fruitful results for those who are curious). So the trilemma is a false one to begin with, as it is feasible (in fact, more feasible than the alternative) to doubt the most incredible story of Jesus as it is presented to us. In order to take the Bible literally, one must already assume its inerrancy, which means assuming the existence of God, leading to a circular argument. So, we don't even have to accept the trilemma as it is given to us, much less consider the laughable solution Mr. Lewis proposes, which has been addressed in other reviews.Problem #3: This is (I think) less of a logical problem itself, but a reflection the lack of logic throughout the book. The problem is this: Lewis peppers his entire book with thinly veiled threats of hell for the unbeliever. One sentence I recall goes something like \\"The unbeliever make enjoy the devil more than the Lord, but he won't when he actually meets him.\\" This patronizing Holier-than-thou attitude is exactly the sort of thing that turns many people off from Christianity. It does not take a great deal of imagination to see early Christianity's P.R. department thinking \\"you know, just in case none of the arguments in favor of Christianity work, lets throw in the worst threat we can find. That outta get us SOME converts.\\" This goes back to the first problem, as Lewis has admitted that his arguments for the unbeliever are deceptive at best, as they attempt to hide the inconsistencies of his religion.Problem #4: For some of the vaguer problems. Lewis makes the typical moral argument (\\"there are no morals without god\\"), assuming that we would all go on killing sprees if we didn't have a supervising agent. He seems to take the 3 year old's approach to morality: don't do something wrong cause you might get caught. He also argues \\"We all desire the supernatural, and we cannot desire something that does not exist.\\" As we for \\"we all desire\\" part, my answer would be \\"speak for yourself.\\" Additionally, Lewis seems to have never heard of the imagination. You know, that faculty of our brain that allows us to construct images of things that don't necessarily exist?I am sure there are other problems, but once I located these, I stopped reading the book. I know, poor form. However, when the Lewis trilemma is your foundation, and you admit in the introduction that your entire attempt at rational defense is inherently dishonest, you can only go downhill from there."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity is a wonderful book. Lewis was at one time an atheist who later came to Christianity, and Mere Christianity is a compilation of Lewis's thought that lead to the conversion. The book is not a difficult read; Lewis has taken complex ideas and broken them down to their most simple forms. His thought is always logical, and almost as far as one can go, he details the logical reasons for God. Of course, as Kierkegaard and Lewis both know, faith in God can't be found by simple reasoning; there is that &quot;leap&quot; involved. For this reason, Lewis goes on to explain many of his basic beliefs about Christianity.Really, Mere Christianity is a great book to detail the most basic foundations of Christianity. There are a few areas where my own interpretations and opinions differ slightly from Lewis, but that is definitely to be expected. Lewis was open-minded and acknowledged that differences in doctrinal thought are essential from Christian to Christian. I think that this is part of the real strength of the book; C.S. Lewis has explained the most basic principals of Christianity in general, and the individual Christian can build on them. Mere Christianity can be an essential tool to help the Christian better articulate his/her beliefs, and the book can also serve as a very basic introduction to a person considering or wanting to learn about Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is not a work for the those uninitiated into Christian dogma. Within about 50 pages, Lewis establishes the existence of the Christian God from the premise that the human being enters this world with a priori knowledge of right and wrong. Wow! The argument is weak, and proceeds through a sort of process of elimination of alternative explanations rather than through a demonstration of the necessity of the Christian God. People had told me that CS Lewis was an intelligent Christian apologist. However, it seem to me that this book is not meant to bring anyone into the Christian fold, but simply to keep them in. I suggest taking a look at Kreeft's book, &quot;Christianity for Modern Pagans&quot;, a commentary on Pascal's Pensees. Or read Pascal's pensees directly."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"THIS IS A BOOK THAT WITHSTOOD THE TEST OF TIME.C. S.

FOR THAT REASON IT WRITTEN IN AN OLDER, MORE FORMAL STYLE.THIS MAY TAKE A CHAPTER OR TWO TO GET FAMILIAR WITH. BUT ONCE YOU DO YOU WILL BE RICHLY REWARDED FOR DOING SO."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading Mere Christianity, and I found the first part especially well written. Lewis tells us that Christians don't have to just sit back and not do any thinking, but that if people would just examine the facts, they should come to a similar, logical conclusion that Christianity is the only plausible explanation for our existence. His argument is, at times, somewhat thin, which might cause those who are not quite convinced to waver, but there is much interesting in this book, and even in the later chapters, he maintains a ecumenical spirit of reasonableness. His attempt to show that different denominations of Christians were really just different rooms in the same house--the Universal Church, is an interesting idea, and he tries to show us how really similar the different churches are, and I'm not sure how convincing it is, but I enjoyed his writing style, and I will continue to profit from his insight by reading The Four Loves and the famous Screwtape Letters."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis states that he wrote this book with the idea of convincing atheists. As an atheist myself, I had heard Lewis was the best Christian apologist there is. If these arguments are the best Christianity can come up with, atheism doesn't have much to worry about.Lewis takes the approach in this book of focusing on all the doctrines the largest branches of Christianity have in common, deliberately ignoring controversial issues. The problem with this is that the endless proliferation of Christian sects is one of the strongest arguments against Christianity. If Christians themselves can't agree on what Christ really taught or what God wants from us, what chance is there of convincing atheists--or for that matter Muslims or Hindus? Lewis says that as far as people who have never heard of Christ, we just don't know what God has arranged for them, so we should leave it up to God. This strikes me as an intellectual cop-out. Part of the reason atheism makes sense to me is that atheism has intellectual coherence. Atheism doesn't have to twist itself into knots over the problem of how God can love all his children but leave most of them without knowledge of him, or how God can be good when the world around us often seems filled with evil and injustice.Lewis claims that our ideas of goodness and justice, which are common to all cultures, mean there must be a God. I disagree. I don't see any reason why evolution could not produce human beings having a sense of right and wrong. To some extent, a sense of right and wrong is a necessity for social animals. Chimpanzees complain when something they have worked to get is stolen from them. Wolves reject another wolf from the pack if he doesn't behave as a wolf should. Why would human beings be different?Lewis also argues that the fact that humans hunger to find meaning in life means that there must be a God. I agree that humans have a tendency to be discontented and hunger for more. But what evidence is there such discontent could not evolve in human beings? A certain amount of discontent could have benefitted our ancestors by keeping them always trying to better their circumstances, instead of getting complacent. As a former Christian myself, I also know that Christianity doesn't necessarily bring contentedness. Some atheists are indeed miserable people, but many are happy. As far as my own life, I would call it generally pretty good. The Christians of my acquaintance don't seem to have more meaningful or happy lives on average than the atheists.Lewis has a reputation for being a logician. In my opinion, much of his \\"logic\\" is absurd. For example, Lewis spends a lot of time on the Trinity and how the three persons are connected. He talks about the Son streaming forth from the Father, and that this has always been so, etc. This just makes me laugh. And Lewis thinks that atheism makes no sense?If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible.As far as the book itself, Lewis is a fine writer who is never boring. For that reason I give the book two stars. If you're interested in basic Christianity, this is a good introduction. Before taking it too seriously, however, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. As far as the major problems of our times, I would suggest Kunstler's \\"The Long Emergency.\\" For a defense of atheism and the naturalistic worldview,I would suggest Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" or Taner Edis' \\"The Ghost in the Universe.\\"I read \\"Mere Christianity\\" because I feel as a scientist that it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Some statements: @ the time of writing this short review there are nearly 80 reviews, and rarely do I usually think that I have something to add when so many have already given their opinion. Still, I think I have some important statements for readers out there who have not yet encountered this book.The title, Mere Christiantiy, is really key. While many conservative evangelicals, who often lack a real encounter with the deeper Christian theological tradition present in works by such men as Niebuhr, Tillich &amp; Barth, may present this book to you as THE definitive argument for Christianity, he/she would be in error. Indeed, this is not the author's intent whatsoever. Rather, this book is to serve as a mere cursory introduction to what he sees as Christian orthodoxy, or gestalt if you will ---being the elements present and preserved throughout the faith's history. In some way, he fails @ this task showing that he himself was not immmune to the prejudices of his time (e.g., passages that present the man as 'head of the household').Also, Lewis was neither too liberal nor too conservative, though he was certainly traditional. He certainly was NOT fundamentalist or evangelical (e.g., he did not adhere to the plenary, verbal inspiration of Scripture). Thus, to read him as being an adherent to this flavor of Christianity is to MISread him.Of course, this book has its apologetic elements, and of course, it is not exhaustive. Lewis is not trying to subjugate all of our doubts to the mastery of his arguments. He rarely was so arrogant. One must read this with his attention in mind--- to explain mere Christianity will simultaneously showing it to be reasonable. And, he attempts to soften some of what to outsiders may seem as rough edges and succeeds quite often with amazing fecundity.Despite the impression some may get from the strong recommendations given for this book (and it is indeed a classic), it is best not to assume that this will be the end all to searching. Mere Christianity serves best to introduce an ignorant person of the beliefs of Christianity when knowledge is lacking and to aid the believer in understanding his own faith. For those who would want to encounter more developed, firm arguments and/or have travelled further down the path of intellectual development, this book can't harm, but there is much more to be sought out. For a strong apologetic work, which is more contemporary yet still becoming dated itself, I recommend Hans K&uuml;ng's ON BEING A CHRISTIAN.

Lewis did not believe in the central Christian concept of salvation: \\"Justification by faith\\" and the entire book is an attempt to fashion a soteriology which avoids any notion of \\"propitiated wrath\\" or \\"deflected retribution.\\"Lewis did not believe the Bible when it described God as having it within his nature to see fit to infinitely penalize one of his creatures. And as the late theologian Dr. Martyn Lloyd Jones said \\"Lewis's theology was defective because he was an opponent of the penal concept of the atonement.\\" Lewis spends his whole book subtly making this point without ever using the jargon, but most Christian readers will entirely miss it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It is impossible to support a subjective, mystical experience through logical reasoning, as Lewis claims. He begins by attempting to prove God's existence as an explanation of observed moral behavior. He blithely dismisses the \\"herd instinct,\\" however, much of human cooperative behavior is explained by natural selection. As social animals, humans are expected to relinquish part of their autonomy in return for membership in the group. The desire to cooperate with others, i.e. behave morally, and the feeling of guilt for failure to do so, evolved to promote this cooperation. Thus, the argument that morality originates with a benevolent diety falls apart, leading to the question as to where God gets his own morality. If we say that one of God's properties is that he is moral, that doesn't answer anything - it's a circular argument of \\"God is moral because he is moral.\\" You could just as correctly state, \\"morality exists because it exists,\\" without the need for God.Lewis claims to have arrived at his religious faith reluctantly, through inescapable deductive reasoning. I suspect he is being disingenuous here. The remarkably flawed \\"proof\\" suggests that he arrived at it through an emotional conversion, then, to paraphrase B.F. Skinner, like a child who thinks he sees the outline of an animal in the pattern of pebbles on the beach, he rearranges a few here and there until there is no doubt. The entire work smacks of someone who came to a conclusion in advance, later producing observations and analysis to support it. Lewis is careful not to offer the Bible as \\"proof\\" of his conclusions. Are we to believe that he came to them independently of the Bible?The specific gravity of aluminum is 2.8. We do not believe this because \\"it is written\\" in a mechanical engineering textbook; the book merely records the result of experimental observation. We consult the book because it is easier than performing a time-consuming analysis of our own every time we need this information. But we could verify this figure anytime we wanted. No one would claim that the \\"facts\\" in the Bible could be verified the same way. But we are to believe that Lewis came all the way from atheism to the Church of England (to the consternation of his friend, J.R.R. Tolkien, who had hoped Lewis would embrace Catholicism), purely through deductive logic. This is preposterous. He had a private (albeit popular) mystical experience, then built up an elaborate philosophy (again, a shared one) to explain it. His explanation contradicting this is entirely inauthentic and dishonest. If he had instead admitted that he had undergone an ineffable, mystical experience of the living God, then explored the various evidence supporting this being a valid sensation and not a convincing illusion, I would at least have respected his experience while disagreeing with his conclusions. As it is, I can neither credit the former any more than I can accept the latter."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a fine example of how beautiful prose can mask otherwise muddled thinking. Those who are desperate for some validation of their religious beliefs will undoubtedly praise this diminutive tome. Those with sharper wit will easily see past the eloquent facade and discover why this emporer has no clothes."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"by Yahya Sulaiman, The Logic Hammer. (I am not Richard Livingston but his son, despite what it may say above.)When I was a Christian I was much inspired by C.S. Lewis's theology. I tore into it greedily, and the book \\"Mere Christianity\\" in particular helped me when I had lapses of faith. This is not unusual: there is no theological work of his--indeed, perhaps no book of Christian theology by *anyone*--which is as renowned for inspiring or increasing Christian faith. Now, rereading the book as a Muslim, I am a little ashamed that I was ever misled by such sloppy arguments for Christian belief as book provides.On page 75 C.S. Lewis \\"[henceforth] assumes the Christian point of view, and looks at the whole picture as it will be if Christianity is true\\". Everything up to that point is his attempt \\"to explain and defend the belief [system] that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times\\" (page VIII). This review will focus only on the former part of the book. Not being a Christian I am no longer interested in matters addressed only to Christians, and it is in that first seventy-five pages where the missionary crux of the text lies.The structure of the book's argumentation is progressive. Somewhat like the book I'm writing to promote Islam it starts with the issue of God's existence, then discusses theories about God and characteristics attributed to Him; then it's on to the issue of religion. Unlike me, Lewis decides to do almost all of the task in the form of a single process of elimination, going through other worldviews bit by bit until Christianity is left as the only possibility. It is in this structure that the book makes its jaw-dropping fatal mistakes. The whole process of elimination, after starting off well, becomes nothing more than a progressively huger and more blatant series of false dilemmas. Where he might say that A and B are the only possible options he leaves out a very real C and D: then he may allege that 1, 2, and 3 are the only possibilities and that by eliminating 1 and 2 he has proven 3, when in fact the number of possibilities may range well into the hundreds.Like I said, at the start Lewis's argumentation is at least generally sound. He certainly makes the first few chapters a worthy read by putting forth persuasively the Argument from Morality for God's Existence and competently refuting the common rebuttals by nontheists: absolute relativism, the \\"natural/herd instinct\\" appeal, the claims of morality being purely a matter of social convention, education, or semantics. Then Lewis starts to narrow down the issue of what to believe of this higher moral lawgiver. He talks about how all of us have defied our inner moral law and thus put ourselves wrong with the Power behind it. Most of all this is, so far as I can see, free of fallacy, though even here Lewis makes some embarrassing false bifurcations: automatically equating religion with theism, nonreligion with atheism, and hard materialism with atheism. Also, I'm not sure but I don't think that part of the definition of pantheism is belief that God is beyond good and evil, although one could argue that it might entail that.Lewis next moves onto an even bigger and more egregious false dilemma. He claims that the only three possible worldviews in existence are religion (again, he uses \\"religion\\" interchangeably with \\"theism\\"), hard materialism, and the belief in that ill-defined \\"life force\\" of Creative Evolutionists. Where does Buddhism fall into these three categories? Buddhists believe in the existence of immaterial realms but not in theism and certainly not in the \\"life-force\\" of Creative Evolutionists. In which of Lewis's three categories are we to place Taoists? What about agnostics? The issue of God's existence *is* well covered, as I've said, by Lewis's presentation and defenses of the Moral Argument but the fact remains that agnosticism still doesn't fit into the religion/hard materialism/Creative Evolution trifurcation. Nor does deism, technically speaking. And there's even more where all that came from.But that false dilemma is *nothing* compared to the one that follows: \\"There are only two views that face all the facts. One is the Christian view that this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been. The other is the view called Dualism\\" (page 42).Wow.I don't think I could ever *count* how many excluded middles are left out of that! Islam is only one of maybe thousands. Technically speaking, one doesn't even have to subscribe to *any* religion at all in order to believe that this is a good world that's gone wrong yet retains the memory of what it ought to have been. Many fanatically irreligious atheists believe that at least as firmly as your average Christian. Even if you add the part about there being a universal moral lawgiver whom we have all defied, how are Islam or Judaism automatically excluded, leaving Dualism as the sole alternative left to Christianity? Did Lewis not know that we believe that too? The Christian scriptures themselves quote Old Testament texts--Judaism, in other words--to establish the doctrine: Romans 3:10-12 is citing Psalms 53:3 (and maybe also Psalms 14:3). The Koran says that morality is a sign from God (surah 30, verse 21) and that we have all violated it to the point where if God took us to task for it He would destroy all of us (surah 16, verse 61). It agrees that because of what happened in Eden the world has gone wrong yet traces of good--embellishments of this world and potential mercy from God--remain (surah 7, verses 19-32). Yet the one and only mention of our religion in the whole text of \\"Mere Christianity\\" is a little snippet on page 78 about how it is not Christianity but Islam that is a teetotal religion.Did Lewis ever even *consider* Islam? His autobiography \\"Surprised by Joy\\" is of no help. Islam isn't even brought up there either, even though it says that what got Lewis started considering, after he had changed his mind about being an atheist, whether any religions were true was when he began to wonder if any religion was a final consummation of all previous true religion. He arrived at the conclusion that there is such a religion and that it is Christianity. He gives no evidence that the subject of whether or not that religion is Islam ever even crossed his mind, even though Islam makes more of a point than any other religion in the history of the world of alleging to be such a consummation of previous religion. I've read pretty much almost every theological writing Lewis has ever written and with the exception of that incidental fleeting mention of Islam as a teetotal religion of page 78 of \\"Mere Christianity\\" the only thing about Islam from Lewis I can ever remember reading was his claim that that if you went up to Muhammad (on whom be peace) and asked him if he was Allah, \\"he would have rent his clothes and cut your head off\\". With such shameful ignorance as that perhaps it's not surprising he had little to say of my religion.And so it is with this step in Lewis's process of elimination--leaving out Islam, Judaism, and innumerable other excluded middles--that the whole thing goes awry, preventing any following steps in the process from working since they're all proceeding from this false and presumptuous premise. That's the risk you take when you're forming a process of elimination. It's like a game of Jenga: if one piece doesn't fit or is left out then everything above it comes tumbling down. As Lewis himself notes, \\"progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer\\" (page 28). This review could almost end right here. But the process of elimination isn't *quite* the only argumentation for Christianity which Lewis employs. Perhaps he continues because he himself wasn't completely confident of that absurd bifurcation. In any case he still hasn't yet arrived at his final conclusion on pages 61-62 that \\"[therefore] I have to believe that Jesus was (and is) God\\". His last few arguments focus on establishing the specific central doctrines of Christianity.If you thought that no false dilemma could top the Christianity/Dualism one, you were wrong. Throughout the home stretch Lewis's arguments for Christianity are all built, blindly, without justification or even any mention of possible disagreeing viewpoints, on the assumption that all biblical texts he uses--including all of the text of all four Gospels--are necessarily accurate. He points to this and that and the other from the Gospels, and says there, don't you see now? He poses his famous Trilemma (\\"lord, lunatic, or liar\\" etc.), which I soundly refuted at [...]. He takes it for granted that the Bible is right about God having chosen the Jews and so forth. He assumes that all the words the Gospels attributed to Jesus (on whom be peace) are accurate recordings of what he said. He does not devote one penstroke to argumentation for the accuracy or authenticity of any of the texts in question. And because of the alleged implications he finds in his biblical references Christianity must be true. In other words, he essentially tells us to believe the Bible because the Bible says to. Terms like \\"circular argumentation\\" and \\"begging the question\\" don't even *begin* to do the situation justice. Would he have been convinced if I had pointed to texts about Muhammad (on whom be peace) in the Koran as evidence that he must be God's final prophet and messenger?To be sure, there is one other argument for Christianity that Lewis makes. He says that \\"one of the reasons he believes Christianity\\" is that \\"it is a religion you could not have guessed. If it offered us just the kind of universe we had always expected I should feel we were making it up. But in fact, it is not the sort of thing anyone would have made up. It has just that queer twist about it that real things have\\" (pages 41-42). How many religions *don't* offer people something contrary to the kind of universe they had previously expected? And why can't there be nonreligious or even irreligious viewpoints which do the same thing too? *Why* isn't Christianity the sort of thing that anyone would have made up? People could make up anything. Doesn't scientology alone prove that there's nothing on earth that people might not have made up? Exactly what does \\"a queer twist\\" even mean anyway?So there you have it: this is what we get from world's seemingly most oft toted evangelistic tract. This is the best the finest Christian apologist and theologian the world has ever seen can do. Now does that prove that Christianity is untrue? Not at all. One certainly shouldn't reject a religion just because a single person, however relatively skilled at the task compared to most of his kind, failed miserably to argue persuasively for it. Nor does any of this mean that Islam *is* true. That is another subject for other articles, many of which I have already written. Not to worry: as Lewis himself remarks on page 32, \\"If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end.\\" Indeed, and you may even--God grant it--find truth. But for the reasons I've stated you certainly won't find it in \\"Mere Christianity\\"--certainly not very far into the text after the issue of God's existence has come and gone, anyway. May God bless us all and guide us to a right path."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A great book for any Christian or non-Christian. It contains some simple theology with some good analogys."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Note that this book began life as a series of radio broadcasts, and it may have been all very well for radio (if you assume that it's okay to insult the intelligence of radio listeners). But it is now a book, and ought to be judged as such.The first section is a defense of Christianity, although most of it is spent defending Mere Theism - a much weaker doctine, needless to say, but Lewis seems to think that once he has established theism most of the hard work has been done. His central argument for theism is the moral argument: the key premise is, moral claims (\\"it is wrong to steal\\") cannot be true unless there is a god. There are three kinds of objections to this premise: (1) it's mysterious how the existence of the supernatural could make moral facts true, especially if we agree with Lewis that they are necessary truths; (2) there are any number of explanations of the truth of moral claims which don't involve the existence of anything supernatural, and (3) maybe moral claims aren't true after all - an idea we may not find pleasant, but which may be true for all that. Lewis's strategy of dealing with these objections is simplicity itself. He doesn't mention them. That's not quite true. He does briefly consider two alternate explanations of moral claims, but he takes care to pick the silliest two, and then has the gall to pretend that he has exhaustively covered the territory. In fact, that's a general strategy throughout the book. Find three or four positions that are superficially similar to each other, conflate them all with the most ludicrous of the three or four, and then argue against *it* - often failing to find good opposing arguments even then.You might be wondering what arguments Lewis has in favour of Christianity itself, as opposed to Mere Theism. You would be wrong. The word is argument, singular. That's right: after a hundred bad arguments for theism, just one bad argument in favour of the divinity of Christ, a claim he takes to be absolutely central, and it's all over in two pages. It goes as follows. Jesus claimed to be the son of God. He was either lying, mad, or speaking the truth. The biblical evidence indicates he was neither lying nor mad. Therefore he was speaking the truth. Naturally, if you must read Lewis's treatment of this subject, don't expect him to answer obvious objections, or indeed to go into much more depth than I just have.The later chapters are better but still bad. You'll just have to take my word for it since I lack the space and time to mention every single glaring fallacy. But please, please realise that this is by far Lewis's worst book. He usually has better ideas and his writing style is not usually so hectoring. Some of his fiction is superb. Please, please, read something else instead."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I'd read on a website about an atheist who'd converted to Christianity after reading this book, and C.S. Lewis tells readers that he was once an atheist himself. Since I'd love to believe that some Big Grand-Daddy in the Sky is going to make atrocities like George W.'s presidency all right in the end, I gave it a shot. I really did go into it with an open mind, but I was sorely disappointed.In essence, C.S. Lewis's argument is that since humans know right from wrong, we must be getting that notion from somewhere; hence, there must be a god who gives it to us. He dismisses the idea that right and wrong could be hardwired into the human brain by millions of years of evolution by saying the following: You cannot claim that the sense of right and wrong is instinctive because (a) we can have competing instincts, and (b) we often choose to morally follow the weaker of the competing instincts. He gives the example of the instinct to save a drowning man and claims that most people would experience two instincts in that situation--to wit, one to save the man and one to not put oneself in danger--and that the moral man would choose to act on the weaker of the instincts in order to save the man. According to C.S. Lewis, the decision-making that allows us to govern between instincts to choose the moral or immoral course of action comes from god.In a matter of a few minutes, C.S. Lewis dismisses--erroneously, I believe--the idea that morality is a complex biological process whereby the mind sorts through various drives, with the executive decision-making process itself a biological function (which can be impaired or highly functional across individuals). This materialistic view is increasingly supported by scientific research on the brain that was simply unavailable in C.S. Lewis' day. Hence, \\"Mere Christianity\\" is not a very timely or sophisticated piece of writing, since its entire argument rests on the premise that knowledge of right and wrong demands acknowledgement of a god.Atheists and agnostics who want a true challenge to their inclinations must look elsewhere. Likewise, people who are of another religion and considering Christianity ought to look elsewhere. The other major world religions are dismissed even more quickly than C.S. Lewis dismisses moral materialism. People who are already Christians will enjoy not being challenged to think critically, as well as some of C.S. Lewis' less mainstream views on repentance, becoming born again, etc."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book seems to be extremely popular in Christian circles, and it's easy to see why, since it makes a pseudo-intellectual defense of the faith that must be appealing to believers who want to read something to strengthen their faith. But if you really examine it, it is extremely flawed. I could write an essay on the flawed reasoning and false conclusions in \\"Mere Christianity\\", but I'll just mention a few.First, Lewis concludes that morality must come from something other than man himself. For this to be true you must assume that men needs to be told what is right and wrong. In reality, the moral rules exist because they are convenient and if you break them - by for example stealing or murdering - it's wrong, not because God says so, but because it's disruptive for society and therefore ultimately for yourself, because you're making the world a worse place to live.After establishing, by the previous false reasoning, that there must be a force higher than mankind, he somehow concludes that it must be the Christian God. It's a bit unclear how he reached that conclusion, but it was something about Christianity being too complex to have been made up by men, which is a rather strange and very weak argument. He also says that since Jesus Christ says he would forgive all sins, to make such a claim he must either be a madman or be God, and decides that therefore he must be God because otherwise he would be \\"a lunatic on the level of the man who says he's a poached egg\\" and \\"a devil of hell\\". Again, completely flawed reasoning. Jesus is assumed to be God simply because he says he is. But so have many others throughout history.He also makes oversimplified assumptions about why people are atheists, and claims that there can be no happiness without religion.\\"Mere Christianity\\" offers no great wisdom. It does offer insight to a believer's mindset and reasoning and is slightly interesting in that regard. But overall, it is a badly thought out piece of deluded philosophy and a very boring read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"GREAT book! Arrived quick and in perfect condition. Some of my favorite works by this author."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Those that read his several works contained in this book will appreciate his straightword and understandable writing.

Originally published more than 60 years ago during World War II, Mere Christianity remains relevant on every level today. C.S.

This is a book that should be read and re-read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you have any questions to the way life is a certain way, or just want to expand your mind and let new things in, this is the book.

EXCELLENT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Christianity is a journey of discovery and growth... Lewis, a one-time-atheist, has written incredible stories and teaching works that have inspired Christians and surprised everyone else for the better part of the last century. His way of bringing to light the answers to questions you have, and expounding on questions you might not have thought of yet will help anyone on their way to understanding powerful truths in life. Reading C S Lewis has shaped my understanding of my own faith in a way i could not have conceived. he does not present new and controversial ideas, or formulas... he merely helps to understand age old issues that affect us all.This book is a well put together collection of some of his greatest apologetic works that prove and illuminate the Christian Faith. If you don't have it, get it! Then, go out and get his other works, like The Cosmic Trilogy, or The Chronicle of Narnia. Lewis infuses his powerful ideas into these as well, and tells brilliantly woven stories that enthrall our imaginations and inspire our hearts.

Although it is not \\"complete\\" by any means, it does help to present his world view from several different angles. Each work is short and easy to read. Wrestling with the issues personally is the real challenge in Lewis' literature. He uses lots of concrete earthly examples of the spiritual concepts and themes presented. Delicious food for thought to anyone who enjoys exploring spiritual relms."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity contains extremely well-written and solid defenses of four of the basic doctrines of Christianity: (1) That an objective standard of right and wrong really exists, and its origin is God; (2) that every human except Jesus has violated that standard; (3) that the man Jesus was, shockingly, God in flesh; and (4) that Christ's death has made it possible for us to have a right relationship with God. Mere Christianity also contains an excellent general description of basic Christian living and morality, as well as a very readable and compelling explanation of the Trinity (the \\"super-personal\\" God) in the last section of the book, \\"Beyond Personality.\\"Lewis's defense of Christianity, though not logically airtight, is utterly reasonable, a breath of fresh air in its abundance of uncommon sense. This book has enough persuasive force to persuade unbelievers to faith (I know from personal experience), and it also can solidify the faith of Christians who do not understand Christianity as well as they would like.Atheists and agnostics ignore or dismiss this book at their peril. Those looking for absolute certainty will indeed be disappointed by the arguments in this book, but then such logical idiots would be disappointed by just about any argument. There are indeed gaps in Mr. Lewis's logic, but where his syllogisms end his penetrating insights into reality usually carry his arguments the rest of the way. Mr. Lewis's defense of morality, for example, is not immune to logical assault, but he does give plenty of sensible reasons to believe in moral realism over its alternative, moral relativism.Additionally, it is worth noting, as some others have, that Mere Christianity is not, and was not intended to be, a philosophical or theological monograph. Instead, Mere Christianity is a lightly-edited compilation of a series of BBC broadcast talks. Given the time constraints that a BBC broadcast imposes, it would be unfair to pan the book for its lack of depth in addressing some points. Incidentally, those looking for more depth on certain points can find it in other Lewis books and essays. Precisely because of its breadth and brevity, however, Mere Christianity is as good an introduction to C. S. Lewis's work as one can find.In sum, Mere Christianity admirably meets its objectives: to defend and explain Christianity for a general audience. And Mr. Lewis' tone -- conversational, congenial, and, most importantly, humble -- makes this book simply delightful to read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis gives the best explaination of morality I've ever read in the first few chapters. At the end of the book he also gives an awesome explaination of the Trinity. The chapter entitled &quot;The Great Sin,&quot; which focuses on the vice of pride, is one of the best chapters in the history of Christian literature. I think this book is a great read for a Christian or for someone who just wants to know what Christianity is all about."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is an absolute delight - particularly in an era where (at least here in the states) we have a dearth of intelligent discussion on religion.I particularly enjoyed Lewis' insightful and clever use of real-world analogies to illustrate christian theological concepts - it not only made his points easier to grasp but made reading the book far more enjoyable then it might otherwise have been. And his calm, clear, level-headed mode of presentation is SUCH a contrast to current screeds on the topic, particularly those coming from the politically motivated far right wing people who have hijacked the term &quot;christian&quot; - as well as from the equally intellectually-challenged atheistic groups.Right-wingers have done severe damage to Christianity in the United States over the last 20 years or so. As a result of their overtly political behavior they have alienated and driven away many, many people who might otherwise have been attracted to the teachings of Jesus. Many people would probably never dream of picking up a book entitled &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; as a result. However, I encourage anyone with an interest in spirituality, ethics, and/or religion to read this book - it will give you a good picture of what &quot;Real Christianity&quot; is all about."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"For the last week I have been like a little child waiting for a birthday present to come in the mail. I have joyfully anticipated receiving this boxed set of C.S. Lewis treasures. At last, it came today. What a disappointment! If the covers of these books last through more than one reading, I will be surprised. The covers are beautiful, but the quality is poor, and certainly not worth the $47.90 I paid for this set. I was looking forward to something that would last for years to come. Oh well, I won't be sending the set back, because I'm anxious to read these incredible works (the first books I will have read in several years). If this review was about C.S. Lewis, it would be five stars. But, this review is about the shoddy quality of this set, and hence the single star review. Buyer beware."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Originally a series of talks given over the radio to the people of England during WWII, this collection of said dialogue explains in laymen's terms what Christianity is and why C.S. Lewis, originally a non-believer, eventually came to Christ. It does not give his personal story, mind you, but rather is a mixture of philosophical lectures and entertaining anecdotes as to why Christianity is a valid belief.Beware, this is not a light reading romp. I found myself concentrating diligently to follow his ideas and contemplations. In the end, I thought he did a superb job of explaining why he believes what he believes, and why everyone else should as well. Never does he take a condescending tone, and always he appeals to the heart as well as the intellect.C.S. Lewis has long been considered one of the most highly respected Christian writers of the last few centuries and I'd have to agree. However, I have a great deal of trouble believing the \\"common man\\" followed his talks on an intellectual level during the time period it originated, but perhaps I'm looking at that from a 2005 perspective. Perhaps people were more willing to listen to complicated lectures than they are now.If you are a Christian in need of a contemporary refresher on your beliefs, or if you are a non-Christian wanting to know what Christianity is all about without the usual stories and Scripture, then I highly recommend this book. Put your thinking caps on though, ladies and gentlemen, this one requires intense focus.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis is a masterful portrayl of an aspect of Christianity not normally explored. Lewis uses his analytical and logical mindset to discuss simply the facts, and in doing so strengthens his argument that, although no one can truly prove what the after life has in store for us, Christianity is the most logical. By relying only on what we know, and many times stressing he is but a layman with a keen sense for what \\"makes sense\\", Lewis covers every knook and cranney of an argument, many times stating his oponents views, and diminishing them with such ease and logic that it becomes difficult for the reader to disagree. Christian or not, apreciation for this novel should be granted to Lewis, if nothing else for his anological comparisons which simply stated are amazing. With analogies that seem to bring every aspect of his argument into a simple comparison or mental picture, Lewis succeeds in explaining one of the most controversial and complicated subjects known to man. What is interesting however is not that he succeeds, but how he succeeds. He does not overload his audience with useless information or come off as feeling superior in any way, he allows his reader, step by step, logic to logic, to follow him on the only possible solution to the problem. For this Lewis indeeds deserves reverance becauses he refuses to attack his oponents views lilke many speakers of his time and instead focuses on proving what he believes is the truth. With the truth backing Lewis how can he be wrong? I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a masterful work of logic, or better yet someone unsure of their faith. Read this work with an open mind and open heart and little will be left to question, or better yet, little left worth questioning.-Chase Brumfield"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This collection is excellent. C.S. Lewis is one of the greatest Christian thinkers of the 20th century and it shows through in his writing. Having all of his key works together in one volume is nice when studying Lewis' views on Christianity and society. It makes for easy comparison. The volume is also nicely bound with a marker. For anyone wishing to explore Christian thought I would highly recommend this collection."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As a mature, lapsed Catholic with over 40 hours of philosophy and theology at a Catholic University, I found the intellectual explanation of Christ to be brain popping. I could not put the book down. I had for all of my life found religion in general and Christianity in particular to be so much fluff, mysticism and legend. Lewis makes it simple but demonstrates the rational and intelligent conclusion that Christ and the reality of the human individual soul must be true and that their lack would be nonsensical. The Great Sin of Pride is revealed for what it is. I found nothing scary about the prospect of Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"At the time that I am writing this review there are 361 other reviews already posted for this book. Obviously a lot has been said, and instead of writing a lengthy review discussing why I liked this book (a topic which I will shortly cover at the end), I am going to focus on answering what I perceive to be incorrect views about the book. In particular, I'd like to address the following groups of thought: those who think this book is good theology, those who think it is bad theology, and those who think it is just plain bad logic.The thing that the first two groups have in common is that they both read this book as a work of theology. And on some level this book is theology; I suppose no book can be without theology insofar as it is impossible to talk about anything without implicitly making statements about God. To be sure, this book deals with a lot of material that we can probably all agree is clearly of a theological nature. However, the point I want to make to the first two groups of thought is that Lewis himself acknowledges that he is not a theologian, and that his work here should not be taken as a book attempting to answer the more difficult and deep theological problems. He is concerned, as he notes in the preface, with the basic points that all Christians tend to agree upon.I go to such length about this topic because when people then go on to read this book in a theological way they make errors in understanding what Lewis is and is not saying. For example, on page 48 Lewis writes, \\"The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they must be free.\\" Now, it is possible to read (as some have, in fact some I know personally have) these words as being in full-fledged support of free will and/or a repudiation of predestination. But to read Lewis as saying either of those things would be a mistake, a mistake he warned us not to make when he said in the preface that he is not interested in discussing high theology. Another section that people seem to get snagged on is on page 141 when Lewis writes about \\"drifting away\\".So if we're not to draw conclusions about what Lewis is talking about when he writes about \\"free will\\" and \\"drifting away\\", how are we to read this book. Lewis himself gives us some guidance in the preface, but suffice it to say that we should not attempt to nail Lewis down on one side of these issues or another. For all Christians, Lewis claims, accept that there is something called \\"free will\\" and something called \\"God's sovereignty\\"; and then again that there is something called \\"drifting away\\" and something called \\"God's strength\\". The point here is that in some mysterious way these seemingly exclusionary things all exist in reality.To finish this point, perhaps one more example will be helpful. Let's reduce what Lewis is saying about \\"free will\\" and \\"God's sovereignty\\" to the statement: \\"We glorify God when we choose to follow him\\". It simply is not possible from this statement to say the Lewis believes that we have complete free will to choose God or not. And answering that question is not important to Lewis. What is important is the end result; that God is glorified when we follow him. The same pattern of Lewis focusing on a more basic issue can be seen in the \\"drifting away\\" example... the point isn't whether or not a Christian can lose his/her faith, but rather that strengthening faith and obedience requires practice and effort.Enough with the problem of erroneously reading theological points into this book. I'd like to address one last group, which is those that say, \\"Lewis did not prove Christianity, so this book is worthless.\\" Again, close reading would help prevent people from making such statements, since Lewis writes (I can't remember where, but I think in the preface) that no religion can be proved or disproved. Again, Lewis' point isn't to prove that Christianity is the truth. Rather, he wants to point out to people that, in his opinion, Christianity is the religion/philosophy that is most logically sound. Now I suppose people who disagree with Lewis can be upset with him for basically calling them illogical or without common sense. But when people criticize him for not \\"proving Christianity\\" they are simply putting words in his mouth and then turning around and attacking him for those words.I've tried very hard to point out where I think some people have gone wrong in their understanding of this book, and I hope that I've been able to do so respectively. I think this is a great book, especially for those who are thinking about what they believe or are in the very beginning stages of their Christian walk. Lewis is a great writer, and I often found myself laughing or, conversely, (almost) crying. He has great insight into the human condition and the human mind. If you take this book for what it is (an apology of Christianity on a basic level) I think that most people will enjoy what Lewis has to say."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is one of Lewis's most famous and oft-quoted works, and for good reason. It is an honest and intelligent - not to mention brilliantly written - examination of the many facets of the Christian faith and human nature: the existence of and belief in God, the Trinity, faith, love, pride, morality etc. Although written during World War Two, the subjects explored still resonate powerfully with contemporary concerns.I found the opening chapters particularly helpful in presenting a well-argued case for the rational foundations of Christianity, or at least belief in the existence of God. It offers a challenge to Christians to question the intellectual grounds for their faith, and the reassurance that sufficient answers can be found. Non-Christians looking to investigate the rational basis of Christianity, or of religion in general, will also find this an accessible and thought-provoking read.The book is also an ideal place to start for anyone thinking to dip into the non-fiction works of C. S. Lewis. No book in my opinion gives the reader a better first taste of the prolific author's delicious prose, keen intellect and razor-sharp wit.I cannot recommend this book more. For the Christian, for the non-Christian, and for the fan of \`good books': this is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"God works in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform. Anyone who really wants to know the truth about God will receive answers, let me testify. This book by C.S. Lewis, helps illuminate the meaning of the Biblical invitation: &quot;Ask and it shall be given, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door will be opened.&quot; I have always been curious about philosophical and spiritual questions, and I probably will be as long as I have a limited human mind (my master's degree from Stanford in philosophy only more strongly convinced me, as was true of Socrates, that mere humans will never understand all of reality through reason alone, and wise men always acknowledge their ignorance). Nevertheless, this book answered so many questions, clarified so many concepts, and has had life changing consequences for me, because Lewis did make Christianity so clear. The first chapter alone is worth the neglible purchase price of the book: &quot;Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of Life.&quot; About those mysterious ways--this book was listed as one of the top books of the century by National Review, and I had marked it on my list as a book I wanted to read. A few days later, on a visit to far away relatives over the holidays, it happened to be on their bookshelf. So I started reading it, and couldn't put it down. C.S. Lewis is an amazingly engaging author, with the ability to use metaphors and analogies to illustrate difficult concepts. The result is that the reader is able to grasp certain principles that are not easily contained in words. Jesus used parables, stories and analogies to explain the kingdom of God. C.S. Lewis, I believe through God's grace, does the same, with modern examples. I am looking forward to reading &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; (about education), and other works by Lewis. Since reading Lewis, I have begun studying the Bible every day, and have gained new insights, wisdom and strenth from it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Having read Mere Christianity several times and then having read the BAD reviews on it I found the &quot;one star crowd&quot; to be a particularly bitter bunch, ignoring the weightier concepts and ignoring the whole scope of the book. Mr Lewis's life and work was a singular effort in defense of the faith (after his conversion) and anyone who sees a 200 odd page compilation of many of these insights as superficial is correct in only the most superficial way. It would take a book that was a decade in the making and more than an armful to exhaustively compile all the arguments and counter-arguments for and against the christian faith and Lewis gives a lively and accurate synopsis of the whole of apologetics. This is very readable stuff in a progressive manner that basically takes you from the starting point of believing that we exist, through the existance of moral law, a moral law-giver, a self revealing moral lawgiver, and finally arriving at a wise immortal man on a cross. The final sections of the book basically saw what we can think and know about reality basd on this situation and how we should then live. A wonderful book that a christian's heart will take as spiritual steak and potatoes and unbelivers will reel at as they begin to see the reasonableness of the God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"There is very little to be written about Lewis' brilliance that has not already been said. He is truly a consumate writer - brilliant, understandable, witty, and humane. Even if you disagree with him, which he makes difficult to do, it is impossible to not respect his intelligence. Each of his works in this handsome volume make that very clear, and all are worth reading.My only quibble with this edition (and hence my 4 star rating of otherwise 5 star material) is the appearance of several small mistakes that should have been corrected by editors. A line of text is missing in \\"Mere Christianity;\\" there are a few other small mistypings or misspellings elsewhere as well that are not present in non-collected individual publications of Lewis' work.That said, the overall presentation is handsome, if large, and even with the failings of its editors, this is surely a volume that deserves to be owned and read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is a revised and enlarged edition of the three books produced from C.S. Lewis's radio broadcasts in England during World War II: The Case for Christianity, Christian Behaviour, and Beyond Personality. Here is the outline for Mere Christianity:Book I. RIGHT AND WRONG AS A CLUE TO THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE. 1.) The Law of Human Nature (Where Lewis begins by saying, &quot;Every one has heard people quarrelling,&quot; then goes on to talk about the moral law people appeal to when they argue.) 2.) Some Objections 3.)The Reality of the Law 4.) What Lies Behind the Law 5.) We Have Cause to Be UneasyBook II. WHAT CHRISTIANS BELIEVE 1.) The Rival Conceptions of God 2.) The Invasion 3.) The Shocking Alternative (where Lewis presents his claims that Jesus of Nazareth was either God incarnate, a liar, or a lunatic, but not merely a good moral teacher.) 4.) The Perfect Penitent 5.) The Practical ConclusionBook III. CHRISTIAN BEHAVIOUR 1.) The Three Parts of Morality 2.) The &quot;Cardinal Virtues&quot; (Lewis discusses Prudence, Temperance, Justice, and Fortitude) 3.) Social Morality 4.) Morality and Psychoanalysis 5.) Sexual Morality 6.) Christian Marriage 7.) Forgiveness 8.) The Great Sin (pride) 9.) Charity 10.) Hope 11.) Faith 12.) FaithBook IV. BEYOND PERSONALITY: OR FIRST STEPS IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY 1.) Making and Begetting 2.) The Three-Personal God 3.) Time and Beyond Time 4.) Good Infection 5a.) The Obstinate Toy Soldiers 6.) Two Notes 7.) Let's Pretend 8.) Is Christianity Hard or Easy? 9.) Counting the Cost 10.) Nice People or New Men 11.) The New MenIn his preface, Lewis wrote, &quot;The reader should be warned that I offer no help to anyone who is hesitating between two Christian &quot;denominations.&quot; You will not learn from me whether you ought to become an Anglican, a Methodist, a Presbyterian, or a Roman Catholic. . . Ever since I became a Christian I have thought that the best, perhaps! the only, service I could do for my unbelieving neighbours was to explain and defend the belief that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times.&quot; This was Lewis's purpose in creating this book, to discuss what Baxter called &quot;mere&quot; Christianity, or the bare essentials that should be common to all Christians. In a book that is less than 200 pages long, it is amazing that Lewis was able to accomplish such a task. Regardless of whether you are already a Christian, or someone who is interested only in what it is that Christians believe, this concise book explains the basics in an engaging fashion."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The Signature Classics appeal to the rational mind the way the Narnia Series appeals to the imagination. For many Christians who grew up in the faith, trying to converse with non-believers is like trying to describe colors to a blind person. C.S. Lewis helps both believers and non-believers understand the Rationality of Faith. Having these works collected in a single volume is quite a treasure and belongs on the bookself (or in the hands) of every Christian.So far the only two complaints I have with this edition are quite minor. The first is the size of the volume. I would have preferred the publishers had added more pages and decreased the highth and depth to make it more easily fit with other books when resting on the shelf between readings. The second is that they (very nicely) provided a ribbon book mark but THREE would have been even nicer. Many of these writings are very dense and need to be consumed (or re-consumed) in small increments. Switching from one to another allows the mind to digest the material before continuing, and having several bookmarks is almost a necessity.These problems are minor, however. I can not overstate how much I enjoy having this book in my home. Over and over again as I read through this book I find myself astounded with Lewis' insight and clarity. This is definitely a book to buy, to keep, and to read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Originally a series of radio broadcasts that were transcribed into book form with the author's help, C. S. Lewis' witty and systematically logical defense of Christianity still endures as a favorite today. Although intellectual works of this caliber can seem intimidating, his conversational style of communication makes the book approachable and thoroughly enjoyable. He not only addresses the common sense of Christianity, but also thoughtfully doesn't neglect the practical need, the heartfelt void, that Christ alone can fill. All in all, this book is an all-around, solid work that consistently covers all the bases of thought and makes for a great read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The Screwtape Letters by C. S. Lewis is a classic piece of American Literature. This fiction piece chronicles the conversations between Screwtape, a powerful official in hell, second only to the devil himself, and Wormwood, a devil in-training assigned to convert a human to \\"Our Father Below.\\" He uses many tactics to try and turn his patient away from \\"the enemy.\\"(God) The whole book is written in the form of letters from Screwtape to Wormwood, discussing and analyzing his work on his patient. Lewis uses many similes and metaphors in his book to convey analogies about human spiritual structure and about God. His theme throughout the novel is about human temptation and the battle being waged between good and evil.The Screwtape Letters provided a great insight to the battle between good and evil. The whole idea of a book from the devil's point of view is fascinating. This book has made me review my Christianity of and show a deeper commitment to my faith. Screwtape Letters is a deep and thought-provoking book. I thought the most intriguing part of the book was Screwtape's idea that the best way to \\"win a man's soul\\" to the devil was to make him indifferent about good and evil; to make him feel that he's a \\"pretty good\\" Christian so he doesn't have to strive to become better.This magnificent book about what goes on \\"Down below\\" brings a deep sense of spirituality to anyone who reads it. By knowing the enemies tactics, it helps us all to become better Christians. The book is a classic, and it will be around for a very long time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Judging from earlier reviews, you'll either love this one or you'll hate it. A quick scan of the ratings reveals that Christians love it while agnostics and atheists pan it. From 129 ratings out there, only four readers provided on-the-fence &quot;3 star&quot; reviews. By joining this lonely (objective?) crowd, I'm hoping to convince myself that writing review number 130 is not purely an exercise in conceit but can provide a different perspective on the work.First, let's recognize that this book is really a combination of three prior, separate essays comprising two distinct topics. These topics are an apologetic of the Christian faith and a high-level review of fundamental Christian beliefs held across denominations. Those who offer blanket criticism appear to miss this distinction and view the entire work as an apologetic. In my view, these distinct components differ sharply in intent and quality and therefore deserve separate reviews.As to the common threads throughout the work, they are largely positive. Readers of other Lewis works will be familiar with his wonderful ability to write in clear, concise, conversational prose and these gifts are on display throughout the book. His capacity for using metaphors and analogies if rightfully renowned and is particularly helpful in explaining complex beliefs and doctrine.Unfortunately, the pure apologetic section of the work falls far short of it's target of providing a rational justification for the faith. Lewis attempts to structure logical deductive and inductive reasoning arguments to support his conclusion that there is a single God and that Jesus was his only Son. Surprisingly for one of Lewis' obvious intellect, his logic if rife with serious flaws. Two quick examples are symptomatic. First, Lewis states that &quot;Reality is something you could not have guessed. This is one of the reason's I believe in Christianity. It is a religion you could not have guessed.&quot; What he means is that the world is complex and therefore a religion that accurately explains the world must be complex. Thus, because Christianity is complex, it accurately explains the world. This logic leaves seekers of religion free to accept any &quot;complicated&quot; belief system (in fact, the more complicated the better). Second, Lewis argues that Jesus must be the Son of God because the Bible makes it clear that he was &quot;neither a lunatic nor a fiend&quot; and that he must be either a lunatic/fiend or the Son of God. In addition to several deductive logic holes, the argument faces an obvious circularity problem (i.e. one believes what the New Testament says because Jesus is the Son of God and one believes He is the Son of God because of the Bible's description of his life). These and other similar examples of poor logic lead me to give a &quot;2 star&quot; rating to this section of the work.For all the issues with Lewis' apologetic efforts, his attempt to provide an easily understandable, concise summary of the major cross-denominational Christian beliefs is outstanding. One can take issue with the lack of depth and breadth of coverage, but only if one does not clearly understand Lewis' objectives. His discussion of the cardinal virtues, the sin of pride and the trinity are among the most clearly articulated explanations I have seen. While the passage of time has exposed several of his points (e.g. the Christian wife's obligation to &quot;obey&quot; her husband) as no longer falling within the common Christian belief set, on the whole he clearly succeeds in his goals. Thus, I give a &quot;4 star&quot; rating to this section of the work.The 2 and 4 stars equate to an overall 3 star rating. C.S. Lewis fans should read the book for an interesting perspective on his personal beliefs. Those looking for a clear explanation of those common beliefs that Christians hold dear would get great value from the work. Those looking for a compelling, rational defense of the faith would be better served looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Although Lewis was a skeptic for much of his life, he was smart enough to consider the possibility that he might be wrong about his nonbelief in God (for the first half of his life, anyway). Mere Christianity is a compilation of the reasons why he converted. It should be pointed out that this book will not prove Christianity to be true. Trusting in Christ is still a faith issue. However, the evidence presented by Lewis is strong enough to get even the most ardent skeptic to think through the philosophical arguments used to bolster the case Christianity.This book is good for a number of reasons. I appreciate Lewis' candor and frankness as he supports the truth of Christianity. It has been instrumental in the conversions of many people, even those who are very prominent in the Christian scene today. (I think it is wonderful how much more popular Lewis is today than when he was alive!) Indeed, his writing has touched a great number of people, including me. In fact, I've read all of his nonfictional works, and I find it fascinating to track with Lewis' reasoning and argumentation. As you can see, this book has my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is the foremost work of the premiere Christian apologist, C. S. Lewis. It presents, in a very readable and entertaining fashion, the fundamentals on which the Christian faith is based. Whatever your background, and conclusions on reading it, you will come away with an appreciation of the strength of the philosophic underpinnings that has caused this religious movement to grow and thrive for nearly 2000 years, and a recognition that it is a world view that should be considered seriously."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I love C.S. Lewis. His writings always amaze and teach me new ways of understanding and looking at something. This is one of his greatest works. This book is very deep so is sometimes difficult to comprehend if reading quickly. It is a book that must be read slowly, allowing lots of time to think, reflect, and process the thoughts of C.S. Lewis. I highly recommend Mere Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis was a requested Christmas gift by a college-aged granddaughter. Having read the book years before, I knew it would be a good choice for her as well. I was pleased to find the Gift Edition because it includes pictures and narrative that set the historical stage for the original articles. I believe she will find this adds to her understanding and enjoyment of the book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis has a way with words that no one else does. I recommend anything written by C.S. Lewis. You will be richly rewarded for reading Mere Christiantly!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I think that in 1000 years, Lewis will be viewed as one on the great Christian thinkers, up there with Aquinas, Anselm, Barth, etc. Of his works, the ones in this volume are the ones he is best know for and the ones that are his best.The binding on the book is strong, but the edges of the pages are rough cut (probably there is a technical term for this), which makes it seem to not be well bound."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book was so wonderful that I purchased one ...looked at it...and then ordered yet another for our pastor! There are so many quotes and Christian perspectives in C.S. Lewis's writings! This holds all the stories that I wanted! I LOVED IT! IT was much larger than I thought it would be; the quality of the binding / cover was gorgeous and it was a gift I was glad I had purchased. Thinking of ordering yet another for myself!! You can't go wrong with this book if you like C.S. Lewis!!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"My son requested a set of of the C.S. Lewis classics.

I consider &#34;Mere Christianity&#34; his best."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have had this writer and several of these books on my 'to read' list for decades. A health issue, which was misdiagnosed, made reading nearly impossible for the last twenty five years, though life has it's own way of taking up time in any case. I didn't know if these were novels, theological texts, apologetic tomes, or... just what to expect. The first book I read was Screwtape Letters. What a kick. My first book in 25 years, and a great one.Having converted to Catholicism, I did have some wonder about that. No, I am secure enough not to have been sidetracked or such, I just wasn't sure... if I would be... having to revisit too many old notions. That turned out not to be the case, and from what I have read, I would have no problems suggesting these to any Christian. Some things are simply... without origin, to a degree, and common to all. Actually, I would recommend these to all, save recalcitrants who might... learn somethings I would rather they not learn. :p"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I am grate for this beautiful edition of this classic.

Lewis has a unique way of stating things that makethem very interesting and easy to read and understand. I think this is my favorite of his books that I've read so far. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone old enough to read and comprehend it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis had a gift for making the complex understandable. This book will help get an undecided Christian closer to Christianity and will give a Christian enough information to defend the faith, if nothing more than to one self. Mr. Lewis does not make an argument for a particular form of Christianity, although he belonged to the Church of England. J. R. R. Tolkien, a devout Catholic, is said to be largely responsible for his conversion to Christianity.Because he came from an atheist viewpoint and because he was an intellectually gifted man, you can really sense that Mr. Lewis spend a lot of time reasoning his Christian beliefs and has made these conclusions available for us in this gem of a book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"What an astounding, impressive, fulfilling read. I am not normally a non-fiction reader unless it is a good historical piece or biography ... those I will lap up. But a book on religion? As a pretty dedicated church goer myself, I must candidly say that unless the book is actual scripture itself, it might as well be one of those desperately snobbish self-help books full of zippy motivation quotes and the same principles you find in all other books of the same genre, just worded slightly differently. Yet in Mere Christianity, I found none of the superficiality I've previously experienced with other books that delve into philosophic explorations of religion. This is a real study, a deep probe. There is nothing artificial about it. Thank goodness my wife is a huge C.S. Lewis fan or I might not have picked it up at all. But she recommended it to me, and I had it on a trip, and for hours and hours I read, mesmerized in a way that few thrillers can even achieve. What did I find? I found that in this work C.S. Lewis single-handedly legitimizes religion as a belief, lifestyle, and philosophy. And what makes Lewis most credible is that Mere Christianity is not designed to make any reader comfortable, from agnostic to new age believer to hard core Christian. His ideas and reasoning are solid and unavoidable. His ability to address concerns is acute and thorough. He is not pompous, but he is confident. Where he is unsure of something, he admits it, though I'd be careful to deviate from such a sound philosopher. Probably his greatest talent is his use of applicable examples and parallel images. Where a concept is vague, he has the ability to nail it down, to apply it to the known. C.S. Lewis rings of truth throughout. And probably the most important thing in his book, or in any book for that matter, is that when I put it down, I was determined to be a better person, to fix up deficiencies in my life. Mere Christianity is not \\"merely\\" another book on religion or Sunday School manual; it is a call to arms for every person who picks it up, regardless of their faith. Go to it with an open mind, and be prepared to act afterwards."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"\\"Mere Christianity\\" is an excellent defense of Christianity for the average Joe. More than a few scholars of religion and theology will be disappointed in C.S. Lewis' simplistic analogies, explanations and theory (though readers of all ages will love them). His attack of the notion that Christ was not more than a great moral teacher is top-notch and memorable. Post-feminist readings of the chapters on marriage and sexuality will surely produce numerous critiques, but Lewis anticipates and effectively knocks down most of their contentions by explaining that Christianity was never meant to be popular or easy because it was not invented for quick, mass acceptance--it is what it is, not what every generation would have it. Popular fashions come and go, God is eternal.Lewis is unafraid to tell the reader what he cannot know, either because of personal limitations or those of man in general. Still, this rarely softens the cogency of his larger points. His prose is a model for writers everywhere. I whole-heartedly recommend \\"Mere Christianity\\" for believers, skeptics and everything in between."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is beautiful. I would guess that most people reading this are allready familiar with the quality of C.S. Lewis' writings and are would like to know what the actual book looks like. It's nice. It's about the size of a textbook, with a cover that has some sort of fabric over it and a silver ribbon attached for marking your page."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This collection of C.S. Lewis' works on religion gives me his hard-to-find works and an easy place to find the more popular ones. Lewis is unsurpassed in clarity of thought on being a real Christian - worth going back to in a reference like this."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is a gifted writer and noted scholar. His books are enjoyed by readers of all ages, and \\"Mere Christianity\\" is one of his most popular works.The argument he presents in \\"Mere Christianity\\" is not new. Throughout history, scholars have posited these same ideas, and Lewis is merely joining their ranks.What makes this book standout and the author loved by so many is the honesty and humility that Lewis wraps the apologetic. He lets readers know a little bit about his journey to becoming a Christian. He reveals some of his thoughts, concerns, and struggles: as a Christian and from his days as an atheist.Other authors do an excellent job defending the Christian faith, but \\"Mere Christianity\\" is a must read. It's something everyone should have his or her library."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is very nice to have. It's got CS's classics, that I've always enjoyed reading, and now can just flip to them through out the book instead of having a half dozen books around.It's a large book (normal paper size 8x11) and looks very eligant. I've given as gifts on a few occasions."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is one of C.S. Lewis' crowning achievements.

If you are not watchful, he can trick you to a dreadful thing. It is all fine if god wished to create a world full of freewill beings rather than automatas.

Lewis in hisself-aggrandizing book, Mere Christianity? No, silly, not murder, child molestation, starting wars, or rape. It's PRIDE. Oh yes, and here is another chunk of wisdom for those who find deep meaning in blather: \\"Thinking about doing something is the same as doing it.\\" (Don't let those thinking about hurting you find this out.) Frankly, I'd rather someone think about molesting my kid than actually doing it. Plus, C.S. Lewis tells us that soldiers should kill for their country with a lightness of heart. Plus, we should love everyone the same--spouse, kids, god, mailmen, assassins, C.S. Lewis, Darwin, etc. C.S. Lewis offers nuggets of so-called truths without providing a smattering of evidence in support of his supernatural notions. You know, god, soul, virgin births, evil, hell, etc.--all the good stuff that keeps you blindly faithful while giving the logic cells in your brain a rest. Are you tired of trying to convince yourself that your pastor speaks the truth? Let this book convince you the way no amount of evidence can. If you prefer actual truth, try Carl Sagan's more contemporary work, The Demon Haunted World, or pull up the short essay by Richard Dawkins called Good and Bad Reasons for Believing. Leave this book to the astrology crowd and those who think aliens visit earth to make goofy designs in cornfields; if truth is your passion, science is your source.It evolves. If you like to believe stuff based on conjecture, testimony, anecdote, fear of reprisal, and because it just makes you feel good, check out the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, anything by Shirley McLaine; try dianetics, the Torah, assorted versions of the old and new testament; don't forget the book of Mormon, and Reverend Moon has some persuasive nuggets too. I'm sure there are lots of prophets, gods, and gurus who would gladly tell you just exactly what it all means."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It is better if one does not begin the argument if he cannot to the core.

The problem with highly intelligent people, like C.S Lewis, is this: they do not know how to communicate their ideas in plain language so that \\"plain\\" people can understand what they're saying. I call that ignorance.These books are mostly filled with highfalutin, pompous, non-sensical drivel.Unless you are highly intelligent don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"i never received that book even though my cc was charged. it might have been sent in august but i wonder if they are still printing the book for me?? and walking it to maryland.i do not recommedn this source and had i known this would happen i never would have used amazon.com"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I'm sorry but Mr.Lewis' writing struck me as pedantic and boring. I was initially interested in his works because of my readings in grief literature. I couldn't get into any of his stories. They seemed dry to me.

I am glad he is well read but personally I am just not into his books."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"i could only read half an hour of this critically aclaimed outline. its too wordy/complicated for even the very seasoned christian."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book after a friend of mine who is Christian suggested that reading it might give me a better understanding of the world view of Christians, since I myself am an agnostic. This book does a fine job of explaining the Christian view of the world and for rationalizing Christianity.A lot of reviewers, most of them in the atheist and agnostic camps, have attacked this book, accusing it of having faulty logic and having a number of logical fallacies. What they overlook is that Lewis is trying to explain the Christian faith in a book of 250 pages. Of course there might be a few liberties taken or imperfect examples of logic.Still, Lewis brings up a lot of good points. One of which is the fact that many who mock Christianity as being a belief system based on authority of the Bible are all too willing to accept other things on authority, such as science and history. This is true, but it misses a key point. If I want to see gravity at work, all I have to do is drop something. If I want to see why science tells me adding water to acid is a bad idea, I can go into a chemistry lab and find out. To this end, I'd say the Bible fits more with history. We can forever debate what happened in the past, and there is no way of being certain. With history, however, we can make educated guesses based on probability. Granted, some take science and history with full faith on face value, but this doesn't make it equally reliable with religion, which cannot be tested and must be taken on face value. With God, it's a matter of faith.I enjoyed the part which talked about Christian morality and virtues as well, but I think one would be mistaken to state that there must be a God for there to be any sort of morality. Truth exists independent of what anyone may say, as does morality which can be seen as a form of truth. If I decide to watch Casablanca over the next 2 hours, no number of people saying that I watched Citizen Kane will change the fact that I watched Casablanca, which is the truth. Likewise, everyone saying I watched Casablanca does not make the statement any more true than it would be if nobody made that claim. The fact that certain moral values are shared in common in the world and that we might be able to agree on some basic fundamentals of moral truth does not require a God.I will say that this book has given me a decent introduction to Christianity, but it has not converted me, but this is no fault of the book. The problem Lewis faces is that while he reasons through his faith, he is using Christian beliefs to show why he has Christian beliefs at many points. This is fine if one is Christian, as it fits into facts and beliefs that are already accepted, and while it shows Christianity to be reasonable, it does not have the capacity to convince a non-believer. Still, I give it five stars because given its length, it is a very good attempt to explain and justify the Christian faith. So, give it a read and ignore all of the atheists who seem to love tearing apart Christian beliefs a bit too much."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you are honestly searching for answers, then you have found the ultimate book. This book isn't for the feint at heart, it's not for bubble-gum churchgoers, and it's not for people who have no desire to objectively search for the Lord. I was totally blown away by Lewis's intellectual examination of Christianity. I had never seen anything even remotely close to what Lewis has done. Lewis's arguments are so unique that you will be left wondering, \\"How come nobody ever has addressed these issues in this way before?\\" It's almost like the Lord gave Lewis a unique gift to appeal to the intellectuals who are on the fence. If you are on the fence, then Lewis will push you onto the right track (if you are willing)."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book twice, about four years apart. While I did enjoy many points that C.S. Lewis makes, and I understand that he is a highly respected author, but I have to disagree with some of the reviewers. I feel that Mere Christianity is becoming out-dated.Since many people may already know what the book is about, I want to focus on some areas where I feel that C. S. Lewis is becoming out-dated. I feel that Mere Christianity may have been a revolutionary book for its time and helped spark some discussion about Christianity. But as apologists have to update their arguments when new responses have been made, this book has to keep up with new developments in the discussion about Christianity.C. S. Lewis' argument against Duality seems to fail. He writes, \\"Then good would not deserve to be called good.\\" (p. 43) Lewis tries to see the eastern philosophy through a western standpoint. But people who hold the eastern viewpoint do not see any dividing line between good and evil. They would state that reality is completely \\"beyond\\" good and evil, and thus there only appears to be a distinction to our culturally conditioned minds, but in actuality, there is no distinction between good and evil, and therefore one cannot even use the words \\"good\\" and \\"evil.\\"I disagree with Lewis on the idea that everybody lives forever, on a theological basis. Even though he never uses the Bible to support his claims, he writes, \\"Again, Christianity asserts that every individual human being is going to live for ever, and this must be either true or false.\\" (p. 74) The Bible states that God \\"alone has immortality.\\" (1 Timothy 6:16) and that the wicked will be completely wiped out of existence in the last days.Also, C. S. Lewis' watered-down approach to charity, \\"If our expenditure on comforts, luxuries, amusements, etc., is up to the standard common among those with the same income as our own, we are probably giving away too little,\\" (p. 86) would be an understatement for the wealthy.I also disagree with Lewis' definition of temperance. He writes, \\"Temperance referred not specially to drink, but to all pleasures; and it meant not abstaining, but going the right length and no further.\\" (p. 78) Temperance actually does mean abstaining from anything that is bad-alcohol, drugs, and smoking are all bad. It also means moderation in anything that is good-Yes, you can get too much of a good thing-but the Bible does not tell us to be \\"moderate\\" in our destructive behavior. The Bible calls us to abstain, to separate from evil, and to be pure. Where is Lewis' scriptural support? None, because he does not have scriptural support.But then again, maybe this is because C. S. Lewis likes drinking alcohol. He admits, \\"At least I know I should be very angry if the Mohammedans tried to prevent the rest of us from drinking wine.\\" (p. 112) Lewis also states that Christians \\"may see fit to give up all sorts of things for special reasons-marriage, or meat, or beer, or the cinema; but the moment he starts saying the things are bad in themselves, or looking down his nose at other people who do use them, he has then the wrong turning.\\" (p. 79) I disagree because beer and marriage are not on the same level. Alcohol really is bad. It is not the same as eating meat. Discouraging others from refraining from alcohol does not necessarily mean looking down one's nose at others.I personally feel that C. S. Lewis puts too much emphasis on social morality, and I will explain. On page 84, Lewis writes about Christian literature, Christian novelists, Christian dramatists, Christian society, Christian economists, Christian this, and Christian that. Next thing you know, we might be deciding between Christian toothpaste and non-Christian toothpaste when we shop at the grocery store. Is the point of Christianity to make society Christian or to make Christian products? Personal life-changing seems to be second priority to social change, but Christ's priority was personal life-changing. I don't think the Good News was meant to be a \\"social gospel.\\"Next, C. S. Lewis does not use any Scripture to support why the man should be the head of the household, besides just saying that it is the \\"Christian\\" way. He describes decision-making in marriage as \\"voting\\" and saying that somebody has to have the final say. What about both submitting to each other, which is actually what the Bible calls for, rather than fighting against each other? But rather, Lewis writes, \\"There must be something unnatural about the rule of wives over husbands, because the wives themselves are half-ashamed of it and despise the husbands of whom they rule.\\" (p. 113) This is a culturally determined generalization, and since it is not based in logic, cannot serve as the basis of a theological reasoning.Finally, the biggest contradiction is that C. S. Lewis is a Christian that believes in evolution. He writes, \\"Everyone now knows about Evolution... everyone has been told that man has evolved from lower types of life.\\" (p. 218)And this statement is bizarre: \\"There was a time before sex had appeared; development used to go on by different methods.\\" (p. 220) This seems like it would be hard to believe for an evolutionist, but this man supposedly believes in a supernatural God.Nevertheless, I do believe that there are some fundamental questions that can be answered in this book, such as \\"Why does evil exist?\\" or \\"Are there absolute truths?\\" Lewis nails these questions. There were some points that he brought out that affected me spiritually. One statement about pride hit home with me: \\"The more pride one had, the more one disliked pride in others.\\" (p. 122) But, in my humble opinion, I felt that C. S. Lewis rambled a lot, and failed to use good logic or good illustrations for most of his book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis' MERE CHRISTIANITY has for several decades been an popular work of Christian apologetics. Compiled from a series of radio talks during World War II, the book attempts to present basic Christian thought to the layman with clear tone and little in the way of theological complexity. The title comes from Lewis' desire to present only the foundational beliefs of Christianity as shared by the four major denominations of Britain (the Church of England, Presbyterianism, Roman Catholicism, and Methodism).The first half of the book is pretty good, going from \\"why do people have a conscience\\", to asserting the existence of god, to putting Jesus Christ forward as saviour of the human race. Lewis moves slowly, and tries to make all his assertions based on logic - though not entirely with success, as he makes a few slipups and depends far too much on shaky comparisons. Still, it's an entertaining read and may answer some of the questions a non-Christian would have about Christianity.The second half of the book, however, nearly obliterates the value of the first, as the author starts to come across as a sort of muttering old man, who everyone appreciates but no one finds convincing. The chapter on sexuality, for example, immediately alienates the reader, not because Lewis' points are necessarily wrong (I found myself agreeing with more than I imagined I would), but because Lewis pulls out the old hyperbole that we're living in the most immoral age since pagan times--even the Greeks looked back to a mythical better age while deploring the current as utterly lost--and as soon as Lewis asserts this the reader finds it difficult to take anything he has to say seriously.I also found it disappointing that Lewis spoke little on the responsibility of Christians to change society, for the four denominations on which he concentrates all have a tradition of preaching the social gospel, attempting to bring about laws and social traditions which they believe will be beneficial to society. Instead, he speaks almost entirely of individuals, while not addressing the concerns of the many, as Roman Catholicism does in its theology of liberation, or Methodism has classically done in its emphasis on peace.I've found that the best works of Christian apologetics are not books such as MERE CHRISTIANITY, which attempt to convince the reader of something through tired proofs when Christian is foremost about faith, believing something in spite of lack of proof. I think personal stories of conversion to Christianity do a better job of presenting the religion as it actually is to the believer, and would recommend in particular the CONFESSIONS of Saint Augustine and THE SEVEN-STOREY MOUNTAIN of Thomas Merton over Lewis' work. MERE CHRISTIANITY had many flaws from the start, and then hasn't aged well at all."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As a Christian, and C.S. Lewis Fan, I rate Mere Christianity as book with a detailed description, and beliefs that Christianity holds. Lewis, went from Chapter to Chapter talking about the issues of Christianity, and sums everything up well. For a person looking for an in depth, and fully intellectual resource, Mere Christianity is the book for you. I thought this books helped me in my faith, and it also made me see things more clearly. Lewis, as ALWAYS made a masterpice of Theological Literature."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis is a magnificent writer, and he has a fondness for metaphor that serves his style very well and that makes his fiction delightful. And certainly this book, like all of his work, is inspired by an unusually clear understanding of the human mind and of human desire. But as a philosopher and an apologist, Lewis leaves much to be desired, especially if you do not happen to be a devout Christian to begin with. He over-simplifies, side-steps important objections, and insists in arguing by allegory (something that any logician will tell you is a major no-no because the appropriateness of the allegory is itself open to contention). But it is still worth reading. I found his treatment of the problem of pride especially inspired."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this in college after reading Charles Colson's book &quot;Born Again.&quot; You remember Colson, don't you? He was Richard Nixon's hatchet man. &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; is the book that led him to Christ. He became a Christian and shortly thereafter, went to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. (No, God doesn't always rescue us from the consequences of our mistakes. Sorry!) Since that time he's been the founder/leader for Prison Fellowship--talk about making lemonade from lemons!, and one of the fieriest Christian leaders of our time. I'd also read somewhere else that Dr. Lewis was an atheist at one time, and wanted to hear about the religion I grew up in from the perspective of a critical thinker who'd chosen it after intellectual consideration and not just because he knew nothing different. I was not disappointed. And eventually, I chose Christianity after weighing all the evidence for myself. This is not easy or light reading. You will read a page or two, and have to think about it and chew on it awhile. But what insights. Twenty years after the first time I read this, I am newly convicted and challenged every time I pick up this book and re-read a passage from it. Like Oswald Chambers' My Utmost for His Highest, this is communication that will stand the test of time. If I had only five books to take to a desert island, this would be the second one I'd pack after my NIV Bible. Christians and sincere seekers, check in here.

C.S. Lewis uses wit, logic and analogies throughout this book which will give comfort to even the most militant of agnostics. Lewis' original intent of this book was to, once and for all, prove that there was/is NO God. After completing less than half of his research, he became one of the great defenders of the Christian Faith in the 20th century. This converted atheist and most intelligent scholar from Oxford University of England has found his place as a true guide to help others discover that divinity in Christ exists and all one has to do is read. Another claim I will make, is that this piece appeals to most of the spectrum of intelligence in society from a sophomore in high school to a theological philosopher..enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I'll be right up front with my own religious orientation and say that I'm an atheist. As such, I suppose I am the ideal audience for this book, since CS Lewis undertakes to explain the fundamental unifying beliefs of the various Christian denominations in simple language and analogy that should be clear to anyone. In this, he succeeds admirably, although his tone often comes off as condescending. In the end, however, I was not persuaded. I am put off by his views on homosexuals and the role of women as well as his acceptance of the Christian's permission (if not obligation) to kill in cases such as war or criminal punishment.I was also not convinced by his basic premise that God must exist because humans everywhere share a basic moral sense. It is easier for me to believe that we evolved certain behaviors because they allowed us to coexist relatively peacefully in communities; these behaviors had survival value for us because we are best able to thrive in communities. Being the intellectually complex beings that we are, we have developed sets of religious belief to explain these behaviors and tendencies to ourselves.These problems notwithstanding, \\"Mere Christianity\\" is a readable and illuminating introduction to Christian thought and merits reading."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The life of C.S.

This book will put all doubt to the side."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is a Christian apologetic, that is, a reasoned attempted to defend and argue for Christian faith. The Christian apologetic is a bit of a lost art these days (the atheist apologetic, on the other hand, is all the rage). Christian apologetics fell out of fashion perhaps in recognition that apologetics, whether Christian, atheist, or other, are doomed to failure. They attempt to by reason defend and argue for that which must, ultimately, be accepted as a matter of faith. Lewis magnifies his task by taking a particularly rationalist tack.Lewis also devotes a large part of Mere Christianity to laying out the basics of Christian belief. Frankly, I think this is more important than the apologetic, so I'm glad Lewis includes it.Lewis is certainly one of the great writers on Christianity of the 20th century. Mere Christianity is the most fundamental, basic, and broad of his religious books. I must say it pales beside A Grief Observed, though. But then pretty much any book pales beside A Grief Observed (I'm waiting to review it until my petition to Amazon to add a seventh star comes through).While Lewis's work, in my mind, is in most ways and in general superior to Chesterton's (The Everlasting Man), faith is not well suited to a rationalist explanation. It's called faith for a reason. Chesterton understood this and to his credit focused on the unexplainable to demonstrate the possibility of the unexplainable. Chesterton's prose in The Everlasting Man reminding me of that of, of all people, Christopher Hitchens. For both their own literary flair can obfuscate their point. For all his success writing fiction, Lewis never lets his prose get in the way of his persuasion. As another reviewer notes, he writes in \\"clear, concise, conversational prose.\\"I do highly recommend Mere Christianity to anyone looking for an attempt at a rationalist argument for Christianity and the basics of what Christians believe. I also think it would make it onto the list of one or two dozen books every Christian should read at some point in their life."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I forget how much I enjoy reading Lewis when I haven't read anything by him in a while. I hadn't read this book before but decided to give it a try after reading a friend's review last year, and I'm so glad that I did! Lewis takes so many of the truths of Christianity and explains them in practical ways. His illustrations and examples are wonderful, really helping his readers to understand what he is talking about. While this book is geared more toward non-Christians, there is a lot that Christians can get from reading this book. In case you can't tell, I really enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of my favorite books. C.S. Lewis is a master communicator and winsome apologist for the Christian faith in Mere Christianity. He begins with the universal idea of right and wrong that exists in every person and works his way, slowly, purposefully, and convincingly to Jesus Christ.Mere Christianity would be excellent reading for the curious unbeliever or the seasoned follower. Full of quotable passages Mere Christianity will run your highlighter dry as well as your fountain of excuses for disbelief. Lewis masterfully builds a case for Christianity that any thinking person will find hard to dismiss. The reader is forced to deal with Jesus.\\"A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg - or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God.

Or perhaps you have Christian friends and just don't want to bring up the topic.That's where this book comes in handy.Although this book has an understandable appeal for believers, I believe that even non-believers will find this book useful.First of all, unlike most Christian non-fiction, this one has absolutely no Bible verses. You don't have to worry about Lewis cherry-picking his favorite verses to uphold whatever point he is trying to get across. You don't even need a copy of the Bible at hand to read this book (of course having one doesn't hurt, either).What results is that Lewis is able to talk about Christianity in a very candid manner, as if the two of you were sitting together by a fireplace and discussing it, no strings attached.To illustrate his points, Lewis uses many parallels to aid one in visualizing certain concepts. He doesn't go into the topics that denominations disagree and nitpick about. He simply breaks down Christianity to its lowest common denominator and presents it in that form.Good as this book is, I don't think it's enough for those that may be looking for \\"The Ultimate Argument In Favor Of Christianity\\". Those looking for such may be disappointed, but I think those seeking candid, heartfelt and insightful commentary will be pleased.For myself, I found his commentary on \\"Pride\\" and \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" (Our Father . . .) to be exceptionally articulated, bringing out points that I hadn't even considered before.At a little over 200 pages, this is a great book for non-believers to get acquainted with Christianity and also a great book for believers to see some old concepts in a new light."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I feel that there is no need to give an in-depth review of this book, so I won't waste your time being cliche.

Lewis is an absolute master - light years beyond most thinkers in every way. A must read for any human - Christian or not."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This classic work contains the response of popular Christian apologetist C. S. Lewis to three fundamental questions:1. Is there a God?2. Is God a good and loving God, or is he indifferent to us?3. Is Christ what he says he is (Savior of mankind)?Lewis gives skillful, entertaining and relatively brief responses, but an atheist once pointed out to me that Lewis left a gigantic hole in the third argument - how do we know that the quotations of Christ in the Bible that we read today are accurate? So, the journey starts here, but it does not end here. I next turned to The Historical Reliability of the Gospels by Craig L. Blomberg, and The Case for Christ: A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus by Lee Strobel. In the interest of staying on point, I'll discuss those books elsewhere and conclude by highly recommending this book to those new to Christianity or Christian apologetics, but with the caveat that it takes the answer to one crucial question completely for granted."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Originally a series of radio broadcasts that were transcribed into book form with the author's help, C. S. Lewis' witty and systematically logical defense of Christianity still endures as a favorite today. Although intellectual works of this caliber can seem intimidating, his conversational style of communication makes the book approachable and thoroughly enjoyable. He not only addresses the common sense of Christianity, but also thoughtfully doesn't neglect the practical need, the heartfelt void, that Christ alone can fill. All in all, this book is an all-around, solid work that consistently covers all the bases of thought and makes for a great read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I won't bother restating what others have stated more than adequately. I'll just say the best and worst thing about this book:Best: Simple but effective arguments by analogy--well put and understandable, causing you to smile, remember them and repeat them to yourself later.Worst: Sometimes the book is so simplified, so stripped down that it may have you longing for meatier material by the same author. But since Lewis did write other more complex books on the same subjects, one can't really hold that against this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Perhaps the boxed set would be a better choice for one wishing to carry around their C.S. Lewis with them everywhere they go (and who wouldn't), but I particularly enjoy having these signature classics all together in one tome. It greatly facilitates flipping around to other selections for reference. I'm not going to review the individual works, because I think if a person is considering buying this collection they already know their Lewis pretty well. I have to mention the Screwtape Letters, though. What a wonderful work of allegory and fiction, and though it is fiction it is certainly not out of place in a collection of apologist writings and social commentary. Also deserving particular notice is The Abolition of Man, proving that Eastern philosophy and Christian ideology are not mutually exclusive. I consider this volume one of the greatest in my literary collection."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Our Sunday School class is using this for our weekly lessons. The writing is very conversational and tends to repeat itself to get the point across. The book comes from BBC broadcasts C. S. Lewis made in the 1940s. This tone fits the style of lesson we have where one member of the class reads aloud while the others listen. We use the journalMere Christianity Journalas a guide for discussion questions in class. The questions presented are equally applicable to today as they were in the 1940s. Lewis has made us think about what it means to be \\"Christian\\" in the WWII era as well as today and how the life of a christian is challenging no matter what place or time you live in.You may have trouble \\"getting\\" some of his references and following his train of thought without re-reading some sections. The reader can tell that C. S. Lewis is an academian through the way he writes. This is not leisurely reading, but makes you think about where your life as a christian can fit into the world. Recommended."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is valuable to read for both Christians and non-Christians. First of all, it is good for Christians to review the basics of their faith. Even those who have been raised in the Christian tradition for a long time can learn a lot from Lewis' explanations of the basics. And those who do not accept Christianity would still be helped by reading it, as Lewis writes in a non-sectarian and interdenominational way, and will help greatly in understanding what Christianity actually is.Originally a series of talks for the radio, Lewis expanded on them and put those and more into the book MERE CHRISTIANITY. The book is divided into four divisions:1. RIGHT AND WRONG AS A CLUE TO THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE. This is then divided into five chapters dealing with the ideas of right and wrong.2. WHAT CHRISTIANS BELIEVE? There are five chapters dealing with basics in the Christian faith, doing a comparison of how Christianity and other faiths actually have a lot in common with other religions and that it is at the point of departure that Christians then embrace their faith as opposed to others.3. CHRISTIAN BEHAVIOR. I especially appreciated this section. I was raised in a strong Christian home, for which I am grateful. But the biggest problem I had were other Christians (most of them outside the home) with people putting together arbitrary lists of what Christians \\"should\\" and \\"shouldn't do - most of them being conspicuous by their absence in the Bible.4. BEYOND PERSONALITY: OR FIRST STEPS IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY. This covers a number of aspects of Christian living. I especially appreciated the chapter \\"Is Christianity Hard or Easy?\\" and \\"Nice People or New Men?\\"It is a knowledgeable book. You'll be glad you read it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis hits the bull's-eye in a way that no one else has done before. One could imagine how people devoted to reading the Bible all their lives, or going to mass every Sunday, could miss the salient points of Christianity. His vital argument is that Christianity is not about how much Bible you know, or how to spin a doctrine, or how much you praise your local Priest/Pastor, but how to actually set about doing what Christ asks Christians to do. Namely, how to become a little version of Jesus... a Christian!Instead of breaking down the Bible into a verse by verse tutorial or going through several stages of Catechism, C.S Lewis goes for the characteristics of the Saints and compares them to Jesus to produce a portrait of what God is asking human beings to be like. For all intents and purposes a human being who does not deserve God is called to try and be like God by walking in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. It is never surprising how this very basic of basic requirements of Christianity goes over most heads who are usually too busy hung-up on apologetics or doctrines to get the simplest of commandments which is the message of the Gospel...1. Love the Lord your God2. Love your neighbor as yourselfHow do you do this? By realizing that only Jesus can do it for you. Give up trying to do it yourself and submit to Jesus. That is how it is done.Mere Christianity was specifically designed between 1942 and 1944 to encourage and motivate the British people to fight the Nazi threat. It worked. They won.Book 1 of Mere Christianity discusses our inbuilt nature to know the difference between right and wrong. Lewis calls it the law of human nature. The argument is good because it becomes apparent that common sense should prevail in the world today... but doesn't. We simply know when we are up to no good, or when someone else is up to no good, not because we have been taught what is right and wrong but because of our inbuilt sense of knowing right from wrong that is active somewhere within us. There also seems to be an unseen force that discerns this difference for us, a sense which Lewis believes comes from a higher being. The thing here is that this higher being seems to desire good will. This means that the higher being is probably good and not bad. The onion is that people don't always do what they know to be right. This indicates to Lewis that man seems designed for a higher purpose but mostly achieves a lower standard of being because of doing wrong.Book 2 of Mere Christianity goes right for an explanation of the problems set up by Book 1. Lewis thinks Christianity holds the solution to this problem because things turn out never quite like we expect them to be. That point can not be underestimated. Maybe Jesus did create the world? Maybe there is a spiritual battle taking place in this realm? Lewis believes that a fallen angel called Satan is manipulating people to go against their true nature on planet Earth. Lewis proposes that God values free will over direct intervention and wants human beings to freely choose Jesus to thwart the devil's influence in their daily lives. That is basically it.Book 3 of Mere Christianity is where it is at. This is the big morals and ethics lesson about how to be a better person through Christ Jesus. Lewis talks about the cardinal virtues, prudence (discern our true good in every circumstance and to choose the right means of achieving it), justice (give due to God and neighbor), fortitude (firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of the good) and temperance (moderates the attraction of pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods). Lewis then talks about the theological virtues of faith, hope and love. Sexual morality and Christian marriage play a big part in getting good with God. His lesson is very motivating. Forgiveness is a fundamental. The greatest sin of pride gets a big lecture. Book 3 is the real reason to buy Mere Christianity.Book 4 discusses God in the sense that someone who goes through the practice laid out in Book 3 can look forward to what is the next projected step in human evolution which is to voluntarily become an eternal spiritual person through Christ. It contains the barest of doctrines and principles but the chapter called Let's Pretend about the teaching of putting on Christ in a sort of dressing up as Christ routine is a mind blowing concept. Here Lewis indicates that no one deserves to be play acting like Christ but that this is what Christ asks people to do by following the directions Christ laid out, such as praying the \`Our Father...', yes calling God our dad! See how such an outrageous mockery this is considering how we do not deserve any of it. It is this orientation of one not deserving anything that gains one everything. It is Christ that leads the way to everlasting life not man leading man to nowhere else but the grave. Yes Christ will kill our old selves in the process but what remains is what we are and not what we have become as a result of reflecting what is bad about this world and not reflecting the goodness that is within it. This is eternal life in heaven being spoken about. The greatest quest a human being can undertake.Mere Christianity is most certainly a Christian essential that will be read more than once for its unlimited value in contributing to good will intensions. You would be hard pressed to find a book as rewarding as this for the little amount you have to read. You will probably do best to read the four Gospels after reading Mere Christianity to figure out more about the Christ who we are asked to put on. Remember to let Christ do the work. We cannot do it ourselves. God bless C.S Lewis!Some additional points however need to be made. This book was written during the 1950s and there has been much progress since then. Being yourself is important. Stop speculating about prophetical end times. Read the Gospels instead. Don't worry about Satan. Concentrate on Jesus instead. Reason before mystical feelings (feelings can be misleading). Check your reasoning with experts. Live life as best you can. God loves you. God is with you always. Pray for the better. Christ's love gets us into heaven. Mistakes are just mistakes. Be careful with legalism (trying to depend too much on the commandments or regulations to get you into heaven and not Jesus). Keep the commandments as best you can though. Christians do develop with the times as they have always done so try to stay in touch. Vatican II aligned Priests are recommended for Catholics. Protestants Christians and Brothers and Sisters in Christ would do best to have a Biblical exegesis that uses the historical critical method instead of just concentrating on direct literal interpretation alone. Also I would add that above all else is honesty and Christianity is not exempt from this because in fact it promotes it. Religion of all kinds should be allowed criticism (Christianity takes full advantage of this when it touches on other religions). A person should honestly evaluate the arguments rather than ignore them. That would be the Christian thing to do."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Although there are doubtless classics that don't deserve that status, this book is not one of them. This book is an absolute must-read that has stood the test of time very well and is still thoroughly relevant today. There are a few books I think every Christian should read; this one is near the top.Whether you're a new Christian trying to learn more about your faith, or you've been a Christian for awhile and want to learn how to defend your faith, or aren't a Christian at all and would like to know why Christians believe what they do, then this is the book for you. I wouldn't even think about going into apologetics without having read it, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to non-Christians and \\"seekers\\" who want to learn more about Christianity. This is also a great book for Christians of any maturity level; in fact, it's one you'll probably want to read multiple times.In our postmodernist, relativistic age where people are becoming increasingly skeptical of Christianity, it is becoming more important than ever to be able to articulate and defend the truth clearly, and this book will help you do that as a Christian. Christianity is facing challenges on every side, from the rise of Islam to the popularity of the \\"New Atheists\\" to the dominance of secular humanism in the public school system, and Christians MUST be able to respond to these challenges; if we can't, then I fear for the future of Christianity in this culture.Not that the benefits of this book are exclusively for Christians. Even if you're a non-Christian, I think you will find this book informative and thought-provoking; it will show you that being a Christian does not require you to exercise blind faith, check reason at the door, or ignore the facts. I once heard someone define faith as believing something you know isn't true; C. S. Lewis shows that, at least in terms of Christianity, nothing could be further from the truth. Who knows - you may even be persuaded by this book, as many other people have, and become a Christian yourself. But even if you don't, I think you will still find this book challenging.I honestly can't recommend this book enough. I can't think of anyone who I wouldn't recommend this book to, and I would recommend it without reservation or qualification. If you've never read this book, I suggest you do so as soon as you can."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It is amazing to think that the essays in \\"Mere Christianity\\" were originally short radio essays that C.S. Lewis delivered during World War II. They are so deep. Yet they are so short it's easy to get through one. That's one of the strengths of this book. Lewis breaks down concepts into such small pieces that it is easy to understand his larger points when he makes them. He also continually raises questions and perspectives that make one stop and think. He provokes his readers to have an opinion."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Anything by C.S. Lewis is amazing, but Mere Christianity tells you about being a Christian in straight, understandable form. I highlight all of the quotes I love from that book--and that is almost everything on the page. If you want to know what Christianity is like, whether you are a Christian or not, this book will tell you without confusing you. I am a Christian, and it has even given me new perspectives on Christianity, such as \\"don't hate the bad man; hate what the bad man does.\\" Some of my favorite quotes are below:\\"We were promised sufferings. They were part of the program. We were even told, ''Blessed are they that mourn.''\\"\\"The very man who has argued you down, will sometimes be found, years later, to have been influenced by what you said.\\"\\"If I discover within myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.\\"The Quotable LewisI recommend this for more of C.S. Lewis' words of wisdom"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is arguably the premier apologetic writer of the 20th century, his case for the Christian faith made even more powerful by his former atheism. \\"Mere Christianity\\" may be more important now for the modern audience than it was back in 1952. Lewis is one of my favorite writers and this book is a definitive classic, a masterpiece. It is a brilliant rationale: encouraging and challenging alike. Simply put, the book invites the reader to become a \\"New Man.\\" In a warm, conversational tone, Lewis addresses the Big questions in four parts: morality as God's law; what Christians believe; Christian behavior, such as the cardinal virtues and problem of sin; and the theological doctrine of Christianity, all of which are concerns to living this \\"new\\" life, the life of a Christian. As stated in Matthew 16:25 of the NIV Bible, \\"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.\\" Lewis takes this idea -- which looks abstract to a non-Christian -- and illustrates, in concrete terms, the rationale behind the Christian faith. Why must Christians give up their \\"lives\\" -- their \\"selves\\" -- to come closer to Christ? It is a choice at odds with the humanistic society we live in. Christians have been warned of this struggle and of the importance to adhere to the age-old truths in the Bible: \\"Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world.\\" (Romans 12:2). The journey has been described as a daily walk: with each step one is either closer to Christ or further away. As Lewis puts it, \\"Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different than it was before.\\" For the Christian, that \\"something different\\" looks more like Christ and less like us. The importance of this idea cannot be overstated for a modern, cynical, self-sufficient and self-important -- and largely secular -- society. Particularly powerful is the writing on the dichotomy of good and evil--how morality (right and wrong) appears to be a subjective issue, or as atheists like to claim, \\"common sense.\\" Not everyone appears to need Christ, at least not while things are going splendidly. As Lewis sadly surmises, \\"If you have sound nerves and intelligence and health and popularity and a good upbringing, you are likely to be quite satisfied with your character as it is. \\"Why drag God into it?\\" you may ask.\\" Why indeed? This book may inspire you to find out."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a classic. I would recommend it to long-time Christians as well as new Christians or those wanting to explore the basic components of the Christian faith.Lewis is humble, positive and writes a hopeful and uplifting book. There are a few comments that show some biases of the time in which it was written, but looking at the big picture this book is excellent.Of course, there will always be those who criticize the logic of Lewis' book and I just do not understand the obsession with trying to prove to people of faith that they are wrong, unenlightened, uninformed. On the contrary, I think Lewis book shows that Christianity is not for blind followers but for people who are ready to be challenged each day."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"i read mere christianity and screwtape years ago and was delighted to see them in one volume with other 'signature classics' by ol' clive staples lewis. if you want to go to narnia on the pop culture train, pass on this. if you want contemporary thought by a man long dead, but his words still live and indict the modern mind to stretch beyond complacency, get this volume NOW!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The book was more than I expected.

When done with this book you can't help but wish to read another of his great works of art"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book sets out to be an exposition of \\"agreed, or common, or central, or 'mere' Christianity\\" for non-Christians or doubting Christians. It is important to note that the word \\"Christianity\\" can be understood either as the body of Christ or else as the body of Christians. Most people, when talking about Christianity, mean the first. Lewis quite explicitly means the second. In this book he only describes what Christians believe. In the preface he states that some objected that \\"a person who cannot believe the doctrines expounded in the book can be far more truly Christian, far closer to the spirit of Christ, than some who do\\". He accepts this objection as very right, but claims that it is not \\"useful\\" and that it would be a \\"disaster\\" to use language like that. This cannot be true: if it is not belief in the doctrines what makes a person more truly Christian, then the exposition of these doctrines have no place in a book that sets out to be about the central aspect of Christianity. In fact this book very nicely shows that what Christians believe is a mixture of the sublime and the despicable. Let us not forget that a short while ago many Christians believed that slavery was divinely sanctioned, and that it said so in the Bible, not to mention beliefs about the Jews being the enemies of Christ, or about witches being the tools of the devil. For Lewis the defining characteristic of Christianity is doctrine, and therefore this book is really about Christian doctrine, not about Christianity. The problem is not so much that the book's title is wrong, but that non-Christians or doubting Christians who read it searching for truth will get the wrong message.Much of what is central to the spirit of Christianity, such as compassion, is discussed in only a few pages. On the other hand, much of what is peripheral, such as, supposedly, that a wife should obey her husband, is expounded at length and defended with ...arguments (page 113). Fatally, much that is clearly contrary to Christianity is expounded if only because all major denominations have allowed it: so it is explained that a Christian judge may hang a murderer (page 118), and that a Christian soldier may kill his enemies, even while loving them, forgiving them, and literally wishing them well (page 120). Clearly Lewis is hard at work trying to find arguments to paper over the absurdities and contradictions in Christian doctrine. But this is hypocrisy, and hypocrisy, no matter how cleverly done, is the very antithesis of Christianity. Also, many of his arguments are childishly weak: For example, he recognizes that one of the major stumbling blocks for non-believers is the fact that Christians are as bad if not worse than non-Christians. He even asserts that \\"Christ told us to judge by results - a tree is known by its fruit\\" (page 208), but then sets out to prove that it is unreasonable to hold that \\"the whole world can be neatly divided into two camps - Christian and non-Christian - and that all the people in the first camp at any given moment should be obviously nicer than all the people in the second\\". This is evidently true, but quite beside the point.Lewis is fiercely intelligent, writes beautiful English, and this small book is more compact full with ideas than other books three times its size. His capacity for luminous analogy is incredible, beyond the ability of any other writer I know. Most of what is true in Christian doctrine is rendered beautifully and memorably. He is courageous in many points, for example he flatly states that when Jesus said that the rich will not enter the Kingdom he meant the economically rich (page 213). Mercifully, he accepts the theory of evolution. Christians should not use the laws to impose their morality on others - after all \\"we would be very angry if the Mohammedans tried to prevent the rest of us from drinking wine\\" (page 112). The book is uncompromising in its morals, it gives refreshing views into the meaning of Trinity and the Atonement, and most useful of all, it gives good practical advice, such as, splendidly, on how to love our neighbor: \\"Do not waste time bothering whether you \`love' your neighbor; act as if you did. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him\\" (page 131). This is one of the most inspiring books I have read, and at the same time one of the most frustrating.I think that Lewis is led by the supposedly Christian virtue of obedience to the church. If obedience is a Christian virtue then Christ displayed very little of it, towards the authorities civil or religious, or even towards his own family. I think that Jesus was telling us that the only and undiluted authority is God. Tragically, because Lewis is really a great writer, to him the authority is the church. So he chickens out and refuses to oppose supposedly 'central' church dogma. This includes his long discussion of sexuality, where he jarringly admonishes against even married couples \\"indulging\\" in ...[intercourse] (page 97). The argument is that sex, like eating, is a natural function that should be exercised only as far as needed: we should only eat while hungry and we should only have ...[intercourse] when wanting to have babies. The book is only a few decades old and already amusingly outdated: masturbation is a sin (page 202), homosexuality is a perversion (page 89), our wishes are suggested by devils (page 225). Also, unfortunately, its tone is often spoiled by sexist expressions.All in all, I can only recommend this book to steadfast Christians. I cannot imagine anybody else not being confused by it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Say what you like about the new Narnia movie; it's gotten people reading the Chronicles. The question most readers have upon closing the seventh volume is what to read next. For fiction, I would suggest the space trilogy, but many readers like to jump out into Lewis' non-fiction.Mere Christianity is by far his best selling non-fiction book. It isn't just a million seller; it sells that many copies every year. It's consistently in the top two hundred books on Amazon and there are a few hundred readers' reviews. Originally given as broadcast talks over BBC radio during World War II, this material was later published in three skinny books before being collected together as Mere Christianity.Lewis is widely read because he has a way of putting things that everyone wonders about. He argues from the natural law (why things are the way they are or appear to be), common sense (things people seem to mostly hold in common and which make up human life) and a particularly Lewisian idea of cosmic homesickness, in German, sensucht, that we are made for somewhere and someone else and, as St. Augustine put it, \\"our hearts are always restless 'till we find our rest in Thee.\\"Lewis, well read in Northern and other mythology, goes further, identifying that destination and destiny with joy, and the motif of delight is one of the things that makes the Narnian Chronicles so -well, delightful. He echoes philosopher Blaise Pascal's idea that we are made with a God-shaped hole (vacuum)that \\"cannot be filled by any created thing but only by the Creator as known through Jesus Christ.\\" That's the mere Christianity Lewis finds running as a golden thread through the heart of the various denominations. \\"All our quarrels are lovers' quarrels,\\" said early TV preacher Fulton Sheen.

This book is laid out in three parts: Right and Wrong, What Christians Believe, and Christian Behaviour. In the third part--Christian Behaviour--Mr. Lewis eloquently portrays what it means to accept Christ.Mr. Lewis understood very well the true principle: one of the things that will make heaven indeed heaven is the way people treat each other and deal with each other. Those who accept Christ will find themselves yearning to live as he lived, and do as he did. By doing so, they will ultimately build the kind of character it takes to be \\"heavenly.\\"Mr. Lewis also points out some of the characteristics that prevent us from developing such character -- such as pride. \\"Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man.\\" Mr. Lewis points out that pride is one of the many qualities, which (if unbridled) keeps so many people away from true discipleship in Christ. The competitive nature of pride compels us to squander away our limited time on earth in a competitive pursuit of worldly treasures and success, which (for most of us) is at the expense of more important things. And, if my life has been spent without performing the Christ like acts of service and love -- necessary to build \\"heavenly character,\\" can I actually expect heaven to be a place where I will comfortably fit in?I highly recommend this book and I find it a valuable addition to my library."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S.

He lays his points politely and respectfully. This is his demeanor throughout the book's entirety. I feel he makes great points and explanations, all while taking his reader into consideration.I don't think this is the type of book that will convert a die-hard atheist. I believe that it gives thoughtful answers (that are much better than &quot;It's in the Bible, that's why!&quot; or, worse, &quot;Because that's what God wants!&quot;) If the reader isn't swayed, at the very least, I think they can walk away, content with a mutual agreement to disagree."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I've never seen C.

This is also good to try if the last essay you read by Lewis was too abstract or confusing (like A Grief Observed, Pilgrim's Regress). If this book does not appeal to you, then stay clear of his essays, but there is a chance you may still like some of his other works (Narnia, Screwtape or The Great Divorce)."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"By &quot;mere&quot; Christianity, Lewis means that he is writing about the fundamental issues that all Christ-based religions can agree upon. It is written in a conversational tone, with few references to particular bible verses. An outstanding work. This was written 50 years ago but is timeless and accurate today."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"By &quot;mere&quot; Christianity, Lewis means that he is writing about the fundamental issues that all Christ-based religions can agree upon.

Starting as Lewis often does, from essentially nothing and building on simple day-to-day examples he explains from the ground up the what and why of Christianity. Later he delves into more complicated and tricky philosphical questions which have held many back from believing. While not proving christianity (an impossibility in my opinion), he makes a very strong case and this is truly the book which changed my life.If you like it, check out &quot;The Pilgrims Regress&quot; also by Lewis, easily the best book I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"'Mere Christianity' is an informal discussion of what is at the heartof Christianity. This book literally changed my life. Lewis brought downmany of the prejudices I had against the Church and religion in general."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis writes brilliantly and will persuade those who wish to persuaded. There is of course nothing logical about Christianity, as some Christian apologists have recognized from Tertullian's certum, quia impossible est to Sir Thomas Browne: \\"Methinks there be not half enough impossibilities in religion for an active faith.\\"An example of Lewis's fallacious argument is seen in his declaration that Jesus' declaration that he is God is either a lie, a statement of a madman, or something worse. In fact, there is no reasonable certainty that Jesus ever made this claim, since it appears in the least historical of the gospels (none of which were written by the original disciples). For a good, scholarly study of the gospels, see Spong, Rescuing the Bible from fundamentalism : a bishop rethinks the meaning of Scripture.Lewis' stance in this book is kind persuasion of the average reader. Thus he must ignore historical and anthropological data that show that the belief human sacrifice is necessary to please the god(s) has antecedents thousands of years before Christianity. Obviously many people still find credible the idea that only a human sacrifice can please God (yes, we all know Christians believe Jesus to be God, but Jesus suffered horribly as a human being). A god who requires human sacrifice (note precedents in OT) because all human beings inherit the guilt of their supposed first parents, Adam and Eve, is a bronze age god. The old, bloody ideas of collective, inherited guilt requiring human sacrifice keep marching on."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"How would you explain Christianity in broad strokes to someone who doesn't know anything about it or maybe just a little about it? How do you explain Christianity to people of other world views, such as dualists or pantheists or atheists? What would our common experiences tell us about the Creator, if there is a Creator? How do you know there is a Creator? What is the Creator like, and how personal is He, if He indeed exists?Mere Christianity provides some classic answers written by one of the great Christian philosophers of the 20th century, C S Lewis, who sold almost 100 million books on Christian philosophy, some even in fantasy form (like the Chronicles of Narnia). It is not about Catholicism or Protestantism of any particular stripe, but is about \`mere' Christianity, that is, Christianity in its basic essence. It is not about proving Christian doctrine from Scripture, but from logic instead. In other words, it is about high-level apologetics (philosophy) as opposed to the low-level apologetics (Scriptures) we are much more familiar with and many of us hear every Sunday from the pulpit. It is about talking to non-church goers about our beliefs, in language and logic familiar to everybody. It's about taking a step back and seeing what we have in Christianity.Lewis does an excellent job of breaking his arguments into digestible bite-size pieces that were originally his radio broadcasts of the 1940's. The language and sentence and paragraph structures are simple and accessible. He does a good job of making plain what he is saying, and though written simply, his arguments are thought-provoking and challenging.The early chapters tackle other world views with very logical arguments for a meaningful universe. If it could be logically deduced that God created the universe, then it would be logical that the universe has meaning. On the other hand, if the evidence shows that the universe just happened, then the universe has no meaning. Lewis proceeds by giving arguments for the existence of God based on our innate knowledge of good and evil, and where that knowledge must have come from. I found this to be the most challenging part of the book.The middle chapters go over Christian moral qualities and what they really mean and why having Christian qualities does not necessarily mean you're a Christian, and not having these qualities in full does not mean that you're not a Christian (which every Christian can be thankful for, by the way).The later chapters deal with such things as understanding the Trinity, being born-again, God being outside of time, and the God-man makeup of Christ. These are highly spiritual subjects that, of course, can only be approached and not fully explained. Remember, he is not proving anything by use of the Scripture, but is only using reason against the basic ideas of Christianity. He gives it a very good shot making liberal use of clever analogies to give us some sense of what these abstract ideas mean.It is a good book about what 'mere'Christianity is, and well worth the time and effort to understand, both for Christians and non-Christians."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Since Lewis began as an unbeliever and gradually worked his way into Christian belief, we felt it would be a good read for someone who is converting from the Muslim faith to Christianity. We have found the book to be a very valuable tool for this purpose."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis, besides being a great fiction writer and a fair poet, is a briliant mind. His theology, well, his theology is the theology that you want to read. When you read this book you can really see one of the greatest minds at work. For the faithful as well as the unfaithful intellect, this is a book to read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I decided to reread \\"Mere Christianity\\" to see if I could rekindle insights into what is God, what has He done and what should we be doing.I had underlined several sentences and paragraphs from my previous reading of this book. I found that these underlined passages were still applicable. I recorded several new thoughts to aid my understanding of God.Lewis takes on the tough issues facing Christians. For example, we know what morality is but do not practice it completely. When we understand how much more we have to do to be a better person, we are progressing in the right direction.I was particularly interested in two thoughts from Lewis' book.1. Try to become a better person by taking one step at a time. Ask for God's help. This is really good advice. It works!!2. Religious leaders who politicize God's word are not working for God. Religion and political party platforms should remain separate and apart."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"(...)Personal Opinion:This book is quite a heavy reading. You have to concentrate and think as you read in order to fully understand his arguments. But you will get a lot out of it once you understand them. C.S. Lewis writes from a layman's perspective, so you will not be tripped by any technical theological jargons.In the morality section of the book, you will find the espoused values going against modern society's mindset. I'm surprised that many of his arguments for morality is still highly relevant today, even though it's written decades ago.This is a good book to read if you want to understand Christianity in its purest form. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One night, several years ago, a great figure stepped into my life, someone whom I have read and admired ever since. I was waiting with my mother in a Christian bookstore for my father, when I spied a book, titled Mere Christianity. Thinking it looked like good book(And already familiar with the Chronicles of Narnia), I bought it. Now, as I sit here, I think of the books I have to read- works by Anselm, Aquinas, Augustine, Plato, Aristotle, Kierkergaard- and it is the influence Clive Staples Lewis had on my life. In simple language, C. S. Lewis explains basic Christian doctrine and theology. Only the Epistles are a better introduction to Christian thought. Personally, I liked the fact that C. S. Lewis didn't use too many Bible quotes- it's easy to find them yourself, and it makes the book more readable for an atheist. A truly great book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I recomend this to any one wether Christian, athiest, agnostic, deist, antitheist, and the like. a work like no other. truly amazing"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I bought this book having read only the review and I got a lot more than I had bargained for. This is a very direct lesson from Lewis to his readers about the very kernel of Christian philosophy. I recommend it without reserve for anyone with some background knowledge of Chistianity. This book will touch you very deeply. Buy one and share it with friends!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"was a sweet gift for xmas for the sis the postal took its time but not the sellers fault"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Read this at 20 - made more sense at 30. I like the second half especially. The insights were helpful to me."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have listened or read several of C.S Lewis books. This one is my favorite so far."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I like this compilation very much, since it contains a lot of the classics of C.S. Lewis that I wanted to have on my shelf. The book is of course a great bargain, since you'd pay a lot more if you bought each one seperately.Personally, I like C.S. Lewis' essays a lot, because they are written for those \\"intellectuals\\" that just can't really grasp the idea of God that doesn't fit into their (our) scientific world. It is a great lecture for those who doubt. BUT: one should read it with an open mind since not all of Lewis' arguments are always coherent up to the end (let's face it though, faith can never be explained 100% with human logic). Still he gives a lot of impulses for ways to think about faith and, I think, in the variety of essays everyone can find something convincing.On a personal note, I like C.S. Lewis because he never forgets to point out that christianity is not a religion where everyone can just pick out one opinion or interpretation that \\"suits him\\", but contains duties and prohibitions before God and all humans, at the same time as peace, community and love. I think, that is a point often forgotten nowadays.C.S. Lewis is a writer whose books I dare to recommend and give to the most doubting and mind-guided people, always with the recommendation that they keep their mind open while reading it; despite some incoherencies (and C.S.Lewis never claims his opinions to be the universal truth for everybody) he makes people think anew or at least rethink their own fragile arguments against the existence of God. If they don't finish up believing, then at least admitting the possiblity. Read it!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The language is somewhat dated, and so are the examples to a certain degree...but the content,the message of this book has withstood, and will withstand, the test of time.You may be tempted to put it down, but stay with it...it all makes sense in the end, and the search for meaning in life and Christianity's role in it takes some time to comprehend, understand and internalize...A good book for the serious Christian who wants to grow. Since these chapters were orignally prepared for radio broadcast, it might be more meaningful and effecive to listen to an audio version, but this(the printed version) will not fail---if you stay with it!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is a great writer; so great that, while reading his \\"Mere Christianity,\\" one almost gets the idea that this man could convince you about anything, perhaps even that pigs fly when they get enough motivation. But, at a certain point in reading, it becomes evident that this book isn't compelling just because of Lewis's literary and argumentative skill; it's compelling because the ideas are monumental and the scope is universal. It just so happens that the ideas professed in the book require a mind like Lewis's to fully develop them-- and in an entertaining way, I might add.The book, which was originally a radio broadcast during the early 1940s, initially gets into the nature of man and the species' tendency to maintain a standard of morality (Natural Law). He then describes the dichotomy of belief (including secular and religious), which has existed since prehistory. Finally he delves into the specific religion of Christianity and makes a great, uncompromising argument for his belief. He spends most of the last section showing how a non-Christian can test the waters of the faith and eventually become immersed.His points are well thought out and his language is expert and it is a pleasure to read his work, including the dated British phrases like, \\"...he will be complaining 'It's not fair' before you can say Jack Robinson.\\" Who's Jack Robinson? Some may be turned away from the theological nature of the book, or the fact that it was written so long ago, but they will be glad to find out that this work is a very practical, timeless piece that can offer anyone something of value. Two memorable concepts that stick out to me are Lewis's development of our Natural Law, in which the author shows how we all acknowledge there is a just standard out there, which we always hold others to yet consistently fail to hold ourselves to. Another memorable concept was how prayer literally transforms our minds and beings by our putting on Christ's clothes.While \\"Mere Christianity\\" can offer something to everyone, I strongly recommend it to open-minded secularists who think religions to be on the level of silly superstitions (Lewis himself was counted as one before his conversion), and Christians who don't really know why they are who they profess to be. What they will find is a thorough, intelligent, witty, and prfound review of the most popular religion of all humanity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As a young man trying to decide whether or not to believe the things I grew up in, this book was very helpful to me. I remember reading the chapter on pride, \\"The Great Sin,\\" one night at a camp in Alaska where I was counseling. The Holy Spirit showed me myself in that chapter. I poured over this book in those days, internalized it, even learned Chinese hoping to translate it.I have since \\"moved on\\" to more detailed and empirically-oriented books by Christians, skeptics, and followers of other religions. Many of these offer interesting facts and insights. But the only place I have found as much wisdom as here (outside the Bible) was G. K. Chestertons's Everlasting Man, which influenced Lewis to faith.Lewis has a marvelous gift for explaining things in simple terms without patronizing or talking down. Some may find his argument difficult, and others, too simple. In that case I recommend further reading; Lewis is not trying to be thorough.I agree with one skeptical reviewer that Lewis does not offer \\"proof\\" of God, or even logically-compelling evidence. He dismisses atheism with amazing abruptness. \\"Atheism is too simple. . . If the universe has no meaning, we would never have found out.\\" (How does he know that? Does he have a control universe in his pocket?) But don't misunderstand. Lewis does not really offer \\"proof\\" of God. Notice he calls section one, \\"Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe.\\" Lewis views our relationship with God not in scientific but in personal terms. God does not force faith on His wayward children, but drops hints for those who are seeking, is his assumption. Life is not an equation, but an adventure, even a romance with truth.Some suggest a loophole in Lewis' famous \\"Liar, Lunatic, or Lord\\" argument for the deity of Christ. Jesus' words were misrepresented by his followers, they say: he didn't really make the claims the Gospels say he did. Here again, remember that Lewis is trying to be concise. Originally, he did mention this possibility, but his comments were edited for time. If you want his answer to that objection (still a very devastating answer, if you are familiar with Jesus Seminar material), you'll find it in his essay, Fernseed and Elephants. The argument is also more fully developed in the first chapters of \\"On the Man Called Christ,\\" in part two of Everlasting Man, where I guess Lewis found it in the first place.There are books with a more empirical approach to the existence of God; Hugh Ross' book on the Anthropic Principle, Creator and the Cosmos, for example, or Don Richardson's Eternity in Their Hearts, that shows how God has worked in cultures around the world. NT Wright's series on the \\"historical Jesus\\" is deeply enlightening.My own new book, The Truth Behind the New Atheism, answers a couple objections Interested Observer makes below, and I think gives a pretty forceful response to Dawkins & Co generally.But I don't know any modern popular author of any viewpoint who can hold a candle to Lewis or Chesterton in terms of expressing deep truths in simple words. There are truths here that will enrich you the rest of your life, if you lay hold of them."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"My husband and I have enjoyed listening to these tapes each week before our class. We feel as if C. S. Lewis himself is talking to us! Great addition to our personal resources!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a fantastic, fantastic book--especially for those who are on the fence regarding Christianity or religion in general. Lewis writes from a unique point of view: an atheist who converted to Christianity. And as an Oxford professor, he has a seemingly innate ability to look at issues from every point of view and reach a logical conclusion. If you're not a Christian, don't worry about being offended by emotional rhetoric or bored by the same old, same old. If you're already a Christian, this book will spur you to think about why you believe what you believe and will help you explain it to others. Lewis is widely regarded as one of the best Christian writers in history."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is truly fascinating in every aspect. It gives a firm foundation of logical proof that God in fact exists, and that Christ is the way to Him. All the logic goes step by step from page 1, building brick on top of brick to a proof that simply cannot be shattered. I have nine of Lewis' books, but this is the only one I've finished as of yet. I do, however, recommend The Problem of Pain, by Lewis. It's excellent so far."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If I could only have one book besides the Bible, this is the book I would choose! I re-read this book every year or so.

I have read and re-read &quot;Mere Chistianity&quot; several times and each time gaining new insight. Next to the Holy Bible it holds a place of regular usage."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book thinking that it would be an argument for Christianity. Instead, the book assumes that you have already accepted Christianity and want to know where to go from there.Some of the arguments are VERY weak (ex. The universe must have meaning because we have a concept of meaning. It's like if we lived in a world of all darkness we would not have a concept of light) The light and dark part are true because we can only see things as light and dark. But we have a concept of meaning in almost everything that we do. Not just the universe.Also some of the thoughts are a bit dated (Couples should stay together because the woman must have sacrificed her career for raising children).For someone looking for a book that will \\"prove\\" or \\"convince\\" him or her that there is a god, this book is not for you. It presents too many theories as fact and uses them as a basis for all its arguments. The non-believer should look else where for a compelling argument of the other side."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was disappointed in the quality of this book.

This is not an easy read, but worth every minute you spend with it. To Lewis, and to me, history has moved Christianity beyond the need to prove itself (if one knows even a little history), so he sets out to explain it. And does so magnificently. And if you need a simple, honest book about dealing with grief, read his book, A Grief Observed, about the death of his wife."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book gives me the impression of having been written as a discourse. I liked the ideas expressed about total christianity, the fact that we have to abide by the rules of christianity if we are to call ourselves 'christian'.

It is an excellent book that clarified and strengthened my beliefs in Christianity. I had many doubts about Christianity before, but this book has helped me significantly. The philosophy inside has also helped me to explain Christianity to my non-Christian friends as well, and I believe that it has helped some of them (who were knowledgeable about Christianity, but didn't believe in Christianity for years) to begin to explore Christianity more seriously."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It works in three parts, putting forward an argument for the existence of God, then for Christianity, then for Christian doctrine.

I don't think there wil be one thing that you disagree on when you read this book. There are a lot of moments, while reading it, where you say 'oh!' and 'wow, that's true.' It will make you jump up for joy to be alive. It really is a testament of faith. This author, C.S. Lewis used to be an athiest until he converted to christianity. So he knows eactly what questions to answer. Another part of God's work, I say. A perfect companion to the Bible. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Many of the 'bad' reviews given to this book have a point. Mere Christianity is over-simplistic and does have it's logical flaws. Appealing to a 'common morality' among all people is simply too problematic to be useful as a apologetic. He has certainly written better books (see 'The Abolition of Man').That said, there are redeeming qualities to the book. Overall, it is smart and educated. Not all of the arguments Lewis uses are so problematic as the aforementioned. And it certainly cannot be dismissed as quickly as some have (after 5 chapters in one case apparently). This is a book that should be treated seriously, for there is much to give thought to.In the end, there are better books of Christian apologetics. G.K. Chesterson's Orthodoxy being one of the best."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Thank God for C.S. Lewis. An atheist until age 28, he worked out his Christianity from a totally intellectual standpoint and then passed it on to us. This guy is clearly an intellectual giant with a gift for making very simple and clear answers to huge questions. He also, in his genius, is chock full of ideas and will address many other aspects of religion that you may not have ever considered, but will find most interesting to ponder. There are many times where I have found myself reading this book in preference to The Bible, which should attest to the value of it.One of the most intriguing ideas he elaborates on is his notion that most people have the opportunity to go to heaven but actually choose hell instead because they are unwilling to give up their worldly attachments. Just think about how that would be 'The Great Divorce'.His chapter on why pride is the worst sin was also especially thought-provoking.This book is one that I'll keep the rest of my life as a spiritual guide unlike any other and the best other than the Bible that I have ever read. It has expanded my thoughts and elevated my Christianity to a higher plane. I only wish I had known about it much, much sooner."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S.Lewis has the ability to teach us why Christianity makes sense and why God Himself, makes sense. In words we can all understand he lays out the various reasons to accept Christianity and why it is right and intelligent to do so.As a previous Athiest, his commentary on why we should believe as he does is even more umnderstandable as he takes it from concept to certainty. Very well written by a very smart guy. Written during WWII in England it is also a commentary on the war, in some parts, in relation to good and evil.Another book that should be read by all believers and non-believers alike is \\"I don\\"t have enough faith to be an Athiest\\" written by Norman Geisler and Frank Turek. For the believer it is all you need to make sound arguments for why you believe and for the non-believer I challenge you to continue in non-belief after you read the definitive evidence in these pages."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"8/29/09C.

What a great and inspired man.Geri Grant"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Chistianity is divided into 4 books: 1. Right & Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe, 2. What Christians Believe, 3. Christian Behavior, and 4. Beyond Personality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity.In Book 1, Lewis strikes an early, direct blow against relativistic thinking: \\"If anyone will take the time to compare the moral teaching of, say the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Hindus, Chinesese, Greeks and Romans, what will really strike him will be how very like they are to each other and to our own\\" (p. 6). There are basic, universal moral standards: \\"men find themselves under a moral law, which they did not make, and cannot quite forget even when they try, and which they know they ought to obey\\" (p.23). \\"I am under a law; that somebody or something wants me to behave in a certain way\\" (p. 25). Who but God wrote this law on my heart?Personally, I've never met anyone who denied that Jesus was a great moral teacher. Yet, in one way or another, plenty of people try to deny His Divinity. In Book 2, Lewis tries \\"to prevent the really foolish thing that people often say about Him. \`I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God'....A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic [sic]...or else he would be the Devil of Hell\\" (p. 52). Along these very same lines,Peter Kreeft and Ronald Tacellipresent the options as \\"Lord, Lunatic, or Liar.\\" \\"Now the Christian belief is that if we somehow share the humility and suffering of Christ we shall also share in His conquest of death and find a new life after we have died and in it become perfect, and perfectly happy creatures. This means something much more than our trying to follow His teaching\\" (p. 60).In contrast to any notion that God's law is intrusive, oppressive, or stifling, Lewis starts 1943's Book 3 with the reminder that \\"moral rules are directions for running the human machine\\" (p. 69). Explaining the \\"cardinal virtues\\" (i.e., prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance), he notes that \\"a man who perseveres in doing just actions gets in the end a certain quality of character. Now it is that quality rather than the particular actions which we mean when we talk of a \`virtue'\\" (p. 80). Book 3 closes with chapters devoted to forgiveness and pride, as well as the \\"theological virtues\\" of faith, hope, and charity.Considering that Lewis was a member of the Church of England, which had approved limited contraceptive use in 1930, much of his commentary on sexual morality is prophetic: \\"Contraceptives have made sexual indulgence far less costly in marriage and far safer outside it than ever before, and public opinion is less hostile to illicit unions and even to perversion than it has been since Pagan times....Christianity is almost [sic] the only one of the great religions which thoroughly approves of the body - which believes that matter is good, that God Himself once took on a body, that some kind of body is going to be given to us even in Heaven....Christianity has glorified marriage more than any other religion: and nearly all the greatest love poetry in the world has been produced by Christians. If anyone says that sex, in itself, is bad, Christianity contradicts him at once\\" (pp. 97, 98). \\"We may, indeed, be sure that perfect chastity - like perfect charity - will not be attained by any merely human efforts. You must ask for God's help....those who are seriously attempting chastity are more conscious, and soon know a great deal more about their own sexuality than anyone else....Virtue - even attempted virtue - brings light; indulgence brings fog\\" (pp. 101, 102).I say that \\"much of his commentary on sexual morality is prophetic,\\" because Lewis also offered some well-intentioned, yet poorly thought out, comments on marriage and sexuality:* \\"If people do not believe in permanent marriage, it is perhaps better that they should live together unmarried than they should make vows that they do not mean to keep\\" (p. 106).* \\"There ought to be two distinct kinds of marriage: one governed by the State with rules enforced on all citizens, the other governed by the Church with rules enforced by her on her own members\\" (p. 112).I am among those who believe that, had Lewis lived longer, he would have embraced the fullness of the Truth which resides in Catholicism. How much his works would have been enhanced, were they informed by our generation'sCatechism of the Catholic Churchor theCompendium of the Catechism!In book 4, Lewis acknowledges the attraction of \\"a vague religion - all about feeling God in nature, and so on\\" (p. 155). He warns that such touchy-feely, pseudo-religion cannot lead to \\"eternal life by simply feeling the presence of God in flowers or music....a great many of the ideas about God which are trotted out as novelties today are simply the ones which real Theologians tried centuries ago and rejected\\" (p. 155). \\"If Christianity was something we were making up, of course we could make it easier. But it is not. We cannot compete, in simplicity, with people who are inventing religions. How could we? We are dealing with Fact.\\" \\"The more we get what we now call \`ourselves' out of the way and let Him take us over, the more truly ourselves we become....It is when I turn to Christ, when I give myself up to His personality, that I first begin to have a real personality of my own....How monotonously alike all the great tyrants and conquerors have been: how gloriously different are the saints....submit with every fiber of your being, and you will find eternal life\\" (pp. 225 - 227)."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"this book is truly inspired.he speaks with such authority that could only come from the presence of God.this book was not based much on intellectual research but divine insight and experiential knowledge.i recommend this book to anyone who seeks more than just religion.this is true human philosophy; not the varied theories and opinions we have of humanity but the truth about humanity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis will make you think deeply and give strong arguments on the existence of God. He's my favorite Christian author because he doesn't have to throw the book at you to make you realize the existence of God. He argues the scientific aspect of it, presents philosophical arguments about the existence of God, and then makes atheists think again about how and why God exists and makes Christians even more confident that the Lord is alive and well. On top of that C.S. Lewis used to be a strong atheist but his friendship with J.R. Tolkien helped him consider otherwise."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Clive Staples Lewis was indeed an intellectual giant. His insight into human nature was amazing. I was surprised that his life span overlapped mine (He lived 1898 to 1963.). I was delighted that he came to the same conclusion at how God can know the future and we can still have free will. (It involves an appreciation of the fact that time is different for God.)There were times when C.S. got close but couldn't quite get there because he didn't have the benefit of the greater light of the restored gospel. But on the whole, he had a good grasp of what Christ taught and how we should live after the manner of happiness."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a step-by-step path to reinforcing the faith journey.

Based on his feedback, it was a huge success on the gift-giving front! The actual book is huge, because of the multiple books in it; it looks more like a college textbook than a book to read outside by the pool. Besides that, it is an awesome collection of C.S.

Someone who used to be an atheist told me to read this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity was written not as a \\"Christian book\\", but as a series of radio broadcasts during the horrors of World War II. Its author is not a theologian, or even a Christian Inspirational Writer, but a soldier and medievalist/Renaissance scholar: a beer-drinking chain-smoking man who considered himself \\"a very ordinary layman.\\" (6) He speaks in a spirit of love and service to show the Christian religion to the non-Christian, and to \\"defend the common belief that has been common to all Christians at all times.\\"Lewis shows the importance of peace between Christian denominations, all of which he believed to be equal. I first used this excellent product shortly after I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior at age sixteen, and suddenly felt a need to leave the denomination into which I was born. Lewis' words are very reassuring for anyone experiencing similar spiritual struggles, as the denomination in which I was born and the denomination in which I was baptized, while strikingly different from each other on a superficial level, are in essence completely equal, although, as I have learned from Lewis' philosophy, there is a degree of appropriateness for each individual Believer in his or her particular chosen denomination. Yet Lewis cautions Christians not to discuss the differences between denominations except among fellow Christians. Experience has taught me this makes perfect sense.Lewis vehemently speaks out against the rampant sin of legalism as he discusses the virtue of \\"temperance.\\" If one wants to completely abstain from alcohol, one may, but a Christian ought not to pass judgment on those Christians who, as Lewis and his wife and brother did, enjoy their beer! He also points out that those who devote their lives to any thing, such as clothes or games or motorcycles are as intemperate as those who drink alcohol to excess. Lewis' wife Joy Davidman goes one step further in her clear exposition on the Ten Commandments in which she takes Lewis' concept of intemperance one step further by classifying it as idolatry.Lewis strongly promotes the Christian work ethic and puts the responsibilities of the Christian writer into perspective. If all work performed by Christians counts as Christian service, then all excellent books written by Christians are Christian books. If, in Lewis' words, \\"Christian literature comes from Christian novelists and dramatists . . .\\", then perhaps most of us are in possession of four of the greatest Christian books ever written: Tolkien's Hobbit and Lord of the Rings!Lewis brings Christian morality to the forefront, but I believe the very people who recoil in fear at the mention of the subject are the ones who may need to take comfort in his words, as Lewis shows how the deadliest of all sin is pride, from which springs other sins such as legalism. He calls Pride the chief misery in every nation and shows how \\"other vices may bring people together\\". Conversely, I have learned from Lewis that humility, the opposite of pride, is not the belief that one is inferior to everybody else, but that everybody is superior to that one person. Many of us are humble at Christmas anyway as we think about what to give our relatives and friends as signs of love and appreciation. From my many readings of Mere Christianity, I learned that the best way to be humble is to behave as if every day was Christmas Day!From a purely cultural perspective, Lewis' scholarship is stellar, and a Druid friend to whom I gave a copy of Mere Christianity, while remaining a staunch Druid, admires Lewis' clear writing and sharp perspectives.I first used this product when I was a fledgling Christian myself. I have been using this product for over thirty years now and have not only been recommending it highly, but have been giving it as gifts![[ASIN:066424680X Smoke on the Mountain: An Interpretation of the Ten Commandments]]J.R.R.

Lewis was once an atheist who later embraced Jesus Christ. Lewis went on to become a passionate and articulate defender of classical Christianity. \\"Mere Christianity\\" is considered to be his magnum opus defense of Christian belief.In \\"Mere Christianity,\\" Lewis strikes at the core of what Christians - all Christians - believe to be true about God and the world God has created. The title, which sounds strange today, simply refers to commonly shared beliefs among all Christians: Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, etc. Lewis begins with the Moral Argument for God's existence, moving ever closer to the person of Jesus Christ. The latter half of the book addresses what Christians belief BECAUSE of who we believe Jesus to be. He touches on issues of sexuality, sacraments, virtues, etc.Some of Lewis' language is a bit dated. His beliefs about gender roles and marriage may also rub some readers/listeners the wrong way. But none of these detract from the significance of this book.You can \\"read\\" MC as a superb audiobook, available through [...]. Geoffrey Howard, the audiobook narrator, is fantastic. I'm so glad they found a British narrator to read a book by a British author. I read the book in print long before I listened to it, but I enjoy the book well enough to re-read it - and I assume that audiobook actually gets closer to MC's original presentation as a series of radio broadcasts.Check out my earlier post on good books for non-Christians and new Christians.

Now C.S. Lewis is one of the most famous Christians around with his The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe books and movies like the Chronicles of Narnia. He gets a little sciency in some parts, but it's a great book to help you figure out where you stand with your beliefs."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a compilation of knowledge that can be used in a life plan.

Lewis transcends books, which I happen to value highly. It transcends wealth, a comfortable home, a comfortable life. It is, as such, accrued wisdom: valuable over the long-term, perhaps less so for some in the here and now. I purchased this volume when I read that Mere Christianity [included] was at least partially responsible for removing the \\"a\\" from an atheist of note. I am not one (of note nor otherwise), but was struggling somewhat. I was fortunate, for this is where C.S. Lewis shines.From apologia such as Mere Christianity to the personal, and deeply moving A Grief Observed, C.S. Lewis provides his crystal clear view of the \\"why's\\" and \\"how's\\" that many a reflective person ponders. But, he provides more than salve. His is an exploration that presents challenges as well: responsibility, inevitability, cause and effect. It is not all celestial repose.The Complete C.S. Lewis has dislodged that which rested in my favored book spot upon the library coffee table. I feel as though a life-long education has been accelerated by a quantum leap. There are those who will think it inconvenient, impractical, or worse. But, C.S. Lewis presents God to those wishing to learn of Him. The opinions of those who wish otherwise are, at least in this arena, of little account. 5 huge, life-affirming stars."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is just that - the basics. C. S. Lewis was a man who refused to argue about the details. He placed a great importance on the central beliefs. This book is a collection of various works, and covers the basic elements of the Christian faith. I would highly recommend Mere Christianity for anyone; but especially for young people in their twenties. Some of the most seemingly difficult points of scripture are explained here in plain english. This is the place to start."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is the most important book you can read after the Bible. If you are searching for the meaning of your life, if you think there's gotta be more than what we see and perceive in our earthly existence, if your heart tells you to honestly seek for the truth, look no further; no other book will help you discover it. Actually God is reachable to everyone. You only have to be willing to put aside those obstacles in your vision. C. S. Lewis is not out there to \\"get you\\", nor preach to you. He'll help you figure it out yourself better than any other philosopher or scientist.Some people will start looking for God by means of their intellectual curiosity, others will do it out of despair and sheer anguish, and others simply draw near Him out of love for His Son Jesus Christ. Whatever means to start your search is good as long as it is honest. (But remember that faith is a gift that God gives you, not that you give to yourself).The book deals in its first short chapters with Natural Law, and it explains the difference with the laws of nature, e.g. gravity, etc. The language is simple enough for anybody to understand (if I understand it anybody can). Natural Law is still one of the unrefutable evidences for the existence of God that nobody can deny, or explain. Human Genome Project founder Francis Collins explains this very clearly too in his book 'The Language of God'. By the way, Collins says that the other choice we, humans, have in order to understand our nature is accepting that life is the result of an infinite series of miraculous \\"coincidences\\" or chances, whose probability are, each one of them, infinitely small.I am reading this book for the second time, now in Spanish (Amazon doesn't let me publish my review to the Spanish edition). I am underlining almost every line. There is so much to think about here. But I'd like to quote the following lines:\\"In religion, as in war and in everything else, consolation is the only thing that cannot be obtained by searching for it. If you look for the truth, you may find consolation in the end. If you look for consolation you will not find neither consolation nor the truth... only empty talk and preestablished conceptions to start with, and in the end, despair.\\"And this reminds me so much of one of Peter Kreeft's funny stories: When you were a child and believed in Santa, it made you feel comfortable and happy. Then why, when you grew up, did you stop believing in him? Why care for the truth if you can be happy?Approach it honestly; and God bless us all who so seek Him, for we shall surely find Him."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A confirmed agnostic of many years, I believed Christianity was illogical and no reasoning person could believe in it. C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity proved me wrong. Lewis uses reason and logic to convince readers that Christianity not only makes sense, it is TRUE.

Lewis writes as if he's sitting in a comfortable chair next to you in a quiet sitting room, pausing only to allow a point to sink in or to light his pipe.(I believe this book actually started a series of radio talks in England during the very dark days of World World II).I have filled a page with the names of people I've given this book to (I had to start keeping track to avoid giving someone a second copy!).MERE CHRISTIANITY is a book for any believer to reaffirm their faith and for any open-minded person to hear its argument far away from the red-faced hysterics that usually accompany such matters.No matter who you are, it will challenge your world."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is one of only a few books I have ever read, and re-read, and re-read, and read again. C.S. Lewis uses simple, yet comprehensive, arguments that lead the reader to the inarguable conclusion that Jesus was in fact God. The way in which the argument unfolds is simply masterful; almost like a well written murder mystery where the villian was visible all along, but you just couldn't quite figure it out. Then all at once the answer hits you!Lewis goes on to explain how the Christian faith interacts with the individual and with society in general. C.S. Lewis does this without any bias to a particular Christian dogma, instead opting to address the common beliefs of all Christian religions.This book will be enjoyed by anyone who is unsure of the existence of God or unsure of who Jesus is. It will also be enjoyed by firm believers for its simple style. A must read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I feel somewhat foolish giving C.S. Lewis a book review. Formerly a rigid atheist, Lewis tested the tenets of Christianity with his intellect. This was no small test. Lewis, an Oxford alumni and professor, put his faith in the one who claimed to be the Messiah to a people needing salvation.If you are searching for absolute truth, or if you seek something more than what you see from your so-called &quot;Christian&quot; neighbors, read this book. If you are an agnostic, read this book. Atheist? Read the book. Do you go to church every Sunday? Read it! Frequent the bars? It's okay. Read the book at the bar. I guarantee that C.S. Lewis will paint an attractive picture of what Christianity is all about. You will not feel threatened. You will not be judged. I will, however, guarantee a mental work-out. Further, you will see Christianity for what it truly is. No, seriously."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I got this book after hearing a series of lectures on CS Lewis. I already love his writing and this review is not a reflection on him as a writer. I dislike the SIZE of this anthology. Far from being a volume that you can curl up with or take on a trip in the car, this is a coffee table book and can really only be read sitting at a table or desk. I took it on a road trip and had to stop reading because of the size (like 24 inches by 12 inches - really big).I did return this book and I guess will buy the volumes separately so that I can enjoy them anywhere."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As with any art form, whether painting, sculpture, or literature, there are works that you review and there are works that review you.

I am only saying that if anyone wants to understand the basics of orthodox Christianity, that person must contend with this work. It is probably the broadest, simpliest, statement on Christian doctrine penned in the 20th century. It is probably responsible for more people converting to the Christian faith than any other 20th century book.If you are a Christian and have not wrestled with the concepts of this book, do not call yourself a scholar. If you are not a Christian and are interested in the faith, this book is a great starting place.

It is ideal for the intellectual non-Christian who is struggling with the claims of Christ, mentally wrestling with the truth of His message and the need of salvation and new birth. It is also helpful for the new believer to understand better his faith and his relationship with his Lord.Lewis here is profound, yet practical. His words are holy, yet extremely human. This book is actually a compilation of three separate titles by Lewis, the first of which was copyrighted in 1943.

Whether through symbolism in the Great Divorce, biting satire in the Screwtape Letters, or unflinching logic in Mere Christianity his brilliance shows through clearly. \\"The Complete C. S. Lewis Signature Classics\\" contains his seven most popular works - Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, Miracles, The Great Divorce, The Problem of Pain, A Grief Observed, and The Abolition of Man. While I read many of these years ago as a young Christian and college student this is the first compendium that I have reviewed. Make no mistake about it; this is a collector's edition in all respects - hardbound, nice dust jacket, crisp quality printing, and even an attached ribbon bookmark.\\"Mere Christianity\\" presents the basic tenets of Christianity. C. S. Lewis breaks the book up into four parts - Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe, What Christians Believe, Christian Behaviour, and Beyond Personality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity. This book is one of the most commonly recommended books for new Christians and those who want to understand basic Christian doctrine from a well-rounded apologetics point of view.\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" has been one of my favorite books for many years. While it is fictional it soon becomes quite clear that we are dealing with real world problems. Through thirty-one letters to his nephew, Wormwood, Screwtape consoles and instructs him in how to keep his \\"patient\\" from becoming a Christian or at least from becoming an effective one. Using the vehicle of these letters C. S. Lewis examines various issues and problems of the Christian life. For example, he points out to Wormwood that if he can make his \\"patient\\" start going all over town looking for a church that \\"suits\\" him instead of being loyal to his local church it will reduce his effectiveness. By searching for the \\"suitable\\" church he learns to be a critic of churches instead of a pupil of Christianity. Not to mention that the \\"congregational principle\\" makes each church into a kind of club for a specific type of person and eventually that becomes a faction. Each letter points out one or more of the insidious ways that a Christian or church can be slowly changed into nothing more than an ineffective shell.\\"Miracles\\" is an examination of the possibility that supernatural events happen in the world. Within the pages C. S. Lewis develops a compelling argument for the existence of miracles and God's personal interaction with the world. Lewis examines miracles not only in the light of Christian belief but also addresses the positions of agnostics and rationalists and shows why their view is less tenable than the existence of miracles.\\"The Great Divorce\\" is another fictional tale in which the narrator takes a bus ride and visits both heaven and hell.On this fanciful trip he meets supernatural beings and those who have passed on to be consigned to one or the other. Through discussion and observation he soon realizes that the people who are consigned to hell are there because they refuse to give up even minor sinful thoughts for the greatness of heaven. It is sure to challenge your concept of sin, heaven, and hell.In \\"The Problem of Pain\\" C. S. Lewis examines one of the most common questions of Christianity. If God is all-knowing and all-loving then why is there pain and suffering? He deftly deals with that question from a generic point of view and does an excellent job. You have to realize that it is not specific and so will not answer why something happened to someone in particular. However, reading it does help provide a positive understanding of how pain and suffering can actually be a tool to grab our attention and to purify us for heaven.\\"A Grief Observed\\" is one of the best books on grief and working through the effect that it can have on your faith. After losing his wife, C. S. Lewis comes to face grief and the feelings of anger and doubt toward God that often accompany such a loss. Here we see a strong Christian and apologeticist having his faith shaken to the core and come to understand that these feelings are a normal part of grief. However, over time he comes around to working through his grief to a stronger understanding and deeper relationship with God.\\"The Abolition of Man\\" examines moral relativism and education. C. S. Lewis argues that all morals are not relative, some are absolute. His examination of the issues also applies very well to today's concerns with situational ethics. Lewis points out that due to poor education, bad logic, and the advances of science mankind will eventually destroy itself.If you would like a collection of some of his best known works in a solid collectible single volume you will want to add this one to your library. \\"The Complete C. S. Lewis Signature Classics\\" is a very highly recommended purchase whether to read for the first time or as a quality edition for the C. S. Lewis enthusiast."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In his \\"Preface to Paradise Lost\\", Lewis wrote the following:\\"The first qualification for judging any piece of workmanship from a corkscrew to a cathedral is to know *what* it is - what it was intended to do and how it was meant to be used. After that has been discovered the temperance reformer may decide that the corkscrew was made for a bad purpose, and the communist may think the same about the cathedral. But such questions come later. The first thing is to understand the object before you: as long as you think the corkscrew was meant for opening tins or the cathedral for entertaining tourists you can say nothing to purpose about them.\\"This is a splendid piece of writing, but the idea presented is no way an original one - Plato and Aristotle said the same, said it clearly, and said it over two thousand years before Lewis did. If you had been able to confront Lewis with this fact, he might have said \\"Exactly.\\"This brings us to one of the great themes of Lewis's writing, evident nowhere more so than in \\"Mere Christianity\\": the defense of traditional wisdom against prejudice of our age that would reject it for no other reason than that it is traditional. Lewis often encountered those who complained that his ideas were old-fashioned, and his standard reply was that theirs would soon be as well, so in that they were equal. I admit I couldn't help but smile at the complaint by one Amazon reviewer that Lewis's ideas on sexuality were \\"decades old\\". The complaint is quite mistaken: the ideas are not decades old but thousands of years old.And it is here that we have part of the answer to the problem of understanding the kind of thing \\"Mere Christianity\\" is: it is nothing new. It is in fact very, very old. What Lewis is defending is not his own personal belief system, but the Christianity that is the common heritage of mankind. The threat to it comes not from hard-core atheists, who receive the barest of notices from Lewis, but the general modern tendency to subject traditional Christianity to the death of a thousand cuts - discarding one ancient doctrine after another, on grounds often no better than mere chronological snobbery - that modern people aren't supposed to believe that kind of thing anymoreThis is why Lewis, in what has been often described as the most important defense of Christianity in the twentieth century, spends a mere fifteen pages in arguing for the existence of God. The important task is not to defend a vague theism, which is the position Lewis found from experience that his audience already believed, but to rebuild what little of traditional Christianity modernism has left them - some vague belief in \\"a higher power\\", and \\"some purpose to all of this\\" into that concrete set of specific beliefs that are the historical core of Christianity.While the defense of historical Christianity is one part of understanding what \\"Mere Christianity\\" is, the other part is that it is intended to be accessible to anyone. This requires that Lewis be both clear and brief - a combination brutally difficult to achieve, as any writer who has attempted it will attest.Lewis's success in this can be measured in two ways: first, that his work has indeed found a very wide readership - millions of have read it; second, his work is often recommended by those whose knowledge of traditional Christian theology is broad and deep. The size of the readership attests to the accessibility of the work, and the expert recommendations attest to the accuracy of its message.There is one other thing that is important to note about Lewis's success: Lewis could afford to be brief because what he was explaining was not his own theology, but our common intellectual inheritance. The reader who is dissatisfied with the depth of this or that point in \\"Mere Christianity\\" will have no difficulty in finding sources that go into the same thing in much greater detail. Calvin wrote line-by-line commentaries on all of scripture. Thomas Aquinas's \\"Summa Theologica\\" is over 6,000 pages long. The collected works of Augustine fill more than 40 volumes.So, to return to the question with which this review began: what kind of thing is \\"Mere Christianity\\"? The answer is that it is a brief exposition of traditional Christianity for a modern audience. In the sixty years since it was published, the nature of the modernist challenge to Christianity has not substantially changed, nor has a clearer, more accessible response to that challenge yet been written. Some have complained that the work has \\"gaps\\" or that it skims over this or that point, but that is a complaint that fails to understand what kind of thing this is. What they are asking for, whether they know it or not, is a completely different book. Properly evaluated, on the basis of the kind of thing it is, it is trivially easy to give the highest recommendation to \\"Mere Christianity\\": it is on a topic of the greatest possible importance and the presentation is outstanding."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"CS Lewis is one of the great modern Christian writers. His writings are non-denominational, and can be appreciated by people of any faith. This box set contains some (though not all!) of his best work.'Mere Christianity' is a great introduction to Lewis's way of thinking. Originally a series of radio addresses, this work details why Lewis is a Christian, and presents a case for Christianity that is compelling, to say the least.'The Screwtape Letters' is my personal favorite. It is fiction, written from the unique point of view of a master devil named Screwtape. The master is trying to teach his nephew how to win souls for the devil through temptation. This one will definitely change the way you look at sin.'The Problem of Pain.' -- what is pain? Well, Lewis tackles this subject here, and argues that God gives us pain because he loves us, and in order to mold us to his will.'A Grief Observed' is a very intimate work, written after Lewis's wife died. It is, quite simply, a very honest and unique look at grieving, which shows this master Christian apologist, who seems to always have all the answers, vulnerable and without a solution.'The Great Divorce' is Lewis's 'Divine Comedy.' This is a great look at Heaven and Hell, and presents the very compelling idea that people will go to Hell, not because they are forced to, but because they simply won't tolerate Heaven.'Miracles' examines the question \\"can miracles occur?\\" For Lewis, the answer is yes, and this book shows how the Creator of Nature and mankind can work miracles without interrupting the 'natural' flow of things.Buying these books together in a set is a good way to get these six classics at a great price. This is a wonderful starting point for anyone interested in Christian theology. No one interested in Christian thinker should be without these masterpieces by CS Lewis."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis is remarkable in his depth of faith and logic while remaining consistently humble about his opinions. Also, he purposefully avoids denominational battles or speaking on denominational doctrines, focusing on Christ instead. When he discusses Christianity, he makes every effort to avoid advancing a denominational agenda and focuses on the things that unite Christians instead. CS Lewis is a refreshing breeze to those who believe that we should be presenting a united front to the world.Contents:MERE CHRISTIANITY: An excellent exposition on the necessity of a good, personal God based on observational and philosophical evidence. He then moves to an argument that Christ is a \\"personality\\" of that creator God and that Christianity follows \\"naturally\\" from what we have already acknowledged to be true. His arguments are 100% as true and effective today as they were when written - I find myself using them today (and surprisingly, belief systems that portray themselves as more \\"rational\\" have not yet responded to these criticisms in the past 75 years or so...)THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS: one can chillingly find the demon Screwtape's suggestions being carried out in our own actions on a regular basis. CS Lewis has an intuition of human nature!MIRACLES, THE PROBLEM OF PAIN: these two didn't thrill me, but we each respond to different things. Lewis at least develops these ideas very well and that development was interesting.THE GREAT DIVORCE: This was my favorite work. Lewis displays once again a keen insight into human nature, set in the backdrop of arriving at Paradise from Purgatory and having to shed their old selves before they are willing to enter Heaven.A GRIEF OBSERVED: This chronicles the spiritual journey of CS Lewis after his wife's [end of life]. It is very open and honest, and thus very painful to read. Sometimes we benefit by reading of others' trials as well as their triumphs.THE ABOLITION OF MAN: A fascinating analysis of post-modernism and where it will lead us."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"After reading several books on a similar topic that did nothing but confuse me, I was glad that I came upon C.S. Lewis's work. All of the other books about the existence of God are way off in their own world, and discourage anyone who feels lost in their ideas about God. This book really explained the reasons that God must exist, and then moved on to easily describe the major beliefs of Christians, without leaving anyone out in the cold on what the key issues actually are. This book is perfect for the agnostic, the atheist, and even the Christian that wants to know the logical and simple reasons that C.S. Lewis came to be a Christian. Over and over, his words made me see even the simplest concepts of religion in a completely new light. I was greatly impressed and have already read this book multiple times."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis rejects the boundaries that divide Christianity's many denominations. While religious belief is not a concern for some, to many more it is an extremely serious decision, requiring deep thought and the entire energy of the mind.In Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis leads all the Christian religions to common ground. This book is in fact a defense of the beliefs common to all Christians at all times. Originally, these ideas were contained in three separate books. Prior to 1943 they were only heard as informal radio broadcasts. This is why you will see colloquialisms used and the conversational style of the writing.When you read C. S. Lewis' work, you can hear his voice. Sometimes I forget I am reading. Like a friend with a cup of coffee in hand, he sits across from us. He then leads us up a ladder of logical thinking. He starts on the lowest step and gives us confidence to climb the next step. He guides us through an incredible thought process to a conclusion, which is perhaps so logical it becomes irrevocable truth.If you were to fall off a real ladder, your body would simply be obeying the laws of Gravity. He brilliantly explains how there is an eternal Law of Human Nature. This is the law of how mankind \\"ought\\" to behave in order to maintain a safe and happy society where everyone plays fair. Unfortunately, we all know how our society has failed to practice this law in all aspects of life.If you want a definition for this law it can only be \\"morals.\\" A word from which many reel, as if a light was shining brightly in their eyes. To others: it is a light by which they see the path they walk through life. C. S. Lewis divides morality into three main sections: the actions, reasons behind the actions and why man was created. When you realize that different beliefs about the universe can make us behave differently; you can then make some compelling arguments in favor of Christianity.C. S. Lewis was an atheist (as was my father once and his writing reminds me of a conversation with my father for some reason, perhaps they came to some of the same conclusions) who later became a Christian. He is perhaps one of the most qualified individuals to discuss a universe at war, for the idea of atheism and Christianity could not be more diametrically opposed.\\"Good and evil both increase at compound interest. That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance.\\" --C. S. LewisLike a voice from the grave (he passed away in 1963), C. S. Lewis speaks as if this message was for the year 2000. I read this work 53 years after it was written and the truths are still eternal. Good and Evil are perhaps the oldest concept we know of. I found it interesting when he pointed out that without good, evil would not exist. That good allows evil to occur. For example: selfishness is undesirable, while unselfishness is desirable. The basis for this is founded in some deep religious beliefs. He explains how this all relates to the moral laws of nature.I enjoyed his discussion of the Theological Virtues (Faith/Hope/Charity) and the Cardinal (pivotal) Virtues (Prudence/Temperance/Justice/Fortitude). His chapter on the issue of \\"Pride\\" (the most evil of all vices) also shows how \\"power\\" is what pride wants.\\"There is nothing that makes a man feel more superior to others as being able to move them about like toy soldiers.\\" --C. S. LewisThrough this book, you will gain a greater understanding of what holds us all together, what makes us responsible to one another. You may even conclude that those who find morals threatening, may in fact be the largest threat to a civilized society. If we all had morals we would simply have a safer environment to thrive and be happy in. It is simply the way you look at it.Mere Christianity is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read to date! If you are at all interested in the logical basis for Christianity, this book goes to the depths of thought and reveals the essence of the beliefs behind the beliefs. This book becomes perfume, which completely seduces your soul.For Christians, it will be a reminder of the truth you hold dear and a reminder of our eternal life. For those who love the Narnia Chronicles, page 146 gives you an insight into the \\"time factor.\\" (The children in the story can leave the material world and when they return, time never changes.)One of my favorite quotes from Mere Christianity:\\" When it (Christianity) tells you to feed the hungry it does not give you a lesson in cookery.\\" --C. S. Lewis, page 79On page 87 you will also find a beautiful passage. It is my all-time favorite passage to explain LIFE! It is a must read.This book will put your brain in gear and send you on a drive to enlightenment. I intend to read every one of Lewis' books. His work is deep, yet understandable. Eternally Recommended.C. S. Lewis is my all-time favorite author. I was first introduced to his writing as a very young child in second grade. It was then that I fell in love with his writing. Through the Narnia Chronicles, C.S. Lewis weaves the morals and beliefs children need to learn.I recommend Mere Christianity for non-Christians and Christians. For all children, The Chronicles of Narnia will enlighten them and they will never forget the stories! I also reviewed the set. They are the most magical stories a child can read. Mere Christianity is perhaps the most brilliant explanation for Christian beliefs any adult can read.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"IMPORTANT: This review is about the physical product being shipped when you orderC. S. Lewis Signature Classics: Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, A Grief Observed, The Problem of Pain, Miracles, and The Great Divorce (Boxed Set).

For the content of these volumes: 5/5 stars. You needn't look very far to find many high-quality 5-star reviews of Lewis' work.However, this physical product is one of the lowest-quality publishing jobs I've ever seen. I don't think HarperCollins (or anyone) should ever try to pass this edition off as the same product as the earlier edition box set depicted in the product pictures. The original 2001 box set has different art, different typesetting, different dimensions, different paper, etc., etc. the list goes on. The original (2001) edition is also far more durable, and ages better. I should know, I have both.What you *want* is the original edition, but good luck finding it. HarperCollins refers to both the 2001 box set and this newer \\"rough cut\\" edition with the same ISBN, so if you search for and believe you've bought the 2001 box set you'll most likely be unpleasantly surprised to receive this inferior version instead.EDIT: Review edited to reflect Joseph's feedback. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Next to my Bible, my copy of the Catechism, my copy of the Didache, and some other writings from the early church, this is the most important book that I own. C.S. Lewis is one of the English speaking world's greatest treasures, and his work is a contribution to all of humanity.That might sound over the top. But it is simply true. This book contains 1) Mere Christianity, which is adapted from a series of radio shows Lewis did. If this book does not lead you closer to Christ, I don't know what will. 2) The Screwtape Letters, my favorite book by Lewis, which is a satirical look at how the enemy tempts us away from God. 3) The Great Divorce, which is a masterful discussion about the problem of good and evil. 4) The Problem of Pain, an equally excellent look at why a loving God allows suffering. 5) Miracles... I challenge you to read this and remain a cynic. 6) A Grief Observed. Heartrending and helpful for anyone who has suffered. 7) The Abolition of Man, a scary look at where we are headed when we loose our values.I have read Screwtape several times, and have checked out every other book in this collection at least once. If you are looking for solid, sane philosophy grounded in reason, to help you through your journey, get this book. It is the only MUST own I have ever recommended next to the Bible. (okay, one of two MUST owns. If you are Catholic, you MUST own the Catechism too)The book itself is beautiful in hardcover, with a partially cloth cover and a ribbon marker. A suitable package for this quality of writing."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"At the age of 25 I read this book in 1976. In the midst of its pages, I became a Christian. The conversion experience was real, it was exciting, and it was lasting. Now, 23 years later, I consider myself a child of God through the ministry of C.S. Lewis. Charles Colson, former &quot;enforcer&quot; of the Nixon Administration, also became a Christian reading Lewis's Mere Christianity. I recommend it to non-believers, believers, and to outright opponents of the idea that Jesus is Lord. Why? Because Lewis strips away all the silly religious accretions that obscure the true message of this historic person known as Jesus of Nazareth. All of these notions kept me away from the faith for years, and it was exhilirating to confront, via Lewis, the Jesus who actually walked the Earth and who, 25 years ago, changed my life radically and forever. I am a lawyer who knows what evidence will stand up in a court room. Lewis has it. I have been &quot;convicted&quot; by that evidence, by the grace of God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a 'very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to 'experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.This collection contains several of C.S. Lewis' classic works (although it is not in fact a complete collection of all his writings, not even of all his non-fiction writings). It contains the following works: 'Mere Christianity', 'The Screwtape Letters', 'The Great Divorce', 'The Problem of Pain', 'Miracles', 'A Grief Observed', plus 'The Abolition of Man'. It does provide an excellent survey of Lewis' theology, ethics, and general outlook on life. I will highlight two of the selections that show the different ways Lewis approaches things.For the first example, the book 'Mere Christianity' looks at beliefs, both from a 'natural' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, 'When I was an atheist...' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the \`leave it to God' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God's own personality. Lewis' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God's is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the \`new man' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.'Mere Christianity' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - 'The Case for Christianity', 'Christian Behaviour', and 'Beyond Personality'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made.On the other hand, Lewis can write in ways that are intensely personal and reflective. This is true of the book 'A Grief Observed'. This was drawn out of his personal experience with his wife, Joy. C.S. Lewis was a confirmed bachelor (not that he was a 'confirmed bachelor', mind you, just that he had become set enough in his ways over time that he no longer held out the prospect of marriage or relationships). Then, into his comfortable existence, a special woman, Joy Davidson, arrived. They fell in love quickly, and had a brief marriage of only a few years, when Joy died of cancer.This left Lewis inconsolable.For his mother had also died of cancer, when he was very young.Cancer, cancer, cancer!Lewis goes through a dramatic period of grief, from which he never truly recovers (according to the essayist Chad Walsh, who writes a postscript to Lewis' book). He died a few years later, the same day as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.However, Lewis takes the wonderful and dramatic step of writing down his grief to share with others. The fits and starts, the anger, the reconciliation, the pain--all is laid bare for the reader to experience. So high a cost for insight is what true spirituality requires. An awful, awe-ful cost and experience.'Did you know, dear, how much you took away with you when you left? You have stripped me even of my past...'All that was good paled in comparison to the loss. How can anything be good again? This is such an honest human feeling, that even the past is no longer what is was in relation to the new reality of being alone again.In the end, Lewis reaches a bit of a reconciliation with his feelings, and with God.'How wicked it would be, if we could, to call the dead back. She said not to me, but to the chaplain, \\"I am at peace with God.\\" 'Lewis had a comfortable, routine life that was jolted by love, and then devasted by loss. Through all of this, he took pains to recount what he was going through, that it might not be lost, that it might benefit others, that there might be some small part of his love for Joy that would last forever.I hope it shall.This is a wonderful collection."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book has been one of the best books I have read on Christianity.

I cannot add to the many comments about the book as whole; but I think that Lewis's insight into sex should be noted.Lewis says, \\"When an adolescent or an adult is engaged in resisting a conscious desire, he is not dealing with a repression nor is he in the least danger of creating a repression. On the contrary, those who are seriously attempting chastity are more conscious, and soon know a great deal more about their own sexuality than anyone else. They come to know their desires as Wellington knew Napoleon, or as Sherlock Holmes knew Mariarty; as a rat-catcher knows rats or a plumber knows about leaky pipes. Virtue--even attempted virtue--brings light; indulgence brings fog.\\"This idea that Chastity helps one know sexuality in the way a rat-catcher knows rats helps explain what Thoreau was saying in Walden when he called Chastity the beginning of genius and heroism. It's what Freud was talking about when he talked about Leonardo da Vinci transmuting sexual energy into genius. Virtue--even attempted virtue--brings light. As a physician, I know the intimate details of the lives of thousands of people and I know no perfect people. But, I know many people who have more light by simply making a serious attempt at virtue (more light in their quest for better sex and more light in other arenas).The connection between sexuality and spirituality is complicated but direct and profound. When understood, this connection offers a way to both deeper spiritual and sexual relations. I'm not sure that I completely understand it yet (after studying that connection for 30 years) but this book (in Chapter 5: Sexual Morality) offers important clues.Having counseled thousands of women and having treated them medically, I have found that real virtue (not the fake stuff) does bring clarity and the most sexual and skilled women are often the most virtuous. The over indulged frequently suffer with difficulty with orgasm and depression and forms of self abuse.Here's another one of my favorite passages:\\"Finally, though I have had to speak at some length about sex, I want to make it as clear as I possibly can that the centre of Christian morality is not here...The sins of the flesh are bad, but they are the least bad of all sins. All the worst pleasures are purely spiritual: the pleasure of putting other people in the worng, of bossing and patronizsing and spoiling sport, and back-biting; the pleasures of power, of hatred. For there are two things inside me, competing with the human self which I must try to become. They are the Animal self and the Diabolical self. The Diabolical self is the worse of the two. That is why a cold, self-righteious prig who goes regularly to church may be far nearer to hell than a prostitute. But, of course, it is better to be neither.\\"I have attended (as physician) prostitutes and am a friend to women who have worked in the sex business--some as prostitutes. I've found the mark left by work in the sex industry usually leaves a woman with a hard shell but very tender and forgiving heart. While the fluffy woman on the front seat at churh will sometimes have a soft shell and very hard and unforgiving heart. I would agree with Lewis that the Prostitute is nearer to heaven than the Prig.I'm sorry if this review sounds preachy. I don't mean to try and expain what Lewis explains so eloquently in his book. But, as someone who has treated thousands for sexual dysfunction, as the author of what is presently the best selling sex manual on Amazon, I thought I might hopefully write a note to encourage more people to pay attention to Lewis's chapter on sexual morality.Peace & Health,Charles Runels, MD"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The wonderful thing about C.S. Lewis was that he put an amazing amount of thought into his faith. He understood better than most that becoming a Christian meant constantly trying to understand more, to examine both one's self and one's relationship to God. His penetrating intellegence towards Christianity is something that is often lacking in religion, and every time I read Lewis I learn something new, both about myself and my faith. Lewis is a true master. Another author who I'd highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Lewis, one who explores the Christian faith as brilliantly as Lewis, is Brian Caldwell. His novel, We All Fall Down is breathtaking. I'd put him on a par with Lewis, both for writing ability and theological brilliance. His novel is one of the few Christian masterpieces. Both Lewis and Caldwell should be read by those who have discovered God and want to explore that faith as deeply as possible, and perhaps more importantly, by those who have not."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I give this book 5 stars even though there a couple of things in the book that I don't totally agree with. Normally, when I like a book but find some things about it that are of concern to me, I will give the book a 4 star rating and explain the concerns that prevented me from giving the book 5 stars. But I'm not doing that in this case, primarily because the concerns I have are minor in nature and represent an extremely small amount of what Lewis discusses in the book. So with that explanation out of the way, I'd like to describe the things about the book that I found to be very positive.First, Lewis' writing style is exquisite. Those who are interested in writing books should study Lewis purely as an education in how to write a thought provoking and engaging book in an exciting literary way. There are many fine books out on the market, but few can match Mere Christianity in terms of exquisite grammatical presentation. It was a joy to read a book by an author who not only displays excellence in the subject being discussed, but also commands a high competence level in the language he/she is using to communicate the subject matter.Secondly, the subject matter itself is highly refined and presented in an extraordinarily sensible way. Lewis was not a pastor or a theologian, he was a layman. Sometimes, this is to his detriment in his writings, but often, it is to his benefit. Being a layman espousing the truths of Christianity gives him a unique perspective and insight into the faith itself as well as an insight into the thought processes of non Christians examining the claims of Christianity. The apologetic that he puts forth in these pages provides a very rare combination of being easy to follow, yet being highly intellectual in its approach. He builds his apologetic one argument at a time, each argument building upon the last. And he presents these arguments in impeccably concise language so that he does not bog the reader down in having to sift through many pages to try and reach the point that Lewis is trying to make. This is often the biggest problem with modern apologetic books. Many authors today spend a lot of time in their books trying to make the same point in many ways, and by doing so, often dilute their ultimate point in a sea of repetitous arguments. Lewis makes his points in concise language, and this makes his arguments very persuasive and sharp.Lastly, the high level of logic, intellect, and common sense that buttresses his apologetic builds confidence in the reader that Christianity is a faith that makes sense intellectually. It is difficult to find a comprehensive non Christian rebuttal to Mere Christianity. Even some of those who disagree with Mere Christianity and the assertions put forward have admitted that they were humbled by the arguments put forward and compliment Lewis and his intellect.In conclusion, this is a book that I would highly recommend to all Christians not only as a classic apologetic but also because of the exquisite literary style. I would also highly recommend this to anyone who may be hung up on the philosophical integrity of Christianity. I would also recommend this book as a very good witnessing tool for those who know somebody who has intellectual concerns about Christianity. Mere Christianity is a top apologetic book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis makes a perfectly reasonble argument with most of his book. He uses God as an explanation for the existence of moral law. Many argue that no proof can even be given for the existence of moral law, but I have not yet seen a proof of its nonexistence either. Most evidence seems to point to its existence. Society itself is built on the acceptance of certain moral principles. Lewis goes into the differences between the moral law that humans follow and any rules that govern animal behavior, and they are obvious even to the average person. For those who say that belief in moral law is un-intellectual, try reading Plato, Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, or any of the other great philosophers in history.Lewis simply assumes that a moral law exists, and credits God with its origin. He does not PROVE this existence as some say, but he does give a reasonable explanation for his belief. If the existence of God could be proven, all people would probably believe in Him. There would be no need for FAITH, which the God of the Bible seems to value highly.Never will a writer or philosopher like Lewis actually prove that God exists. I see belief in God as a choice. His existence will never be proven or disproven, so each person must decide which position to believe in. Neither choice is more or less intellectual than the other. However, it seems to me that not believing in God is the much riskier decision of the two. Lewis himself said that if one person believes in God and another doesn't, and there is no God, then they both lose everything at death. But if there is a God, the one who believes gains everything, while the unbeliever loses everything anyway.As for belief in Christianity, I urge everyone to look closely and open-mindedly at Jesus Christ, as Lewis does. Everything about Christianity centers on Him. He is the one thing that separates Christianity from any other religion or belief. If He truly was the son of God, then everything the Bible says is true. If not, then he was just a pitiable lunatic who has led millions of people to waste their lives. I do not see myself (or C.S. Lewis) as an unintelligent person, yet I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. I urge others to think carefully before they make a decision on this subject. It is the most important decision you will ever make."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"No matter how far along you are in your Christian walk (I'm 30+ years into it), or even if you are a &quot;seeker&quot;, just investigating the Christian faith, there is great benefit to be received from this book. Lewis, of course, is a great literary scholar and author, but he is a layman in theological matters, yet he has a better grasp on doctrine and morality than many more learned theologians. Who said theology is just for the theologians anyway? With relentless logic and literary grace Lewis not only builds a solid case for Christianity but equips the believer with analogical paradigms for better understanding his or her own faith. Of course, not everyone will be convinced, but this book has convinced many in the latter half of the 20th century and beyond about the claims of Christ. I don't agree with every point Lewis makes, but the gist of his message is hard to refute.I have to make a comment about Kathleen Norris' Foreword in this edition. She starts out by making the point that &quot;This book begs to be seen in its historical context&quot;. Actually, this book stands on its own better than most without any historical context whatsoever. Having read two books by Norris, I know there are points of disagreement she has with Lewis, and her backhanded way of casting a shadow on the book's message adds nothing and actually detracts. Skip that part and delve right into the masterpiece that is &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I grew up in the church and believed what the Bible says but at times had doubts and was unsure as to what real christianity was. I was annoyed and discouraged by what I had seen as 'play Christianity'. At a point when I was tired of 'religiousness' I read this book.It is awe-inspiring. It causes one to focus on the Christ in Christianity and presses the point that the focus should not be on one's goodness or the social values of the world, after one reasonably looks and considers the case for Christianity they will realize that it is true and real and that Christ might be trusted and that the sphere of religion isn't where my focus should be but that of Christ.A must read! Add to your collection!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If I, as a nasty combative atheist, felt compelled to take down the case Lewis builds, I would press hardest on the opening chapter, his metaphysical derivation of God (some god, any god) from the self-evident truth of objective morality (or natural law). If I could succeed in knocking out that philosophical JENGA block, so would go the truth of Christianity.But I'm not a nasty combative atheist, just a normal one, and so I'm not going to present that case, though I do think this is the weakest argument in Lewis's book. Even that argument, problematic as I find it, is a delightful thing.Lewis is eminently creative and imaginative. His arguments are often surprising and fresh, and even if you disagree with them, they're fun to read and watch them work. The rounded and coherent view of his religion that Lewis provides is at once attractive (not entirely so, of course) and at the same time uncompromising and absolute. He clearly and to his credit hews to the beliefs his position requires, never obscuring those things that may prove unattractive.It's a good book, no matter the theistic worldview you find comfortable. His tone is cheerful and open, not sugary."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As the title implies, this book is about what all Christians hold true; i.e., the commonly agreed upon aspects of faith held by all Christian churches, regardless of denomination or doctrine. For anyone wanting to understand the basic tenets of Christianity, or anyone wanting an introduction to Christianity, this is the book to read. I've already read it four times. I love this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is currently my favorite reasonable take on the Christian faith.Part 1 is popular & brilliant: It details Lewis' examination of Right & Wrong, and what it means to us today. Many people feel it's Book 1 that is C. S. Lewis' best. I like it! It's *brilliant* because Right & Wrong as applied to Christianity isn't even addressed until Book 2- Book 1 is straight-up 100% philosophy. Lewis argues for a higher power based on this concept of Right & Wrong- that Right & Wrong is a *real* thing, and not simply imagined, invented, or made up. I can't convey Book 1's brilliance with just a short description- you'll have to read it for yourself!Part 2 is GREAT- yet *highly* contentious: It details the Christian's answer to Right & Wrong- and the Higher Power it indicates. Lewis addresses & dismisses all other religions, including atheism, rather quickly & systematically. It's the Divinity of Christ that makes this easy to do. If Jesus really is God in the Jewish sense, He is the ultimate Authority on all things. The main vehicle Lewis uses to ascertain His Divinity has been called the Trilemma: Lord, liar, or lunatic. If Jesus really did & said the things the Gospels say He did & said, Jesus could only be one of these 3 options. It seems plain to Lewis that Jesus was neither a liar nor a lunatic, so however improbable it may seem, Jesus *must* be Lord. This presupposes one *very* big thing: That the Gospels are an accurate record of what Jesus did & said. Many critics bash this presupposition, but Lewis only does this to keep the book short. Proving the historical accuracy of the Gospels takes too much time & space: Lewis assumes at this point that you've already consulted other works that handle this lengthy & difficult question, and that you currently *do* believe the Gospels to be accurate. Critics also suggest that maybe Jesus was simply honestly mistaken about his identity- that maybe He was crazy in the genius sense. C. S. Lewis just doesn't buy that option. The debate continues to this day!Part 3 is highly insightful: Now that we know *what* Christians believe, how should it affect behavior? Even if you didn't agree with Lewis up to this point, Book 3 will give you great insight on what Christians still say & do. Some of it, Lewis readily admits, is going to be *extremely* unpopular. Some critics these days like to dismiss Lewis' take on morality as being completely out-of-date. Yet Lewis answers this objection several times throughout the entire book! He says the date of an idea isn't really the issue- it's truthfulness that counts.Part 4 is all about the Trinity: This is a *practical* look at God as Trinity, i.e. What does it mean to the average Christian on an actual daily basis? What is the Trinity like? What does it mean to be 'in Christ'? How exactly does the Christian life work? What does the supernatural Christian process look like? Is Christianity hard or easy? What about Christians compared to non-Christians? What's the point of it all, anyway? C. S. Lewis tackles all these questions & then some. The *entire* point of Mere Christianity is summed up in this section. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"An excellent spring board into Christian apologetics or just understanding in simple terms the basics of Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"While this book may not be perfect in every regard, for what it attempts to do it is the best there is. Some of the crisicism of this book is perhaps true, but it misses the point: this book was written to explain Christianity to &quot;lay people.&quot; It's not SUPPOSED to be a full-fledged philosophical defense of the Christian faith, considering every possible angle, so why complain when it isn't? Those critics are like the man who buys a car and complains that it's not enough like a train because it lacks a dining car and doesn't run on rails!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S.

Lewis's other famous works. This is a wonderful collection of his best work. I have loved every one and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing God through another perspective. Based on Biblical truth, but not \\"preachy,\\" he gives us a glimpse into God's nature and His relationship with us. Not exactly an easy read (definitely not a \\"beach book\\"), but the message is crystal clear."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The book arrived very soon after I ordered it. Its description was accurate and the price was great."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Fitting, I think, to be reading what may arguably be one of C. S. Lewis's most important books, on a retreat during which one of my personal goals was to find a spiritual, if not religious, inner peace. Reading the work of C. S. Lewis is to meet a friend who reflects us and understands us--and helps us to understand.Who of us has not asked these questions? Who of us has not prayed these prayers, even those of us who are atheists (which group has at times included me, and has also included C. S. Lewis), even if only praying to our void? Lewis takes on several of these questions that have held me captive since youth, when I first began to wonder about a God: who He might be, if indeed He is, and what might my relationship be with Him.Before he has even cleared the pages of the preface, Lewis nabs me cold: \\"It is true that some people may find they have to wait in the hall for a considerable time, while others feel certain almost at once which door they must knock at. I do not know why there is this difference, but I am sure God keeps no one waiting unless He sees that it is good for him to wait. When you do get into your room you will find that the long wait has done you some kind of good which you would not have had otherwise.\\" Then Lewis reminds us that this time of \\"waiting in the hall\\" is not a form of camping, but a time of rigorous seeking, questioning, praying even when we are not sure who we are praying to or if we are heard. \\"And above all you must be asking which door is the true one; not which pleases you best by its paint and paneling.\\"Christianity, Lewis writes, is a way of life. An owner's manual, if you will. It is not meant to constrain us, but to fully free us. Following its doctrines means to \\"transform our lives in such a way that evil diminishes and good prevails.\\" There is an innate law, he observes, that follows along the lines of human nature, a natural right and wrong, and in examining all religions, we find right and wrong, good and evil, are more or less defined along the same lines by all humanity, regardless of religious beliefs. This is our first clue that we have found an unchangeable truth. Even the atheist, Lewis says, has a sense of right and wrong, good and bad, and as soon as one realizes this, the next step is to understand the universal standard of morality. From where does this standard come if not from some higher ruling of the universe? It echoes inside each and every one of us. \\"The moment you say that one set of moral ideas can be better than another, you are, in fact, measuring them both by a standard ...\\" which is what Lewis terms as \\"Real Morality.\\"The God Lewis has us see is not a kindly and bearded man sitting on a throne in some distant and ethereal place. He calls him a great artist, for the universe is a very beautiful place, but also a Being that is intensely interested in right conduct--in fair play, unselfishness, courage, good faith, honesty and truthfulness. Insofar as all that, one can think of God as \\"good.\\" But Lewis does not see Him as an easy master. \\"There is nothing indulgent about the Moral Law. It is as hard as nails. It tells you to do the straight thing and it does not seem to care how painful, or dangerous, or difficult it is to do. If God is like the Moral Law, then He is not soft.\\"From here, Lewis proceeds to tackle those common questions: how can God exist in such a cruel and unjust world? If God knows how the story of mankind ends, why did he create us and our story at all? If the future already exists in His eyes, what does that say about free will? How can we know that Christ wasn't simply a great moral teacher, but indeed the Son of God? And, why did Christ have to die, and so cruelly, for our sins to be forgiven? Why could we not just shake hands on it?Lewis explores free will and how God understood, as we so often have not, that in giving us free will, He gave us the ability to love. It is only when we have to ability to choose, that we can love. Anything else would be forced bondage, slave bowing to master. If we have botched up our ability to choose, so very often throughout our history, then we cannot shake our fists at the heavens and blame God, but must look to ourselves and the choices we have made. Lewis urges us to return to the basics, the Law of Morality, for only in addressing that place where our mistakes were first made can we continue forward in a progressive manner. If we cannot ever achieve perfection, it does not mean we are ever off the hook in striving for it.Time and what is beyond time, the concepts of heaven and hell, the need to be a part of an active Christian community, what was meant by being formed in the likeness of God (no, we are not his mirror images), the true meaning of charity (far more than the occasional giving of alms to the poor), the meaning of faith and why it should not be blind, what it means to love our neighbor as we love ourselves (and this section made me laugh, perhaps in relief, as Lewis explains that to love our neighbors as ourselves does not mean we have to like our neighbors or even always to be kind to them, no more than we always like ourselves or are kind to ourselves), so Lewis covers all the basics.There is a very real cost to being a Christian, Lewis teaches. Make no mistake, it is not a small pittance. But it is one that, if we do not pay it, will cost us far more in the long run, and not only after our lives on earth have ended. All that we do, all that we are, here on earth, already comes back to us, with our free will choices following their own natural law of returns.\\"God is easy to please, but hard to satisfy,\\" Lewis writes. We are not talking about mere improvement, but transformation. One that we choose to either retreat from, and pay the resulting price, or embrace, and pay that price. To find our own true selves, however, Lewis sums up, can be done only by submitting fully. To let go, and let God.\\"The more I resist Him and try to live on my own, the more I become dominated by my own heredity and upbringing and surroundings and natural desires ... I am not, in my natural state, nearly so much of a person as I like to believe: most of what I call \`me' can be very easily explained. It is when I turn to Christ, when I give myself up ... that I first begin to have a real personality of my own.\\"Lewis has invited us to enter into this transformation, and he helps us to do so in a manner that is far from blind.~Abridged from Zinta's Reviews, on blogspot.com, and The Smoking Poet, Fall 2008"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I truly recommend this book to anyone who wants to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord.I tend to be very hard on myself in my walk with God. This book helps me to put my walk with God in a proper perspective.

Lewis was certainly 1 of, if not the most, thought provoking theologist of the last century. As a former atheist/current agnostic, I will say, his is the only sensible argument for Christianity I've ever come across. Of course his prose is as always thoughtful, intelligent, & often humorous."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"MERE CHRISTIANITY represents an excellent distillation of Lewis' thought on the essential elements of Christianity. He knows, of course, that the word 'mere' can mean 'simple' or 'basic' but that it once meant 'pure' or 'essential'. This book gives you the supreme elements of Christian thought, but in simple, accessible terms. That is, of course, Lewis' forte--to depict the complex with a very light touch. Here he talks about such notions as human nature, Christian morality, virtue, and the triune God and he does so in chapter/segments slightly longer than sound bites. The reader is neither stretched on a rack of jargon and chop-logic nor asked to bear up under an onslaught of endless, vague verbiage. S/he is given the unvarnished truth of Christianity in clear terms and manageable segments. One can 'read in' the book, as one reads in the Bible or the Book of Common Prayer. This is the perfect introduction to Christian thought and the perfect introduction to the insights of Lewis the believer."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is one of my favorite C.S. Lewis books, which is saying a lot.If you enjoy Lewis' apologetic books and his piercing intellect, this book is a must have.Many of the arguments he makes in this book I have used in talking to people, because they are so compelling.It is a classic for a reason.Buy it!!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book helped God reveal to me the truth that I had so long struggled to discover myself. I was raised in the church, but I could never fully understand the nature and meaning of Christ. My logical and intellectual nature as an engineer kept me from grasping the truth about God, but after reading this book, I feel I have been saved. The intellectual struggle is over, and I now live to do God's will. In this book, C.S. Lewis begins logically introducing this feeling of morality all humans feel. He then explains the source of this morality which everyone should take notice of. He also holds up what he believes to be the core of Christian belief that all Christian denominations must agree on. If you struggle with what seems to be illogical about God, read this book. You'll come to see that God is more logical then you have ever considered befored."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I am a believer who loves the Lewis of the Narnia books, but his more argumentative books, including this one, Mere Christianity, are often rather lacking in basic coherence. The gaps in logic are often dumbfounding.My favorite example is Lewis's argument that you cannot accept Jesus as a wise man unless you accept that he is God, because anyone who claims to be God, and isn't God, is barking mad. Putting aside the issue of whether \\"the hisorical Jesus\\" actually made such a claim, alas, anyone who has ever taken a even a cursory look at the great writers and sages throughout history knows that one minute they can be the fount of wisdom and the next can be absolutely off their rocker. Dostoevsky springs most immediately to mind.And thats not the worst gap in logic in the book.So, those looking for a reasoned defense of Christianity are strongly advised to go straight to G.K. Chesterton's The Everlasting Man and skip this one."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This collection of C.S. Lewis's greatest works in one volume is just incredible. I love it!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Not really the best Christian apologetic Lewis ever wrote: that would be his 1960 revision of _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_, in conjunction with his much earlier _The Problem of Pain_ (which should be read after MaPS).Still, MC is very accessible to many readers. The chapters of the first two sections were originally designed to be \\"Broadcast Talks\\" (the original title of the first publication of the first section) on BBC radio during WWII. They provide a colorful version (if somewhat oversimplified, as Lewis well knew) of the theistic Argument from Morality, which does help to introduce the principles within and around the argument; and, for section 2, a variation of what has come to be called the Lewis Trilemma (aka 'Liar, Lunatic, or Lord?').The Trilemma is also oversimplified (keep in mind the broad target audience), and should not be considered to be Lewis' ultimate opinion on the subject; but unfortunately he never seems to have written a more technical version. (Some even more foreshortened versions can be found in other articles and essays he wrote.) In any event, although it is tempting to deride Lewis for simply presuming that the texts are sufficiently accurate to make such a judgment, any critic (pro or con) ought to know from other writings that Lewis was well aware of the benefits and limitations (and abuses) of textual criticism. Besides, the attempt to call into question the honesty of the textual authors/editors merely ends up reinstituting the Trilemma again at the next level. The Trilemma cannot easily be brushed aside: as the increasingly complex (and spurious) historical revisionism theories of the past 30 years (forms of which Lewis was already familiar with from his own day and prior) ironically testify.This doesn't mean that the Trilemma argument is rock-solid, either, however. It isn't a substitute for preliminary philosophical argument; nor is it a substitute for historical analysis. It perhaps works best as the very tail end of one (or ideally both) of those endeavors. Dr. Gregory Boyd makes much the same point very well in _Cynic Sage or Son of God_ (an indepth analysis of the logical bona fides of various historical propositions): if Jesus was like _that_, then we have a fairly straightforward explanation for why the earliest existant texts about him are like _this_--an explanation that doesn't require (for instance) hypothesizing about what a hypothetical community did not believe based on what a hypothetical 'early strata' of a hypothetical document hypothesized to have been used by this hypothetical community does _not_ say. |g| (As Boyd pithly observes: _that_ requires faith! Lewis, who had already seen numerous similar attempts at historical revisionism in his day, even outside Jesus-studies, would agree.)As always, careful qualification should be observed, pro or con: and it is admittedly worth noting, that due to certain restrictions in his delivery, Lewis is not as carefully qualified as he could be. (i.e., this is a necessarily truncated _introduction_ to the topic, not the final word on it.)The AfM in Section 1, remember, is also not rigorously proposed. (Although it is more thorough than the chapter on morality in MaPS, again for a good reason in relation to the structure of that greater work.) Unfortunately, again, Lewis never wrote a rigorous (specifically theistic) AfM--possibly because he believed that no total weight would hang adequately on it (there is some indication of this in how he uses it to make a restrained and subordinate point in MaPS). _The Abolition of Man_ (and a few essays here and there which presage it) does not exactly take up the slack as a theistic AfM--although, once again, this is because Lewis didn't design it to. (See my review of TAoM.)The remaining two sections (also originally published separately) form the majority of the book. The 3rd section, on 'Christian Morality', is again a useful and enjoyable (if very basic) introduction to the subject, both at a theological and historical level, in the sense of: 'This is the consistency of the subject in relation to Christian philosophy, and this is (a very basic) overview of how Christian thinkers have tended to most cogently consider the matter.'The final section, on the doctrine of the Trinity, is the best popular introduction to the subject I know.Both last sections (3 and 4) can work well at helping readers, both believer and sceptic, to clear away some misconceptions concerning those two topics (the generally-Christian moral code, and the trinitarian doctrine). Unfortunately, theories on those topics are widespread and different enough, that confusion may result if these are taken to be _the_ foundational base of understanding for future reading; especially in the case of the Trinity. Still, as aids to practical application of the relevant doctrines, they make excellent introductions."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function W(s,i,n,u,r,a){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,L)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(A,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-888920e4"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/29.md","filePath":"guide/29.md"}'),G={name:"guide/29.md"},j=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(i,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{E as __pageData,j as default};
