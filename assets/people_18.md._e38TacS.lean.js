SILENT SPRING caused an enormous sensation forty years ago, as it married a highly evolved lyric writing style with a hardcore expose of DDT and other insecticides, a topic which was quite flammable and which provoked the wrath of a host of leading scientists and others invested in the big business of &quot;nature cleansing.&quot; To some, Carson was a renegade, and a retro one at that, a conservative who wished to take the world back to the days before &quot;scientific progress.&quot;As many conservationists have been called before and since. But conservation does not automatically imply &quot;conservative,&quot; and I think Carson, in her own way, was quite radical in her thinking and in her prognosis for the future. This book is lovely, but to my mind not well served by the insipid introduction by Terry Tempest Williams who is an OK writer but nothing special, particularly when compared to Carson. My advice is, skip the intro, you don't need it, and get right to the heart of the book and the wonderful limpid prose, the most evocative since Thoreau's."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This is the definitive book about ecological issues. Sadly it is just as applicable today as it was almost three decades ago when it was written, except that there are even more eco-problems facing our ravaged world such as global warming, the Ozone Hole, high UV-radiation, increased industrial and automobile pollution etc. We obviously did not pay enough heed to Rachel Carson's sound caveats! Could it be that Silent Spring is too information oriented for our entertainment seeking 21st Century world? If so, maybe another book just recently published, entitled, ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES (by scientist-author, C.B. Don) might help to bridge this gap as there is an interesting tie-in with Silent Spring. In Silent Spring, Rachel Carson mentions the devastating effects of pesticides sprayed on orchards and the decimated honeybee pollinator colonies...essential for our agriculture! &quot;Accused By Facet-Eyes&quot; takes Silent Spring one step further. It is a well researched contemporary science-fiction eco-novel, which presents a fantastic, thought-provoking storyline through &quot;honeybee facet-eyes&quot;. I am a long-time fan of Silent Spring and yet I loved this new, imaginative eco-novel. Both books share a strong ecological message presented in different ways. Silent Spring and &quot;Accused By Facet-Eyes&quot; are rare eco-books, both truly worthwhile reading and reflecting upon!"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Over 35 years ago, this book, which would give aid and comfort to all those who would destroy our way of life, was written. Consider how the advocates of a certain policy (i.e. banning of pesticides) will skew &quot;scientific&quot; data to support a pre-ordained conclusion. A fine example of that in this book would be the &quot;finding&quot; of thin eagle eggshells, due to (we're told) DDT. Not mentioned was the diet fed to the mother eagles in the study, one containing only 20% of their normal, natural calcium intake.Stop for a minute to think about how many millions of lives in the world were saved from malaria by DDT - and how many that were not saved since banning it. But, to the new &quot;environmental&quot; Marxists, what's a few million human lives in the battle to enslave all of humanity? Those who have written to praise this monument to junk science ought to consider the harm done by polemics such as this. This same sentiment is in control of the EPA today. One need only look at the environment of former Soviet satellite nations of Eastern Europe to see what a disaster totalitarian governments (with no oversight) have made. Continue along our current course of Washington-dominated command-and-control bureaucratic decision-making (as well as more government funded and controlled &quot;science&quot;), and we will have a dirtier and more unhealthy world, with lower life expectancy for everyone.Undoubtedly, such an outcome would be praised as &quot;fair&quot; by our would-be dictators."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Would you believe the case could be made that this book is responsible for as many deaths as Hitler or Stalin were responsible for? It is quite a claim but there are millions of people in third world countries, primarily Africa, dying of malaria every year.

You don't have to take my word for it. Check out JunkScience.com, fightingmaliria, TechCentral, or event the Wall Street Journal. JunkScience.com gives many details of the troubles with the research that went into this book regarding DDT and how effective it is and nowhere near as harmful as this book would lead you to believe. We don't see all these MILLIONS of people dying on the nightly news so many people are quite apathetic. Using DDT only in homes would save millions of lives a year.

Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" that led to the restrictive use of DDT that is one of the oldest pesticides & is still the best for controlling mosquitoes. Spraying DDT in houses and on mosquito breeding grounds was the primary reason that rates of malaria around the world declined dramatically after the Second World War. Nearly one million Indians died from malaria in 1945, but DDT spraying reduced this to a few thousand by 1960. Today there are once again millions of cases of malaria in India, and over 300 million cases worldwide-most in sub-Saharan Africa. Cases of malaria in South Africa have risen by over 1000 percent in the past five years. Only those countries that have continued to use DDT, such as Ecuador, have contained or reduced malaria. It appears that if you can't see it from your house, it is no problems. Dead birds or dead people, there would be neither if DDT was allowed to be wisely applied.Seems that Al Gores loves a convent lie, such as this one: \\"#27 - Mosquitoes \\"climbing to higher altitudes\\"Gore says that, because of \\"global warming\\", mosquitoes are climbing to higher altitudes. They are not. Most recent outbreaks have been at lower levels than those of a century and more ago. He says that Nairobi was founded 1000 m above sea level so as to be above the mosquito line. It was not. In the period before anthropogenic warming could have had any significant effect, there were ten malaria outbreaks in Nairobi, one of which reached as far up as Eldoret, almost 3000 m above sea level. Malaria is not a tropical disease. Mosquitoes do not need tropical temperatures:they need no more than 15 degrees Celsius to breed. The largest malaria outbreak of modern times was in Siberia in the 1920s and 1930s, when 13 million were infected, 600,000 died and 30,000 died as far north as Arkhangelsk, on the Arctic Circle. There is no reason to suppose that malaria will spread even if the climate continues to become warmer.[...]The lies continue and so do people dying because of them.

Though the intentions were good, this book is among the most destructive ever published. DDT is far and away the most effective way to control mosquitoes. The potential problems with DDT were associated with blanket industrial use in agriculture, rather than its use in public health. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT DDT IS HARMFUL TO HUMANS WHEN USED IN THE LEVELS NECESSARY TO CONTROL MOSQUITOES. The banning of DDT for insect control was a death by malaria sentence for 50 million human beings. In 2006 The World Health Organization officially RECOMMENDED the use of indoor residual spraying (IRS) of DDT. So compelling was the latest scientific evidence of DDT effectiveness and safety that the Environmental Defense, which launched the anti-DDT campaign in the 1960's, now ENDORSES the indoor use of DDT for malaria control, as does The Sierra Club, and the Endangered Wildlife Trust. I think that Dick Tavern, a British politician summed it up correctly, \\"Carson didn't seem to take into account the vital role (DDT) played in controlling the transmission of malaria by killing the mosquitoes that carry the parasite (...)It is the single most effective agent ever developed for saving human life (...) Rachel Carson is a warning to us all of the danger of neglecting the evidence-based approach and the need to weigh potential risk against benefit: it can be argued that the anti DDT campaign she inspired was responsible for almost as many deaths as some of the worst dictators of the last century.\\""},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This review will be short, this book presents a one sided argument in a completely emotional manner rather than a factual and scientific manner."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Where she talked about birds that were going extinct because of ddt she fails to tell you that most of these birds were going extinct before ddt was put into mass production.

I attended the ceremony because I had to. I didn't pick up Carson's book until college. I was curious about the claims since as a kid on military bases around the world, the evening DDT truck sprayers were a fixture. We as kids would run for blocks behind the trucks enjoying the man-made fog. I remember my mouth being pasty with DDT residue. I am now 56 and in great health with no DDT adverse affects that I know of. During the time from then till now, I moved from studying History to Earth Science and have had a certain amount of liberal environmentalism pumped into my head by way of such minded professors.I have worked in both the petroleum industry and the enviromental industry for over 31 years.I can now look back and see that Carson's book did not just lay the foundation for the environmentalist movement, but was the blue print for irrational, emotion based, bad science citing environmental fear mongering that that we see today in the man-made global warming religion. I say religion, because that is what it has become. It is inviolate. Anyone who speaks out against it, is personally crucified or burnt at the stake for heresy, not matter how valid their argument. Religious zealots don't care about rational arguments, only their faith based beliefs. No amount of counter science will sway their faith that they are right in their beliefs.I recall the brown roadsides where highway crews sprayed 2-4D with reckless abandon to control weeds. I recall the brown swaths lining roads from Maine to Virginia as we drove from Maine to California. I recall the DDT spraying too. But as other reviewers have pointed out, and the UN numbers support, that since the political decision was made to ban DDT by the US and soon after the EU countries, and it became unavailable in developing nations, a conservative estimate of over 150,000 human beings died per year since it was banned in in the 1972. That comes to close to 6 million people in the 3rd world killed by the work of Rachel Carson. She has single handedly carried out a Holocaust of the magnitude of Adolf Hitler, albeit it took quite a few years longer.We do have anecdotal accounts that there are more song birds now than there would have been, but everything comes at a price, right? More song birds, higher book sales for Simon and Schuster and a fatter bank account for Rachel.The irrefutable facts show that DDT saved millions of lives during WWII by halting the spread of Scrub Typhus in Italy, Germany, France and Belgium as well as lowering the mortality of Typhus, as well as malaria and other mosquito borne tropical diseases in the Asia theater.One should know that Carson's science credentials while on the surface are impressive, the history of her academic studies and subsequent literary works show that she was ever a english/journalism major even in her work for the Fish and Wildlife department. She focused her science studies on fish and wrote a number of books on that subject for Simon and Schuster and if you know how publishers work, I am sure she was encouraged to write something that would sell rather than poor selling books on marine life. She found that something in the fear mongering in Silent Spring, and with it gave birth to the modern enviromental movement. I guess one could say her lesbian lover, Dorothy Freeman was the father, lol, but then I don't have intimate knowledge of which one took on the role of the man, but judging from her hair cut it was Rachel.In retrospect the book serves as a nice historical tome, putting in context the environmental hysteria we see on a daily basis on TV, in print and on the internet. Rational thinking people will see that even in the 1960's sensationalism sold and it still does today. No matter whether the science is good, or even true, emotionalism is still able to touch the ignorant heart and that my friends is what passes for science today."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"It repeats alot of the same things over and over for 300 pages.

That given, I will comment upon it at its end.\\"\\"Sometimes you find mass murderers in the most unlikely places. Take Rachel Carson. She was, by all accounts, a mild-mannered writer for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--hardly a sociopath breeding ground. And yet, according to many in the media, Carson has more blood on her hands than Hitler.The problems started in the 1940s, when Carson left the Service to begin writing full-time. In 1962, she published a series of articles in the New Yorker, resulting in the book Silent Spring--widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement. The book discussed how pesticides and pollutants moved up the food chain, threatening the ecosystems for many animals, especially birds. Without them, it warned, we might face the title's silent spring.Farmers used vast quantities of DDT to protect their crops against insects--80 million pounds were sprayed in 1959 alone--but from there it quickly climbed up the food chain. Bald eagles, eating fish that had concentrated DDT in their tissues, headed toward extinction. Humans, likewise accumulating DDT in our systems, appeared to get cancer as a result. Mothers passed the chemical on to their children through breast milk. Silent Spring drew attention to these concerns and, in 1972, the resulting movement succeeded in getting DDT banned in the U.S.--a ban that later spread to other nations.And that, according to Carson's critics, is where the trouble started. DDT had been sprayed heavily on houses in developing countries to protect against malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Without it, malaria rates in developing countries skyrocketed. Over 1 million people die from it each year.To the critics, the solution seems simple: Forget Carson's emotional arguments about dead birds and start spraying DDT again so we can save human lives.Worse than Hitler?\\"What the World Needs Now Is DDT\\" asserted the headline of a lengthy feature in the New York Times Magazine (4/11/04). \\"No one concerned about the environmental damage of DDT set out to kill African children,\\" reporter Tina Rosenberg generously allowed. Nonetheless, \\"Silent Spring is now killing African children because of its persistence in the public mind.\\"It's a common theme--echoed by two more articles in the Times by the same author (3/29/06, 10/5/06), and by Times columnists Nicholas Kristof (3/12/05) and John Tierney (6/05/07). The same refrain appears in a Washington Post op-ed by columnist Sebastian Mallaby, gleefully headlined \\"Look Who's Ignoring Science Now\\" (10/09/05). And again in the Baltimore Sun (\\"Ms. Carson's views [came] at a cost of many thousands of lives worldwide\\"--5/27/07), New York Sun (\\"millions of Africans died . . . thanks to Rachel Carson's junk science classic\\"--4/21/06), the Hill (\\"millions die on the altar of politically correct ideologies\\"--11/02/05), San Francisco Examiner (\\"Carson was wrong, and millions of people continue to pay the price\\"--5/28/07) and Wall Street Journal (\\"environmental controls were more important than the lives of human beings\\"--2/21/07).Even novelists have gotten in on the game. \\"Banning DDT killed more people than Hitler, Ted,\\" explains a character in Michael Crichton's 2004 bestseller, State of Fear (p. 487). \\"[DDT] was so safe you could eat it.\\" That fictional comment not only inspired a column on the same theme in Australia's Sydney Morning Herald (6/18/05), it led Senator James Inhofe (R-Ok.) to invite Crichton and Dr. Donald R. Roberts, a longtime pro-DDT activist, to testify before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.But other attacks only seem like fiction. A web page on junkscience.com features a live Malaria Death Clock next to a photo of Rachel Carson, holding her responsible for more deaths than malaria has caused in total (you Must tag on other deaths that are caused by the same transmission method: Yellow Fever etc). (\\"DDT allows [Africans to] climb out of the poverty/subsistence hole in which \`caring greens' apparently wish to keep them trapped,\\" it helpfully explains.) And a new website from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, RachelWasWrong.org, features photos of deceased African children along the side of every page.\\"\\"What is not mentioned in all of this is that much of the data that Carson used to back up her work was of her own making. Studies that are quoted did not and never have existed. No one can find where it was drawn from. Sources she quotes do not exist. Papers and publications she sites were never written and their authors are nowhere to be found. From what can be told at this juncture it was all a fabrication . . . a lie, made up to elevate her own personal insights to dogma.Given the above the only true virtue that can be attributed to \\"SILENT SPRING\\" is that it conclusively demonstrates that the shameful inclinations to lie, cheat, exaggerate, miss quote, quote out of context, misalign graphs (a la Al Gore) and out & out prevaricate that have lead to the current Climate-Gate e-mail scandal in the eco-terrorist/Chicken Little movement, have been there since the very beginning and are indelibly etched upon the collective movements soul."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"arrived quick and in great condition!

Even though cancer deaths for certain types of cancers are declining ( due mainly to more efficacious treatments)...cancer rates continue to rise in both people and animals.

At the time of her writing she knew the ideas presented in the book were going to be seen as radical, however, she never exaggerated the many facts that she consistently referenced. Today these ideas don't seem radical and the repetition is obvious, but that is only because we have learned from her writings.The information in this book was purposely repeated several times so that the reader would not forget the importance since these were entirely new ideas and information for the reader. Today the average reader will read this publication from the 60s and think yes you already said that, we already know this. When this book was published though, no one knew any of this, so the consistency of being reminded certain facts was extremely important. Additionally, the extreme criticism and backlash that she received from this writing (which seems to be forgotten today) was not from the average reader who thought this was a bad piece of writing, but rather from companies (and political figures who were financed by them) whose business processes were dependent on certain practices that were extremely harsh to the environment.A reader mentioned DDT, and yes the use of it is banned in America (along with many other countries), however, it is still being produced (the production and use are regulated differently; not sure where production is banned) and used in some parts of the world (which has an effect on us, no matter where you are) such as Africa, where certain parts suffer extremely from malaria. There is an ongoing debate as to whether DDT should be used or not used in these areas. There are several informational web sites on either side of the topic.Another reader wanted an updated version, which I think would be great. It would be very impressive if someone today could write another book about environmental conditions and would be yet another wake-up call that would produce a new mindset on our environment.

They wrap the new Ag students up tight.But I was always interested in organic farming, organic gardening, sustainable agriculture, and I, unlike so many in Ag., was always interested in what Rachel Carson had to say.What I found so interesting on re-reading this book many years later was that it was still so readable, so to the point, and most of all, that in all this time, so many of the things she warned us about back in the 60's, had not changed, were still here.I am a horticulture writer (author of Allergy-Free Gardening, Safe Sex in the Garden,(Ten Speed Press) & other books) and I keep a large supply of important reference books on hand.

I went out and got a copy of the book to see for myself. To my surprise and great disappointment I found that yes Carlson exactly what the reviewer said. Carlson claimed that there was a dramatic increase in the rate of death from childhood leukemia between 1900 and (circa) 1960 and blamed the increase on chemical pollution. Carlson failed to understand the difference between rate (as she defined it) and incidence. In 1900 children died from many different diseases most of which were cured by 1960. So naturally a greater fraction of child deaths would be from leukemia. If we cured all childhood diseases except leukemia then 100% of the childhood deaths from disease would be from leukemia. You really should compare the incidence rate in 1900 with 1960. Carlson did not do this, either out of ignorance or because it does not give the answer she wanted. This is not just a trivial mistake. It reveals a profound lack of competence in drawing conclusions from data. If you want a feel-good polemic against pesticides then you will like this book. If you want to be informed about the dangers of pesticides then read serious works by qualified epidemiologists. Junk science books like this do a disservice to the cause of environmentalism."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"The book starts out well enough and gets the point across.

Carson obviously felt similarly, and expressed her extreme passion for nature, the earth, living things, and the environment in her compelling book, Silent Spring. Carson was one who would not remain silent, or go without action. She boldly alerted the public to the poisons and dangers we are dispersing into the world. Carson's writing reveals her concern for everything that has been done to the earth, and will be done in the future. However, it also shows the hope that someday instead of pouring chemicals deemed intolerable and poisonous for humans by the FDA into our environment, natural and safer solutions will be sought and widely used for the same reasons. This book served as both a wonderful, thought-provoking read, as well as a terrible realization. I enjoyed how with each page I read, a myriad of questions arose forcing the reader to think about the distinctions between animals and man, the interconnected web of life, the silent and deadly killers eating away at the environment, and how we let it get this far. Despite the fact that this book was written in the early 1960's, it still teaches several valuble lessons to every reader. Since that time many advances in methodology, technology, and science have been made to alleviate many of the problems discussed in this book, but the damage has been done. Much of the environment will never be the same, and it's important to understand why. What is more powerful than a book to inform the unaware! Being born far after the time when the book was released, and the environmental movement began, this book has been a key tool in helping me to understand man's capacity to poison, kill, and destroy, as well as his amazing capability to understand, learn, help, teach, and try to change and fix what has been done."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book should be mandatory reading in all high schools. The issues identified decades ago are even more relevant today. This author made a major contribution to the world before her death. Now it is up to us to heed her early warning call."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Every once in a while a book comes a long that has such a profound effect on society that it creates a movement for awareness and betterment. Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, is one of those. Silent Spring did for the environmental movement what Upton Sinclair's The Jungle did for the labor movement and Uncle Tom's Cabin did for the anti-slavery movement. Carson took a stand on environmental abuses, especially against the chemical industry in this work of social criticism. Carson opened the eyes of many and forced many to take responsibility for their actions, which sparked a modern environmental and awareness movement that is still active today.Silent Spring discusses the implications of using harmful chemicals to all life--plant, animal, human and the like. They cause negative cyclical reactions--the processes do not continue to work, so it is the harmful chemicals to the Earth are repeated year after year. Though the chemical industry would make you believe the levels in use are not harmful, that is a fallacy. They are extremely dangerous chemicals and poisons, which build up over time in one's body and in the Earth, over time make them lethal.Carson did well in creating a book that everyone, not just science and environmental enthusiasts could both read and understand. The information presented captures the urgent and sincere trouble that the United States was heading down during the time Silent Spring was written. The use of chemical insecticides and pesticides was going against nature and creating irreversible damage to all living things. The Earth and its facets have its own built-in system to correct problems and to make it work in harmony. Industry, farmers, and others trying to self correct these--mainly by using large amounts of dangerous chemicals, upsets this balance and creates even more problems. It is a cyclical action where there is no positive end in sight.The actual idea of a \\"silent spring\\" which Carson helps the reader visualize in chapter one is a dreary one. Carson goes on to describe specific chemicals (especially DDT), their make-up, and specific hazards they pose. Pesticides and insecticides are both broken down into the dangerous poisons that they are. Carson discusses how these poisons are passed through the food chain, therefore leaving every living thing at risk. Unhealthy consequences, such as disease often occurs, resulting in death if exposed heavily. It is important to understand that the use of these chemicals creates the decline of the Earth's natural defenses against insect populations. By understanding that these poisons exterminate insects only temporary, it's clear that most insects develop resistance to the chemicals rendering them useless. For example, once insects become resistant they can take over in even greater numbers.Carson uses several chapters to focus on specific aspects of the Earth and how they are specifically affected by these poisons--water, soil, and plants are examined in detail. Carson goes into specific massive spraying campaigns that were used rigorously, but at the expense of the health of the planet and those inhabiting it. One in particular included the spraying in the Midwest for eliminating the Japanese beetle. The Japanese beetle became resistant to the chemicals and has now increased their population. The Midwest completely disregarded the fact that other parts of the United States had successfully used natural predators of the beetle. Again the \\"easier\\" and cheaper plan was used at the cost of much of the wildlife in that area.There was much research and reference to the effect this all had on the bird populations in the United States. This is likely because birds were greatly affected, but also because Carson began this book project after hearing about her friend's experience--many birds died in this friend's hometown as a result of a spraying campaign of DDT. Since birds eat insects and worms (which feed on the insecticides and pesticides) they are extremely vulnerable to being poisoned. Birds were also greatly affected by the mass spraying of DDT for Dutch elm disease. The birds' natural habitat was once again being negatively harmed.Rivers, streams, and lakes, along with the life that goes with it have also been greatly influenced. Groups of salmon were killed in the campaign against the spruce budworm in forests. Another forest campaign was against the gypsy moth--many people were affected by this (along with many other campaigns) as areas outside of the forest region were sprayed. This is not an uncommon occurrence though. There are few people in the world who do not carry residue from these chemical poisons in their body. Carson uses some of the last chapters to explain the human body's make-up and just how detrimental chemical insecticides and pesticides can be. This leads to diseases such as cancer and eventually death.As far as some negatives of the book--obviously since the book was written in the early 1960's it is not all up-to-date and relevant. Also, Carson becomes repetitive throughout the book. Though it may not be specifically relevant, it did occur and therefore it affects us nowadays in some way. Not all has been resolved as well--we have a long way to go to become universally environmentally friendly. This book should be used as a tool to help present day and future generations learn from the mistakes of the past. Also, it is fairly one sided with the information. Carson is presenting her findings, but not exactly presenting valid counterarguments.Carson does not just go over all that is wrong and leave it at that--she wraps up by explaining possible alternative methods of insect control, including some methods that have been tested and proven valid. These \\"biological\\" methods are based on understanding the living organism that needs to be controlled, as well as the environment surrounding it. Alternatives include the \\"male sterilization\\" technique, using natural enemies of the insects, creating weapons from the insects own life--understanding and then using the insects' venoms, attractants, repellants, and secretions against it. Also, sound repellent and the use of natural diseases of the insects and crops are also alternative ideas.Overall, Silent Spring is an incredible wake-up call for the fragility of earth and for the dangerous \\"butterfly effect\\"--one mistake can set off a chain of events critical to all life as we know it. Silent Spring is a classic work of literature that should be read by school children and adults alike, as a reminder to how vital it is to respect our amazing planet. Because it is not just the birds in danger, it is all of nature and all of humanity."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson sent tremors through American society with the publication of her 1962 book \\"Silent Spring.\\" Carson, a marine biologist who died two years after publication of the book, wrote \\"Silent Spring\\" when she received a letter from a concerned citizen lamenting the mass death of birds after a DDT spraying. Carson continues to serve as a touchstone for both mainline and radical environmental groups, from the Sierra Club to Earth First!. It is not difficult to see why; Carson's call for active involvement in our environment is still an absolute necessity today as the industrial system continues its rapid march across the landscape. If we do not want our children born with gills and fins, keeping Carson in mind is important.Carson's analysis of DDT and other synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides resulted in a deeply ominous conclusion-pesticides destroy the environment and threaten everything within the ecological system. Carson examined the composition of pesticides, revealing that synthetic pesticides have the ability to not only kill their intended targets, but they also move right up the food chain, eventually reaching the human population. The pesticides then build up in the tissues of the body, rarely breaking down but often building in intensity through continued exposure or changing into forms that are even more toxic by interacting with other ingested chemicals. Even worse, these chemicals cause tremors, paralysis, cancer, and a host of other unpleasant ailments. Carson cites numerous stories about exposed people falling ill and dying shortly after spraying these toxic chemicals. Carson also shows the biological process these poisons take when they enter the body, when they cut off oxygen to the cells and raise the metabolic rate to unhealthy levels. Carson proves these chemicals move on to succeeding generations of offspring through mother's milk and other biological processes.Most of the book deals with the effects of chemical spraying on wildlife in the environment. Separate chapters deal with birds, insects, fish, and plant life. Needless to say, the picture painted here is not pretty. Too often, spraying chemicals in the 1950's and 1960's brought into play the full ignorance of the human race. Carson's book shows how farmers applied pounds of poisons to their land, far exceeding the recommended application levels. Spray trucks moved through neighborhoods, hosing down the community with poison while the kiddies played outside in the yard. On several occasions, planes sprayed poison on cities. This reckless disregard for life in any form ruined landscapes, created mounds of animal corpses, and gave us tasty water that can melt your teeth.What is surprising about Carson's book is that people knew all about the effects of these poisons. \\"Silent Spring\\" made a difference because it puts it all together, showing how a series of localized incidents is, in fact, a national problem. Carson also wrote her book in a style where even the densest yokels in the herd could figure out the dangers of the problem. Since I am a science idiot, I appreciated Carson's clear articulation of the problem without sacrificing the hard data behind the examples.Carson delivers a stinging rebuke to our conception of mankind as the dominant force in the universe. If humanity truly rules the roost, so to speak, why are we such idiots about sustaining the very environment that feeds us? The ignorance of man in this book is astounding. Repeatedly, we destroy and destroy again even in the face of overwhelming evidence of the damage we are causing. Local governments kept spraying even when evidence showed it was a failure. Birds literally fell out of the sky while the trucks went out for another pass through the neighborhood. Dumb, dumb, dumb!\\"Silent Spring\\" concludes with a call for sanity. Carson's answer to the insane escalation of chemical spraying is to seek out biological control methods. Many insects have natural enemies that, if introduced into a problem area, will keep down pest populations. Even localized spraying will work better than mass, indiscriminate spraying. Carson argues that biological control methods are increasingly important because insects are building up resistance to pesticides, requiring the creation of even more virulent poisons in a never-ending cycle where nobody wins.\\"Silent Spring\\" is required reading for anyone concerned about the environment. Carson's book led to significant changes in environmental law (some would say not enough change) and resulted in the outright ban of DDT. My only problem with the book is the introduction written by Al Gore, as the publisher marketed the book with that fact in mind. Gore's name seems to merit equal billing with Carson's on the cover. One must remember Al Gore is a politician and is in league with the destroyers because he needs their money to run his expensive campaigns. Carson would be appalled."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Anyone who has read this book has easy reference to multiple studies that ALL show DDT is an entirely ineffective long-term solution to malaria. It isn't hard to miss the sexism in a lot of these comments, calling Carson out as \\"emotional\\" especially stands out-anyone who has actually read her book would struggle to find a trace of emotion as she describes case studies in depth. She loved nature, this is true, but the woman never made a single assertion that wasn't backed up by abundant research. The haters can call Carson names and accuse her of murder all day long, but the fact is there isn't a single study out there that gives any hope of DDT being a sustainable solution to malaria (or anything else, really. Does cancer count?). The only reason it is being sprayed in poor areas is because there is restricted funding for sustainable methods of mosquito-control, and DDT is well, cheap. But a cheap poison is still a poison, and at the end of the day none of the trolls on this page can produce any credible research to back up their opinionated claims. So they display this scientist, a woman who was never known to display anything other than calm composure, even when testifying in front of congress and the nation, as an overly-emotional wackjob who decided to rampage against toxic killers one day in the middle of a bad period. She was in fact, the exact opposite- a meticulous, exacting scientist who disliked open displays of emotion and cited all her assertions with plentiful evidence. Read this book, you won't regret it. Unless of course, you already hate facts- then join the trolls on this page!"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Too many reviewers see only one thread of Carson's argument: that DDT and pesticides like it endanger the environment. The other thread is that DDT resistance in mosquitoes develops very quickly, and the more quickly the more it is used. Which leaves us right back where we started. Her argument is not that pesticides should not be used, but that they should be used intelligently. In this age, when antibiotic resistant bacteria are becoming a very serious problem precisely because of antibiotic overuse (and not only in hospitals, but, most egregiously, as growth enhancers for livestock), this argument should be indisputable."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring - Rachel Carson (40th Anniversary Edition)It was finally time for me to pick up the book that is often credited with inspiring or starting the modern environmental movement. I'd heard of Silent Spring many times from environmental speakers and had seen it referenced in The Ecology of Commerce and in Megatrends 2010 (see other reviews). The title has lost nothing of its timeliness or relevance with the passage of more than 40 years since its first printing. To that point, First Mariner Books published a 40th Anniversary Edition with introduction and afterword by Linda Lear and Edward O. Wilson, respectively, that place the book and author in historical context and give credit for the impact both have had on our world.I want to first of all give the author praise for being much more balanced and far-seeing in her thinking than any of the detractors whose reviews I've read on Amazon would hint at. The main charge post-humously leveled is that rampant unthinking DDT (or worse) use would have saved lives lost to malaria had it not been for one woman writing a slanderous attack on the petrochem industry whose only apparent reason for being is to improve life. Rachel Carson's prose may have been very eloquent, pursuasive and moving but she was not advocating an extreme or unthinking position. Whereas she may have been extremely passionate about the need to make changes in the spray away mindset of the day, she did not call for throwing away what science could contribute to public health and well-being or even economic productivity. Quite the contrary, based on an ecological mindset and a commitment to understand nature and work with her, Carson encouraged exploring biologically wise means to control pests that thrive in a bio-defense impoverished monoculture. She cited figures and facts on successful pioneering integrated pest management programs and made a cost-benefit analysis that set the balance right.I may have majored in Economics, but I'll gladly take my science from scientists like Rachel Carson rather than the PR department of a chemical firm with a vested interest in selling a \\"silver bullet\\" that has to be reapplied year after year in greater amounts. Carson makes an ironclad case for the dangers of bioaccumulation of toxins in the food chain (yeah and guess who's at the top), the ill-targetted dispersal methods, insect resistance due to extremely short reproduction cycles and the mutagenic qualities of many of the new wave of pesticides. She lays out her arguments in such clear language and with sufficient analogies and background that a layman can easily follow and be more conversant in the concepts of the subject matter. The other criticism of the book by detractors' reviews is that there are \\"too many facts\\" referenced in it - I don't think these readers have any sense for the time period that Rachel Carson was writing in and the need for a woman, an outsider, to make damn sure that she lined up all the facts she could behind her case so as to not just be dismissed ad hominem when raising concern about how the men in the white coats were wisley dragging us down the wrong path.What's with all the wingnuts claiming that Carson is responsible for millions of malaria deaths by banning DDT? Nice Limbaughesque talking point, but as often, WAY OFF TARGET. The main thrust of the book is against agricultural pesticides where the damage caused by the target pest is economically less significant than the collateral damage of control efforts to the environment and human well-being. The reference to mosquito control in the actual book these buffoons claim to be reviewing is 1). a warning on mosquito resistance, 2). risk of wiping out the mosquitos natural predators with indiscrimminate control strategies (Nissan Island WWII), 3).exploring other more targetted control measures such as ultrasound."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring is, without a doubt, the most amazing book I have ever read. Though it is gut-loaded with facts, Carson' s ingenious wording makes reading it a somewhat enjoyable experience. It seems as if the words had an almost surreal quality. For example one of her chapters is entitled, &quot;Realms of the Soil,&quot; and another is, &quot;The Earth's Green Mantle.&quot; One can tell that this is her style of writing because she also used such titles in her other books such as Under the Sea Wind. With this style, the drawbacks are that about every sentence is difficult to understand, with few I completely did not understand at all. Then again, I am just a preteen; Silent Spring was intended for adults to read, comprehend, and then heed its warning. I most definitely can see why the people of the 1960's were so moved by this single book, for I could have almost be fooled to thinking that it was a piece of classic fictional literature when I began reading it.This book was also quite informative, as I was appalled by some of the actual events mentioned, like the story of a factory or warehouse that polluted the water around it so much that over time, the menagerie of chemicals bonded to form an additional one. It is true that Carson exaggerated a bit, but the point is, her message was sent far beyond a person's imagination. Silent Spring was the smoking gun against chemical toxins. Anyhow, I thoroughly enjoyed Silent Spring, and at times I found it hard to put down. After all, I did not give it such a high rating for nothing."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"As an entomologist I would like to clarify what I have seen in some of the prior reviews. I would also like future readers of this book to understand that it was written in 1962. It's important to understand what Rachel Carson's book was trying to do. She had to make an impact to millions of readers, and do so in layman's terms. That was a near insurmountable task, especially the way in which women in science were treated during that era.I do agree with others in that some of her statements are based on shaky evidence. However, I don't agree that see is responsible for thousands of deaths due to malaria. Diseases have existed for THOUSANDS OF YEARS, and all animals have had to deal with it, including humans. For example, humans with sickle cell anemia are immune to malaria.It is easy for someone in America to say that DDT should not be used in Africa to fight disease, because we don't have to deal with the thousands of people dying every day. Perhaps DDT can be used in more precise applications to cut down on mosquitos (which are the vectors or carriers of the disease). However, malaria and other autochthonous diseases in Africa can be dealt with by means other than DDT, and thanks to Rachel Carson, funding for research into areas such as creating transgenic mosquitos is a reality. Someday we may have the ability to eraticate malaria, and credit would undoubted have to partly go to her.The issue of the safety of DDT has been mentioned in many of these reviews, and the truth is NO ONE IS RIGHT! There has been almost no testing into the safety of DDT, so it's impossible for anyone to say that it's safe or dangerous (to humans). A famous toxicologist once said, &quot;The poison is the dose&quot;. The big problem with DDT is that it biomagnifies and is fat soluble; in other words gets easily passed through the food chain and increases consequently in concentration while been stored in fats. So basically, that &quot;dose&quot; increases and increases and can more easily damage organisms. But again, not a lot of scientific research has been done in this subject, so I wouldn't say anything about DDT other than a my own hypothesis.In summary, read this book, its a little dry, overstates its point, but it changed the world's perspective on pesticides.If you want to see a good reference on insecticides look for:Pedigo, L.

It appears that a few chemical snake-oil pushers and/or their apologists have been leaving bad reviews amongst the mostly glowing reviews, confirming the success and timeless message of Carson's work long after her passing in 1964.Indeed, *Silent Spring* is still one of the most referenced works when it comes to environment and chemical contamination of the environment. One will understand why after reading this monumental achievement.Ms Carson's work put environment and ecology squarely into our collective consciousness and part of that success is owed, inadvertently, to the chemical manufacturers who ruthlessly attacked her as a person and the integrity of her work. She was called before congress to testify about the dangers of pesticide/herbicide use and to prove her work while simultaneously being challenged by scientists and chemical manufacturer representatives.The outcome was that chemicals such as DDT, which were wiping-out non-targeted life forms such as the Bald Eagle, were eventually banned from use in the U.S.The controversy over pesticide use stirred-up another important issue and that was the chemical manufacturers insidious influence of university-level research. Manufacturers have always funded university research with rich grants for which they expect data to support their products success in the market-place. Researchers are often coerced by threat of loosing funding or their credibility challenged if their findings are not favorable to industry. Unfortunately, a few of those researchers are gladly willing to take part in this nefarious pseudo-science and seem not to loose any sleep over it.After the backlash of government and public outcry caused by Ms Carson\`s efforts, chemical manufacturers to this day think twice before attempting to publicly defame decent/honest chemical detractors, indeed, the possibility of being exposed by the dreaded \\"Silent Spring Syndrome\\" haunts them in a poetic gesture to the memory and work of Rachel Carson.After Ms Carson's exhaustive studies and field work, where the damage of pesticides and herbicides showed their insidious bad habits of spreading beyond target areas, polluting and disrupting biomes, her clear message to the public was simply stated:\\"Now at last, as it has become apparent that the heedless and unrestrained use of chemicals is a greater menace to ourselves than to the targets (bugs), the river which is the science of biotic control flows again, fed by new streams of thought.\\" (p 279) Indeed!Carson's legacy is enhanced by a host of dedicated people who keep her work not only referenced, but updated and disseminated through such beautiful books as: Sandra Steingraber's \\"Living Downstream: An Ecologist Looks at Cancer and the Environment\\" and for empathy and understanding of the insect world, there is Joanne E. Lauck's \\"The Voice of the Infinite in the Small: Re-visioning the Insect-Human Connection\\".In 1964, and after Ms Carson died, Robert L. Rudd, a zoologist and expert on the dangers pesticides, published hisstudy: \\"Pesticides and the Living Landscape\\". This work underscored and corraberated the importance Ms Carson's work and showed that many scientists could not be bought or intimidated by the chemical companies.The sad irony of the chemical manufacturer's dangerous assault on insects is that all bugs have a purpose, but then so do the chemical companies: to make a ton of money selling insanity to an unwitting and uneducated public. This constitutes one of the most irresponsible and insidious snake-oil scams in history.To learn more about Rachel Carson's legacy and resources for action, go to: www.rachelcarson.org and the Racel Carson Council: http://members.aol.com/rccouncil/ourpage/"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"In 1962, while still in college, I received, as a member of the Book-of-the-Month Club, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin Company, c. 1962). It opened my eyes to something I'd never considered: environmental destruction. It made me, rather abruptly, an environmentalist! I decided to re-read Silent Spring, and coincidentally noticed a remark in a magazine saying no one actually reads Carson's book these days. In part this is due to the fact that many of her \\"scientific\\" assertions never had merit. Indeed, her alarms regarding DDT, leading to its banning (and the resultant deaths of millions of Africans), amount to one of the great tragedies of the past century.Carson launched her work with a quotation from Albert Schweitzer: \\"Man has lost the capacity to foresee and to forestall. He will end by destroying the earth.\\" That's her fear. She herself was losing a battle with the cancer which killed her when she wrote the book, and she feared the earth, as well as she, might die, poisoned by pesticides. She feared the chemical flood we've unleashed since WWII might overwhelm the delicate biological networks which sustain life on earth. \\"The most alarming of all man's assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and even lethal materials. This pollution is for the most part irrecoverable; the chain of evil it initiates not only in the world that must support life but in living tissues is for the most part irreversible\\" (p. 6).We've done this, Carson argued, primarily to eliminate a few alleged \\"pests\\"--insects and weeds which annoy us. In fact, few of these \\"pests\\" pose significant threat to human survival or welfare, and in our effort to eliminate them we failed to understand three important facts: 1) the insects and weeds we try to destroy rapidly adapt to the poisons and thenceforth prove even graver threats; 2) the broadside spraying of chemicals kills good as well as bad creatures--thus the natural predators which kept populations balanced were often wiped out along with pollinating insects like bees which are necessary for plant life; 3) poisonous substances, such as DDT and DDD, though initially applied in small amounts, concentrate as they move up the food chain and remain permanently imbedded in certain tissues (fatty tissues in mammals, for example).Carson described the kinds of chemicals (she calls them biocides) which are most widely used in pesticides and herbicides, enabling non-scientists like myself to comprehend their composition and lethal power. Then she illustrates how these chemicals, mainly used in agriculture, flow into surface waters and leech into ground water. We're increasingly aware of water shortages, legal water wars between states such as Arizona and California, and poor water quality. I suspect Carson's still accurate in saying: \\"In the entire water-pollution problem, there is probably nothing more disturbing than the threat of widespread contamination of groundwater\\" (p. 42).She illustrates the crisis with the case of Clear Lake, California, 90 miles north of San Francisco. A good lake for fishing, it was also plagued by a gnat, annoying but not harmful to humans. In the late 1940's, DDD was applied at a ratio of one part per 70 million parts of water. The gnats quickly recovered, however, so in 1954 another spraying was done, this time at the ratio of one part per 50 million, followed by a third application in three years. Some noticed that many of the western (or swan) grebe began dying, and fatty tissues in the birds were found to contain 1600 parts per million of the poison. By 1960, of the original 1000 pairs of nesting grebe, only 30 remained. The gnats endured, as much a nuisance as ever; the birds, however, perished.\\"Silent spring,\\" of course warns of the disappearance of birds like the grebe. Massive amounts of herbicides and pesticides have been applied, unsuccessfully trying to deal with problems such as Dutch Elm Disease, only to end up killing songbirds such as robins. Dumped into streams and rivers, such \\"biocides\\" kill fish. And, ultimately, they also kill men and women who eat the fish. Carson explains, with consummate literary skill, the life of cells and the oxidizing wonders of tiny mitochondria within them, showing how they sustain life. Toxic chemicals, however, interrupt normal cell life and provoke abnormal reactions and growth.Much has changed since Carson published her treatise. Savagely attacked at first, her agenda, if not her research, has succeeded. Her concerns have encouraged others to continue her work, and toxics are no longer used as recklessly as they were in her time. This book endures as more of a classic literary work than a scientific work, a book which will be read in coming generations because it alerted us to a momentous problem and illustrated how science can be written so as to engage the popular mind."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I was disappointed to say the least of some of the following reviews of Silent Spring. It is no wonder that our earth is being so abused. Yes, Virginia, there is an environmental problem. Unfortunately, it is undeniable. The earth IS fragile (God-created or not), chemicals DO persist in the environment, and we &quot;environmentalists&quot; are NOT Marxists.You see, the significance of Rachel Carson's book was not its scientific accuracy, nor the position it took on DDT. Its significance was that it helped to turn national, even global, consiousness in a different direction. Suddenly we were not the only species on the planet. The steps we take to improve ourselves actually have an impact on the rest of the world...on our own environment. Everyday we make compromises. Ban pesticides, eat a hamburger. Both have significant impacts on the health and hunger of those less fortunate. We help one, we hurt another, whether individuals, businesses, species, or nations. There are few easy ways out. With our tendency to ignore long-term consequences, both negative and positive, it is easy to argue forcibly against such activists as Rachel Carson. Short-term results are nearly absent when we seriously consider securing the future of the earth.But shouldn't this security be a universal goal?So read Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and be moved as she feels the groanings of the earth and speaks out on their behalf. Thank you, Rachel, for having that courage, for opening that door."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Suppose an individual is in a time machine that is stopped during the period of the release of Carson's book \\"Silent Spring.\\" The environment is headed in a downward spiral, and any voice that speaks out against new methods of chemically destroying pests is suppressed by the strength of the government and its scientists. But in this moment, Carson defies the odds and strikes against these giant foes by releasing her literary arsenal upon the scientists and their chemical pesticides. By using specific examples, overwhelming amounts of facts, and well thought out scenarios, \\"Silent Spring\\" powerfully assaults the use of chemical pesticides on farms in the world.Carson, one who had her M.A. in zoology and was chief editor for all publications of the United States Fish and Wildlife Services, was the perfect individual to speak out against pesticides such as DDT in this \\"David and Goliath\\" match-up. Carson begins her book by playing out a scenario, one that could have occurred if the effects of DDT had not been exposed. By using vivid diction and a foreboding tone, Carson effectively portrays to her worldwide audience the horrifying effects that some chemical pesticides have on the environment. Carson then breaks the book down into sections that give specific examples of chemical pesticides harming nature, and then produces many facts and figures related to the use of these chemical pesticides. She also goes on to offer possible solutions to the problem, and gives possible outcomes in a manner that reflects Robert Frost's work \\"Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening.\\" She explains that the road \\"less traveled by\\" is the one that consists of a pesticide free world, where nature can continue to grow and expand. She explains the well-beaten path as the one that may be easy at that time, but would eventually lead to death and destruction in the world. This very powerful comparison helps to strike fear into the hearts of people in the world, which helped to create an outcry against DDT and other harmful chemical pesticides.This very inspirational work was one of the main reasons that harmful chemical pesticides such as DDT were removed from farms all around the world. Her work just may have saved the world from almost certain natural destruction. Individuals all around the world owe Rachel Carson a great debt for her efforts in writing this book. Thank you, Rachel Louise Carson."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"An excellent old book, yet with important and very valid content and teachings. The book should be done obligatory reading object for all students of environmental related subjects."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I remember that before this book, the wonderful brown pelicans had all but vanished from Edisto Beach. And then this book came out, and the world changed back, slowly but surely. After this brave woman wrote this clear and unforgiving book, the pelicans came back, so that each year there were more and more, till finally the beauty of their wings and bodies flying over that wonderful beach were back again, bringing the reality of life back to South Carolina. Just as her fiery condemnation of those chemical poisons helped clear away the death and destruction. Though there are still places which honor the wealth of sheep and cattle farmers so that wolves must die, still the beauty of Rachel's work keep many of us aware that we must work to save all of nature, which includes mankind. Thanks to this book, written by that brave and caring woman."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I always knew about this book - and heard that it had galvanized the environmental movement. But I didn't really know why. I do now, after reading (most of) it. I have never before or since read a book dealing with science and ecology that contained the passion and poetry of Silent Spring. It seems to be the perfect balance of critical scientific information, and a heart-felt condemnation of the practice of poisoning the earth, its inhabitants (i.e. including us!) and destroying entire ecosystems for the short-term benefit of high-profit industrialized agriculture.I have to admit, I didn't finish it. It did get somewhat redundant. I don't fault the author for it, though. Chapter after chapter of examples of men poisoning the natural environment with chemicals was quite depressing. It was very thoroughly written, and I learned a ton about some of the appalling practices carried out by our society in recent history."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Excellent, seminal book on the topic. It is frightening that so little has been done to change the situation even now."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Over all it was a good book, even for being out dated.

You cannot help but rethink your position on environmental issues after reading Rachel's book. The beauty is that it is not a scientific tomb - but a beautiful collection of heartfelt passion; well documented research; innovative and even dangerous ideas for the time (and even now) all eloquently written"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Yes, the book brought environmentalism into the light, and people started to care more about nature. But I also believe that DDT is not a harmful chemical, and that the ban on it should be lifted to save lives. The book isn't militant in its environmentalist themes- it does not aim for us to go back to nature, or to even have animals' needs fulfilled first. She implies that human life is, indeed, more important, and that humans come first. The aims of her book often concern the misuse of DDT, and the usage of actually deadly poisons.The book should not be heralded entirely for its scientific value (which is minimal). Instead, one should point out that this book is poetic, and well-written. It also stand as a testament to the power of literature, and the influence that words have on people."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"While people were being galvanized about the DDT problem in the 1960's due to Carson's book, they remained unaware of pesticides such as dieldrin, a mercuric-oxide-based pesticide even worse than DDT. Dieldrin was in wide use in states such as Wisconsin in the 1940s and 50s, where it got out of control and killed an estimated 1 billion fish, birds, and small mammals. The bad thing about dieldrin is that it can accumulate all the way up the food chain to a much greater degree than DDT.However, one strange thing about DDT I learned is that it basically accumulates in fat cells. In a fascinating article I read some years ago, the author said that theoretically, someone who was very overweight, say 50 pounds or so, and who had been exposed to small amounts of DDT over time, could have a toxic reaction if they lost weight too quickly. This is because the DDT is relatively inert once it's sequestered in the fat cells. However, if this person started dropping weight quickly, perhaps as a result of a crash diet, the DDT would get dumped into the bloodstream because of all the fat the person was burning, thereby causing a toxic reaction.Anyway, Carson's book is still a classic and there is no doubt the wake-up call it sounded was responsible for galvanizing the public's awareness about these issues, as well as producing important legislation and policies relating to the environment."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"In \\"Any Questions\\" on BBC Radio 4 a panel of politicians were quizzed in turn as to one person they thought would be regarded as an important person in the future from the 20th century who improved the lot of us humans. Of about four panelists one said Nelson Mandela. Being unimaginative this was backed up by about two of the others. I would have mentioned Rachel Carson although she still represents an unsung heroine - the pioneer of the \\"Deep Ecology\\" movement.Unfortunately a lot of what she had to say is still ignored by mainstream politicians though enough has trickled through to create a stream of people who think in the context of concern for all life on Earth rather than how best one group of us can dominate and manipulate our human and environmental resources at irreplaceable cost to life as we know it.This is the book that started it all - showing us that science and technology unrestrained were not the solution to all our problems. The EPA at least owes its very existence to Carson.I salute Carson and her book as a lighthouse that guided our thinking from the cliffs of short sighted destructiveness. Long may the beacon prevail.This is an important book. Perhaps dated, Carson's voice is not shrill but reasoned and strident. A classic worth sharing and upgrading."},{"Title":"A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy","review":"I use this book in teaching, and am very grateful for it. However, there are a few &quot;gotchas&quot; that the reader/student should be aware of.First, it's old. It was done in 1963 and won't be revised, since the author is dead. It thus has a very &quot;traditionalistic&quot; selection of texts, with philosophy more narrowly defined than I feel comfortable with. And of course, it doesn't include any of the textual discoveries since 1963, or any of the groundbreaking textual work, such as Graham's on the Chuang-tzu. There are major authenticity problems with some of the selections from the Kung-sun Lung-tzu and Tung Chung-shu as well.Second, even for its time, it's conservative. The author was, to put it kindly, credulous about some early datings. The discussion of the Lao-tzu is particularly problematic. There is also an overly dismissive attitude towards the thought of some periods, such as the Han.Third, it's somewhat biased, though in a very traditional way. The Neo-Confucian standpoint is more or less assumed true throughout. This detracts from the discussion of some documents earlier than the Neo-Confucians.None of this is an argument not to use the book. But be just a bit careful if you do."},{"Title":"A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy","review":"Dr. Chan was my college Asian philosophy professor so I used the book under special circumstances. As I recall, it was to be a beginning for those interested in the subject and was not intended to satisfy those further along in their studies. He was always receptive to differing views, and I think, would have been pleased to argue his points. He might be called conservative, but it was not easy for intellectuals still stuck in Mao's China as he was as a young man. He told us of having to read in the toilet so no one would know. The book is very simply written, easy for a novice to grasp and structured in such a way as to encourage discussion about the various philosophers. I recommend it for those with a budding interest in the subject. It gives a good overview and would encourage most readers to go on. No book should be read without the possibility of questioning what it contains just as no teacher should ever be regarded as the ultimate authority."},{"Title":"A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy","review":"We owe a great debt to the late Professor Chan for having translated this anthology of selections from over 2,500 years of Chinese philosophy. To my knowledge, this is the only anthology that gives so many selections from so many different periods in Chinese history. Perhaps there never will be a book like this again, at least by one scholar, because I doubt anyone else is competent to translate so many texts from so many different periods.That being said, this book also has serious limitations. Arbuckle's review (which is nearby) expertly identifies many of them. Here are some more. Chan's English is much better than my modern Chinese, but he still sometimes lapses into incoherence. With a few exceptions, his comments on the translations are both confusing and confused. Chan likes to use Western philosophical terminology, but he is not in command of it. It is neither accurate nor helpful to describe the Ch'eng-Chu wing of Neo-Confucianism as &quot;rationalistic,&quot; and the Lu-Wang wing as &quot;dynamic idealism.&quot;For many of the philosophers that Chan covers, this is still the best source for translations. This is especially so of later Chinese philosophy. I know of no better translation of selections from Ch'eng Yi and Ch'eng Hao, for example. But for many other philosophers, you would be better off with translations with a more narrow focus. Daniel Gardner's _Learning to Be a Sage_ is a great source on Chu Hsi. And I would (not surprisingly) recommend the anthology I co-edited for translations from ancient Chinese philosophers. (D.C. Lau, Victor Mair, and Burton Watson have also produced more extensive translations of major early Chinese philosophers. Look up their names here on amazon.com.)"},{"Title":"A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is somewhat dated. However, it still ranks as one of the most accessable books in print about Chinese philosophy. Chan is an expert at culling the essential material from the various sources and distilling them into coherent chunks. However, Chan is notorious for leaning too heavily on the Confucian side of Chinese tradition.My professor, Wm. Theodore de Bary, arguably Chan's successor, occasionally raises points in class regarding problems with Chan's work. In Wm. de Bary's point of view, the problems are not serious but they are worth addressing in a revision. For example, Chan uses the phrase &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; following an earlier translation while a more accurate translation would be simply &quot;The Mean&quot;. Chan has similar problems with English-language usage, but these only occur in exceptional instances. More often he gets bogged down in terminology that was commonly in use during his period but now seems dated.Another matter to bring up, although not necessarily a problem, is Chan's personal faith in Christianity, which may have influenced his choice of word usage and selection of materials.Objections aside, this is a wonderful book that anyone with more than a passing interest in Chinese philosophy will find useful. After reading this book, one might want to move on to Prof. de Bary's newly-revised &quot;Sources of Chinese Tradition&quot;, and then on to more specialized works."},{"Title":"A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy","review":"This 1969 sourcebook is the culmination of a Neo-Confucian researcher's work. The late author's philosophical leanings do not necessarily detract from its authority because he's relatively forthright about his opinions. Chan's work is commonly cited not only in the West but also in Taiwan and Hong Kong, despite the fact that wave after wave of archeological findings have illuminated these texts since this book's publication. The cloth edition of Laozi found in Mawangdui, Changsha in 1974 redefined Confucian scholarship, for instance.This work is probably the best introduction to Chinese--indeed, Asian--philosophy I can think of. For more intensive research I like the carefully annotated originals from the Hong Kong series Zhonghua Shuju ([...]). They are conveniently organized and offer a wider variety of perspectives."},{"Title":"A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy","review":"This anthology has been around seemingly forever and was one of the first books I looked into (after the original basic texts) in studying Chinese Philosophy. Since it's publication, however, a lot of work has been done in this field, and the information we have in the West has increased manifold.The text is excellent in covering the basics, which it presents in a very straightfoward, if not somewhat regimented manner. The basics are definitely here - organized for accessiblity. The history is comprehensive - if not deep, precise - if somewhat lacking in interpretive subtlety. As other reviewers have noted, Chan seems to be more sensitive to his own perspective in the space that he allows to other schools of thought (although he admirably includes them all). The Sourcebook is perfect for the one or two page synopsis of key ideas. Every key concept and figure is at least mentioned.However, if one's interest in primarily in the roots of Chinese thought, especially the incredible \\"hundred schools period\\", one ought to consider A.C. Graham's masterpiece, \\"Disputers of the Tao\\" for a more engaging, searching philosophical discussion. I also have a place in my heart for the introductory essay of Waley's translation of the Tao Te Ching, \\"The Way and its Power\\".The three texts together make for a pretty good introduction to Chinese Philosophy in translation. Chan's enduring tome is a treasure house of learning which can hardly be ignored by any student of Chinese philosophy, religion, or society."},{"Title":"A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy","review":"A bargain anthology that includes extended selections from well-known and lesser-known Chinese works, with brief historical introductions and notes.

As is true with a good share of his writing, the author has produced a work which is not so much non-fiction as it is the fulfillment of a pre-conceived set of beliefs. The book reads well and the countless references to previously unknown or little known incidents are interesting, but because of the author's obvious wish to support a predetermined opinion, the reader is left with little choice but to reserve room in his own mind for some healthy doubt.

If learning truth does not attract and tempt you, then no amount of proof would convince you. But, if you are a person who values truth - no matter upon who it casts its illuminating light, then this book is a MUST READ. America's Civil War cost the lives of over 700,000 of America's finest men and boys, untold pain and suffering by both civilian and military personnel, loss of property, not to mention its resulting in the 'rape' and 'distortion' of our Constitution. 99% percent of Americans probably think that the South started the war by wantonly firing upon a small garrison starving in Fort Sumter. Poppycock! I can tell you flat out, and stake the lives of my wife and children, on the knowledge that Lincoln was determined for a war even before he was inaugurated, and he used lies, deceit, and chicanery to lure the South into actually firing the first gun. Who is a fault in starting a war - the side that actually fires the first shot, or the side which puts the other in a position of having to fire the first shot for defense? If you detect an armed burglar in your house, are you at fault for firing first, or should you wait for him to fire first? Lincoln, who sits upon his Mt. Olympus type throne in the Lincoln monument, is the most despicable president we ever had, and is responsible for all this loss of life that has marred this country ever since. Close examination reveals that he was despised and distrusted by his contemporaries, and was only apotheized after death - this being necessary for the survival of the Republican party of the day. Most Americans don't know (or probably care for that matter) that he is the only president to ever issue a warrant for the arrest of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (Justice Taney) if only because Justics Taney made known his disagreement with Lincoln concerning his suspension of the writ of habeaus corpus (our most sacred law). Read this book and maybe you then just might be able to understand why we can't necessarily trust our own government to this day. Waco, Ruby Ridge, Vince Foster's murder, Kosovo, Elian Gonzales, Oklahoma bombing - can we really believe we are being told the truth? The people of the north in 1861 sure weren't being told the truth, and many died as a result of it."},{"Title":"America's Caesar","review":"The reviewer was steered to this book by amazon.com for which I am thankful.

However, thanks to the National Archives and [...] all the material is available ON LINE for the reader to do their own research and draw their own conclusions. I would venture to say that they would not be far afield from that of Mr. Durand's. The only true method to understand history is to read the source material contemporary to the era that has captured your interest. Thanks to the two sources I mentioned above, my personal library of source material for this particular era now exceeds 100 volumes.It has been said that history repeats, I would argue that it does so because we continually fail to recognize the patterns of history.When historians look back on the true history of this country, it will be found that as with ancient Rome, America too, can be divided into two distinct periods, that of the Republic and that of the Empire.

The winners write the text books, but what if another voice was heard? What if the lack of liberties that Americans now face can be directly traced to the lust for power and control by one man, who abused media (see the publisher's work on the American Bastille!) and manipulated men into one of the most ferocious wars ever fought.As is the case in history, wars are fought over money and power. Invaders are generally in the wrong, and to slap a moral tag \\"free the slaves\\" is an insult to African Americans who have been taught that Lincoln was friend of their anscestors, and a \\"moral\\" man on a journey to reluctantly end slavery. Two years into the war, the issue of slavery finally rose to the surface; and the ranks of the North experienced great declension in number.

Nowadays it is a given that an interesting, educated woman might have a book dedicated to her... at the time it was quite a venture!"},{"Title":"Carlyles at Home","review":"Now it is quite common to write biographies of the wives of great writers and thinkers of times past, but when Thea Holme, an actress living in 24 Cheyne Walk , wrote about the former mistress of the house Jane Carlyle it was very unusual. Yet the experiment was a success: Holme was a superior writer, and this short study of the Carlyles' lives at their home for over thirty years draws you thoroughly into its world of fighting with noisy neighbors, managing funds, and caring for small pets. Jane, the center of the book, emerges as hypochondriacal and at times overly sensitive, but paradoxically also intrepid and likeable. It would have been nice had Holme not taken Carlyle's career and the couple's courtship in Scotland for granted and provided more detail in these respectsm, but so much is given within here it is hard to complain. The book is ideally suited for its new edition through the marvelous Persephone Books; atypically, they chose not to use a period fabric for their endpaperes but instead wisely reproduce Roberrt Tait's famous 1857 \\"A Chelsea Interior,\\" which shows the Carlyles among their beautifully wallpapered and richly upholstered library."},{"Title":"Carlyles at Home","review":"The Carlyles At Home is an account of the years that Thomas and Jane Carlyle lived at 5 (now 24) Cheyne Row, London, moving there in 1834 and covering the years up until Jane's death in 1866. Thomas Carlyle was, of course, a famous writer and essayist, and the couple hobnobbed with many famous people (as a side note, it was interesting to learn that John Stuart Mill's maid accidentally burned the manuscript of Carlyle's The French Revolution, thinking it was waste paper!). Carlyle's relationship with his wife was stormy, to say the least; but this book is less about all of that than it is about the couple's domestic arrangements.The book is short (about 200 pages), but it covers a lot of ground, from the animals the couple kept (the story of their dog, Nero, is especially touching), to the clothing they wore both inside and outside the house, to the various repairs and restorations the Carlyles made to the house (it turns out that 19th century contractors are much like their modern-day counterparts), to the wacky, noisy neighbors at number 6 (and the not-soundproffed soudproof room they had built), to their Servant Problem (34 maids-of-all-work in 32 years), it's all here. And all very interesting, despite the fact that the domestic matters of famous people are frequently overlooked in favor of their accomplishments.The book draws heavily from the voluminous correspondence that the Carlyles maintained over the years--it turns out that not only was Carlyle a writer, but Jane was as well. Her letters are witty and funny, and prove that the story of the woman behind the man is as interesting as the story of the man himself. Really, this book is more about Jane. Although I appreciate the tone of their correspondence, I'm not sure I would have wanted to live with the Carlyles--it seems as though Thomas was always complaining about something, or that Jane was constantly sick and in a bad temper. Their marriage has been described as unhappy, but in this book, I don't see that at all.I thought the organization of the book could have withstood some better organization; it's organized by subject matter and not chronologically, so things could often get confusing. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this glimpse into the lives of two intelligent, interesting people, written by an actress who lived in the Carlyles house nearly a hundred years after Jane's death (the house is now a museum; her husband was the curator there). Although a strong female is at the heart of this account, it's not an overly feminist book."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Karen Robards is one of the leading writers in Romantic Suspense and in PARADISE COUNTY, she has done it again.Alex Haywood is recovering from her father's death (an apparent suicide) and the discovery that his fortune is gone. She has to fire Joe Welch, manager of the family horse ranch, except Joe refuses to stay fired. Joe wants to protect his family and grow his share of the ranch. Falling for a rich girl who is bound to leave (like his ex-wife did) is not on his list. Especially if she has a sister like Neely who falls for one of Joe's sons. Fortunately for the story, Joe's hormones, and Alex's, don't listen to their rational sides.All is not well in Paradise County, however. A truly evil villain (he is so bad he not only rapes and murders women, he also sets dogs on fire) is intrigued by Alex and Neely. Noone, not even Alex herself, can believe the increasing evidence that she is being watched--stalked.PARADISE COUNTY is steamy-sexy, with a believable attraction between Joe and Alex. Unlike most romantic suspense novels, this one ends the romantic conflict before the suspense--but the suspense ends in an epic struggle between good and evil. Robards penetrates deep into the mind of the 'predator' creating a far more frightening character than would have been possible if she had not. Be careful, though. The predator is not for the faint hearted."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"All in all an excellent read. Not since Walking After Midnight, have I enjoyed reading about a hero, so much. Joe Welch certainly personifies the sexy man of the 21st century. Handsome, compassionate, family man, with a great body, Joe really sparks up the pages. When he and Alex after facing off twice, find themselves alone at an opportune moment, things really heat up. The supporting cast of teenagers was wonderfully characterized and so believable. I am so tired of reading about nearly perfect teenagers in a lot of Romances these days.I mean who do those kids belong to? With two of my own, it was refreshing to see that someone else has normal, body piercing, hair dyed pink, teenagers that smoke marijuana, even if they aren't real. It was obvious that Karen has teens or has been around them. As with all of Karen's books there is a macarbe psycho pervert on the loose and there is a nice plot twist with the old house and the secret passages. Best of all was the highschool pep rally, hay ride and walk in the woods, reminiscent of days gone by and it was nice to see not much has changed that way in small communities."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This book was very good and has an exciting, fast paced storyline. I was kept guessing as to who the serial killer was, which is usually obvious. Which might be because I did take the advise of a previous reviewer, who forewarned reader's about graphic animal cruelty scenes in the beginning of the book, by skipping those sections of the story. I really wish authors who used sadistic villains in their stories would leave more to the readers imagination. I really have no need to be \\"in the mind of a killer.\\" Especially when trying to enjoy a good romance. But, after having skipped that bit of the story, I really don't feel that I missed a thing. The relationship between all the characters, first and secondary made this book well worth the time I spent reading. The story is very realistic, I kept thinking, \\"Thank goodness, that's exactly what I would do!\\" Unlike most portrayals of truly frustrating characters that never do the obvious."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"A vintage whodunit from one of the Romantic Suspense genre's consistent stars! The story revolves around the presumed suicide of a millionaire, whose less than legitimate business practices are revealed after his death, propelling his company into bankruptcy. His oldest daughter Alexandra finds herself handling the liquidation of all of the family holdings (including a horse farm in Paradise County Kentucky), dealing with a very interesting younger half sister, the crusty young horse farm manager and his family, and unbeknownst to her a serial killer.The book was refreshing, and a shear pleasure to read. So many of the Romance turn Romantic Suspense writers, including Sandra Brown, Tami Hoag and Nora Roberts have turned away from their roots with their hardcover novels (to be fair to Nora Roberts, however, her niche books in the \\"Romance\\" genre remain pretty steamy). I've begun to wonder, however, if editors have convinced these once best selling authors that a good hardcover book shouldn't focus on romance, but down play. If that's the case, they've done it, to the extent that this element of their stories has become bland and uninteresting, and in most cases, so have the stories themselves.Karen Robards and Linda Howard are two authors who haven't made this change in their hardcover books. Both Robards and Howard have only become better, maturer storytellers in the Romantic Suspense genre; remaining true to their strengths-great romantic tension in the middle of a plausible mystery.In Paradise County, the predator is as evil as they come, and the suspense leading up to the climax is well handled. Paradise County is one of Ms. Robards' best. It's an engrossing, suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This is another of her &quot;can't put this one down&quot; books. I love everything I've read by this author. I am more partial to contemporary romances and this one is an excellent one. I found myself fantacizing of moving to this town to find the hero in this book. You can never go wrong with Karen Robards."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Alexandra has lost her father and his millions, not to mention her finance married someone else and her sister Neeley has runaway from school again. She now has to sell everything that she loved, including Whistledown her father's horse ranch. When meeting the farm manager Joe Welch she finds herself in for a challenge. The first night at Whistledown she discovers someone is in her house. Frightened she and her sister run to Joe's house. Not sure on what to believe Joe helps her out. You know in the book there is a serial killer and now he is fasinated with Alexandra. He wants her and sneaks into her house to watch her sleeping. He's just biding his time... When Neeley and Joe's son Eli disappear they know something bad has happened. Now they are in a race for time. Can they find Neeley and Eli in time or will they be the next victim. And what will happen to Alex? Fast paced and hard to put down. Ms. Robards does it again."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This was the first audiobook that I've listened to completely. The reader did a good job. You get the damsel in distress, with a knight in shining armor trying to take care of them and his three children. You get a killer whose next victim could be anyone. It was fun to listen to with just the right amount of suspense, drama, humor and romance. I don't know if I would call it Paradise, but I would call it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"In Kentucky, Whistledown horse farm manager Joe Welch finds the owner Charles Haywood dead in a barn. Joe thinks Charles committed suicide since the deceased smelled of alcohol and a gun with a discharged bullet was near him. After the funeral, Charles' daughter Alexandra fires Joe, giving him thirty days to leave. Joe refuses, intending to complete his current contract, forcing Alexandra to explain that the horse farm is bankrupt and she will have to sell its assets, the horses.Alexandra, a renowned photographer, spends the night at Whistledown for the first time in a quite a while. She gets spooked when she hears breathing in her room with no one there. She and her teenage sister Neely flee to Joe's house. At the same time, a psychopathic killer tortures a young lady who looks similar to Neely. Over the next few weeks, Alex and Joe fall in love, but happiness eludes them when her sister and his son Eli vanish.Karen Robards has a unique writing style that provides readers with a fresh voice with every new novel she publishes. PARADISE COUNTY is a high caliber romantic suspense novel featuring realistic characters struggling with a rainbow of feelings. The steamy romance between the adult couple is counterbalanced by the sweet relationship between Neely and Eli. Ms. Robards knows how to raise the temperature on several levels with a strong tale that will excite sub-genre readers.Harriet Klausne"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"After the death of her father, Alexandra Haywood is left with the job of seeing after her father's estate. Contrary to what everyone believes- the estate is broke and has to be down sized. The lawyer suggested that Alexandra let him take care of dismissing employees and selling race horse farm but Alexandra feels she owes it to the loyal employees to be told by her that they no longer have a job. She sets out for Paradise County, Kentucky. When she mets Joe Welch, the farm manager face to face and tells him to sell off the horses so she can sell the farm, Joe fights her all the way. His dream was to make these horses the best race horses yet and now it is being shot to pieces. Sparks fly! Emotionally and physically between the two. There's an attraction there between Alexandra and Joe but never want to admit it due to the friction over the farm. It is still hard for Alexandra to believe that her father would commit suicide- but that is what the report says- but even from it things don't add up. And Joe Welch was the one that found him dead. Alexandra wants to do some questioning of her own. The more Alexandra ask the more unusual things start turning up, like a presence in her bedroom at night and someone setting the house on fire- could someone be out to harm Alexandra? Alexandra's kid sister showing up from school to live with her doesn't help the matter. Joe has his kids to keep track of too. Being a single parent hasn't been easy but Joe has worked at it. Now he has someone else needing some of his attention- Alexandria. Can he deal with someone special coming into his life after all of these years of being single? The story line is good but there seemed to be something left out of it. It seemed choppy to me- I don't know. It just wasn't one of my favorites. But I wouldn't say don't read it. Just don't buy it. There is better out there."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This book has it all, romance, suspense, and humor. I have just discovered the books of this author and cannot wait to read them all. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Have read most, if not all, of Ms. Robards' novels and found this one to be a major disappointment. I found the central romance to be way too far beyond the bounds of possibility---even within the romance genre. Instead of developing one strong theme, she threw a surplus of subplots and diversions into the mix---reminding me of an overly-decorated Victorian parlor."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I found this to be another good Karen Robards romance. I'd have to agree with another reviewer that the chapters involving the pschopathic murderer were a little to graphically violent but the rmoance was hot and the story basically fun. I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. I read it on one day. The characters are crisp and the romance sizzles. I felt as if I was in Paradise County. I was really suprised to see the low count of stars for this book and am hoping this will bring the rating up a bit. The writing is superb."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I read half of the book and found it to be only a sex manual. The story plot is shallow and could have been written in a few pages. Why does she feel the need for detailed sexual experiences? If the story is good, such details are not necessary. Didn't she use the same type of &quot;hidden&quot; villian in a previous book? An earlier book with the horse farm background was much more interesting. Most earlier books were better than the recent ones."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This is the first work of Karen Robard that I have been disappointed in. The characters were lacking something. I could not finish this book. I have enjoyed most of her works."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I'd recommend this book on the romance alone!! You could feel the chemistry of Joe and Alex jumping off the pages!! The suspense aspect was ok too, but the romance was the best part of this book. I'm sure I'm going to read this a 2nd time!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Another great novel by Karen Robards. She never fails to create a story of suspense filled with a hot romance. I was a little disturbed by the \\"predator's\\" method of murder and its descriptions but overall, this book was excellent. If you are a suspense/romance fan, read it!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This book was great. And ya, there is a psycho killer on the loose, but that is why this is a romantic-suspence, and not just a romance. It had me on the edge of my seat, and was so hot, I could have melted. This book broke me into romance, and I still love my suspence books. Loved it. Mrs. Robards is one of my favorties."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I have read many books in my time, but this has to be the all time worst. If this is supposed to be a love story with a twist, all I can say is \\"no thank you\\". The insert on the inside cover is to me, very misleading. Granted, it does say that \\"bad things\\" happen in the book, but does not indicate just how twisted the plot is. I could not even get to the end of the book, it was so disturbing. Someone else read the last part and told me who \\"did it\\". He too, agreed that the things the person did to others in the book, were so horrid that it was enough to give even the most seasoned reader nightmares. It is the ultimate how to book, when it comes to what unspeakable things one person can do to others!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Sick,. sick,. sick,. Complete waste of time. Wish I had read some of these reviews before I picked it up at the library. Fortunately, I didn't pay for it or waste more of my time by reading the entire trashy book!!!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I just adore this book! The (reluctant) hero is a real man, not an over-the-top, too-good-to-be-true god that the reader cannot relate to. The heroine isn't perfect, either, which is why she is so realistic. The sexual tension between them leaps off the pages, and the love scenes are dynamite. Robards fans will really like this one, and those new to the author will like what they find, as well.After this one, check out \\"To Trust a Stranger\\""},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This book was nowhere near her usual standard. I read Robards novels for interesting plots, richly drawn characters, and a little romance and intrigue on the side. This novel, however, is less a romance or a mystery than a disgusting, excessively violent treatise on how to abduct and torture animals and women. Ugh. I was disappointed that an author as creative and talented as Robards would resort to the unsubtle, unnecessary, repulsive descriptions that she does in this novel. I REALLY do not want to read a detailed description of a pathetic stray dog being lit on fire and tortured, to say nothing of the equally disturbing descriptions of what the killer does to his victims. I don't mind the presence of a psycho killer, but I think the novel would have been much more suspenseful, and a lot less stomach-turning, with more subtle descriptions. After all, things the reader has to imagine himself are the most frightening. Things laid out in repellent detail are just disgusting."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Not only was I very disapointed in this book - I was also replused by it. What is this prevailing trend in romantic suspense that predicates a really Sick and Twisted Villian??? In this particular book Ms. Robards seems compelled to up the ante by having her bad guy commit an egregious act of animal cruelty - on paper or not, it was needlessly cruel and violent and did not need to happen for the story to unfold. And what a story it is...Poor Little Rich Girl and the Virile Stablehand - there's even the predictable sub-plot romance. How trite and how not very interesting - I've read this story millions of times and 999,999 of them have been better written. Save your money and donate it to an animal cause on behalf of &quot;Karen Robards&quot;."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Not sure what's up with these reviews, I loved this book! One of my favorites of hers. The romance between Alex & Joe was SUPER HOT. Alex is adorable and sassy and gorgeous, and Joe is manly and strong and they are perfect together. Plus the subplots of his children, who are great, Alex's little sister (who makes the story along w/ Joe's oldest son) - plus the first suspense story that actually pulls off suspense as well as a creepy factor. The romance is STEAMY and you will not want to put it down. Loved it!!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Paradise County is a very good book because it has a variety of themes in it. It keeps the reader interested and because there is a mystery the reader will want to keep reading until the end of the book.The story takes place in Shelby County, Kentucky. The beautiful scenery and finest horses make people call it \\"Paradise County\\". Charles Haywood is a very rich man who owns a horse farm called Whistledown, located in Shelby County. He is there visiting his horse farm when he unexpectedly dies. His death is ruled a suicide. Joe Welch, who manages Whistledown and has lived on the farm since he was younger, is the one that found Mr. Haywood. Joe has three children and raises them by himself. Their mother and his wife left them many years before. Alexandra Haywood is Charles Haywood's daughter. She and her younger sister Neely, come to visit Whistledown to oversee the selling of the horse farm. When Mr. Haywood died, Alex and Neely were left in debt. The horse farm and the horses had to be sold. While making arrangements for Whistledown, Alex also wants desperately to find answers to her father's so-called suicide. She can't believe her father would have killed himself. Joe and Alex's first meeting with each other is very unpleasant. The meeting turns out very bad, they hate one another. After a few days at Whistledown, Neely, who is a teenage wild child, starts hanging around with Joe's son Eli. Eli is Joe's oldest son and is sixteen years old. Alex and Joe also start to develop a better relationship. It seems that their hatred for each other turns into passion. While Neely and Eli get into a few mischievous situations, Alex and Joe start a romantic relationship. All of a sudden Neely and Eli disappear. Alex and Joe start uncovering a mystery while trying to find them. Soon they all become in danger. It turns out a murderer has been living in Paradise County. Throughout the book, the story goes from the characters at Whistledown to the unknown murderer. The murderer is killing his victims and keeping some prisoner. It goes into detail about his victims at different times in the book.I enjoyed this book because it made me want to keep reading until I uncovered the mystery. I wanted to find out who the murderer was. I also enjoyed the developing love stories. Paradise County also talks about a ghost, which might appeal to some readers. This book had passion, murders, and comedy all mixed into it. Readers will want to see if eventually the murderer is caught. Most of the story is believable. It is likely that a rich man could have been murdered. It is also likely that he could have committed suicide. People who might despise each other could fall in love with each other. There are murderers around, even in what seems like a \\"paradise\\" type of place. Some might question the fact that the girls see a ghost of their father, while others might not think twice about that idea. The author does not use extremely difficult words, they are easy to understand and follow. As far as character development goes I think Alex and Joe's characters developed a lot as the story went on. I feel that they both were judgmental at the beginning. It is interesting to see the hatred they have for each other quickly turn into love. They seem to need each other very much.I would recommend this book to anyone but especially to people that enjoy a good mystery. If someone enjoys all types of books, this would be one to read because the reader gets a mixture of different themes."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"First of all let me say I HATE books where the bad guy is a psycho-female-killing-torturing goon. (I'm not giving away the plot by mentioning the psycho since he is in the story from the start.) To my way of thinking, it is a plot cop-out. I KNOW authors can come up with a better way to get the heroine in danger (and thus allow our hero to rescue her). BUT. . .that said, I really liked this book. I more or less skimed over the psycho part and concentrated on the rest of the story. Yes, you need one to make the other, but you don't have to dwell on his actions until the end of the book. This book might not singe your eyelashes, but it is pretty hot stuff and Joe and Alex are hot together. I'd put this one on the keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Karen Robards crafts the most deliciously evil villians and this book is no exception. Villians are people too, and it's just as important to get a sense of their goals and motivations as it is the main characters. I have yet to put down a Robards book for lack of exciting and intriguing characters."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"If I could give this less than one star, I would! I usually love Karen Robards' books. I have several of her books that I reread at least once a year. This one is horrifying! When I got to the villian pouring kerosene on a dog in preparation to set him on fire, I threw the book across the room. Two weeks later, I ripped the book apart and fed it into my new cross-cut shredder. I love books and this is the first and only book I've ever felt compelled to destroy so no one else had to read it. If I want something disgusting enough to give me nightmares, I'll read true-crime books or watch the news. Reading books is supposed to be an enjoyable escape, not something that you spend weeks trying to get out of your head every time you close your eyes. Especially disappointing is when the book is written by one of your favorite authors and it's supposed to be &quot;romance.&quot; My advice: If you love animals and hate needless torture and cruelty, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I have read all of Ms. Robards' books and enjoyed all but the last few. Lately, it seems that she is upping the ante with her villains as their acts become more heinous. I read romantic suspense novels for a few hours of escapism, not to be grossed out by evil antics. Ms. Robards needs to lighten up or be listed with other horror genre authors."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I try not to review a book based on the moral message, but rather on the quality of the book itself, but this time I just could not do it.I could not believe this book is supposed to be a romance. Ms. Robards has the talent - as usual - of making you feel that you are right there in the story - she has the ability to make her scenes come really alive. I am sorry that she uses this talent to give us the mind and feelings of a psycho - and sorry that I read it.What previous reviewers failed to mention - as far as I saw - was that the graphic violence was not limited to dogs! He abducts women, too, obviously - about twenty over ten years - or more - and there is a little too much detail for me. A lot! Yes, nothing actually happens to Alex - the heroine - but the other women were also human beings - I can't believe I read this. And I can't believe that people who read this are only bothered about the dog!I read romance to escape from all this - from the frying pan into the fire, in this case.And, yes, besides for all that, the book is good. Just not romance."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This book was an excellent read! Riveting, and hard to put down, from the country charm of a thoroughbred farm to the suspenceful and surprising murders and mysteries. Very steamy sex scenes, and a great plot!!!

The \\"predator\\" scenes were very disturbing and graphic, and I wondered two things after finishing the book. He killed a total of 30 people. I'm assuming that they were all abducted from either his motel or the rest area, and yet the characters in the books repeatedly claim that there is no crime in Paradise County. I also wondered what he did with all of the cars and trucks of the victims, including Eli's. Silly things, but they spoiled the credibility of the book for me."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This was the first book I read by Karen Robards. I read an exerpt in Cosmo and just had to buy the book. It was fantastic and I was hooked from cover to cover! I will definately be purchasing more books by this author."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"Believe me when I say I would love a sizzling romantic suspense -yet Paradise County by Karen Robards failed to enchant.Alexandra Haywood, daughter of billionaire Charles Haywood returns to Paradise County, Kentucky distraught over the death of her father. She prepares herself for the firing of one of her father's employed manager at his Whistledown establishment. Joe Welch runs his stable and has dreams of bringing his fine horses to tournaments but they are shattered. His livelihood along with his son Eli and daughter Jenny is threatened and he blames it on Alex.Yet their chemistry cannot be denied and when the killer who claimed her father returns for her, Alex has no choice but to reach for safety in the arms of Joe. When stunning relevations about Joe's long-lost wife are made and Alex's sister Neely together with Eli has disappeared, the danger becomes more treacherous than ever....Karen Robard's contemporary romance is hot and sexy with Joe and Alex but the suspense leaves readers cold. It is contrived and unimaginative with cliches of chasing scene ripped off from a Scream horror movie. The pages can be skipped to the next hot sex outing because it is exactly the author's intention. The mystery is there to provide lame excuses to the passionate scenes and is embarrassingly distasteful. The killer's identity is hastily revealed and the motive is an insult to the intelligence of any mystery readers. It can be summarized in a page - so why have the mystery in the first place? It is made unneccessarily violent with the killer burning dogs and threatening young girls.This book is vile and save for the chemistry between Alex and Joe, it rambles on without any clever plotting and leaves readers disappointed beyond words."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"From the beginning of Chapter 1 I thought I wasn't going to be able to put this book down. By Chapter 3 I was becoming very disappointed. I really love a good suspense, mystery and romance, but somethings need to be left to the imagination. The story line was very good and intriguing, but the crimes were definitely too graphic, to the point of being disturbing. The sexual antics of Joe and Alex were too descriptive, I mean really...a whole chapter describing their love making, please. Even when Eli and Neely are missing, they can't stop from going at it. The ending was very exciting but it all came together a little too fast. I just wanted to hurry up and finish this book. I will probably read more of Karen Robards writings but not if the next one is similar to this."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This book was not what I expected from ms Robards. I have enjoyed her books a great deal in the past. For about ninety percent of this book, no one knows there is a bad guy, or even that people are missing or being murdered. Only the readers know, not the characters, which doesn't make for much suspense throughout the book. The story mostly concentrates on Alex and Joe's relationship, and at the very end the two kids go missing. Everyone thinks that they have just run off. The whole big ending with the bad guy takes about five minutes and is very anticlimactic. I would wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This is one of K.Robard's best books. Alexandra Haywood and Joe Welch have a fiery attraction to spice up this suspense story. Joe personifies tall, dark, sexy and handsome. Fantastic read and the sexual attraction makes you want to keep on reading to see where all of it is heading. Loved the teenagers but especially JOE and ALEX. Don't miss this one.. ."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I was very disappointed in Karen Robards' new book Paradise County. I was hoping that she would revert to the style she used so successfully in Walking after Midnight. I found that book so refreshing, a combination of Romance ,Suspense and Humor. The characters in Paradise County seem drawn together purely through sexual attraction and have very little in common. The book does have some surprising twists, in both plot and character definition. It is not the norm for romance/suspense novels to introduce drug abuse as a sub plot even though Robards just seems to throw that in as an afterthought. Not Karen Robards at her best."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I won't go into a description of the story, please read the editorial review on this book.The author basically used the same formula when writing Paradise County as she used in her previous novel Ghost Moon. With one exception--fewer characters. The main characters included in this story were Alexandra Haywood and her sister, Neely, Joe Welch and his three children and Joe's father, Cary.The editorial review gave this story a sensuality rating of 8 and I have to agree the story was very sexy and mostly read as a romance novel with very good interaction between Joe and Alex and their family members. Of course there is murder to be solved but once again the author chose to include a killer who preys on women and animals.Mostly I enjoyed this book but the chapters on the murderer and his activities I found to be disturbing. I enjoy a murder mystery but I can do without the graphic violence. In solving the crises, the last few chapters were rushed. A longer ending would have been more appreciated."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I found the audio book version of Karen Robards' novel at our town library without knowing a thing about the author. The back jacket promised a mystery about some evil dominating a Kentucky county, and I thought it would be some interesting suspense story surrounding equestrian sports. Oh, if only we'd been that lucky. What I got instead was a long cd narrative of two wooden and repellent creatures committing lustful acts page after page...after page after page. EEEEEEEEUCK!!!!! In fact, the so-called mystery is just a flimsy and seldom mentioned excuse to assault readers who aren't familiar with Robards' work mercilessly with unexpected forays into carnal experiences that nobody I've ever met experiences EVERY time.The two characters are unrealistic and so cardboard I'm surprised they didn't give paper cuts to each other with all that action. Alexandra Haywood comes off like a rich peroxide blond nympho, and Joe Welch? Please, how many times have we seen the cliche' of some \\"hard-working\\" cowboy stealing a rich woman's heart? Oh, yeah, don't forget that they always desecrate some expensive chair by sitting on it backward with their legs straddled and their arms crossed over the back rest. And since when is this guy ever working the ranch? All he does is chase the bimbo around and get mad.We do have a villain running around, referred to as \\"the predator.\\" Basically, he chains a girl up and lights a dog on fire. Other than hearing from him for a total of five minutes throughout the book until the end where he's needed to serve up the dumbest climax since Jessica Simpson on her wedding night, we are constantly assaulted with one intimate foray after another. They don't care about anything but boinking each other's brains out. Really now, they do their nastiest business while his kid Eli and her little sister Neely are chained up in a cave under the house. That's the most hysterical part about Robards' lame book; the characters are so anti-drug, yet it's okay if they irresponsibly set a bad example about you-know-what. In fact, I wanted to vomit when they did it in his dad's house while he was sleeping off a drunk.It got to a point as I forced myself to listen to the story all the way through where I wished the predator would kill them all and Robards would announce that her book was just a farcical joke. No such luck, but the book is still a joke. If she can get garbage like this published, then maybe I shouldn't have thrown away bad stuff I'd written. If nothing else, this book is proof positive that some of us try too hard to write something of quality while this somehow passed some publisher's inspection. Well, shame on them, and shame on me for listening to Vida Visaitis read this like she's a smut goddess. Most of all, shame on Karen Robards for insulting her readers' intelligence. She should be on America's Most Wanted, because novels this awful are a crime."},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"There is no good reason to bring blatant animal abuse (p. 73) into a story sold as mystery/romance.

I love ALL of Karen Robards books. In her stories, there is a really good balance between the romance and the action...she doesn't go \\"overboard\\" on one and not the other. In this book I love Joe...he seems sexy without even trying. Alex is strong, but she isn't afraid to show her weak side to Joe. Neely is the comic relief of the book...outrageous and funny. And they way she portrays the \\"villan\\"...wow! Pure evil. What he does to his victims would give you nightmares. Out of all her books, he gets my vote as the most horrifying villan. On a lighter note, I loved the part of the book when they go on the hayride to the pep rally and then at the pep rally...so sweet! I give this book 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! Totally enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"I loved this book. Though different, it reminded me of Ghost Moon (which was the first Karen Robards book I ever read and loved so). I totally fell in love with Joe Welch - oh gosh, Joe where are you? Wish I knew a Joe Welch! Loved the way he treated his kids, loved the way he loved Alex. I wish.... Well anyway, I thought it was a great read.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I decided I am giving too many books 5 stars. So I would say this is a 4.5 star.

As she closes one business after another, she arrives at his Kentucky horse breeding estate to close up shop, but finds herself up against the ranch foreman Joe Welch, who has plans to turn the stock into champion race horses. As the two go toe to toe about the closure, an attraction develops between the two. When Alex decides to do a little digging about her father's death, she suddenly finds herself in the crosshairs of a sadistic killer. Will she and Joe ever see eye to eye about the farm or will she become the predator's next victim?Robards uses her trademark sizzle to create a charismatic couple (and a pretty steamy read). The mystery takes a backseat to the romantic tension, and the killer may chill a reader or two, though little time is spent developing this predator. As a mystery, it is a little lacking, but makes for a good steamy read!"},{"Title":"Paradise County","review":"This book was about a wealthy ranch owner who suddenly dies. Due to unfortunate financial situations his eldest daughter is forced to fire her father's various employees. When she brings the bad news to the farm manager, the reader instantly sees where this is all going to lead.The romance aspect of this novel was steamy. You wanted these two together, they were good for one another and you couldn't help but be excited when they were in the same room. The thriller aspect of the story was completely out of place. Every once and awhile when one of those chapters appeared I felt as though I had begun a different novel entirely. I wanted to skip ahead and get back to Alex & Joe.Overall this was an okay read.

She masterfully writes about my two favorite subjects - the history of British-occupied India, and good, romantic stories about mysterious men. Thank you for another enthralling tale. My only complaint is that there wasn't quite enough about the relationship of Damien and Emma and maybe too much about the political intrigue. What I loved best about &quot;Olivia and Jai&quot; is that the love story was the main focus with the history as a backdrop. Still, I will look forward to ANYTHING Ryman cares to do in the future."},{"Title":"Shalimar","review":"It is not often a reader comes across so skilful and gripping a combination of romance and espionage. What makes Ryman's new book as &quot;unputdownable&quot; a read as the unforgettable &quot;Olivia and Jai&quot; (set in Calcutta) is the fluidity with which the several narrative strains entwine and then separate for the thrilling finale. As with her other books, the structure here too is amazingly complex yet never too complicated for quick understanding. Her graphic descriptions of the Kashmir valley and Central Asia in the 19th century bring these little known regions to instant life and her characters are vibrant, alive and very real. Set against the high adventure of the &quot;Big Game&quot; being played by Britain, Russia and China in the last century, the novel astounds by its topicality today when Kashmir is still Asia's most volatile flashpoint. As a male reader not especially enamoured of romance, I have to say the romantic skein in this one melded beautifully with the strong meat of espionage and intrigue. Ryman's research into the last decade of the last century and the machinations of the Raj is prodigious and impeccable. A friend brought me this book from America which I have enjoyed thoroughly. I recommend it highly to those who appreciate graphic prose, intelligent writing and clever plotting. I hope that it is published soon in this country."},{"Title":"Shalimar","review":"How refreshing to find a historical romance the way such books used to be, before they became sex fantasies in period costume! Reminiscent of THE FAR PAVILLIONS in both setting and scope, SHALIMAR builds to a startling conclusion that will take your breath away! I'm going back to the library to look up Rebecca Ryman's other books, OLIVIA AND JAI and THE VEIL OF ILLUSION."},{"Title":"Shalimar","review":"Since the story is a mixture of espionage and romance, a lot of names are revealed. I had to reread the passages in order to keep track of them. So this is not something you'd want to read in bed. Damien and Emma are the faint reminiscences of what Ryman's other characters have been. However, the dialogues are too played out, and the exposition is a bit shaky. I still don't get the love-hate relationship between them. But overall, Ryman's curry-like description will work like magic."},{"Title":"Shalimar","review":"I enjoyed this book, but found it a bit slow at times while the various plot threads were being separately spun. I could have done without all the &quot;chit-chat&quot; in Simla with the govt folks ... didn't feel it contributed much to the overall plot. Would definitely read more by this author."},{"Title":"Shalimar","review":"Rebecca Ryman is a great example of why the world needs... Her superbbooks are just not known here in Australia, so the only way to seekthem out and obtain them is through this site. In Shalimar Ryman'scraft has matured - the plotting and development are superbly handledand as usual her authenticity is unrivalled. While the relationshipbetween Damien and Emma give the plot its agonizing sexual tension,the espionage story is what lifts it above being just another lovestory. Like all great historical novels, it subtly educates you abouta corner of history you know little about, while also spinning anold-fashioned ripping yarn with spies, explorers, bandits, and deepdark secrets. It's a pity that Ryman's previous books are all out ofprint - those discovering her anew are sure to want to read herearlier work. When is she coming out in paperback?"},{"Title":"Shalimar","review":"I finished this book and immediately started the search for everything else Ms Ryman wrote. This is a wonderfull book, a perfectly told story. The main plot is the search for a legendary secret pass, but anybody who wants to read a good love story will love Damien and Emma's story. I adored the characters, Ms Ryman's style and wit, and while the book lasted I was in 1890 Central Asia - although this might give a uncontrollable urge to pack up and go to Kashmir, or Samarkand or Simla."},{"Title":"Shalimar","review":"Shalimar begins in 1890 shortly after the death of Emma Wyncliffe's father, who was found frozen on a glacier high in the Himalayas during an archeological expedition that went tragically awry. The Wyncliffe's are left with little funds and Emma's brother David in the throes of gambling bets and loses the family home to the mysterious Damien Granville. For reasons of his own, Damien offers to void the gambling debt if Emma will marry him and live at Shalimar, his estate in the Vale of Kashmir.As Emma tries to reconcile herself to a loveless marriage, mystery and intrigue take center stage as many players unfold in an international chase between Great Britain, Russia and China as they play the Great Game to unlock the secret to the long hidden Yasmina Pass, as whoever holds access to the pass holds the key to control of the unclaimed regions that sit in the center of the borders of India, Russia and China. Emma unknowingly holds the key to it all (or does she?), and who is the mysterious Armenian slave Ivana that all players in the game are desperate to find at all costs?No one (except Emma of course) is who or what they appear to be on the surface and the author keeps the reader guessing with plentiful twists, turns and big surprises all the way until the very last pages. This was a top notch novel of mystery and intrigue and I found it very difficult to put down, especially the last 100 or so pages. The author's knowledge of India and its culture shines through, and I especially loved the gorgeous glimpses of the Himalayas and Kashmir Valley. Just a warning, if you're expecting a love story on a scale of Ryman's fabulousOlivia and Jaiyou will probably be very disappointed. However, if you want a novel filled with abundant history, mystery, treachery and intrigue that keeps you on your seat until the end I'd say go for it if you can find a copy used at a reasonable price. 4.5 stars rounded up to five, not perfect but pretty darned good."},{"Title":"Shalimar","review":"I miss Jai Raventhorne, Amos and Alistair.

He says, 'I happen to be lucky enough to have known a great man who happened to be a writer, and I feel I must make you share with me the precious moments that gave me this knowledge.'''These words of Jerome Weidman, printed on the back of the book's dust jacket, are probably the best review of Remembering Mr. Maugham that is possible to be written. Yet, I would try my best as well.The American writer, playwright, director, librettist and God knows what else, Garson Kanin, knew Somerset Maugham for more than 20 years, from the early 1940s until his death in 1965. His wife, the actress/playwright Ruth Gordon, knew the great writer as early as 1928. The couple was often guest at Maugham's Villa Mauresque on the French Riviera and whenever he was in London or in the United States they frequently met and had dinner and absorbing conversations together. Most of these occasions were described by Garson Kanin immediately afterwards, including long conversations that he found he could reproduce very accurately right after they were finished. This is what this book consists of: numerous sketches arranged in no special order telling about the great many meetings the Kanins had with Somerset Maugham, including few conversations with other people about Maugham. The style of Mr Kanin is engaging and charming, the book is hugely readable and highly entertaining, not in the least because of his many notes in italics that add a new dimension of events that even then, in 1966, were already decade or two old.But what makes this book really great, and I don't hesitate to describe it as such, is that it deals solely with a great man and a great writer giving tons of precious insights into his unique personality that you can hardly find elsewhere. Moreover, it is written not only by a talented writer but also by a man who obviously had deep affection for Maugham. Among the hundreds of anecdotes and verbatim reports, there is something about more or less everything concerning Maugham: his stammering, his works, working methods and working discipline, his opinions about writing, other writers and the theater, even something about his most painful personal matters (his marriage and the relationship with his wife, and later with his daughter, as well as his only proposal of marriage and how it was turned down); his passions for bridge and travel are also here and so are his many peculiarities of speech and behaviour. Mr Kanin has reproduced as faithfully as he could Maugham's way of talking, with its pauses here and there to prevent him from stammering a difficult words (or to add a certain dramatic strength perhaps?) and with his brilliant and witty remarks. Garson Kanin has done an inestimable favour to all admirers of Somerset Maugham; his book is absolutely indispensable for everybody who is interested in Maugham's life and especially in his personality. It is a perfect complement to Maugham's most personal writings about himself adding a whole dimension to his personality.The variety of incidents and people on these pages is so immense that even a short overview would become a tedious business to be read (and to be written, for that matter). I think what impresses me most is that Garson Kanin frankly expresses his opinion about everything connected with Maugham, including such touchy topics like his scandalous memoirs Looking Back (1962) or Edmund Wilson's notorious attacks or Maugham's harsh critical judgment of Henry James, to name but a few; but he always remains tolerant and always tries to understand, he never condemns even if he sometimes disagrees completely with Maugham and, albeit being almost 40 years younger, dared argue with him. Kanin actually once even met Edmund Wilson and his opinion that the famous critic didn't seem to know much of Maugham's work and might well have feared a competition with him (since Maugham's popularity as essayist about literature was growing at the time) are very perceptive points indeed. Garson Kanin even has the audacity to say that the notorious Looking Back is a damned well written piece of writing and to ask himself who he is to condemn its author; but when he says that Maugham's aim was to hurt I think he is very much mistaken. On the whole, however, Garson Kanin's attitude to Maugham is one of warm feelings, great respect and indefatigable industry to understand, rather than to condemn, even the most contradictory and incongruous sides of Maugham's extremely complicated and fascinating personality. This is in stark contrast with the short and rather prejudiced foreword by Noel Coward who is obviously incapable of feeling anything for Maugham but ill-hidden contempt; I guess it is only too natural for the mediocre to despise the great.Perhaps the most telling sketch in the whole book is the one in which Mr Kanin narrates of an incident in a restaurant: he ordered several wines and, not knowledgeable himself, asked Maugham who pronounce them not good; later Mr Kanin heard exactly the opposite story circulating everywhere, certainly spread by Maugham himself. He rightly says that this was unkind and ungracious from Maugham's side. But then he asks himself why he is not angered by it, why he is not vexed as he should normally be. Mr Kanin's answer and explanation are certainly worth reading the whole book: because, he says, Mr Maugham is a storyteller. Precisely. The facts are only his raw material to be arranged for the purposes of fiction, he wouldn't have been a creative writer if he had related the mere facts unchanged; when he says that in his work fact and fiction are so intermingled that he can hardly recognize one of the other he certainly does not talk through his hat. If only the real persons Maugham modeled his characters upon had the same common sense. Alas, that was far too much for them; and so was for most of his critics.I do not believe there is a real Maugham admirer who, having read Remembering Mr. Maugham, will not be deeply grateful to Garson Kanin for having written it."},{"Title":"110 Best Job Search Sites on the Internet","review":"The Internet Job Search Site is repository of literally hundreds of thousands of job openings around the world.

Oftentimes, we hear about the great triumphs of the space program, but unless it is a great disaster, the problems encountered in spaceflight are often overlooked. This book covers all aspects of spaceflight (training, flight, EVA, etc.) from the early pioneering days right up to the present. The book includes a great deal on the Soviet space program that I have not seen before.The book opens with the daring adventures of the early manned ballooning experiments and the goal of the setting a record altitude. I was quite impressed with what was accomplished in the 1920's and 1930's. The book then proceeds to the various experimental X-planes and the problems encountered with these projects.After this brief, but very informative introduction, the book examines the era of manned spaceflight. The book is divided into four main areas: training, launch, space travel, and re-entry. Each of the main areas examines all the major and minor problems encountered with these aspects of spaceflight. As one would expect, the book covers the major spaceflight disasters, like Apollo 1, the Challenger explosion, Apollo 13, but it also includes even the smallest problems like the lunar explorers falling down or urine leaks in the shuttle EVA suits. It was interesting to see that the have been many more problems, though minor ones, in manned spaceflight than has been reported in the press.The book contains numerous rarely seen photographs and drawings.

I use it very heavily, especially if I am still in the pre-coffee period of the day.The book is arranged in grammatical structures, with a page to each. The structures range from past simple to causatives and modals. The book would suitable from about Pre-Intermediate to Upper-Intermediate, but could be used conceivably beyond that.The activities require no photocopying, which is the real bonus. They use the whiteboard as the visual aspect, so if you go that way, you need to be a little bit artistic. Sadly, my stick figures are fairly pathetic, so I rarely do the pictures. There are pictures drawn in the book, so anyone could do it, I guess.Basically, this is one simple and awesome book to use.

After years of being hounded by high school friends to take up golf, two years ago I finally did at the age of 58. I took two group lessons and went to range 3 to 4 times a week. A friend gave me this book shortly thereafter. I read chapter after chapter, idea after idea.The book covers 48 chapters of 48 different golf instructional books. The general categories' are: Swing Theory, Power, Short Game and Putting, Strategy and the Mental Game. So each chapter is written by a different author but each is preceded by a short biography of that author. The benefit of this format is you get a good feel of 48 different authors, their ideas and their writing style without having to purchase their books.The two benefits of the book: As I read other golf books, such as The Greatest Game Ever Played by Mark Frost and Harvey Penick's Little Red Book (Both GREAT books)I would come across some of the old great names of golf, and they would be in this book. A great cross reference.But the real benefit is my driver swing is directly from Joe Dante's \\"The Four Magic Moves to Winning Golf\\" and my iron swing is directly from Mindy Blake. I know, two different swings is different, but it is working for me, and I am close to bogey golf. I still get the occasionally 7 or 8 due to weak wedge play but I am working on that over the winter, inside, being from MN.I cannot believe how often I pull this book out to either review something or look up to see if it is in there. BTW I have also purchased Tommy Armour's 2 books, he writes short, witty, and explains actionable tips, he was also a smartass which you have to love, and Gallway's Inner Game of Golf.

This does NOT make the novel about Marie Antoinette. I echo an earlier reviewer, it's a travesty. How on earth did this get published?I recommend Chantal Thomas's \\"Farewell, My Queen\\" and am looking avidly forward to the publication of Sena Jeter Naslund's \\"Abundance\\".

After coming across this novel, I have lost respect for Carrolly Erickson and will never take any of her work seriously again. Yes, I know that this is considered romantic women's fiction, but why do lies have to be more interesting and romantic than actual events? For novels that are well-written but closer to reality, I would recommend Victoria Holt's 'The Queen's Confession,' Vidal's 'Trianon,' or Thomas' 'Farewell My Queen.'

In addition to the excellent Sophia Coppola film there is Sena Naslund's excellent new novel on Marie entitled \\"Abundance.\\"The Carolly Erickson book is a fictional epistolatory novel in which Marie records her innermost thoughts from age 17 to her execution in 1793a few months after her royal spouse the deposed Louis XVI was also executed in Paris.This novel is the second by Erickson dealing with Marie Antoinette. Her first and better effort is entitled \\"To the Scaffold\\" and is more historically accurate than this effort. In \\"The Secret Diary of Marie Antoinette\\" Dr. Erickson invents characters; has Marie visiting the Swedish homeland of her love Count Axel Ferson and inventing dialogue and situations which though plausible are not based on fact. As one who has read many books on Marie I would have to recommend Lady Antonia Fraser's \\"Marie Antoinette\\" as the best one you can buy.I was often bored while reading this book. Marie was a hedonist who was wed to a sexually akward and dull husband. She did have courage and loved her children. In the last days before her death she exhibited strength andChristian faith.Erickson is a good historical novelist but this is one of her more mediocre efforts."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"This is a definite page turner.

I read this book yesterday in an entire day. I loved it! It transported me back to a time and place. I do not typically like period pieces and this made me want to read more. I understand it is not NON-FICTION but what I love about her book is it makes you want to learn more about the real Marie Antoinette. I loved the characters - although sometimes I wanted Louis to finally get the courage to stand up and take charge - I loved that they worked together...!

Spoiler!\\" I screamed at my husband, \\"I can't believe they gave away the ending!\\"I wish I was joking.So it's with a little shame and much trepidation that I say that Carolly Erickson made me understand history a little. After reading this book I realized that history is really just a big ol' diary kept by us as a group.The book was wonderful, engaging and fun, after I finished reading it I read some more traditional sources and found it wasn't 100% factual. I don't care. It's historical fiction, written well and for my enjoyment.I enjoyed. I learned.And I coulda' been surprised by the ending... nothing to brag about."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"Yet another fictionalized version of the life and times of one of France's most famous Queens. I am addicted to historical fiction such as this, and the detailing of her personal trials was very appealing to me. Also, diary format novels tend to be easier to read, although they usually lack depth. Erickson's vision of Marie is sympathetic, yet alludes to her naive personality traits - this is done very well, giving her very human-like qualities and a conscience, while at the same time addressing her self-righteous faults. The dialogue is well written (something I have trouble with myself) and the entire book is a good example of showing mounting despair and the culmination of events, as well as time progression. That said, the dates were strangely off (not historically, but mathematically ... for example, she said that something happened two years before, but according to the dates in the book, it was less than a year) and the entries about Marie being in love are tedious and trite. The author skipped over important events. If they are even covered, they lack detail and description. In fact, the entire tome uses repetitious images and doesn't have much visual imagery. Of course, the journal entries could just be a personificaition of the author's purpose - that is, to show a vapid, almost shallow girl mature into a woman of strength and pride - by using ideas over and over to show childishness. In the end, though, this was most definitely a page turner: gripping, sometimes shocking (see page 316), and emotionally filling. The pages of the brutality of the French Revolution were particularly eye opening for me. I found myself wanting more, Erickson's portrayal of Marie being both fascinating and quite beautiful in its own simplistic way."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"She's remembered as the spoiled French queen who ignored her subjects, saying, \\"Let them eat cake\\" when told they had no bread. But this fictional narrative offers a far more sympathetic picture of Marie Antoinette.From her privileged childhood in Austria and marriage to quirky Louis XVI to her affair with a Swedish diplomat and eventual beheading, we see both the extravagance of 18th century Versailles and the reign of terror that was the French Revolution. Although missing any mention of the Affair of the Necklace, which is disappointing, this is still a captivating read."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"This book is written in the form of a diary--which if it is not done correctly, can be extremely boring. This is simply not the case with this book!! It was riveting throughout. I read the book in only 2 days and could not put it down. The book follows the life of Marie from her teen years until her death, written as she might have felt. The well-developed characters and fast plot made it a read for well into the night...I do not normally read this type of literature, but was in a bookstore and the cover caught my eye. I started reading it and I was immediately hooked. This book held my interest and complete attention from the first page to the last. In fact, I found myself re-reading parts of it that I thought were written extremely well.I don't think many of the people who have written reviews have given this book enough credit where it is due. Erickson was not writing a history book to be taken literally, though much of this book really had historical value. I felt that the image painted of Marie Antoinette was very well done. While some people have criticized the book because it softens the image of Marie, I actually enjoyed the alternate perspective. Erickson has often been adament in her non-fiction that Marie had only one extra-marital lover, which this book portrays. The book is, in fact, written as a diary and therefore through the imaginary eyes of Marie Antoinette. It is simply how she might have viewed/felt about aspects during her lifetime.The book was very well written, and did contain romantic sentiment--but I did not find it over-bearing or tacky. In fact, it only added to an extremely dramatic plot. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time and I am glad that I took a chance at reading it. I recommend this book whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I am sorry I didn't choose a biography now. I wanted to know more about MA but instead I am further confused. But it is a novel so I had to read it as a story based on a life. I'm not sure what the reading level is, but I would guess young adults."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I read this book in one day since I wanted to see the Marie Antoinette movie its opening night and had waited the last minute to do so. It was not difficult to get through it in so little time since it's diary-format helped move the story along and it held a good mixture of meaningless information about Antoinette and the incredibly devastating events that took place in her life. While I read it I had to keep reminding myself that this woman really existed since the author did so well in emphasizing the odd etiquette and practices of that time and the turmoil that each character experienced. It seemed almost unfathomable that so much of the story really occurred but I did have to keep in mind that some of it was indeed imagined by the author and not historically accurate. I would say that the only reason it may have lacked some excitement was that the author stuck with the main plot of marie antoinette's life and therefore didn't stray into any extrememly fictionalized material which isn't the author's fault. This is definitely worth reading, especially if you haven't yet watched the movie because I found it helped me follow the story better."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"It is interesting to note that the author (Carolly Erickson) has written several biographies over the years. When she attempted \\"historical entertainment,\\" though, I feel that she lost something. She admits she invented several characters and situations in this book, and that was disappointing. I think she could have stuck closer to the \\"truth\\" when telling this fascinating woman's story without so much fluff and shock value. In the interview in the back of the book, Erickson admits that she likes writing these kind of books because it's easier and she doesn't have to work as hard. In my opinion, her lack of effort is reflected in this book. To do historical fiction right, I think, you almost have to work HARDER to take facts, fill in gaps, and make a story that is interesting, engaging, and believable. Unfortunately, Erickson didn't do that. This book is not bad, and it is enjoyable at parts, but I am sure there are many books available that tell this story better. Keep looking."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I am an avid reader of historical fiction and this is most definitely one of my favorites!

I don't know how accurate it is as far as history goes. It may be helpful that you read the Note to the Reader in the back before you read the book. The author explains that this is nothing but fiction and she wasn't trying to make it historically accurate. So it's best not to go into it thinking you're going to learn about the French Revolution or Antoinette's exact life.Nonetheless, I couldn't put this book down. I know this book is fiction, but it never occured to me that when Antoinette and Louis were arrested they were treated horribly, very undignified by those who hated them the most. It left me wanting to know even more about this young queen and her life, what happened to France that caused the Revolution (or The Terror). Lucky us, Erickson has written a non-fiction biography called To the Scaffold, which I've ordered and can't wait to read.This book may not satisfy those who are used to reading historical fiction/romance, but I really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"How can anyone write a historical novel involving Marie Antoinette and completely avoid even mentioning the Affair of the Necklace, which was one of the straws that broke the French monarchy's back. There is a slight hint to it when Madame DuBarry demands diamonds to rival Marie Antoinette's Habsburg Sun diamond but that is about it.As for Marie Antoinette's trip to Sweden with Axel von Fersen, it never happened."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and, though a history buff, I can ignore historical inaccuracies for the sake of a good story. However, this was, quite possibly, THE WORST story I have ever read.The plot is simplistic and trite, the characters are all unsympathetic and I was quite glad that Erickson's incredibly evil National Assembly condemned them all to death. She ignored the complexities of the people and the time period and instead chose to invent characters and events that were incredibly inane and were much more boring than what actually happened.The author very obviously did not bother to do much research and her account of the French Revolution reads like royalist propaganda. Robespierre, who historically was a soft-spoken idealist called \\"the Incorruptible\\" shows up as The Source of All Evil, whom we are supposed to hate because he has pockmarks (he didn't) and he blames Marie for quite rightly conspiring with Austria. Marie herself is horribly unsympathetic and I wanted to hit her over the head with a shovel. She is stupid, vapid, irritating, and selfish. It is remarkably easy to make Marie Antoinette sympathetic. Who wouldn't feel sorry for a 14-year-old princess taken away from everything she holds dear to the very bewildering court of Versailles? However, by zeroing in on the flippant, frivolous twit who ramped up the national debt because she just *had* to have a new diamond necklace, Erickson made Marie Antoinette one-dimensional and thoroughly boring when she wasn't thoroughly irritating.Erickson offers no motivations for any of her characters' actions, offers an incredibly vacuous view of a highly complicated time and completely ignores historical people and events for invented, trite, boring, and incredibly stupid characters and actions that she made up entirely.This was a terrible, terrible book, and I hope Carolly Erickson will learn to a. research before attempting an historical novel, and b. learn that people have motivations for actions and are seldom one-dimensional.I wish I could have a refund, and/or rate this zero stars. It was really that bad."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I am a huge sympathizer of Marie Antoinette and I love to pick up as many books as I can find of her. I was hugely disappointed with this one, especially since I have read Carolly Erickson in the past and have been satisfied with her work. However, this was the first of her fictional books that I have read, since the previous ones were non-fiction/biographies (\\"Alexandra\\", \\"Great Catherine\\", \\"The First Elizabeth\\" and \\"Josephine\\").The author, though she has written a biography of Marie Antoinette, got a lot of facts wrong in this work of fiction about the famous queen. For starters, Marie Antoinette went on a journey to Sweden for a few months, and spent much of her time there with her lover Count Fersen. Well, considering that Marie Antoinette never even saw the ocean, how could she have gone on a journey to Sweden. I just don't like my fictional books about real people to have that much exaggeration in it. I nearly tossed the book aside because of that little addition. Also, I did not like how some of the most important people in her life, like the Princess de Lamballe and Duchesse de Polignac were hardly in the story.Also certain events that shook the queen's life were non-existent, like the affair of the necklace, which probably forever ruined the queen's reputation in the eyes of the people, and her one time comment to the mistress of Louis XV, Madame du Barry, which had caused a lot of stir at court (at the time anyway).All in all, with too much fiction clouding out the life of a real queen (for her life was as splendid and tragic as most, and did not need anything at all added to it or made up) I could only give it a 3 star rating. I'm wary of picking up any more of Erickson's fictional books. NOTE: If you want to read a good book about Marie Antoinette, read \\"Abundance\\" by Sena Jester Naslund, which is a fictinal work and true to fact. Then there is \\"Marie Antoinette: The Journey\\" by Antonia Fraser, one of the greatest biographies I've ever read. Both books have gotten a five star rating from me and come very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"My doctor, who listens to audio books every day, recommended this book to me.

An airplane read, perhaps?"},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"The author could have added so many details that were factual and actual events and, yet, were so compelling and riveting. This book lacked substance and depth. You don't really experience the life or the personal conflicts that played out in the French court. It was also too sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and highly unbelievable. There were also so many missing pieces that could have explained more clearly what led up to the revolution. I know this is a work of fiction but the true historical events and figures that took place were much more interesting than all the fictional events and characters the author created."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I read through some of the reviews here before I began reading this book and was, frankly, quite hesitant. As far as some of the simplistic language, I think the author was trying to catch the true essence of Marie Antoinette. She was not a highly educated girl and so wouldn't be writing long, labrious sentences. She also was a very sheltered and naive girl, even selfish. However, we have to remember the times and the possibility that if any other queen had been on the throne, they would have probably lost their head as well.I have 2 main objections to this book: 1) I really would have rather had a more historical fictionalized version of this book as opposed to a full diary account and 2) Amelie. She is the most crude, horrible, inhumane person I have ever encountered in literature (OK, a little drastic). I would have loved for someone to have shot her or stabbed her before Marie was dragged back to her cell."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I picked up The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette because I had looked forward to reading a fictional account of one of the most interesting historical figures I have ever read about. I have an enormous historical encyclopedia and I have learned a great deal about various European royals that vary from Medieval to Renaissance periods. I don't expect historical fiction to be faithful to the actual events and facts, for it is fiction after all, but I do expect some accuracy and relevancy. Carolly Erickson has created an almost different account on Archduchess Maria Antonia in a way that for a second I thought this was a novel about a made-up person. Why use the name of a historical figure if you're not going to be true to the character or its events? Anyway, this novel is written in diary form that begins in June 1769 and goes on an account of sorts about her life, from her affair with Axel Fersen to her marriage to the French Louis XVI. Amid all of this is a big compilation of fictional conflicts and made up characters that, while some were compelling, they took precedence over actual events, some of which were not even mentioned.What events were those that weren't mentioned? Erickson overlooked the entire Diamond Necklace Affair scandal during the 1780s. That was one of the biggest scandals during that time period and it was one of the things I had wanted to read about here because I wanted to see how the author would incorporate that into the fictional account of the story. Imagine my disappointment when I saw that it was never mentioned in this novel. I read these books because I have taken a major interest in history and because I love fiction and, well, I love to incorporate the two. And what I thought was a meaty, juicy book with one of the most interesting historical queens turned out to be something frivolous. But not all of it is bad. The backdrop of the French Revolution is quite good. The events that lead to Marie Antoinette being beheaded are actually very insightful as well. And I do like some of the conflict centered on Antoinette and Louis XVI of France. Her loneliness leads to the somewhat extravagant and frivolous lifestyle of parties and other social gatherings. The author does paint a more sympathetic picture of the queen by departing from the whole let-them-eat-cake thing and portrays a woman with virtues as well as flaws. And for those things I give this novel three stars. The novel isn't terrible by a long shot, and I enjoyed reading it despite the things I mentioned above. But I definitely would have liked more insights and accuracy in terms of her life and not so much focus on the made up stuff. The author should have balanced those two aspects. I do recommend The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette if you're in the bargain for some historical fiction that is more entertaining than educational."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"After reading about this book in the NY Times Book Review, I gave it a try. Like the reviewer, I was totally absorbed after the first few pages. Even though you know how it ends, it (the end) is still painful and unforgettable. I don't know what the historians would think of it, but I totally enjoyed this and I thought about it long after I finished the book.

My concern is that people came away from this book believing that they had learned some historical facts they didn't know before. This is a falsehood. The \\"poetic license\\" that Ms. Erickson takes with the truth is very disturbing. Marie Antoinette never traveled to Sweden to be with her lover??!! It worries me greatly that people will take as absolute fact the inaccuracies that are rampant in this novel."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I just finished The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette and I really enjoyed it while I was reading it. I have to admit that I am pretty ignorant about lots and lots of world history and when I was younger I didn't enjoy History class much, if at all. But this novel presents history in a very accessible way. It wasn't overwhelming with details...in a good way. And it left me wanting to read more about Marie Antoinette.I would have given the novel four stars if the journal style of it had been true to form but the dialog was written in the third person narrative. Which I enjoyed reading but it's certainly not how a diary would be written.I think this would be a wonderful novel for students learning about the French Revolution and for people like me who have never read anything about Marie Antoinette. It's a great starting point."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I was intrigued at first and enjoyed the parts about Antonia's girlhood and her preparing to marry, while still very young, a man she'd never met. But, it kind of went downhill from there. I found her character to be very shallow - she claimed to feel compassion for the poor, but didn't see anything wrong with only wearing a pair of calfskin gloves once and then throwing them away. I do not know if this is the way she actually was or just the way Erickson made her out to be - her \\"compassion\\" did not seem genuine, if that was Erickson's intension. And I just didn't buy any of the love stories which may or may not have actually happened. The whole love at first sight thing between the queen and Axel seemed extremely contrived and convenient. If you're going to invent a romance between two characters, at least put some effort into it. And... you knew what was going to happen at the end, so it was kind of a chore getting through the final half of it..."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"It is in our nature, as human beings, to feel intrigued and interested by other peoples tragic stories. I believe this is why so many of us can't help but be interested in historical figures such as Marie Antoinette, or Anne Boleyn.One thing that is important to remember is that this is, in fact, historical *fiction*. Some people complain too much about historical fiction books and novels not being accurate enough. I feel that if you want nothing but historic facts, then you should be reading a non-fiction autobiography. If you want to be entertained by a story in addition to historical aspects (real or imagined), then fiction is the way to go, and this book was certainly entertaining to me.With historical fiction, it is up to the author to use the information available to them, and then tweak it to weave an interesting new story out of it. In this respect, I think Carolly Erickson did that wonderfully. Her attention to detail is incredible, and I think she was truly able to capture a different side of Marie Antoinette than may not have previously been presented in other works of both fiction and non-fiction.This novel follows the life of Marie Antoinette from the day she was told she would be moving to France to become the dauphine (and someday, the Queen), to the day she laid her head on the chopping block.One of the things that helps make this book unique is the way it is written in the form of a diary. While an author may be able to include more detail of some events when *not* using a diary-esque form of writing, I feel that by telling the story through a diary gave the story a more personal feeling.I enjoyed this book, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I don't know much about Marie Antoinette, but I have always been intrigued by her. When I saw this book I decided it could be a good intro to her story.

I for one really enjoyed the parts of the book where her fashions, hairstyles, and lavish homes were discussed- I'd like to find a book that delves further into that.

The intrigues of Versailles, the horror of the era, and the well-known indecisiveness of Louis XVI all came through. Marie is often villified, and even though this is a fictional account of her life at court, the author, I feel, has given her a voice from the grave that accurately reflects her true character. She was indeed misunderstood, and readers will walk away with a sense that she was a victim of her birthright."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"As an avid reader of historical fiction, I think this is one of the truly remarkable examples of this genre at its finest.The author's vast knowledge of the time period and its players is evident, as is her supurb writing style. Writing this story from the point of view of Marie Antionette via her hidden diary allows us to consider a different perspective of the famous Queen from that which is typically portrayed.Its a thoroughly engrossing read- you won't be able to put it down. Since its written as a diary, you're given access to all her secrets and desires which makes it fun, although there is a lot of historical significance to the events surrounding her life, marriage and the time period in which its written.I truly hope this is but her first foray into the historical fiction genre - would love to read more by this wonderful author!If you like Phillippa Gregory, Debbie Taylor, Posie Graeme-Evans, Rosalind Miles, Linda Holeman a/o historical fiction in general, you'll surely love this!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"\\"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette: A Novel\\" was a very interesting historical fiction novel. The diary aspect is of it is a tad pointless, I found, because of the lengthy dialogue entries. I've yet to read a diary like that, and because of it, I, at times, forgot that this was indeed supposed to be a diary. I would have liked author Carolly Erickson to include historical information at the end of the book, or a lineage page, to better detail the lives of the figures in this book. Yes, most people know about Marie Antoinette, but some don't, and facts would have been helpful. We all must remember that this is a work of fiction, and that dramatic licenses were taken to make this story all the more captivating. If you're graduating up from the \\"Dear America\\" and \\"The Royal Diaries\\" series, this may be a good next book choice for you. I recommend."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"Non-fiction author Carolly Erickson jumps into the fiction market with The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette, a novel about the infamous queen who famously told the French populace to \\"eat cake\\" told her in own voice.At a young age Marie Antoinette, or, at the time, Antonia, was sent away from her mother Maria-Therease's Hapsburg court in Austria to marry the French Dauphin, Louis, as part of a treaty between the two countries. Antonia (now dubbed Marie Antoinette) is forcefully transformed into a Frenchwoman, weds Louis and takes her place at court. Though Marie has trouble with French politics and her husband, nothing can prepare her for the horrors of the Revolution. The only solace she can find lies in the pages of her secret diary.Though it has its flaws, Erickson's first fiction offering is a quick, easy read that paints a thorough picture of Marie Antoinette and Louis filled with emotion and a sense of the unexpected. Rather than portraying the ill-fated queen as a lavish spender, deviant or bohemian, Erickson instead paints the queen as woman who loves her family and her country and simply tries to do what's best for them. Though Erickson's Marie Antoinette does deal somewhat with the above issues, it's not explored nearly as much as in other works of fiction (or even non-fiction) on the French queen. I, honestly, was a little surprised and slightly disappointed by this. Even though I could tell that Erickson was trying to show Marie Antoinette as a more human character, I was craving something juicier and more interesting.There is also a lack of detail about the period, which bugged me just a little. Though I'm guessing this comes from Erickson's history as a non-fiction writer, she has a little more to learn about setting the scene and giving enough description for the reader to see what's going on. Erickson's pacing is also a little off, especially near the end where it feels like Marie Antoinette's imprisonment seems to drag on forever.Though a first good effort, not the best, but I can definitely see Erickson going places in future novels."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"Marie Antoinette has been my favorite figure in history for many years.

It is really good and it does have something to it, though I can't say what it is. However, in most cases of the book, Marie is seen as a trashy slut. She sleeps with Eric, her stable boy and seduces him, and deas with Axel, a Swedish aristocratic, and admits how much she loves him and sleeps with him, holds his hand, kisses him. She shames the French court and behind her husband's back. Poor Louis is suffering due to his unitelligence in ruling the kingdom, his children are sick, his daughter is the only living heiress to the kingdom to the chagrin of the country of France and his wife is whoring around and he knows it not. Plus, I love Amelie, who tells the Queen the bitter truth; she's not afraid to be bluntly honest even to royalty and those higher."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"This book is written in the format of a diary (hence the title). Marie Antoinette tells us her story as it happens. Now since this IS historical fiction there are characters that are made up (such as Eric, Amelie and Sophie) to make the story run smoothly. I thought that Erickson did a good job at that. The characters she added just enhanced the\\"true\\" story.Marie Antoinette is married to Louis XVI when she is only 14 years old. It was a very well know fact that the marriage was not consummated for nearly seven years. The result of this is that the citizens starting printing pamphlets that were centered on the queen finding sexual relief in others (men and women). To make herself feel better, Marie engrosses herself in fashion, buying the newest dresses, shoes and gloves. Louis is historically noted for being weak and cowardly and in Erickson's book she really shows how Marie Antoinette has to treat him as a child and not a husband.During this time, France's debt is steadily increasing. Their debt from the Seven Years' War still hadn't been paid and now they were embroiled in Great Britain's war in the North American colonies. Erickson describes the life of the normal citizen and it isn't pretty. There are fights over bread and people living in filth. Yet Marie Antoinette continues to redecorate and buy dresses which further infuriates the people (wouldn't you be upset?)As we know, Marie Antoinette's marriage is eventually consummated and children are born. She continues her affair with Count Axel von Fersen during the entire marriage which fueled the rumors of illegitimacy of the children. Erickson's character Amelie (the bitter wife of a childhood friend) does bear some similarities to Jeanne of Valois-Saint-Remy who was known to be a big enemy of hers. She was imprisoned and then escaped and published pamphlets about her supposed sexual encounters with Marie Antoinette.Of course as we know, the French Revolution began. The royal family was imprisoned and both Louis and Marie were executed by the guillotine. During the entire story we read about the many different attempts and plans to rescue the family. The one plan that Louis finally gave into unfortunately didn't work because of his indecisiveness. Since he couldn't decide who would play what character, they were late in departing and were caught within 24 hours. It will always make me wonder what would have happened if Louis would have left France when things started going downhill or if the rescue attempt did work. What if Marie Antoinette left with Count Axel? How different would France be today?This was a great book. Erickson tells a fantastic story of Marie Antoinette. Even with the added \\"stuff\\" that comes with historical fiction, she doesn't overdo it."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I couldn't finish The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette by Carolly Erickson. I found myself skimming and not feeling I was missing anything. It was too simplistic in tone and content for the immense complexity of the French queen's life. As she aged, her diary didn't reflect sufficient corresponding maturity. It would a good young adult fictional biography, but it does include some mild sexual activity for parents to be aware of as what might be age appropriate for their child.I've read Ms. Erickson's non-fiction, so I was disappointed in this, her first novel. I found Erickson's non-fiction biography of Marie Antoinette more satisfying. It read like a novel, was more factual, and added depth to Marie's character."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"This was an enjoyable, light historical fiction read. If you are looking for a meaty, comprehensive HF read on Marie Antoinette this will probably disappoint. For a deep, insightful read tryAbundance, A Novel of Marie Antoinette (P.S.)But if you are looking for and introduction to Marie Antoinette or the French Revolution this would be a good fit. This reminded me, although it does fall short, of Robin Maxwell'sThe Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn.Erickson's use of the diary format gives you the immediacy of being transported to the French courts. The picking of fabrics for gowns, the elaborate hair designs, the embroidered slippers, all these frivolous but joyful things that help Marie Antoinette cope with the disappointments of her marriage and trying to fit in at this foreign court and its workings. Erickson does paint a sympathetic figure but does not shy away from showing how out of touch she was with the common people, both her lack of understanding and sympathy and her belief from birth that royalty are indeed above the people. Erickson lets us see her growth from a young woman, girl really, to a wife who grows genuinely fond of her husband and a loving mother. Her maturation and acceptance of what is happening is compelling and poignant for the reader. Overall it is an easy read that touches on Antoinette's life and should leave the reader wanting to learn more about her and this period."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I really liked this book. I didn't know much about Marie Antoinette to begin with, now I want to learn more about her.

Why she didn't use her knowledge in this book is beyond me. Instead of giving us insight into things that did happen (adopting a child before she had her own), she creates characters who didn't historically exist. Instead of bringing alive the people who affected the Queen's life, she glossed over relationships and character. The King's brothers tried to take his thrown, the King's aunts tried to sabotage the Queen, the Queen adopted a child then abandoned him, the Queen was accused of relationships with her women friends... but frankly, this \\"hidden diary\\" is as vacuous as critics said Marie Antoinette was. Highly disappointing from Carolly Erickson. Fragmented and strangely distancing from the subject."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"When I saw this book at the store I was immediately intrigued. As an avid reader about this time in French history, I had high hopes for this novel. I was profoundly disappointed. It is, unfortunately, a weak book worsened by a confused structure. This work of historical fiction is filled with a blatant disregard for history. Although Erickson attempts to avoid the issue by saying this is a work of fiction, I feel that if you choose a historical figure as the subject of a \`fictional account', there is still some responsibility to write within the realm of well known history. What is entertaining about reading historical fiction is that the author takes the known history of a subject and frames that within a shell of fiction. This fiction can be used to fill in gaps or perhaps give an alternate view of a certain life or event but should still remain true to its historical root. There is a very real difference between historical fiction and the historical invention found in this novel. I do realize that there are limitations when writing about the personal feelings of a subject who left no diary or memoir, but come on! There are several parts of the story that are pure fabrication (Trip to Sweden, The Hapsburg Sun, Eric) while some of the most important events in Marie Antoinette's real life (i.e., Affair of the Necklace, her trial) are excluded from the story altogether.Bottom Line: The worst problem with this book is that Erickson's Marie Antoinette is just not a believable character. The real life story of Marie Antoinette needs no tawdry and pointless supplements to be entertaining. It is full of enough drama and tragedy to stand wholly on its own; any author worth her salt should have recognized that."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"Before I write my review I will just give a disclaimer, which is that I enjoyed this book and you probably will too. It was entertaining. You will particularly enjoy it if you don't know anything about Marie Antoinette. I already knew all this stuff and still thought it was fun. If it's all new to you, you will like the dishy and accurate details of, e.g., the King's inability to consummate the royal marriage for seven whole years. Great stuff, very dishy, and the author knows how to write a page turner. So, on that level I say go buy it. It gave me some hours of fun. Although, you might find it downright insane that the Diamond Necklace Affair, one of the most infamous court scandals of the 1780s and the one believed to have played a major role in fatally defaming Marie Antoinette, was not mentioned at all! Not once! It was important enough to be a recent movie with 2 time oscar winner Hillary Swank, but this author decided not to include a single mention of it.So, on another, more deeper level, I'm actually a historian so I have to say that this kind of friviolous, uninformative and selective-omission type writing irritates me to a degree. We already know so much about this woman, and while I do not believe she deserved her fate (I'm against the death penalty period!) I think she is a poor subject for literature. It's interesting that such an ordinary man (Louis the Last) and woman (Widow Capet) with such uninspiring personalities would end up being thrown into such a situation by an accident of fate, but that only goes so far.After awhile, when you realize there is real history of import out there, you have to wonder why there are thousands upon thousands of books about Marie Antoinette. It's very elitist. Let's face it,it's like Princess Diana being on the cover of all those magazines. Yes, she seemed like a nice lady and yes, it's sad that she ended up in awful situations. But what about people like Nelson Mandela? They're a lot more interesting and tell us a lot more about the heroic potential of the human spirit than some woman who, at the end of the day, really was frivolous. She may not have said \\"Qu'ils mangent du gateau\\" (let them eat cake), but she did spend much money on finery while people starved to death. A modern-day dictator would hardly be celebrated in fluff literature for such choices. And if they would, we have to question our values system.Which brings me to my absolute least favorite part of the book. It was relatively accurate despite some of the fictious characters-until the end. It really bothered me that the author takes a Dickensian approach toward revolutionary violence...well, she takes the approach of of all conservative writers from the time of the revolution to now (i.e., Simon Schama). I don't defend violence, but she made no attempt to understand or portray what drives the desperately poor and needy to acts of intense inhumanity then, and this still happens now.I understand the author is trying to \\"be\\" Marie Antoinette, so her \\"insights\\" are limited, but I think it's a little ridiculous and contrived to make up a stupid personality for Robespierre and an even dumber meeting between him and the Queen. The author's Robespierre is based almost entirely on Mme. Roland's memoirs, the famous and bizarre aside Mme Roland made about the Incorruptible having greenish veins which was later turned by Carlyle into the infamous \\"sea-green Incorruptible\\". Madame Roland was about the only source ever claiming Robespierre was \\"green\\". Most people said he was quite pleasant looking. I ought to know. I've read about seventeen biographies on the man. (Don't ask).She exaggerated everything about him and completely obscured his actual personality. He was misguided, but not in the way she portrayed it.It was a total recycled, post-Thermidorian cartoon of the man, which is not good history, it's not even decent historical fiction. He wasn't out of control in the way she wrote it. Also, he stands in for every other revolutionary. Only Marat and Mirabeau are mentioned, and barely at that.Keep in mind that it's awful history and think of it more as \\"Jackie Collins in 18th Century France\\". Which is fine, but I still think they could've made it a little less ridiculous. I don't like real historical figures to be simplified down to cartoon characters. The cartoon gets remembered and nothing else-which is the dumbest form of history out there."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"Erickson's main objective (rather than argument) was to imaginatively elaborate on the actual lives of Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI. Erickson invented dialogue and characters. Entries into the journal recited creative dialogue and the deeply personal thoughts of Marie Antoinette. The characters that were created further transformed this book into a spellbinding read. The invented characters of Amelie, Erick, and Sophie enriched the read by evoking emotions from Marie Antoinette, such as lust, love, and hatred."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I particularly enjoyed the diary format of The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette. It illustrated the hypothetical Marie's state of mind from her early teens up to her death by guillotine and made for a quick, entertaining read.Author Carolly Erickson makes it clear that this is a work of fiction, not fact, but her attention to historical detail, embellished by her beautifully drawn characterizations of Marie, Louie and Axel Ferson captures every nuance of their convoluted personal relationships. The reader occasionally finds themselves feeling some sympathy Marie, the mother, as well as for the weak King Louis XVI, since it was never his desire to ascend the throne. One does wonder why he and Marie ignored the Parisian storm that was building for a dozen or more years until it became the violent hurricane known as the French Revolution. (I suppose since the outcome of the story had already been written by history, the author chose to explore the logical steps that would culminate with a trip to the guillotine).Cheers to Ms. Erickson for her imaginative, enthralling chronicle. One can almost believe this diary was actually committed to paper by the woman who - in reality - - was much too busy living to ever have the time or inclination to pen this journal."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"While most probably think the story of Marie Antoinette's life is already well known, we come to know the woman in Carolly Erickson's absorbing narrative. The wife of Louis IV probably does not have an enviable reputation among many. Perhaps they think she was merely a vapid member of the decadent aristocracy who dismissed the hungry French with \\"Let them eat cake.\\" (Which, by the way she did not say). She emerges as a much more sympathetic character in the hands of Erickson.Using a fictional diary as her literary device, Erickson recounts Marie Antoinette's fated life in the queen's own words. She joyfully remembers her happy childhood in Austria where she lived as an archduchess. It was a childhood that many today will think came to an abrupt end when at the age of 14 she was wed to Louis, heir to the French throne. His lineage, sad to say, was almost all that distinguished him.We hear of the glory years at Versailles and the queen's liaison with a Swedish diplomat. Too soon these days come to an end with the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette's grueling imprisonment, and eventual death by guillotine. She suffered the loss of her children, and witnessed the death of her husband.Actress/singer Maggi-Meg Reed gives an insightful performance beautifully capturing both the queen's gaiety and her heartbreak.

Thus starts a record of her life through her eyes that she maintains until her last entry while residing in Conciergie Prison in Oct 1793. Early on at fourteen, she is to save Austria by marrying the Bourbon heir to the throne of France. Over the next two decades she takes lovers, but supports her husband King Louis XVI. When the peasants storm the palace, she is as unprepared as the other nobles especially her spouse. As she realizes they will get their pint of blood and more, she keeps her head up until she meets Madam Guillotine.Using real historical events over the latter half of the eighteenth century, Carolly Erickson provides a provocative fictionalized autobiography of Marie Antoinette. Fans obtain a taste of how the royal court perceived life including their take on the peasant class. Though there is too much titillating tease about Maria's affairs that takes away from the insightful look at the events and misinterpretation of these incidents that lead to the downfall of royalty, THE HIDDEN DIARY OF MARIE ANTOINETTE remains a fine work of historical fiction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I can't help thinking \\"Hidden Diary\\" was written as a potential candidate for the \\"Royal Diaries\\" children's series.

All of the characters are extremely one-dimensional and Errickson provides no motives to develop MA's character.It reads like, \\"Right now I'm in Austria, and I'm in love with the groom....Now I'm in France, and I want to be a good wife, and I still love the groom and his wife is SO jealous....Now I've met Axel and I'm SO in love...\\" etc.All in all this is an amateurish and uninspiring work. The romantic parts weren't romantic since none of the romantic pairs ever really fall in love, everything \\"just happens\\" to suit the plotline.The trecherous chambermaid, Amelie, is a rip off of Madame Defarge. It's never clarified what her grievances really are or if she's just a psychopath.Ironically I think Louis XVI may be the one character in the story who touched me.

The novel is a quick read, and in the diary format that I usually find so compelling, but somehow the whole overall feel of the book seems dull and uninspired.The Marie Antoinette pictured here seems so saccharine and flavorless. Everything she does is perfect - she loves her husband (despite his ugliness, awkwardness, and all the troubles he causes her), she \\"courtly\\" (i.e., without sex) loves her horse groom, she monogamously loves Count Fersen, she manages the country and household when the king can't be bothered, and even her short-sightedness with finances is largely brushed off as amusing little foibles. I feel that author Erickson is trying to counteract the lamentable tendency to thoroughly and unfairly villify Marie Antoinette, but has overshot the mark into whitewashing her into the perfect suburban housewife - it's just so neat and tidy.Furthermore, it's frustrating to have to point out that fictional characters should not obviously be fictional. To put it another way, when I'm reading a fictional account, I should not be able to tell - until the final Author's Note - which characters were made up out of whole-cloth. To provide a 'villain' for the novel, Erickson has invented a serving maid that might as well have '666' tattooed on her forehead for all the subtlety she brings. You may well think this character to be the devil incarnate when she is able to sass royalty brazenly, single-handedly organize villagers to revolt, and then manage to insert herself into ever major interview with the queen in her later years - including as her guard, her tormentor, her captor, and in a gratuitous \\"threaten with rape and dismemberment\\" scene. Where does she find the energy to do all that AND clean chamber-pots, is what I want to know. But seriously, a single focal-point villain is not a good thing, and the part should have been broken up more carefully and realistically - it just strains the credulity and reminds the reader that this is fiction, not history.Beyond anything else, the pacing seems a little \\"off\\" in this novel. Almost no time is spent pre-wedding in this novel - the famous scene of her clothing change-over is left out entirely, and she seems to become engaged and then married in the course of a few days. The early years of her marriage are skipped through quickly as well, and much of the drama of the aunts and DuBarry is hurried past. Once she becomes queen, a great deal of time is spent on her early years, and then largely with an emphasis on Count Fersen, and yet an awful lot is not said - and what is said seems sometimes confusing and poorly edited, for instance when we are told that her journal was found and all her secrets about Eric became court gossip, and yet a few pages later she mentions that her greatest fear is that anyone will find out that she in fond of Eric. Things get worse when Sophie-the-child is introduced and is not always carefully differentiated between Sophie-the-maid.Overall, this isn't a bad book, and I think a lot of people will find the reading pleasant, but I found it disappointing because so much interesting material was left out, and so much of what was written failed to really hold the attention or add depth to the characters. \\"Shallow\\" is how I would describe it - as sugary and substance-less as a piece of cake.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"Fact or Fiction or half and half, who cares, it was an excellent read. I didn't want to put the book down from the moment I started it. Very amazing story and it was enjoyable.

I reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in her, and the life she lead."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about Marie Antoinette. And, what I do know probably comes from the movies. She usually isn't portrayed very kindly there. I had built this image of a young women who liked parties, clothes, and basic extravagance. This book took an extreme opposite view. It touched on the rumors surrounding the Queen, but I never got a good feel for how the Queen felt about this. The book seems to down play all of that, when in fact that malicious gossip eventually made the people of France hate her. She had to have realized that but she seems really detached from her people and her country. I'm sure the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Although, I'm sure we will never know the whole truth surrounding all the gossip.I did really enjoy the format of the book. The diary entries made it seem like more of a possibility that this was who the Queen really was. I learned a few things I did not know. Plus, it made me want to read more historical fiction about Marie Antoinette. Some seem to complain about some characters being made up, but I able to take that in because I know it is historical fiction. I know that not everything is fact. Overall, and interesting read, but I feel it's steeped more in fiction than in fact."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"This isn't a history book. It's fiction with historical facts thrown in which makes it a great read!You can see Marie Antoinette as a normal human being in this book - very different from how history books and rumors of the past made her out to be. A refreshing perspective!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"A friend sent me this book, and I had it read in about a day because I couldn't put it down. Marie Antoinette has always fascinated me, because she is one of the historical underdogs who was completely misunderstood by the French people. The ironic part is, I realize why they thought she was so heinous: they were literally starving, and to them, she was living in a guilded cage wearing jewels and having extravagent balls. What most of them didn't realize is, she had virtually no concept of what the true conditions were outside her walls, until it was too late. Sure, she gave bread out, but that was unknown to the rest of the nation, and besides, it did not negate the fact that she was chilling while children starved to death.This book was fascinating because, barring some blatant (and purposeful) historical wrongs (and really, we were not alive back then, so how does anybody know for sure??), we got to glimpse into a completely misunderstood life that has been quickly judged by those who were not forced to live a life similar to hers for the past couple of centuries.It is also interesting to me that Louis XVI, who was not known to be incredibly war saavy nor remarkably intelligent, was responsible for a lot of what happened, yet most of the blame was based on his wife, who was virtually powerless to stop him. Any person who has delved a little into history and royals in general understands that women were traded like cattle and were there for props only. (For the most part...Elizabeth I is a different case because she inherited the throne by birth and never married; had she, her reign would not have been deemed successful by her hand alone). How horrible to want to leave and have a husband who is so selfish and blinded that he does not \\"let\\" his wife and children escape to safety. That he believed the French people would not harm him when it was very clear that was exactly what they wanted to do would be slightly amusing if it were not so tragic in the end.I only gave this book 4 stars becuase I found myself skipping a page or two here and there toward the end because I felt things were explained a little too much."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"THE HIDDEN DIARY OF MARIE ANTOINETTEI started reading this book, knowing full well it was FICTIONAL with some history thrown in.Marie Antoinette is one of history's most read about people. Some think she had a fairy tale life, but she did not. When you are reading about someone in history it is hard to think of them as a living, breathing, loving, total person. You just think of them as somebody from the past and you don't quite put them in a human perspective. This book did make Marie Antoinette a real person.The author took liberty with characters, writing in some that never existed. She also deleted many historical happenings that made Marie's life what it was.This was a good book, but I don't know what is actually true and/or false from a true history standpoint. I found myself going to Wikipedi Encyclopedia constantly, looking up this character, this event, trying to find FACTS about Marie's life. It was actually quite helpful. I wish the author would have stuck to the true actual history of Marie's life and thrown in a little bit of fiction for the diary writings. I did enjoy the format of the book; it reads like the title states, in diary form. This made for quick reading.For those of you who love romance with some history -- be it true or false -- thrown in, this would be a book you would enjoy.For those of you who are true history lovers, skip this one and stay with the nonfiction history books.

Upon reading the title of the book, i instantly knew it would be a work of fiction as I know Marie Antionette (unfortunately) never left such diary to be found. However, i deemed it to be adequate entertainment material for an easy afternoon read.For the most part it was tolerable, a few accurate or similar facts here and there, but seemed to be presented in a way that would best be presented to a child. As an adult reader, I found myself getting frustrated at the lack of depth and maturity whenever something interesting was mentioned.Historically, the book was terrible. I especially didn't like the exclusion of important events and inclusion of fictional characters that only made the childish bablings seem more pointless. I was prepared to take on some fictional aspects, but I thought the author indulged too much in her own characters (who i found uninteresting), leaving little room for the real people in Marie Antionette's life, and so you never really got a chance for them to become \\"Real people\\" in the book.Her \\"romances\\" were described in a very general, impersonal way, which dashed any hopes for this at least being a decent romance. There's none of it.There are large skips in the \\"diary\\"- sometimes as much as a year had passed between entries, which I felt made Marie Antoinette's character very distant. Louis is undoubtedly the most established and true to life character in the book, he is the only one who seems to have a distinct personality.Despite these complaints, I found the book to be readable, if only in a light hearted sense. If youre a younger reader, or just someone who likes easy read books with some historical references, but without all the minute facts and detais of a biography or study, then this could possibly be what you're looking for.If you're thinking of reading this book to find out more about Marie Antionette, the revolution, real life in late 18th century france, or the life of a royal, then money is much better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette (Robert Amiss Mysteries)","review":"An interesting take on the life of Marie Antionette, served up in the style of a diary.

The first six chapters would be beneficial to most anyone, after that, it is specific to Christianity"},{"Title":"Why Believe?: Reason and Mystery as Pointers to God","review":"Why write a review of a book that was first published in 1986? Well, when I was looking for a book that claims to comprehensively refute the various psychological, cultural, and sociological reasons not to believe in God, this one stood out. It seems that few Christian apologists even recognise these as issues, let alone address them. \`Why Believe? Reason and Mystery as Pointers to God' is presented as an attempt to overcome the \`intellectual barriers' to Christian faith. Evans claims that it \`may be helpful for those who are truly concerned about what life means and are willing to examine or re-examine deeply held assumptions and attitudes'. Evans states that \`Religious convictions concern life and how life should be lived. And since we cannot suspend judgement about life itself, in the end we cannot be neutral about religious faith'. This seems like a reasonable position and an unbiased investigation of the issues would be useful.Unfortunately, because Evans is selective in presenting and refuting the arguments against the existence of God, the book is of little use to someone who genuinely wants to re-examine their beliefs and discover the truth. It may comfort those agnostics who are having some doubts about their Christian beliefs and want to justify them, or it may even convince some atheists to believe in God. However, since it presents a biased analysis of Christian dogma, it is of little help to those who are looking for a thorough and balanced consideration of the arguments surrounding the God hypothesis.To give Evans credit, he does point out that there are a number of issues raised by psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists and scientists in relation to belief in God. These include the contradictions between science and the creation story in Genesis, alternative explanations for miracles, the fact that people believe because they want or need to, the effect of social conditioning on beliefs, the problems caused by religions and the existence of suffering. However, he does not discuss these issues in an even handed way by presenting both sides of the argument equally. It's not so much what he says as what he doesn't say. In the end he shies away from reason and concedes that \`...in reality a person's faith is largely shaped by nonrational factors'.Evans also fails in his use of logic in some cases, which is disappointing considering he has a PhD in philosophy. Furthermore, his choice of words reflects a bias toward confirming Christian ideas and doubting non-Christian facts. For example, he refers to a \`widespread view' that the Earth is \`tremendously old'. This is not a widespread view - it is a scientific fact that the Earth is billions of years old, based on extensive evidence from various disciplines. The people who doubt this are either ignorant of the scientific evidence or just completely irrational. Perhaps his failure to mention the counter arguments and his logic problems arose because of his failure to suspend his own preconceived ideas and beliefs. Ultimately he fails to find the truth for the same reason as other Christian apologists - because he assumes the truth and then looks for arguments to support it rather than looking at all the arguments in a balanced way and then deciding what the truth is. Some of the counter arguments and logic issues are outlined below.Evans claims that not believing in God still involves faith of some sort. This is faulty logic. The natural world that non-believers accept is self-evident, in contrast to the supernatural world. There is no need for faith in a universe without God because we can see at least a part of it with our own eyes and that is sufficient for practical purposes. Evans refers to \`faith in the scientific method as the ultimate form of reason' as an example. Whether science is the ultimate form of reason is irrelevant. The point is that it tells us, to specified degrees of certainty, how the universe works. We know that science is the best method of finding the truth about the universe. Scientific theories are supported by experiments that we can witness with our own eyes. There is no need for faith in the scientific method. Even supernatural explanations cannot be put forward as an alternative to the scientific method. Unlike the scientific method, they are simply claims of knowledge that cannot be proven or disproven.Evans explains that God does not make his existence completely obvious because \`God presumably would want his creatures to serve him freely out of love, not simply out of fear of his power'. Well, there are plenty of people we love even though we know they exist. Why couldn't the same apply to God? In any case, even if it's true that people would not freely love God if they knew he existed, he doesn't need to make his existence so obscure that there is no reasonable supporting evidence whatsoever. God did not need to create the universe in a way that enables scientific explanations without the need for God and presents evidence that contradicts claims of the Bible. Surely he could have created a universe in which the claims in the Bible seem a little reasonable rather than outrageous. Is God just trying to fool us by making the Earth look much older than it is? Some apologists actually take this absurd stance.Evans argues that the \`burden of proof' does not lie with the believer in God. Using a courtroom analogy, he says religion is not \`guilty until proven innocent'. The problem with this is that one could similarly argue that atheism is not guilty until proven innocent. This renders the legal analogy useless. A more appropriate basis for deciding the burden of proof would be how reasonable and believable the claim is. If someone is making a claim that is extraordinary in terms of our everyday experience and our currently existing explanations for the natural world, then the onus is on that person to provide the evidence. It is reasonable to assume that what is self-evident (that the natural world exists and can be explained without the need for supernatural intervention) should be accepted as true unless proven otherwise. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. For example, Einstein's suggestion that time is relative demanded detailed evidence since it was counter-intuitive. Evans suggests that the evidence for God need only be beyond reasonable doubt rather than certain. This seems reasonable but doesn't shift the burden of proof because, unfortunately for Evans, his evidence raises many reasonable doubts as discussed below.Evans claims that God has revealed himself in history and points to the Bible as evidence of this. However, he fails to mention that there are numerous reasons to doubt the accuracy of the Bible. Without going into details, these include the evidence for the origin, authorship and details of the Gospels; the fact that at most there were two eye witness accounts of Jesus, both written decades after the events; the fact that eye witness accounts, even of very recent events, are notoriously inaccurate; changes resulting from biased transcription and translation; the lack of independent reference to the existence and works of Jesus; the existence of perfectly good natural explanations for alleged supernatural events such as miracles; the failure of Jesus to always make correct predictions and the disagreement between Jews and Christians as to whether Jesus fulfilled Old Testament predictions.Evans presents three types of \`evidence', apart from the Bible, for the existence of God. The first of these is \`the mysterious universe'. He asks \`why, out of all possible universes, should ours exist?' and \`Why shouldn't there just be nothing?' This is a classic fallacy which is often perpetrated by Christian apologists. It's like someone who just won the lottery asking why they won and refusing to believe, because of the low probability, that there was no causal intervention. Asking such questions after the fact is a misuse of probability theory. Obviously if a different universe to ours existed then people on that universe (if they existed) would probably be asking the same question.Even though it is nonsensical to ask why the universe exists after the fact, it is worth digressing for a moment to consider the complexity of such questions. Let's consider the case of why our universe exists out of all possible universes. Firstly it is not clear that the existence of other universes is even possible. The laws of Quantum Physics permit the existence of multiple universes, but this is just speculation and I doubt that this is the type of \`other universes' that Evans is referring to. He seems to be pointing to other universes that could exist, not others that exist concurrently with our own. This is like asking why I exist as the individual I am and not as someone else, considering the billions of people in the world and the number of infinite number of people that could have been born. It just isn't a sensible question. It's like asking \`what's 100 divided by zero?' The correct mathematical answer is that it's undefined - you can't divide a number by zero. Such questions are useful for providing philosophical amusement but are of no value in helping decide practical matters such as whether or not God exists.Evans then ventures into the Intelligent Design argument, or \`purposive order' as he calls it, claiming that the perceived order in the universe implies a designer. This type of argument has been clearly debunked and there are many books and articles that explain the flaws in the ID hypothesis. Although the original edition of Evans' book was published before some of the books and articles that debunk ID, the latest edition was written after books such as Richard Dawkins' \`The Blind Watchmaker' and the ID argument had been clearly refuted by William Paley even before Darwin published \`The Origin of the Species'. An example of the fallacy of \`purposeful design' is the orbit of the planets around the Sun. The reason they orbit so well is that they are travelling at the right speed for their mass. If they were slower they would move closer to the Sun and if they were faster they would have been flung out into space (which some probably were). They weren't placed in the right position by some grand designer. In fact the planets do not orbit as perfectly as some might think. The slow changes in the average orbital distance of many planets and moons indicates that they may not have always been in orbit and may not remain their indefinitely. Evans gives a clue as to why people tend to think there is an intelligent designer behind the universe when he says \`the strong sense that there must be a reason for these things is a natural response of a creature capable of experiencing creatureliness and wondering about it'. The tendency to see patterns where there are none and to expect reasons for natural occurrences has been clearly explained by cognitive science.Evans then contends that there exists a \`moral order' that is evidence of God's existence. He recognises that morality may be simply a product of culture but points to the universal acceptance that certain actions are wrong to support the idea of objective morality. Evans outlines the \`naturalistic explanation' that societies may agree to a set of moral rules so that each individual is better off than if they made up their own rules. He then rejects this explanation on the basis that individuals will undoubtedly not always comply with such rules. He appears to be arguing, in a somewhat confused way, that the fundamental moral principle that one ought to abide by the agreed rules is presupposed by the contract and must therefore be based on a higher moral order. Well it seems to me that this \`fundamental moral principle' is simply the recognition that if people don't stick to the rules the system won't work. It's not any mystical higher moral order. It's not a matter of what we ought to do - it's simply recognition of the consequences, which is completely different to the objective absolute moral order Evans is referring to. Evans concludes that our \`conscience', even though it is clouded by cultural influences, shows that there is a moral standard independent of ourselves. He goes on to say that this fits perfectly with the idea of God. He supports this by claiming that the Intelligence that was the basis for intelligent design of the universe is a moral being. There is no discussion that connects the existence of an independent moral standard, if such a thing exists, with his alleged intelligent designer.There are many questions that Evans' argument for the existence of a morally good God raise, which he does not discuss adequately, if at all. Evans points to universal moral principles as evidence for an objective moral order. However, one could similarly point to the differences between cultures in moral views as evidence against such a moral order. Evans does acknowledge cultural influence and the idea that a common human nature can lead to such universally accepted moral principles, but skirts around this by claiming that such a notion \`...seems increasingly to be rejected by those who do not believe in a God who created human beings...'.Evans' discussion of an objective moral order raises many questions that he fails to address. Even if there is an objective moral order, how do we know that it was created by God rather than just being a conceptual system like, for example, the rules of mathematics? What if the Christians have chosen a set of rules that do not equate to the objective moral order? If God is the judge of what is right and wrong, how do we know that what God commands is morally right? Is it right just because God says so and because he created the moral order or does God give commands based on universal standards that did not need to be created? For example, some proponents of this \`divine command theory' claim that if God commanded us to commit murder then murder would indeed be morally obligatory. This is counter intuitive, if not simply irrational. What is the justification for doing what God says? How do we even know what God wants us to do? Do we just rely on what is said in the scriptures to answer these questions? If so, which scriptures, if any, should we use? If we use the Bible do we just do what Jesus says? How do we apply Jesus' teachings to contemporary moral issues such as abortion, the death penalty, euthanasia, war, racial and sexual discrimination, etc, seeing as Jesus did not provide a full and coherent ethical system? Jesus' ethical \`system' has been described as \`a patchwork of homilies and pronouncements, some of which are unclear and other of which are contradictory'.Evans fails to address any of these issues adequately, if at all, possibly because they are outside the scope of his book and his intentions, or possibly because he doesn't want to confuse the reader. As a result, he presents a very one-sided and over-simplified discussion of morality as a justification for the existence of a good God. An example of this is his statement that \`...anyone who thinks that the abolition of slavery in the Western world was a good thing has really rejected cultural relativism'. He provides no logical justification for this conclusion. Just because a culture's view of what is good and bad changes over time, this doesn't mean that the view is not relative to that culture. An improvement within a culture in one area of applied ethics does not imply that there is an objective \`moral order'. In any case, how do we judge if a change is actually an improvement? This part of Evans' book seems to me to be the weakest link in his unfolding smorgasboard of supposedly linked \`evidence' for the existence of God.Evans moves on to discuss the \`mystery of persons'. He claims that two things make us different from the rest of nature. Firstly he says we were created in the image of God. This is clearly just an unfounded assumption and it is more likely that God was created in the image of us. Secondly he says we were created to enjoy a relationship with God - another assumption. He says that self-awareness, imagination and the power of reflective choice make us different to other creatures. However, it is not clear that other animals do not possess self-awareness. For example, research has shown that some animals can recognise themselves in a mirror. It may even be the case that many animals have some degree of imagination and free decision making ability, but just cannot communicate this to humans. Evans goes on to point out that \`...human beings look pretty much as they should if Christianity is true'. Well of course they do. Can you imagine a case where the ideas of Christianity in relation to human beings would be in contradiction with the reality? Why would anything in the Bible be written so as to not reflect reality? The only reason would be ignorance, as for example in the case of Genesis. Human beings have understood human nature almost since the beginning of human awareness, so of course human nature will correlate with Christianity. Evans cannot be excused for using such poor logic.The next piece of \`evidence' as part of the \`mystery of persons' is the natural desire of human beings to believe in God. Evans claims that \`...the fact that we have a deep need to believe in and find God strongly suggests that God is real...' Evans seems to have abandoned the power of reasoning here. The existence of a strong desire to believe is obviously not evidence for the truth of that belief. Evans explains this need as a \`craving for eternal life, eternal meaning and eternal love.' Firstly it is far from clear that most people have all of these cravings. These desires seem to be essentially held by those who tend to hold religious beliefs. It is not clear which comes first, desire or belief, but they probably feed off each other. Many people can accept that the universe itself is meaningless. This, of course, does not prevent them from finding meaning in their own lives (as opposed to meaning of their lives). Similarly, many have accepted that life and love does not continue forever. Just like all the other events that will cause suffering and fear in our lives, death is not so unacceptable if one can accept that it is inevitable and get on with living. There's nothing to fear about death except the associated suffering and the pain of those left behind. Once we're gone it's no different to us than what it was before we were born.Having tried and failed to show that the apparent \`purposive order' shows that the universe was designed by an Intelligent Designer, that this designer is morally good, that human beings were created in the designer's image, and that many people have a craving for eternity because God exists, Evans then tries to argue that this morally good intelligent designer and Jesus Christ are one and the same. His claims that Jesus actually existed and that the New Testament represents Jesus as divine are reasonable, although the former is far from certain. Evans tries to bolster the credibility of the Bible by explaining that \`...the best scholars today...are agreed that the New Testament was written quite soon after Jesus' life' and that the earliest parts, the epistles of Paul, were \`...written at the latest only twenty to thirty years after Jesus' death.' It seems peculiar to claim that this is supportive of the New Testament's credibility. Firstly, most theological scholars believe the Gospels were not written by the claimed authors. Even if they were, only two of them were written by eye witnesses. Furthermore, extensive research has shown that the credibility of eye witness accounts is notoriously unreliable, even a few hours or minutes after the event. How could accounts written decades after the events be anywhere near accurate, especially with regard to particular words spoken? Why is it that out of thousands of alleged followers and a dozen supposed disciples, none saw it important enough to write about Jesus during his life or immediately after his death? Why do Paul's epistles make very little reference to the numerous alleged events in Jesus' life. Why are there almost no independent references to Jesus in other historical documents? After numerous transcriptions and translations, why would the writings still be as accurate (or inaccurate) as they were when originally written? The weight of evidence here clearly favours the view that the New Testament is highly inaccurate.Evans says that \`...the texts that have been preserved are both more numerous and earlier than is the case with other ancient documents.' He fails to point out that these texts are not original documents and even the originals are unlikely to be anywhere near accurate. Some Christian apologists argue that they know the Bible is accurate because it was \`inspired by God'. This is a circular argument that assumes God exists in order to prove that God exists. Evans overcomes this fallacy by claiming that Christians \`...do not begin by assuming the Bible is inspired by God'. Many fundamentalist Christians would disagree with this. In any case the logical conclusion is that the Bible is as fallible as any other history book, for reasons given above, and maybe more so since it was transcribed by people with a particular religious agenda. Evans admits that \`...this does not mean that the New Testament is necessarily historically reliable...' and suggests only that it \`...should be seriously considered'.Evans claims that Jesus is God because Jesus claimed to be God in the Bible. As discussed above, it is highly questionable whether the words attributed to Jesus were actually the words he spoke. To use Evans' courtroom analogy, it is certainly not \`beyond reasonable doubt'. Evans explains that because of the claim of divinity Jesus would be viewed by most as insane or evil (which he was). But he asks \`...why wasn't everyone repulsed?' His answer is that Jesus was a profound teacher, he did not appear insane or wicked to those who knew him intimately and his ministry was \`shaped by self-giving love, not the lust after power, money, and fame that invariably accompanies the religious charlatan'. Well I think you could say the same about James Warren \`Jim' Jones of the notorious Jonestown. Jones is quoted as saying \`What you need to believe in is what you can see...If you see me as your friend, I'll be your friend. As you see me as your father, I'll be your father, for those of you that don't have a father...If you see me as your savior, I'll be your savior. If you see me as your God, I'll be your God'. His followers did not see him as insane and he did not appear to be looking for fame. A clear difference between Jesus and Jones is that Jesus did not convince his followers to kill themselves. Hardly a reason to believe that he was God.Evans also points out Jesus' alleged resurrection from the dead as evidence that he was God. It's quite obvious that such a claim is false. Nevertheless, as an intellectual exercise let's look at the evidence. Evans says that it is \`...hardly likely that Jesus' dispirited followers could or would have challenged...' the military might of the Roman guards. This may or may not be true, but resurrection is only one possible explanation of why Jesus' body was removed. Some non-believers in the resurrection have argued that resurrection is not possible because miracles are impossible since they defy the laws of nature. Evans argues that since it cannot be proven that God does not exist, it also cannot be proven that miracles can't happen. Similarly, many Christian apologists argue that the resurrection cannot be denied on the grounds that miracles cannot happen. However, acceptance of the resurrection of Jesus requires acceptance that miracles can happen, which in turn requires acceptance that God exists and Jesus is God. Evans is therefore proposing a circular argument that must accept Jesus is divine in order to prove that he is divine. It may well be that we cannot prove the resurrection did not happen, but likewise, Evans cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that it did. Therefore common sense and everyday experience dictates that there probably was no resurrection, even if the reasons given by anthropology, sociology, psychology and cognitive science are ignored.Evans then discusses miracles and goes to some lengths to show that it cannot be proven that miracles do not happen and that God does not exist. Why he sees it important to show this is not clear. The atheist has no particular need to prove that there is no such thing as a miracle that or that God does not exist. There is already ample reason to doubt the accuracy of the Bible, and hence the existence of the Christian God. There are also plenty of reasons to seriously doubt that miracles happen. For example, there is a complete lack of independent evidence for any miracles that have not or could not in principle be explained by science. On the contrary there are well researched natural explanations for so called miracles. For example, alleged faith healings have been shown to be either false claims, coincidental spontaneous remissions, or caused by the placebo effect. The fact that such a tiny proportion of people who visit miraculous sites are actually healed is clear evidence that these \`miracles' are simply coincidence based on the expected probability. If the believer wants to convince the non-believer using the existence of miracles, then the onus is on the believer to prove that they happen.Evans discusses the Bible as \`special revelation from God'. He acknowledges that many people take the view that various books in the Bible were \`...written much later than events reported and that the Bible contains a great deal of accumulated myths and legends'. He doesn't address this issue in any detail but claims that such views are \`...rooted in philosophical suspicion of special acts of God...' and are \`...not solidly rooted in purely historical and textual evidence...'. Basically Evans argues that the claims of the Bible are more likely to be true than the explanations for their falsity. It's a bit like saying it must be true because it's written in a book. This is not very convincing, especially considering the various reasons outlined above for having \`philosophical suspicion'. One could just as easily apply Evans' argument to astrology, after all surveys show that around 30% of Amercians believe in astrology and about 40% think it is scientific (the extent of scientific ignorance never surprises me). Astrology is widespread and is clearly \`rooted in historical and textual evidence', but no doubt Evans would quickly dismiss it as superstition without seeing the superstitious roots of his own beliefs.Evans discusses the existence of suffering as a problem for Christian apologists. \`Why does God permit such things? Why has he made a world where so many, including innocent children, suffer so much?' His answer to this question is twofold. In relation to suffering caused by people he uses the free will argument. This argument states that evil is a by-product of human free will, which God necessarily had to allow people so they could choose to love him freely. It's not a bad argument, although it has been refuted by some. However, this argument cannot be applied to suffering caused by natural disasters. Evans addresses natural disasters by claiming that we cannot know the reasoning of God, even if we know that there must be good reasons. He claims that we know there are good reasons because we know the nature of God (from the Bible, which is unreliable as discussed earlier). Basically it's the old \`God works in strange ways' argument. This is not an acceptable refutation, it's simply an admission that there is no rational answer if God does in fact exist. It's clutching at straws. The simple and more obvious answer is that God does not exist.Evans touches on the conflict between science and religious belief, especially in relation to the creation story in Genesis. He says that most Christians do not believe that the Bible teaches that the universe is only a few thousand years old, and this enables them to accept the findings of science regarding the age of the Earth and evolution (the minority who take the Bible literally, including the six days it supposedly took God to create the Earth, will find no comfort in this view). Evans claims that this is \`...not simply a desperate fall-back maneuver of the part of Christians', explaining that Genesis is \`... an account of who and why, not how.' Nevertheless, Evans' interpretation raises the issue of which parts of the Bible should be interpreted literally and which should not - another issue he conveniently avoids.Regarding the view of Freud that belief in God is a crutch and a form of wish fulfilment, Evans contends that Freud's reasoning commits the \`genetic fallacy' by deciding the truth or falsity of a view on the basis of the origins of the view. I'm not sure what Freud's original intentions were, but the psychological reasons for believing in God simply show that the widespread prevalence of religion is not a sign of his existence. I doubt that any reasonable person would claim that it amounts to a proof of God's non-existence. The same line of reasoning applies to anthropological and sociological explanations for the belief in God. What these disciplines do is give us an understanding of why people hold such beliefs. They believe because they are predisposed to, not because God exists. Evans is essentially using a \`straw man' argument here, in which he incorrectly puts forward an illogical proposition that is supposedly supported by atheists , then knocks it down to gain credibility.Evans discusses issues such as sexism, claiming that although \`the Church' has practised sexism for centuries, Christianity is actually non-sexist because it is based on a belief that all human beings were created in God's image. He then says that \`Christians do not have to defend everything that has been done in the name of religion...' because Christianity is \`...not merely a religion...'. Obviously people who believe that Jesus Christ was God are not going to accept their beliefs and institutions as just another religion. However, this doesn't mean that it's not. Christians are responsible for the actions of their institutions whether they like it or not.The remainder of \`Why Believe?' discusses the \`mysteries' of Christianity, including the trinity, the incarnation, atonement and redemption and the resurrection. Evans says that these seem absurd because they are \`God's mysteries'. They are \`above reason but not against reason'. The logic of this argument makes sense. It is similar to trying to explain the concepts and explanations of modern science to someone in Jesus' time. It would seem absurd to them. I doubt that Jesus or any of his cohorts would have believed, if they knew, that 21st Century Christians, with the benefit of the scientific explanations for nature, would still believe in such things as the creation story and the great flood.Evans doesn't try to use the argument of \`above reason but not against it' as a proof of God's existence, but rather as an explanation to comfort those who have doubts because of this absurdity. He says that the fact that Christianity contains doctrines that seem absurd is precisely what we would expect if God existed. Of course the same argument applies to astrology or Scientology or flying saucers or hundreds of other beliefs (most of which, incidentally, contradict Christianity), so it provides little comfort for doubting Christians.Evans says that the mysteries of the Christian faith \`...do not contradict what is known to be true'. This is plainly false, since there are many things we know to be true that contradict the basic mysteries.In summary, what Evans is basically saying is that we cannot use our reason to understand the mysteries of Christianity. Yet he tries to use reason, often unsuccessfully, to argue in favour of Christianity. Surely conceding that we cannot use our reason is an admission that there is no good reason to believe?"},{"Title":"Pride of the Green Mountains: The story of a trusty Morgan horse and the girl who turns to him for help (Treasured horses collection)","review":"Since this was my favorite Treasured Horses book I'll give it a 10.

He said he knew of none, that what I really needed was therapy. Well, I'm still waiting to get into a program, but this book has been amazing! I will go into therapy prepared. I know what my problems are, and I know what I need to do to improve the way I think and feel. I am doing much of it on my own, with the help of dozens of exercises in this book.This resource is so educational and EMPOWERING. It describes all sorts of distortions in thinking and feeling. The exercises help you make connections between how you think and why you are depressed. What I love about Dr. Yapko is that he is never condescending, and he never accuses the depressed person of causing their own problems. He does claim that depression is learned, but never blames or intimidates. Rather, he shows that there is hope in learning new patterns.I have been in therapy before, and it involved rehashing feelings and experiences from my past. Dr. Yapko shows that what is more important to focus on is our process of thinking and handling events. Rehashing old experiences can just feed our depressive patterns. This explains why my last round of therapy didn't help me cope with my present problems!This book has filled me with hope. There is a lot of information to learn, and many new patterns to develop. But all of that gives me hope for a better future. One of the exercises in particular has really opened my eyes to why I am currently in a depression. Knowing our vulnerabilities can explain when we fall into a depression, and can also help us prevent future episodes! I can't say it enough - buy this book for yourself or for someone you love.FINAL NOTE: Medicine often has value and can help a person achieve a level of stability so that they can tackle the exercises and changes in this book. A severely depressed person should seek professional help and find a medication before starting this book. It could be very overwhelming for someone who is in complete despair."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"My third bout with major depression in four years and I was a burned out house. I saw this book in a used bookstore and, being a good compulsive, decided to read yet another title on the topic. So, so glad I did.I had done endless ruminating about &quot;why&quot; this cycle was occurring, endless dissection of my &quot;inner life&quot; and the like and though I had snagged many insights into my experience, I was still just a very depressed person with insights--I had no ability to link my discoveries with clear, new, hopeful actions. Like many people, I believed that constant introspection would eventually pay off, but after years of going through this painful loop I had lost any energy I'd begun with and had come to know that &quot;understanding&quot; does not automatically mean the thing that's understood is therefore changed.Yapko will make demands on you with this book, but he is never harsh, flippant or vague. No new-age verbiage, childhood revisitation or typical shrink-speak. His demands are those of clear, solution-oriented actions. And honestly, he's a good guide. For those who feel like they've &quot;tried it all&quot; but are still caught on the spike of their own mind, try this book. I think you could get better. Good Luck."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"A mind-opening look into the vicious thought patterns depressed people suffer from, this book has been more helpful to me than years of therapy *and* a degree in psychology. (Although I'm not giving up the meds just yet). I'm amazed by how clearly Yapko explains the cognitive distortions we have. The case histories he describes are priceless.On the &quot;negative&quot; side, Yapko can be just a bit condescending at times; it's clear he thinks his way is the only way. And although he mentions other theories of depression, he favors the &quot;nurture&quot; theory of ineffective learned thought patterns, claiming that only a small percentage of depression is biochemical in nature. (Maybe next lifetime he'll be a woman and get to experience menopause. ;)Yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people &quot;depressives,&quot; which is the kind of labeling we could do without.The most serious criticism I have is that his &quot;Learn by Doing&quot; exercises are sometimes impractical, if not downright silly. For example, to learn about perceived control, Yapko writes, &quot;spend a few days asking [a partner] for permission to do everything, such as 'Can I go to the bathroom?'&quot;. (Can you imagine how much your spouse would enjoy that after the third day?) Other exercises tell you to &quot;interview at least a dozen people&quot; or &quot;sometime when you feel playful, experiment with trying to motivate people to do impossible things&quot; like flying. What depressed person feels playful? Many of these exercises would be highly embarrassing, and certainly not within the realm of a depressed person's capabilities--especially those of us who are &quot;older&quot; and have physical disabilities. However, I do plan to complete the written exercises.Having outlined these minor drawbacks, I have to say it's an excellent book--after all these years, I finally have hope about rising from the ashes of depression."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"As a therapist who sees lots of people with depression I am often asked for useful reading material to add to the therapy. Most depression self help books are of the &quot;if you put your mind to it you can achieve anything&quot; variety. Breaking the Patterns of Depression is the book that I most often recommend because it explains the modern understanding of depression, amplifies by giving realistic examples and gives specific instruction in practical skills that teach people how to learn new ways of thinking to not only treat depression but to prevent recurrence. I often tell people who are in a relationship to, if possible, have their partner read the book aloud to them for 20-30 minutes each day. This way of using the book has multiple benefits for both partners."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"I appreciated Yapko's perspective on depression. He approaches depression from different perspectives, noting that sometimes it is chemical, but other times it is environmental and attitude. Yapko goes down the list of how some cliches and societal perspetives can contribute to anxiety, most memorably, he puts his own spin on the &quot;if first you don't succeed, try try again&quot; cliche, restating it as, &quot;If at first you don't succeed, try try again . . . but try something different!&quot; Keeping our options open, and being willing to try different things, can keep us from being depressed when we don't get exactly what we want in the way we wanted it.Another thing I appreciated was how Yapko noted that sometimes a belief in &quot;higher meaning&quot; can be used in cruel ways. Basically, he details how there are some people who believe that depressed people choose to be depressed, and that if only they would be more spiritual and more open to the positive things in the world then they wouldn't be in a depressed state. In this view, depressed people are seen as burdens who just won't &quot;get with it.&quot; If only they would be more positive, and realize that they choose how they feel (and therefore have chosen this depression, and should feel bad for having done so because having chosen depression shows they are negative people), then things would be okay. Yapko notes that this is very cruel and lacks compassion. The irony being that such people (those who condemn depressed people as &quot;negative thinkers&quot;) are themselves negative thinkers.This book provides a fresh perspective on depression. I really appreciated it."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"I have read many books about depression. This one is so far the best. Dr. Yapko tackled the problem of depression from a somewhat different but profound perspective. Patients are encounraged to check their values and seek the deep rooted scource of their depression. Yapko integrated cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal relationship methods in one book and provided detailed guidelines for readers to find out what specific methods were useful for them. There are many interesting Learning by Doing exercises in this book. Some of these assignments seem a little strange, but gradually they can bring about valuable perceptual shifts, and help people to perceive more positively."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"You've probably heard of the Rorschach Inkblot Test, where people are asked to interpret the meaning of inkblot shapes. The value of this test is in demonstrating how we interpret ambiguous circumstances from our own perspective. Dr. Yapko uses the Rorschach as a metaphor for the ways in which we project our assumptions onto our life experience: &quot;Life is like an inkblot -- an 'experiential Rorschach,' so to speak. Life doesn't have an objective or assigned meaning. We give it meaning by our individual values, beliefs, relationships, careers, hobbies, and other life experiences.&quot; Yapko emphasizes that there's not much value in getting caught up in &quot;what I might have done to bring on depression.&quot; What works is to identify our patterns of behavior, focus on solutions and on the future, and build the skills that help us cope better with all that life brings. Moreover, while his book is directed toward solutions for depression, these principles apply to how our attitudes affect us in general, and can be an aid in all kinds of physical and emotional circumstances. Here are some suggestions based on exercises from this book:- What are some recent situations where your behavior did not reflect your feelings... how might you express your true feelings more directly?- To make your problem less amorphous, create a symbolic image of your experience of it, using paints, or crayons, or whatever else you have at hand. If your disease had a color, what would it be? Size or shape? Texture? How strong is it -- how might it be eliminated as an adversary?- We learn our values as children, and not all of them work in our favor. Make a list of your values, their source, and how you express them in your life. (For example, did you learn to value emotional expressiveness or emotional containment? taking risks or being safe?)- Do you reject parts of yourself? List your &quot;negative&quot; characteristics, then write out at least three examples of situations where these aspects of yourself can have positive value."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"This book is one of the rare self-help books that don't just cite facts about depression, but that also help the reader with his problems!

This book and &quot;Undoing Depression&quot; were the two I tried. The factual content of the two is fairly similar but the tones of the two are worlds apart. &quot;Undoing Depression&quot; is a sympathetic approach to synthesizing all the things that can help form new and better life habits. It is written from three perspectives, that of the literature, of a practicing therapist, and someone who is himself recovering from depression. By contrast Yapko's book never let me feel that he and I were &quot;on the same side;&quot; throughout it I felt that the wise savior therapist was going to show me the error of my ways. In actual fact the advice of the two books is pretty close and people who need detailed and specific exercises and don't mind the school marm tone of voice might find it helpful.

For a depressive to change her reality, all she has to do is substitute new interpretations and constructions for her old, counter-productive readings of experience.Although Yapko tries to provide some balance, he essentially opposes biological, genetic, psychoanalytic, and even behaviorist approaches to depression. Negative thinking isn't in your genes, your psyche, or the \\"external\\" world (though the environment influences its increasing hold on individuals): it's in you. Consequently, Yapko reasons, you can control it if you follow his advice: stop thinking about yourself (self-consciousness leads to paralysis); avoid \\"global\\" thought (produces despair) in favor of concrete, practical thinking; forget about the past and direct your attentions to the individual's capacity to create the future.Yapko's advice, directives, and exercises will no doubt appeal to some readers more than others. For those who suffer from occasional \\"down\\" time, or smoldering but mild \\"dysthymia,\\" the book could prove inspiriting if not inspiring.

Once the situation is resolved, they recover and go back to their lives. I would call this a mood disorder and their pattern is to retreat when problems overwhelm them. Learning how to handle life's ups and downs is behavior modification and fits this book. However, this book is way behind current mental health findings. Most mental illness, like clinical depression, is inherited. It is a genetic predisposition. It is brain chemistry and environment. Your life experiences can determine whether or to what extent you present with a mental illness genetically linked to your family. Childhood abuse (whether sexual, verbal, or emotional), a life tragedy like early death of a parent, sibling or involvement in a horrific event can trigger mental disorders that are biologic in nature. Clinical depression is biochemical and responds best to a combination of medication and therapy. Most people with clinical depression cannot tell you why they are in a depressive episode. There can be known triggers and there are times there seems to be no apparent reason. This book could harm a person with clinical depresssion, as if their illness is their fault and they should be able to stop it at will. Don't waste your money or worry yourself with this book/author who does not understand the different types of depression.

But when stress depletes magnesium, a vicious cycle spins out of control and depression can occur. The body needs magnesium in order to release and bind adequate amounts of serotonin in the brain. The pharmaceutical industry has focused its research for the treatment of depression on serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac to capitalize on serotonin's chemical effects instead of giving serotonin what it really needs -- magnesium...Magnesium deficiency is a potential cause for every type of depression. All treatment protocols should begin with adequate doses of this valuable mineral.\\" If you are suffering from depression, I beg you to acquire and read Dr. Dean's book and take supplemental magnesium daily as Dr. Dean recommends.

Both books emphasize the need for depressed people to improve their lives and both books provide valuable information that will help accomplish this. Yapko seems to place a lot of importance upon cognitive therapy - depressed people almost invariably show errors in their thought processes that are harmful and teaching the depressed person to identify and correct these distortions is often the best way to accomplish rapid and lasting mental health. Often medications are needed, but using medications alone may help with the symptoms while not helping the patient to develop coping skills that are often needed in order to get at the root of the problem, and whereas insights alone may not be particularly helpful coping skills are. The book is well written with \\"Learning by Doing\\" excercises, and I like the way Yapko places emphasis upon understanding the various PATTERNS of depression for what they are, naming them, and helping the reader to recognize these patterns - to see them coming for what they are and to challenge them effectively (Chapter 2's title \\"Less Analysis, More Action\\"). I also think that many people will benefit from the section that focuses on common belief systems that can be harmful (e.g., \\"Everything happens for a reason\\") and helps the reader to move beyond noncritical acceptance of thought patterns and overgeneralizations. I agree with other reviewers that there is no replacement for professional help, and medications may be necessary, but I also think that many mildly to moderately depressed people will beneift greatly from owning these two books."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression offers depressed people a way out of their depression by offering numerous suggestions from an international expert.

In learning to dismantle and defuse old thought and behaviour patterns I regain control of me that I might indeed submit. &quot;Breaking the Patterns of Depression&quot; for me, un-covers the specter of depression to reveal a tangible obstacle that I can confront. It also includes the information and techniques for overcoming it by untangling oneself from its tentacles (which we unwittingly wrap around our own selves) and further how to keep it at bay. I see myself working through this book many times. One pass only begins to unearth the value!"},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"It is bad enough having to suffer from depression without having someone have you dissect yourself in analyzing of the disease or disorder or whatever Dr. Yapko wants one to call it. The book is written in the &quot;parent mode&quot; of communication and he was talking down to me. Plus, since his secret answers were printed upside down, I felt childish trying to read them or, since much of my reading is done in public, I was embarrassed with having to continually turn the book upside down. I want to know the facts and not be quizzed on whether my thinking is proper or healthy. Tell me your opinion or what you know for sure about depression and I will decide whether or not to incorporate them into my process of healthy thinking and living. No, this book was not for me."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"Reading Dr. Yapko's &quot;Breaking the Patterns of Depression&quot; felt like coming home to hope. With language readily understandable, Dr. Yapko defines those features which cause depression and leads the reader to insightfully self-analyze individual patterns and to understand what can be done about them. The emphasis on an active and experiential approach to intervention and subsequent prevention is empowering and extremely helpful and sets this book apart from others."},{"Title":"Breaking the Patterns of Depression","review":"Much has been said here already so I shall just add my voice to say that Yapko changed my life!

I come from the school of thought that the greatest component of moderate to severe depression is biochemical, though most people find themselves in the realm of mild depression. For the mildly depressed, Yapko's advice may be more likely to work. And, like I said, most people could benefit from transforming the way they view and interact with the world. Avery Z.

For some reason she just loves to sit &amp; stare at the pictures. It's the first Richard Scarry book she has seen, and I plan to buy more. The pictures have a busy quality to them that makes kids like to sit and study them. It's rated for 4-8 year olds, but I think older kids may find it boring. Perfect for reading to toddlers &amp; pre-schoolers though."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Hi,I usually don't write spoilers. I think I will a bit, this time. If I'd based the rating system here on the story alone. I would have given it a negative five stars... Mr.Chaplin came from searing poverty, so he says. I don't believe he was ever challenged on that count. He was given the golden ticket in life. An extremely limited number of people are chosen to receive unbelievable luck in life. He was one such person. He went from nothing, to obscene wealth. After reading several hundred pages of his charmed existence. The main thought I can't help but keep coming back to? He didn't do a damn thing for the other 99.99% impoverished after he'd made it so Cinderella big. He was handed millions of dollars during the depression. Did he do so much as open a few soup kitchens? At least a token Thank You to the country that gave him everything? If not in the US, why not London? He never gave anything back. Further, he shirked his military duty in WW1. The movie by his name, w/R.Downey jr., alludes to his having been rejected by the army as being too scrawney. His own Bio makes no mention of this. He only says that some people thought he did more for us from behind a camera. He eventually married a child bride. He married a barely 18yo girl, when he was 36yrs her senior. That's disgusting on a few levels. He had his charmed life handed to him, & apparently didn't learn a thing from his own hardships. To me, that is utterly unforgivable. I doubt I'll ever re-read it. Anyone want a copy?"},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"I originally read this book back in the early 1970's when I was a teen-ager. Recently I found it at my Dad's house and had the great pleasure of re-reading it. As with any autobiography there is a certain amount of self-promotion and justification, however this book really keeps it to a minimum. The period covered is from birth until his expulsion from the United States, and gives great insight on the early years of Hollywood, including his formation of United Artists with Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. If you're a fan of &quot;the Tramp&quot; then I highly recommend this book. If you're not a fan but looking for a great true-to-life story, I would still recommend it as well."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Chaplin is Chaplin. This is enough to make his autobiography interesting. It is his honesty and sensitivity and attempts to be in touch with himself at various points of his life that makes this book remarkable. And it is through sharing his inadequacies and traumas that the comic tramp makes me cry.This book is invaluable in getting an insight into early days of Hollywood. It also provides a great account of Charlie's life and struggles. So the learning is tremendous.However, the best part of the book is its humanness - fallible, confused, hesitant, and shy and yet successful, rich, adored, and mobbed by fans.What struck my heart is the loneliness in the midst of a celebrity status and Charlie's ability to get in touch with it and share it.What is also moving is his trauma during the McCarthy era and his eventual 'reverse migration' to Europe.Even JFK could not get him back."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"While the movie Chaplin is very well done, no person can tell a story like they can tell there own. Based on this, I chose to read the book written by the cinematic legend himself. While there are some discrepencies between the book and movie, books have an ability to make details evident that movies can not make evident.The book spends a considerable amount of time in his early life. Chaplin struggled with a rarely present father and a mentally ill mother. It was through this poverty that he followed the chosen career path of his parents in the theatre. The theatre would would lead him to America where he would begin working in the new film industry. Through this industry he made classic films that continue to influence modern cinema despite their age. When Chaplin made a film, it had something to say. It was art that spoke to the human soul with humor, love, and hope. His films were not merely a way to make money.Aside from his work in films, Chaplin was a humanitarian. He supported America in times of war depite not being a citizen. Chaplin never forgot his roots, making him empathetic to the needs of the less fortunate. This trait led to the revoking of his residency when he spoke of openly of opening a second front in Russia during World War II. It was through this stance that he was labeled a \\"communist\\". In spite of these attacks led by J. Edgar Hoover, Chaplin rarely mentions Hoover in his book. Nor does he harbor ill will toward America. It is a travesty that this film legend and humanitarian was treated so poorly by the American government in his later years.The book ends shortly after Chaplin has settled in to his new life in Switzerland. With his new life, Chaplin has a positive outlook. One has to wonder what might have been if Chaplin finished his life in America. Surely he was capable of creating more great work. However, sometimes a man's greatest work and pleasure is his family."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Despite all the exquisite books that have been devoted to Charlie Chaplin through the years, the comedian's own account of his life remains my first recommendation to anyone interested in his life and work. In fact, it seems to me that the relevance of MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY increases as every new book is written, because every Chaplin-biographer since has relied so heavily on the incredible memory, sensitivity and insight provided in this book. Thus to not recognize it in its entirety would likely result in an unbalanced view of the man.It is the general standpoint that the first twelve out of twenty-nine chapters are the most fascinating. Born and raised in London, Chaplin's intense observations of the late Victorian era, seen through the eyes of a man who suffered a confused and insecure childhood, are often heartwrenching. Although Chaplin tells his story in retrospect as one of the richest and most celebrated personalities the world has ever known, it is made so obvious in his writing that the feelings of desperation and inferiority never quite left him, that I constantly found myself imagine not Chaplin the man, but Charlie the boy telling me his story as though it happened yesterday. His first appearance on the stage, the struggle for money, his mother being transmitted to a mental asylum, the death of his alcoholic father, his first experience with love, his rise from a bit player to a major comedian on the stage, leading to his first movie contract while on tour in the States; it is all here, told through a vast amount of anecdotes and descriptions of everyone and anything.Chaplin devotes an entire chapter on his first year in the movie industry; he talks about the working methods of the time, the various comedians he worked with, his first attempts as a director, and of course the birth of his famous Tramp character who within months turned him into not only a star but also the truly first icon of the movies. He also spends some time further into the book analyzing the development of his character, how the Little Fellow (as he always named him) matured from a rough charicature with certain saddistic traits, into the lovable and (mostly) well-meaning Tramp we remember. As for his movies, one thing of particular interest to me was that Chaplin as early as in 1916 intended to make a science-fiction comedy, having his Tramp character travelling to the moon; one sequence was to have him feeded by a machine. Sadly this movie was never made, but Chaplin used the idea of the feeding machine twenty years later in one of his most acclaimed films.However, as he turns attention to his position as a celebrity, it seems as though Chaplin becomes less interested in talking about his work. He shares interesting recollections of how he was inspired to do THE KID, THE GOLD RUSH, CITY LIGHTS, THE GREAT DICTATOR, MONSIEUR VERDOUX and LIMELIGHT as well as the receptions of these films, but only names a few particular incidents from the shootings. Several pages are spent on his trip to Hawaii in the early 30's, but the making of MODERN TIMES is gained less than two pages. Many readers find this disappointing, and not without reason, but I don't think the comedian's neglections are that surprising. The general enthusiasm in Chaplin's writing reveals that he probably wrote this memoir as much for his own pleasure as for his readers, and it can be assumed that he simply didn't find enough amusement in recalling the inexhausting years he spent on his masterpieces. On the other hand, he expressed in interviews that he remembered his early years as an entertainer with nostalgia; which quite certainly explains why he is more obsessed with his early work than later on.As for his private life, Chaplin spends little time discussing his well publicized affairs with young women, including his two first wives. He does not by any means ignore this aspect of his life; he is frank with his interest in sex, which was mostly present when he had no work to attend, but prefers not to dwell on it, which I think is understandable considering that he'd led a very happy and healthy life with Oona and their children for twenty years by this time. I for one would hardly focuse much on such things if I ever wrote a memoir, as I think they are nobody's business but the involved parts. (Besides, as Chaplin- biographer Robinson has pointed out, this was in the 1960's when a \\"memoir\\" obviously was viewed by another standard than today.) From the infamous Joan Barry-scandal on, though (when he was forced to pay for a child that was not his), Chaplin is very open with his bitter feelings, and he remains such throughout the recollections of his exile from the U.S. in 1952.The comparatively brief time spent on his sex life and working habits seems to be the only thing many people care about. What strikes me as far more important is that despite some slight disappointments, MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY remains a wonderful book throughout. Chaplin talks about love, loneliness, the nature of comedy and tragedy, and his passion for music even till the very last page. His vocabulary is outstanding; it is impossible to recognize the fact that this man got only two years of formal education. In contrast to most memoirs written by movie stars, it is vertified that nothing of Chaplin's book was ghost-written.In addition to being an actor, Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited and compsed the music to his own films; it is through this phenomenal amount of talent, unequalled by anyone else in the business, that he remains one of the most recognizable figures the world has known. He gave us this book to tell his story, and we should be grateful for that."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"CHARLES CHAPLIN: MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY tells the revealing life of one of the most beloved and iconic American silver screen legends of the twentieth century. In his well-known bowl hat, toothbrush mustache, floppy shoes, and bamboo cane, Chaplin had a long illustrious film career that spanned from 1914 to 1957 where he made about 88 films. Through his modest upbringing in Victorian era England by former stage performers, Charles and Hannah Chaplin, Charles picked up where his parents left off. He was an entertainer as he was an articulate man who lived a somewhat vagabond life, which included travels all over the world, but between directing and performing, he spent his time reading the classics from history to philosophy; he was observant of the world around him, but dealt with the subject of history as poetic and a breath of skepticism. Chaplin states, \\"After all, there are more valid facts and details in works of art than there are in history books\\" (323).MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY does not cover controversial terrain. Chaplin is honest and respectful of the people he encountered throughout his career, and this is conveyed within his narrative. Charlie Chaplin lived and worked during the most serious periods in world history, the two World Wars and the controversy of looming accusations that he was tied to communist sentiment. Chaplin had the opportunity to become acquainted with the most towering dignitaries of the world, Sir Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Einstein, US presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, he offers little hints of particular encounters, such as with his meeting with Herbert Hoover, but does not elaborate on the details and leaves it up to the readers to come to their own conclusions. Indeed, he had a deep concern for humanity. He clearly was cognizant in translating his concerns through his creative endeavors, such as in his full-length films, \\"City Lights\\" and \\"The Great Dictator.\\" One of the interesting aspects of Chaplin's discussion of \\"Dictator\\" is that he includes the transcript to the last lines to the film in this book.As a fixture of Hollywood, Chaplin shared the limelight with his peers. His most revered friendships were with Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, William Randolph Hearst, H.G. Wells, and mentor Upton Sinclair. He also experienced less than stellar relationships with different women that led to three failed marriages, but finally succeeded in finding happiness with his fourth wife, Oona O'Neill, daughter of playwright Eugene O'Neill, when she was only eighteen years old and shockingly, he was in his 50's.Overall, Charlie Chaplin shares with readers his most creative and colorful life. The only weakness to the book is that Chaplin seldom mentions any particular date to an event, thus readers are assumed to have knowledge of history and the individuals in which he speaks about in order to parallel these events to his own life. Nevertheless, MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY will enlighten the Chaplin aficionado or curious reader."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"While this is by no means a perfect book, it is still very enjoyable to read Chaplin's account of his life and times. Other works may portray him more accurately and with less bias, but they cannot offer the same personal touch that this book presents. For the most part, the book is a smooth read-even though Chaplin tends to leave out important points that are uncomfortable (but essential), creating a few strange transitions. Further, it appears that even the realm of non-fiction biography is not safe from fictional enhancements. Chaplin, being the tireless dramatist, invented at least one character in this book for fluency and apparently stretched a story here or there as well. Despite this, a fan of the great comedian must respect (or at least accept) the fact that this is how Charlie Chaplin wanted to be remembered."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"GREAT, WONDERFUL, THE BEST. these are just a few of the words that could discribe this briliant book about the talented little tramp, Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin. He tells of his hardships as a child, and his stage debute at the age of five that changed his life, all the way to the first time he walked onto the keystone movie sets, with the creation of the little tramp. He goes on to tell us about all of his movies and all of the trouble making them. He talkes about the invasion of talking movies and the meeting and wedding of the love of his life to the day he died, Oona O'neil. He very gracfully talkes of his exil on the way to the london premier of &quot;Limelight,&quot; and the buying of his new house in Switerland, Manoir de Ban. This was, is, and forever will be a great book for all ages to read."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"There is no doubt that Chaplin was a man of many talents, but he was also a human being. And like us all, was of contradictions, and many flaws. He tells of an absolute horrible childhood,with an alcoholic father, and a very emotional, unstable mother,that left him with a wary eye,towards practically everyone. It is true, that this autobiography left out those that he considered his equal. Such as Stan Laurel and Buster Keaton. He was probably deeply in love with a young girl named Hetty Kelly,that he knew in England-whom he never told how much he cared for her, and when she died, affected him profoundly. His pattern of marriages and their subsequent failures, told me that forever after, he continued to search for Hetty Kelly. Chaplin may have been famous, but this was one deeply sad story, that gave him a lifetime, to reflect on, and mourn."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Once grown up, sort of, I never lingered long at the video shop over Chaplin's oeurve, passing his famous movies by for another day and then renting the Mambo Kings or True Grit, whatever. Finding his autobiography on a sale rack at Gecko Books in Chiang Mai stopped me though, and a few perused pages were enough to intrigue me as the man wrote affectionately and well. How the world has changed! Chaplin will acquaint you with turn-of-the-century London with its vibrant theatrical entertainment juxtaposed with 'work houses' and 'loony bins'. His initial tours as a stage actor in America are wonderfully rendered, filled with anecdotes worthy of Dos Passos, then followed by his swift ascent to fame and fortune working in and transforming the nascent movie industry in Los Angeles. After that sweet ride Chaplin confronted the 'talkies', a somewhat diminished energy and, eventually, the crude machinations of a voracious media and paranoid government. These latter periods are peppered throughout with overly long renditions of the rich and famous who sought him out or he them; mostly they ate and drank together. The look into celebrityhood is, at the very least, quite entertaining as a test of trivia. My Autobiography is a fine book and very well written, by one of the most engaging men of the twentieth century - I've got to rent those videos."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Charles Chaplin was easily the first international superstar the world had ever known, but his story is an intriguing tale of a person with hopes, dreams and faults. The towering successes in Chaplin's life are mirrored by his failures, especially during the early part of his life while he was struggling to perfect his craft. By all means, Chaplin was a comedic genius of the first magnitude, but with it came a price only perfection can demand."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Reading this book was like going on a magical adventure through time and across the world.

A must have for a true fan."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"For a used book, this arrived on time and in very good shape. The book is written in somewhat of an odd manner in that, the stories tend to jump around a lot. Once you figure out how it's written, the stories are easier to follow.

It's really a very interesting read."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"i enjoyed the book alot.the man was the first triple threat acting,directing&amp;music.he could do it all.his movies were great.the characters &amp; stories were done really well.the book tells of his highs&amp;lows.i also enjoyed the film about his life.a must read.a true pioneer."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"The book came in perfect condition and my daughter said it was a page turner.

Nevertheless, it was a very interesting piece of history all about one of the 20th century's greatest actors.Here we are taken on Chaplin's very long tour from the London slums of his Victorian-Era childhood through the early Hollywood studios with The Keystone Kops and Mabel Normand, his lovely young co-star to his finally peaceful post-career days with his very last wife, Oona O'Neill at his beautiful home in Switzerland. And here he even paid a little respect to a few women who would haunt his memories like Lita Grey, his ill-fated second wife who was still passing her puberty at the time and Joan Barry, the vengeful hellcat who eventually dragged him to the court for paternity tests.Thus this is just one of the countless biographies all about the funny little man. Nevertheless - right behind Chaplin's comical mask is a great velvet-padded tiger sleepily reclining in the hot limelight - yet he is quite capable of suddenly lashing out to deal a painful, blood-tracing blow when sourly displeased."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"I remember one day I was sharing thoughts with this guy, who told me with sort of a mock on is face &quot;Chaplin is a great guy for all Cuban people&quot;. I couldn't quite get his point, but I knew he had been there more than once, not living as a tourist. This is my favorite book (other than techy|science ones), I have read it more than 10 times. I am glad to have the time to read the English version of it, after reading one of these Castro's &quot;Ediciones Revolucionarias&quot; ..., that also published The Autobiography of Malcolm X. To me it was neither about &quot;how he made it in Hollywood ...&quot;, nor about &quot;the troubled life of a genious&quot;, but it is about - what a difference a Mother can make -. I don't think that inheritance is only|primarily about genes. Each time I read this book I get blasted by his Mother's strong character, and integrity."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"I gave this as a gift and gave it 3 stars because book was damaged. We both love Charlie Chaplin and he wrote this book himself which is what makes it so important. The gift receiver is reading it now and says it's great, I shall read it after. Looked through it, it has great photos and I look forward to reading it. Was disappointed that although the book arrived shrink wrapped, I did not inspect it, and found after the gift was given and book unwrapped, the back cover of it was all smudged, like the ink was smudged right after printing somehow. With it being shrink wrapped I thought it would not be damaged and was so disappointed that this was a gift and it was like this. I guess I should have thoroughly inspected it and unwrapped it before I gift wrapped it and gave it. I don't like giving damaged gifts."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"It may as well have been subtitled &quot;Famous People Who Paid Obeisance to My Brilliance&quot;. Chaplin was brilliant, no doubt. I love his films and consider him one of the great artists of this century. This book merely confirms my view that great artists aren't exactly wonderful human beings. Chaplin doesn't make one mention of Rollie Totheroh in this book, for example, and doesn't even mention his second wife's name. (Her name was Lita Grey--some believe she was the inspiration for Nabokov's 'Lolita'-- and she only gave him his first two sons). Chaplin, his autobiography makes evident, was a man who could tolerate no one who could possibly pose a threat to his own image of himself as some kind of creative god; therefore he lists, name after name, Great People He Has Known and Who Have Admired His Holy Presence (Cocteau, Einstein, Churchill, etc.). Maybe this explains why he married 'women' who were too young and inexperienced to stand up to him and declare that he was an egotistical annoyance. I don't like this guy at all, needless to say, but was still fascinated by this autobiography, for the reason that I'm a silent-film buff and couldn't ignore him. Admire his work, but not the man."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"There are few books I do not finish and this was one of them. A fascinating, well-told story of his childhood turns into a tale of an ultimately lonely, self-centered man who thinks himself a genius (he was) unable to open his heart to others. The story of his successes (a long list of names who supposedly adored him) reads like a modern story of a well-paid CEO rather than an artist creating great films."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"This book is amazing. Chaplin's descriptions of the slums of London and early Holywood are great, they really transport the reader to the locations. Chaplin discusses his art, his beliefs, and his loves, as well as often just going off on tangents, spending pages describeing other comedians of the time and other interesting oddities. I highly reconmend this book to anyone who has any intrest in film making or anyone who wants to see these worlds that are long gone."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It allows the reader to see the world through Chaplin's mind. It offers insights to what he thought about things. He talks about his depression, thoughts on life, and so on. Anyone wanting to spend their time reading a great book should pick up this one."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"There was a lot more to Charlie Chaplin than what he wrote about in his autobiography. In several instances he would mention that a subject was touchy or self explanitory, and for that reason write very little of it. However, these are the most interesting aspects of his life. The book concentrates almost completely on Chaplin's personal aquantences, and despite how interesting and prestigeous they may have been, it just isn't worth putting into a book. Certainly worth reading though, for there is no better source for information on the begginings of Hollywood."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"I always knew Charlie Chaplin was a comic genius. However, after I read his book I realized he was more than that. He was an incredible man with a remarkable mind that didn't just apply to the silver screen. If he hadn't been a film star he could have been a great writer. His autobiography tells one of the greatest rags to riches stories ever. And he does it with beautiful, poetic prose. I can guarantee anyone who reads this book that they will love both the book and the man who wrote it. There never has been and never will be another man like Charles Chaplin."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Chaplin's autobiography is one of the most powerful I've ever read. Starting in almost indescribable poverty in London, his childhood was comparable to something out of a Dickens novel. Chaplin begins in show business as a child performer from a family struggling on the fringe of England's vaudeville circuit. His arrival in America at the birth of the film industry and his subsequent success both as an artist and a business man are just remarkable given his humble beginnings. Along the way he befriends and meets a veritable who's who of early 20th century celebrities from all walks of life and his descriptions of his vast circle of friends and acquaintances are one of the highlights of this book. These include actors, politicians, business people and scientists. ( Fairbanks, Pickford, Churchill, Hoover, Hearst, Einstein, etc.. etc.)Chaplin wrote this book at a time when tell all biography was not what it is today and while he shares some interesting perceptions about various personalities he is by today's standards quite discreet.I found this book incredibly interesting on a number of levels , First Chaplin himself is a very interesting character. Secondly, the other people who float in and out of his life are fascinating. Finally and perhaps most entertainingly for me are his descriptions of early Hollywood and the foundations of the movie industry.All of these factors added up to an amazing read and I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in movies or in early 20th century culture."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Charlie Chaplin's life story makes a real page-turner of a book. The misery of his first twelve years had me almost in tears; he lived with his mentally ill mother in an endless series of squalid rooms in the worst slums of Victorian London. They lived on pennies a week and he was eventually sent to a workhouse for over a year where the beatings were right out of Dickens. What a contrast to his later life! While traveling in a vaudeville show in the U.S. he was invited to Hollywood where he created the character of the tramp and rose to international fame and fortune.Chaplin writes in a very readable style, recounting the horrors and high points of his life with fascinating detail (except for his many love affairs and marriages which are barely mentioned). He socialized with royalty and traveled the world, yet he never forgot his humble beginnings. The book contains many personal photos and is highly recommended, especially for film fans."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Love it...........That man or rather when he was a boy worked so many jobs and moved around constantly, he sure had a lot of \\"ups and downs\\" as a child. Still reading the book, but I find it very fascinating.Really getting into the Silent film era, I wish more people would too. These marvels of the early movie industry are genius's.Thanks Again"},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"One of the best autobiographies written by a major talent. Thoughtful and poignient, it holds the reader's interest from start to finish with amusing anecdotes. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Charles Chaplin's autobiography is a wonderful history of the entertainment industry as it evolves from vaudeville to silent pictures to \\"talkies\\". You also get a personal side of history in general as you experience WWI, WWII, and other major events of the century through the eyes of well connected individuals. If you are looking for personal information on Mr. Chaplin, read another book. What Mr. Chaplin shares with you is how he went about his business and how the business evolved. He does give a personal account of his childhood in South London which he remembers in great detail and it is similar to Frank McCourt's childhood in Ireland. The difference for Chaplin is that he inherited his parents musical talent and got out early. Watch the video of his acceptance of his honorary Oscar in 1972 BEFORE you read the book! There you will see the personal side of Chaplin as he stands for the longest standing ovation in Oscar history."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Im gonna try not to give out what this book is actually about...besides that it is an autobiography.Chaplin lived his early life in the conditions of dire poverty. However, he almost from the cradle knew that he loved to perform in front of the audience. His natural talent coupled with the ability to charm even the most uncharmable of this world, divided by his love for (and to) work in his favorite field, produced a man, who was insistently no different from that poor kid, and yet who became a master in something....was it movie making? Perhaps that was one of his better known talents...."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Charlie Chaplin was always a sort of mystery to me. I never understood the political mystique, the teary-eyed love of all his fans, the emotional attachment. But I do now. He was a wonderful and courageous individual. He was human. He had weaknesses; he had loves. The story of his childhood in England and his mother was a Dickens novel in itself. I could hardly believe it. What a book. I thoroughly enjoyed it - from cover to cover.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\" A Novel"},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"What I wonderful book. I love Chaplin. He amazes me. I am 17. He is my hero. I have to say that he does go off a little on certain things, but they are very interesting topics. I have read this book many times. I am amazed by all the people he has meet through his life. He was very lucky. And the poeple who met him where very lucky, too. I have all his films, My Life In Pictures, and three other books written about him. All in all, it is a very fun read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"Before he became Sir Charles Chaplin, he was a young man raised by parents who were at one time, performers themselves. Born in 1889, he was the son of Charles and Hannah Chaplin. His father was not very attentive, his interests were more in women and liquor; Charlie and his half-brother lived with their mother who suffered from mental illness. Her illness and the loss of her singing voice caused them to live in poverty. Hannah eventually was committed to an asylum causing Charlie to be placed in a workhouse for paupers.In 1910, Charlie joined Fred Karno's acting troupe where he became aquainted with Stan Laurel who was his understudy for a short time. Through working for Karno, Charlie found his way to America.Charlie stayed in the US and went to work at Mack Sennett's Keystone Studio in late 1913 where Charlie found success as the Tramp. His success and professional aspirations led him to writing, producing, and directing his own film projects. In 1916, the Mutual Film Corporation presented Charlie with a large payment to produce 12 two-reel comedies. After his run at Mutual, he went to First National where he created full-length films including his hit film, The Kid. Chaplin also made popular films while at Essanay Film Studios.In 1919 Charlie, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W. Griffith founded United Artists in order to escape the heavy hand of film studios. U\\\\A was a place where artists could be artists and make their films without studio bosses interferring. Charlie went on to make many films of enormous popularity even to this very day.Chaplin was also a composer, writing the musical scores to his films.Charlie Chaplin is a controversial person because of his politics, his marriages, and female relationships. Chaplin paid taxes in this country, sold war bonds to help the Allies win WW1, created entertainment for millions, and stood against Hitler at a time when it was fashionable in Hollywood to revere the German dictator.J Edgar Hoover went after him after the Joan Barry incident and Hoover eventually had Charlie barred from re-entering the country that gave him so much, was his home, and the country to whom he gave his talent.Chaplin sold his home, his film studio to A&R; Records and moved to Switzerland. He paid his staff so that they would not be left without financial support and he also paid wages to some of his film staff until their dying day.Chaplin wrote his autobiography with a great deal of honesty. I believe that he made acknowledgment to his personal demons and flaws.This book is a great read and I recommend it to readers everywhere."},{"Title":"My Autobiography","review":"This book arrived quickly in time for Christmas.

I do caution you, however, to the fact that there are lots of big words throughout it so you may want a dictionary handy. And also, there are a lot of words throughout it that are only common in the UK back in the day, so I find myself stumbling a bit, wondering what certain words mean or equate to in the American English language. A good read nevertheless though.I think the book could have been written better in terms of format, sequence, etc....Chaplin jumps around A LOT and that makes it difficult to follow at times...I have to go back a few pages at times to remember what or who he is referring to or places and events, etc. It just doesn't flow properly imo.

Charlie did a great job writing this book."},{"Title":"Agricola and Roman Britain (Teach yourself history library)","review":"This is a very good book, though left it undeservedly obscure by the passing decades and written in a style that now seems old fashioned and just a touch sentimental. Not to mind. Burn tells an entertaining story well-packed with relevant historical detail. He is enthusiastic about his subject, who he clearly admires. This adds punch to his narrative. Burn is informed without being impersonal (part of what makes his style old fashioned.It is difficult for the general reader to find good modern accounts of Agricola's career. This book does the job. Aerial surveys and some dedicated digging have added a bit more to information available when Burn wrote (we know more about sites of Roman marching camps and forts, for example) but nothing essential in his narrative has been affected. Burn's account of Agricola's unusually extended tour of duty as governor of Britain (a full 6 years) and especially of the invasion of Scotland will tell most readers all they want to know. Indeed, Burn covers most of what there is to know.What if Agricola had succeeded in his life's ambition to conquer all of Highland Scotland and Ireland as well? Speculation on possible consequences is endlessly interesting. But the governor did not succeed. Agricola went a long way - his fleet accepted the submission of the Orkneys - and won a key battle but it was too little, too late. He was not given the necessary resources, which as Burn points out simply may not have been available. Another legion at the least would have been needed; instead troops were taken out of the far away island to deal with more important crises elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Future Church of 140 BCE","review":"It has often been said that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Bernard Lee takes this admonition one giant step further, implicitly asserting that history is in fact repeating itself within the Church; we just need to look backward to see what's ahead! His refreshingly prophetic look to the past sees a future church marked by the inclusion of laypersons along side clerics -- not just as outside contributors to discussion -- but as an integral part of the &quot;official&quot; guild of interpreters of Catholicism. He sees this paradigm shift as akin to the emergence of the Pharisees (laymen) in Judaism, a century and a half before Christ. (Believe it or not, they actually had some good qualities.) Lee makes a compelling case that a similar lay movement is already taking place in the American Catholic Church. The middle of the book (Chapters III through V) details what the author calls the &quot;pile up of revolutions&quot; over the past 450 years that have shaped our cultures and led to the development of the current &quot;hidden revolution&quot; in the Church. This part of the book is well researched among a variety of disciples and presented as supporting documentation. Like all such documentation, it is scholarly and considerably less provocative than the rest of the book. While it could have been reduced to just one chapter and still made his case effectively, it is, nonetheless, worth reading, as is the Bernard Loomer lecture &quot;Two Kinds of Power&quot; which is appendixed to the book. This is exciting stuff!!! &quot;Future Church of 140 B.C.E.&quot; is must reading for all Catholics (cleric and lay) who take seriously the presence of the Holy Spirit at work in the Church, and who expect to spend the rest of their faith-lives in the future."},{"Title":"Future Man: The Further Evolution of the Human Race","review":"\\"Future Man\\" by Chris Morgan deals with the biological, social, technological and mental changes that shape mankind. It is based on science, forecasting and imagination. The last few chapters deal with the future societies of mankind on the Earth, in space and the far distance future, where mankind is so alien it can no longer be called Homo sapiens sapiens.Do NOT confuse this book with \\"Future Man\\" by Brain Stableford.

At times elements seem to be deliberate mystification, stray plot elements are not resolved, and others seem to be resolved in a somewhat seat-of-his-pants way. Is THAT the end of Low Valley?!? Where is all this leading? I could wish that the story, which is set in semi-historical time, wove some real history into the plotline."},{"Title":"Taken By You (Indigo: Sensuous Love Stories)","review":"Thus far, Leila Chamberlain's structured life has been filled with trying to please family and church members while making a success of her day care business. Because her home sits above the day care, Leila's life has come under the watchful eyes of many of the church parishioners. The parents, staff and children all respect her, as they have seen no evidence of an immoral lifestyle. Despite the sometimes intrusive nature of some of the church members, she is driven to secure more collaboration in the community with churches to bring in more business. Little time or thought has been spent on developing personal relationships with the opposite sex.Reese McCoy has been consumed with making a success of his shipping company, especially since his bitter divorce where he ultimately lost a custody battle for his son. His aim is to eventually move his business closer to the east coast so he can be near his son and facilitate easier visitations. Being an ex-football player, Reese has certainly enjoyed his fair share of women, but his ex-wife has scarred him as far as seeking any emotional attachment from women.What Leila and Reese are not aware of is the manipulating going on in the background to get the two of them together. Their friends, Chi and Parker, are getting married in a week and are using the festivities to pair the two together and let nature take its course. Beginning with their meeting in the airport, it is obvious that Leila and Reese are taken with one another; however, there are also forces at work who desire to keep them apart at all cost.In her third book of the Ryan Family Collection, TAKEN BY YOU, Dorothy Elizabeth Love gives a touching portrayal of love between two individuals obviously smitten with one another, but having to overcome many setbacks and interferences to be together. I found the messages that Ms. Love conveys in this novel to be very appealing. She nicely covers how we can sometimes get so involved in pleasing others that we forget to do the same for ourselves and that it's okay for men to admit that they need love too. I thought the character development was great, and Ms. Love's writing was flawless. This final book in the collection is a story worth reading.Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbonof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Taken By You (Indigo: Sensuous Love Stories)","review":"Leila life has been filled with trying to please everyone but herself while making a success of her day care business (which is made up of 60% of church parishioners). Her home is above the day care center which places Leila's life under the watchful eyes of many of the church parishioners. The parents, staff and children all love and respect her to the fullest, as there's no evidence of an immoral lifestyle (because no time or thought is spent on developing personal relationships with the opposite sex).Reese is your all American alpha male and former NFL player that has been burned by an ex-wife who has custody of their son. He has been consumed with making a success of his shipping company. His aim is to eventually move his business closer to the east coast so he can be near his son for easier visitations. During the years, Reese has certainly enjoyed his fair share of the ladies. However, his ex-wife has scarred him from seeking any emotional attachment from women. But unbeknownst to Reese and Leila their best friends (Parker and Chi), who are scheduled to get married in a week, are manipulators scheming to bring them together (they are hilarious).Starting with their meeting at the airport, it is obvious that Leila and Reese are taken with one another. And their attraction can no longer be ignored when they are forced to share close quarters at Leila's place. But there are also others at work who desires to keep them apart at all cost. As the drama unfolds, will love conquer all? And even though they both have reasons to just give up, will they?I truly enjoyed this book, the characterization and storyline was very believable and on point. The best friends, Parker and Chi, and Parker's sister Patricia and her husband Mac, had me purchasing the other two books to get a take on their story. Even though you don't need the prequels to get an understanding of the characters, I'm positive that after reading this book you will want to purchase them also. I recommend this book without hesitation. Ms. Love you have been added to my list of best authors. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Taken By You (Indigo: Sensuous Love Stories)","review":"In \\"Taken by You\\" by Dorothy Elizabeth Love, Leila Chamberlain encounters a fascinating male specimen in Reese McCoy. Reese, the best man for the wedding of his best friend and surrogate brother Parker to Leila's good friend Chi, is also impressed with Leila. Their burgeoning attraction to each other can no longer be ignored when they are forced to share close quarters due to last minute wedding arrangements that leave Reese bunking at Leila's place.Unbeknownst to the two of them their soon-to-be wedded friends Parker and Chi suspect that sparks will fly and that a burning relationship will be soon ignited between Reese and Leila. What cannot be underestimated is the baggage that they are both dealing with. Leila has a very \\"involved\\" family - biological and church - that have strong opinions about everything from her business venture, a day care center, to her choices in men. Starting a new relationship, thus, won't be easy for her as she tries to balance her own desires with the restraints her family insists upon imposing upon her.Reese on the other had is trying to balance a post-professional football career in shipping with the unreasonable demands of trying to parent a child with an ex-wife who refuses to let him move on with his life. Resolute that he will come back to her, his ex-wife is determined to erect as many roadblocks as possible to his pursuing his interest in Leila.These complex factors set in motion an interesting set of interactions and events that keep the story moving along at a nice pace. A bit uneven in parts, particularly in Reese's interactions with his ex-wife, this is still an intriguing book with a lot to offer."},{"Title":"When You're a Fool: A Memoir of Sin and Redemption","review":"I wrote this book when I was a bit down on twelve step recovery, and that is the weakness of it. Otherwise, it's an interesting look at a conversion to Christianity, and a look at living with gynecomastia. I've never seen another book written on gynecomastia, or even one that mentions it. This one does.

This one is better. I really liked the step-by-step approach, the encouragement, the folksy attitude and exercises. It's like a mentor in a book. I gained clarity and lost some fears in the process."},{"Title":"Secrets of our spaceship moon (A Dell book)","review":"Unfortunately this book is old. However, old doesn't mean useless. It lays a groundwork of structural and gravitational data, quoting from published articles in lunar science journals as well as privately-obtained comments from various astronomers and scientists. Though one would expect that much more high-resolution imagery should be available by now, we should not forget that continuous-tone film is capable of very good resolution. The book includes a photo showing cast shadows suggesting the existence of towers not revealed by the overhead view.The seismic data alone is startling, especially the description of how the moon rang like a bell for four hours after being struck by a spent rocket. And then there's another clanking sort of seismic anomaly that occurs every month like clockwork and also defies explanation, Wilson writes.What was most intriguing to me was to learn that there were surviving hints from ancient Greek texts that the moon was hollow. Some classical authors even wrote that it was inhabited by \\"divine beings\\". These sources were known to, and believed by, early-modern astronomers such as Kepler and Galileo. His telescope observations were the first to confirm those ancient sources as saying there were mountains on the moon. And since Galileo's time, over a couple of centuries observers recorded and wrote about lights and moving objects on the moon that they'd seen in telescopes. So it's not as if the moon being inhabited or at least visited is a new idea.There is more about the moon that is unexplained (or withheld intentionally) than is explained by standard astronomy. Wilson says he started out expecting to gather some wacky ideas for an SF novel, but ended up becoming convinced that the Russian theory of an artificially-hollowed out moon with a metallic shell is plausible because it best explains all the observations that otherwise don't fit the idea of a naturally-formed satellite.If he is right, would people still go into a big panic (the usual justification for non-disclosure) to learn that there are already bases and intelligent beings on or inside our oversized satellite? I doubt it. Science fiction has been playing with this theme and variations on what sort of beings might be going back and forth to that nightlight-aka-mothership-in-the-sky for decades.More likely, I think more people would be disappointed than not to have independently-obtained confirmation that nobody is on the moon.I hope we find out someday."},{"Title":"Secrets of our spaceship moon (A Dell book)","review":"This book is one of the few books that cover the mysteries of the moon in any real detail. And the moon does have it's own mysteries, make no mistake. Why, for example, does the full moon cover the entire orb of the sun within 1% as viewed from earth? Or why is the moon hollow? Yes it is a mystery. Tests have concluded through ground penetration, that if not hollow, it has certainly a difficult to explain interior composition.These reasons alone are worthy of conjecture. This book certainly fills a serious void and asks questions that are not obvious to answer.Where it fails is in the supporting details. It could use an update, and it could use a great deal of technical information. It is not enough to offer conclusions, as the book has, based on the mysteries inherent with the moon. Rather, each mystery should be identified and described in detail. Then only at the very end of the book should conclusions and supporting evidence be presented.Aside from this glaring problem, the book is a easy read, if a bit repetitious. It covers a major mystery and one not easily answered. It is worthwhile, if only for it's uniqueness. If found, I would recommend it's purchase."},{"Title":"Poker: a Guaranteed Income for Life","review":"Who is the author of this book?Is he a \\"Special\\" Mystery Man?"},{"Title":"1910s (Take Ten Years)","review":"Young people need to be exposed to the events that shaped our modern world. In this book, the events of the years 1910 through 1919 are introduced through text and pictures. This is an era that is sorely overlooked in history classes. While recent years are of course foremost in our minds, there was more change in this decade than any other. The old order of Europe was completely removed, where monarchies dissolved to be replaced by republics, some of which were more dictatorial than the royal houses could ever have been.In Europe, World War I is still known as the great war, and it was without question the most popular war in history. Social forces were building and they all seemed to be vented in the initial call to battle. Millions of men enthusiastically marched off to war, only to be annihilated. While the war was the major event, the author also spends some time on the other stories of the decade. She is to be commended for including events such as the suffrage and birth control movements. It is possible to recognize the glimmers of modern life in some of the stories included among the major events.While it is of course impossible to cover such a momentous decade in 43 pages, I found the choice of stories to be an excellent microcosm of what was happening in that decade and I encouraged my children to read the book."},{"Title":"Journal Of The Vampire Hunter [1] Claws Of Darkness Volume 2 (Journal of the Vampire Hunter; Claws of Darkness) (v. 2)","review":"In the second volume of Journal of the Vampire Hunter: Claws of Darkness, we open with the half human/half vampire Bane fighting for his life against the ravaging beast who killed one of Gino Carlos' men in the first issue. It is only by the timely intervention of Anna, owner of the Azul Bar and Inn where Bane is staying, that the beast is driven away. Bane wonders what possible power that Anna could have over the beast as readers are treated to a grisly flashback where we meet Anna's fianc&eacute; Jubile and his sister and learn of the awful fate they suffered at the hands of Carlos' men some years earlier. Meanwhile Bane learns more about the town of Santa Ana, Mexico and confronts Anna's mother, a powerful vampire in a battle to the death.Writer/Artist Jerry Cho continues to spoon feed readers more and more about the Dark History of Santa Ana and its inhabitants. The reason behind Anna's melancholy is revealed with the tragic events concerning Jubile and his sister and we also learn the connection between this, and the sudden appearance of the creature who is hunting down Carlos' men. Cho's art continues to be some of the most dynamic that I've seen in quite some time. He deftly moves from scenes of quiet tranquility to visceral attacks with beautiful skill. The mesmerizing, gothic cover depicting a portrait of Bane with his piercing eyes will make readers pick this book up on the strength of that cover alone. Fantastic work, produced on high quality glossy stock that Cho's use of color takes advantage of fully. I cannot wait to see more!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Indoor Soccer: Tactics, Techniques & Teamwork","review":"This book is a good book for all coaches in general.It covers tactics that are good for both indoor and outdoor soccer.

It is also about the death of the balance of power and the decline of both France and Austria-Hungary. The focus of the book is what leaders were thinking, how they pursued their goals, and the outcome of their machinations and wars, most petty, some major. This approach (diplomatic history) contrasts sharply with analytic or narrative histories whose principal aims include the search for broad trends, the interpretation of deeper causes, and portraits of culture and everyday life. Instead, here, you get what the powerful were trying to do, literally from moment to moment. For myself, while fascinating in many aspects and essential, I found it pretty dry as a reading experience.The beginning of the period, in the wake of the 1848 revolutions, marks the end of a long period of \\"revolutionary diplomacy\\", whereby the ideals of the French Revolution influenced many diplomatic actions. Napoleon III seized power and concentrated on more traditional balance of power diplomacy, as head of the most powerful nation-state at the time. The Brits were content to develop on their own, only stepping into continental entanglements when they could no longer avoid it. Russia, Austria-Hungary and Turkey were in perhaps terminal decline, though clinging to the perquisites of power in their respective multi-ethnic autocracies, in which nationalistic ambitions of an astonishing array of players were threatening them with territorial dissolution. In the effort to unify the country, Italy was having its own revolution. The great wild card was Prussia, at the beginning of the period a small kingdom that, under the leadership of a strategic genius, Bismarck, was slowly consolidating its hold over a vast territory of Germanic speakers; it was a nation in birth, a coming industrial superpower with a huge population that would irrevocably shatter the balance of power.Until 1870, these powers struggled for the typical fruits of the time: gaining territories, trade rights, and any number of privileges or concessions from each other. The complexity of these concerns is daunting and almost without exception obscure, but they were indeed the principal concerns of the leaders of the time. When disputes reached a certain point of impasse, they were often resolved by small-scale war, giving the victor the spoils of whatever was demanded, be it passage into and out of the Black Sea, domination of Poland, or control of the Suez Canal for trade with Asia. The book attempts to cover every single one of these disputes, showing exactly what was contemplated in chronological succession and the what happened in the end. Some readers seem to like this detail, and the gist is important to understand, but a lot of it is historical trivia of little interest, at least in my estimation.Each power was juggling so many interests that the whole is like a dark forest of thorny complexities, obscure secret agreements, and tenuous alliances of mutual benefit. It was like they were all playing chess on the same board - some controlling the major pieces, some smaller ones, all in potential conflict or cooperation at one time but not another. Another analogy that comes to mind is competing LEGO constructions in a limited space, each player endowed with its own array of pieces that they traded and fought over or used collaboratively.Beyond the petty wars (to 1870), there were 3 major engagements that led to decisive consequences. 1) The Crimean War removed Russia as a top-tier player until after WWII. 2) The Prussian victory over Austria-Hungary reduced the latter, with all its ethnic divisions, to a dependent power, ratifying German domination of central EUrope. 3) In 1870, France also fell from the top tier, when it capitulated to Prussia after a brief war.The Conference of Berlin led to the longest period of peace in Europe since the Roman Empire. Over the next 40-odd years, European diplomats played the game of the balance of power, all the while investing in the new determinants of power: commerce, heavy industry (in particular steel production), and military technology; they avoided outright war. The two greatest achievers in this realm were Great Britain (with its mechanized navy) and Germany (split between navy and ground forces), leaving others behind in one or more areas. They created innumerable systems of alliances, peacekeeping, and trade, but all for the traditional parochial reasons. It should be noted that many of their motivations were face-saving and for appearance and prestige, for they had to take public opinion increasingly into consideration. This added to inflexibility.The outbreak of WWI is part of a long discussion in the book. This was one of the most interesting dissections of diplomatic detail that I have ever read. According to Taylor, the bottom line was that the various powers thought the war would be short and decisive. Germany wanted to dominate Europe and thought it could do so by aggrandizing its territories. France, Russia, and Great Britain feared this and hoped to preserve the balance of power to their advantage. Austria Hungary and Turkey wanted to maintain the integrity of their territories from splitting into ethno-linguistic nation states. Oddly, none of the major powers seemed to have any clear goals, backup plans, or even coherent strategies, but went into it as a way to impose solutions to their advantage by force rather than diplomacy - that is, the way things had been done prior to 1870, but with far more advanced military machines that mobilized not just whole populations but industrial economies. Once started, no one could back down and it became a catastrophic war of attrition, bringing in the USA and ending the era of EUropean domination of the world. That brings us to 1918.I believe Taylor's interpretation of the European modus operandi - the fight to maintain yet disrupt the balance of power - is correct. What I missed was a lively narrative with biographical texture and descriptive detail. I know that that is not part of the strict discipline of diplomatic history, but potential readers should be aware of this.Recommended. It is a fundamental text, but something of a chore to read."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"I have read this three time. One was in F.7. One was in university. One was two months ago!! It is a good book!!! Professor Taylor not only utilises plenty of official documents but also develop a very critical standpoint on the historical development of Europe between 1848 and 1918. His view get me a new aspect to study the European history.More than that, his view could break the traditional angle of European historical studies (i.e. Professor David Thomson's ideas).So I love this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"El Prof. Taylor, de Oxford ,ha escrito una pieza maestra. Por decadas sera leido y recordado con furor. El libro es ameno y de facil comprension. Su estilo brillante y claro ha hecho historia en si mismo. Un libro para releer."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"What A. J. P. Taylor's The Struggle for Mastery in Europe suffers from in being nearly fifty years old, it more than makes up for in style. It is a riveting book that is smattered with wit and an author's thorough knowledge of his subject. Alternate titles might have been The Struggle to Prevent the Mastery of Europe, or the Decline and Fall of the Balance of Power.Taylor's unyielding faith in diplomacy reflects a Cold War notion that any political problem can be solved by maintaining a diplomatic balance. He deftly navigates the Byzantine web of diplomatic intrigue to show how negotiations, not war, ultimately resolves crises. His whig interpretations are at times blatant. Conservative Russia and Prussia are often &quot;humiliated&quot; and &quot;old fashioned&quot; while liberal France fell victim to its own &quot;ingenuity&quot; or suffered &quot;shattered prestige.&quot;Not all events are treated equal. The 1867 Anschloss or the 1894 Dreyfus Affair receive practically no attention, while obscure diplomatic conventions receive detailed analysis. Great leaders like Napoleon III or Bismarck receive Taylor's praise while British statesmen of lesser stature receive criticism. Taylor is also anti-imperial, stating that colonies are a sign of weakness (though he later seems to suggest the opposite). His treatment of the coming of World War One is perhaps his greatest weakness, or perhaps this is where the book is most dated. He seems to be somewhat surprised that war erupted in the face of diplomatic failure. He fails to see that many at the time lost faith in diplomacy and allowed the war to happen.In the end, though, this is a fine work. Taylor interjects personal philosophies throughout the book. &quot;Men learn from their mistakes how to make new ones (p. 111);&quot; &quot;Once men imagine a danger they soon turn it into a reality (p. 450); and &quot;A historian should never deal in speculations about what did not happen&quot; (p. 513) are but a few examples. (This last is a personal favorite as it flies in the face of alternative history.) Clever recto page headings and use of dates keep the reader aware of what is happening, and Taylor is a master of the semi colon. All in all this remains a very informative work."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"I think what made me start loving Alan Taylor is the passage from &quot;Struggle&quot; about Louis Napoleon's government being &quot;run by gangsters&quot;. After a lifetime of school histories unwilling to venture a judgement, scrupulous in their aridness, this was a revelation.Taylor suffered ostracism for his outspoken views, especially from Oxford, where his trampling of sacred cows prevented him from gaining a professorship. On the other hand, his rival, Hugh Trevor-Roper, played the Tory historian and prospered. (It was, of course, Trevor-Roper who staked his reputation as an historian on the authenticity of the fraudulent Hitler diaries of 1983, hopefully giving Taylor the last laugh. But being an establishment historian, Sir Hugh was immunized from serious career consequences.)If you want to understand the century past, you must begin in the century previous, in about 1848. When Taylor deposits you in 1918, you will be on secure footing while reading his, &quot;Origins of the Second World War&quot; or Ian Brendon's &quot;Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s,&quot; leading you in turn to WWII, which brings the nineteenth century to a close in 1945. It is said that Alan Taylor liked paradox. I wonder how he liked this one."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"A. J. P. Taylor's The Struggle for Mastery in Europe is the book to start reading about those 70 crucial years in Europe's history.The book begins with the Revolutions of 1845, that's why it would be a good thing to have some knowledge regarding the Napoleonic Wars and its outcome (Treaty of Metternich). Taylor analyses the out coming system of the Balance of Power that governed European diplomacy until War World I. According to This system, the five great powers (England, Prussia, Austria, Russia and the defeated France) would balance each others force, avoiding the out come of war.The system worked pretty well until the fall of Bismarck. That is because Bismarck, as his successor once said, knew how to \\"play with three balls at the same time\\". He could keep Russia and Austria tied to Germany at the same time. Thus, France was checked. Nevertheless, when Germany didn't renewed its treaty with Russia the obvious move was Russia's alliance with France.It could be said that by 1885 the outcome of a Great War was a matter just of time. The system of alliances so well designed by Metternich and so well understood and curried out by Bismarck was at the same time the cause of War World I. Without a great politician as Bismarck nobody could make Metternich's system work.All through his book, Taylor explains what I have just summarized in a really better way. I highly recommend the lecture of this great book."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"A. J. P. Taylor's book is the sine qua non for university students of European history. This is the real deal: Taylor was a genuine historian who never went further than his facts--and his facts are incredibly well researched, well documented, and bountiful. This is true historiography: the way history ought to be done! Plus, Taylor writes very well, in a lively and entertaining fashion. He has good language, wit, and trenchant observations.It must be noted that this is a history of diplomacy--with some political and military of necessity treated. What does this mean? Well, it means that the characters of Taylor's book are mostly forgotten professional diplomats, and therefore most of their names won't be familiar to those unschooled in modern European history--Bismarck and Disraeli excepted. But this esoterica only increases the value of Taylor's work; for it reveals these forgotten characters to us once again: a gem of historical literature."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"This is A.J.P.

This sprawling tale of folly and pretension is informed by Taylor's exhaustive reading of the official foreign affairs correspondence of the respective nations involved, as well as his own mastery of modern European history. His prose is consistently edged with wit on the verge of sarcasm, always keen to the absurd roots of tragedy. For Taylor there are no sacred cows: every class, every institution, every political party, even cynicism itself fumbles in the dark, toiling under the weight of its illusions and contradictions. One does not emerge from this book with an enhanced respect for statesmen, generals or revolutionaries. This is one of the few history books I plan on reading at least twice."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"Taylor successfully tackles a sprawling, detailed subject -- seventy years of byzantine European diplomacy that set the stage for the First World War and, not so indirectly, the Second.

By doing so, I learned a lot from this book."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"A.J.P. Taylor (1906-1990) wrote THE STRUGGLE FOR MASTERY IN EUROPE: 1848-1918 in 1960. This book makes the diplomatic connections and clearly explains the causes and effects of European diplomacy history at a time when the Europeans experienced political revolutions industrial revolutions, etc. Taylor connected the economic changes and diplomatic tensions in a readable style that is unmatched.Taylor began this book with the 1848 revolutions and the attempts at national unity in Central Europe (Germany, the Slavic peoples, etc.) Taylor clearly showed the tensions that frustrated Italian national unity. What the crowned heads and diplomats feared was that nationalism and unity would come from \\"below\\" rather than from the \\"conservative\\" European political leaders who feared the masses yet had to take the masses into account re poltical and diplomatic decisions. Taylor showed how Napoleon III (1852-1870) was able to take advantage of the June Days (1848) in France only to blunder in diplomatic endeavors. As Taylor noted, Napoleon III was too much of a dreamer and was to cautious of an adventurer.Taylor carefully treated the diplomatic tenions in the late 1840s-1850s. The Russians feared Magyar or Hungarian unity as well as that of the Polish. Czar Nicholas II (1825-1855)and his advisers feared was that the Russians would be more of an Asian political entity than a European power. What the Russian political leaders did not fully realize was that the Russian political and military systems were too weak for the Russians to realize their diplomatic ambitions. Czar Nicholas II took the Russians into the Crimean War (1854-1855)ostensibly over Russian Orthodox and French Catholic access to the Holy Places which were in Turkish controlled Palestine. As Taylor noted, Napolean III was looking for glory in confronting the Russians, but Napolean III needed British help, an ally, to confront the Russians. Czar Nicholas II had a better claim re the Holy Places than Napoleon III did simply because the Czar was the official protector of the Russian Orthodox Church, and Napolean III had no such claim to the Catholic Church. The British simply saw a chance to further hinder Russian ambitions re the Turkish Straits and Russian direct access to the Mediterrean Sea. As noted in this book, the Crimean War demonstrated weaknesses of the belligerents and most glaring the weakness of the Russians who never learned.Taylor next dealt with Italian unification. The Italian leaders, especially Count Cavour (1810-1861)knew the Italians could not dislodge the Hapsburgs from Northern Italy without an ally. Napolean III attempted to resurrect French greatness by allying the French with the Italians. Even in victory, Napoleon III blundered, The Italians \\"kept their end of the bargain\\" only to be disappointed that Napoleon III refused the let the Italians have Venetia and Rome.Taylor's treatment of German unification was well done. William I (1862-1888) and Otto von Bismarck (1815-1899) were able to manipulate the Danes into a war vs. the Prussians (the Northern Germans) and the Hapsburghs who easily defeated the Danes in 1863. As Taylor noted, Bismarck undermined the Hapsburgs and Prussian forces defeated them in the Seven Weeks War (1866). The French and Napoleon III managed to isolate themselves without accounting for their diplomatic and military weakness. Bismarck tricked the French into starting the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871)which was a disaster for the French and completed German unification. Readers should note that the French and British were preoccupied with the U.S. Civil War and French designs in Mexico ended in 1870. Taylor should have emphasized these events.As readers may know, after the Franco-Prussian War Bismarck knew that peace could be kept as long as the Russians were placated in Eastern Europe and the French were isolated. Bismarck's \\"system\\" was threatened when the Balkan people rebelled against the Turks in 1875-1876. The Europeans urged the Turks to make reforms to defuse a potential disaster, but the Turks responded by committing The Bulgarian Massacres which outraged the Europeans and led to the Russo-Turkish War. Bismarck knew the potential danger of the Germans being drawn into a war he did not want. To paraphrase Bismarck, the Balkans were not worth one Pomeranian solider. When the Turks were defeated and the Bulgarians got a seaport on the Mediterranain Sea, the British and Hapsburgs opposed the settlement. The British would not tolerate the Russians having access to seaport by proxy via the Bulgarians. Bismarck quickly moved to renegotiate the Treaty of San Stafano to avoid war.Many Europeans thought the time of perpetual peace and prosperity had occured after 1878. Bismarck knew better and knew that the Germans could maintain peace by skilled diplomacy. Taylor gave a solid detailed account of Bismarck's secret alliances with the Hapsburgs, Italians, and Russians. Bismarck pledeged German DEFENSIVE alliances and neutrality to the point that no one could act without the Germans. Readers should note that European and U.S. imperialism deflected European energy. Bismarck, as Taylor noted, was a diplomatic genius.When William II (1888-1918)came to power, Bismarck was dimissed, and his system gradually collapsed. As Taylor noted Bismarck's successors were not nearly as astute as Bismarck. This obviously led to W.W. I, which led to German defeat. Taylor made an interesting comment that the Germans involvement in W.W. I was not due to bad policy. It was due to no policy, and the less able German diplomats and leaders were unaware of the dynamics of European diplomacy. What may have made total war possible was the fact that crowned heads and skilled diplomats did not push for war as much as the masses pushed for war.The Russians who appeared never to learn anything about their own weakness were in part to blame. They were easily defeated in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905)which sent shock waves througout Russia and Europe. The Russians should have realized just how bad their system was and how weak they were. They never learned this until defeat in W.W. I.Taylor concluded this book with the fact that while the Germans were defeated in Western Europe, the Germans won W.W. I vs the Russians and extracted the Treaty of Brest-Listov in 1918. Taylor noted that W.W. I ended any European Balance of Power simply because the Americans were the \\"new players on the block.\\"Taylor wrote a comprehensive book. Readers who examine this book will have a better understanding of how diplomacy is conducted and recognize folly and blunders. This book undermines popular textbook versions of diplomatic history which rarely if ever \\"come to grips\\" with diplomatic history. A.J.P. Taylor's other books that deserve mention are THE ORGINS OF WORLD WAR II, THE HAPSBURG EMPIRE, etc. Anyone interested in careful scholarship and good written expression will benefit from these books."},{"Title":"The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918","review":"This is A.J.P.

This is only one aspect of history, but in fact this book is an excellent guide to 19th century Europe overall, or its second half, and it has enough about economic and political developments to be readable as a general work. It is also extremely entertaining, both in a gossipy kind of way and because Taylor isn't afraid of going through the strategic intricacies of each situation. Don't be discouraged by the length; this is extremely readable.

Mister Miracle is Jack Kirby's super-escape artist character.The first volume was tied more tightly with his \\"Fourth World Series\\" (New Gods, Mister Miracle, Forever People and to a much lesser degree his run on Jimmy Olsen).By the time most of the stories for this second volume came out the other Fourth World titles were cancelled or on the verge of being so. The Demon and Kamandi were in the works.Mister Miracle was being aimed at more conventional super hero fare (or at least as conventional as Kirby could make it). This is not to say the stories are bad, just different from the earlier part of the run.Of note is the introduction of Shiloh Norman who would become Mister Miracle's apprentice and latter in the comics assume the role of Mister Miracle (as he may do again this year, 2005, in a Grant Morrison Maxi Series).Mike Royer provides the inking for the stories in this volume and his stong line compliments Kirby's pencils rather well.Why only four stars, its the black and white. These books were meant for color, but then again the price can't be beat.But don't worry too much, the last story in the volume is the wedding of Scott (Mister Miracle) Free and Barda and the entire cast of the New Gods shows up to make it a wedding slug fest in the grand tradition of Kirby's Fantastic Four Wedding. The very last panels are like something out of Shakesphere and are well worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"Jack Kirby's Fourth World: Featuring: Mister Miracle","review":"This is the final part of a four-part series of black and white trades collecting Jack Kirby's New Gods, Forever People and Mister Miracle. The three titles, which Kirby was writing, drawing and editing himself, where meant to be a grand space opera concluding with a great showdown between Orion and and his father Darkseid. But after the first two series were cancelled by DC, only Mister Miracle was left and the story was simplified so that it focused more on Mister Miracle's life on earth. This trade collects the second half of the Mister Miracle title which Kirby did. Dispite a simpler story, I think its better that the Mister Miracle trade but not as good as the Forever People and New Gods, which is clearly the best.Some new villains are introduceed and Darkseid and his gang make an appearance, but clearly the most important part is the blossoming of the relationship between Big Barda and Mister Miracle. It seems that Kirby was planning to develop this relationship slowly but wasn't given enough time. Still, it wasn't a bad issue at all."},{"Title":"Jack Kirby's Fourth World: Featuring: Mister Miracle","review":"In this volume, you will find the second half of the original Mr. Miracle. As the rest of his \\"Fourth World\\" saga was being shut down by the powers that be at DC, Jack Kirby tried in vain to keep \\"Mr. Miracle\\" afloat. With the exception of the last issue, the comics included in this collection follow the more traditional comic book stories as opposed to the epic mythology of the Fourth World adventures. This is a fun collection despite the conclusion of the series. Mr. Miracle develops as a character and so does his love interest Big Barda and his sidekick Oberon. Kirby's inclusion of a young boy to help Mr. Miracle's adventures, while having consequences down the road in the DC universe, does not particularly help the book along. The series concludes with one of the most powerful endings in comics as characters face love, cheer, sorrow and fear in the course of a few pages. While there are a few conventional superhero stories included here, what stands out is the closing of Kirby's Fourth World. Be warned. This book is black and white. If you want to see this saga in color, you will have to pay a bit more and take a look at the Fourth World Omnibus that DC released. I can not say this took away from my enjoyment of this excellent collection but I focus more on plot and character development than comic art so I can not speak for everyone."},{"Title":"Jack Kirby's Fourth World: Featuring: Mister Miracle","review":"I am waiting for Mark Evanier and the folk's at DC to realize Jack Kirby's Fourth World isn't complete without the DNA Project, Intergang, Dabney Donovan, the Evil Factory and ... well, the list goes on.

Jaeger traces this fact from Homeric times through Plato and explains it through many outstanding writers such as Hesiod, Solon, Sophocles, and many more. He shows the powerful Ideals of the greeks in all their beauty which continue to live on in the world today. He reveals how Poetry, Philosophy, Rhetoric, Politics, Medicine, etc. have their basis in the quest to reach the highest standard imaginable for man and society. The space contributed to Plato is subtantial and the first volume is really only an intro to Plato by the authors own admission. That's a four hundred page intro! But it all leads to the greatest of inventions...Philosphy. I enjoyed the whole book, but the second volume &quot;the search for the divine center&quot; was the best part explaining many things about Plato. To understand in greater depth the influence of these ideals on the western world I recommend reading a book (which I read first) called &quot;The Classical Tradition&quot; by Gilbert Highet whom is also the translator of this book. That book reveals how most of the surviving great works throughout western history were written by authors who were well aware of the greek world and their ideals including many writers in the Christian tradition. Jaeger wrote a short book called &quot;Greek Paideia and Early Christianity&quot; which shows that connection very well. He has convinced me beyond doubt of his statement that the ancient greeks are the educators of the western world."},{"Title":"Paideia : the ideals of Greek culture","review":"That is the question that burned in the hearts of those Greeks, who by their own excellence, or ARETE, made lasting contributions to humanity's imagination about being fully human. Just to add a few words to those reviews below:This is one of those books that simply cannot go out of print as all who have read it and learned from will not let that happen. It's that important! No study of anything Greek would be complete without reading this book. The mesmerizing power that the ancient Greeks continue exert on all intelligent persons everywhere is summed up in their formulation of PAIDEIA, and the manner of their ASKESIS (discipline involved in forging one's true self) in embodying it. Read it well and this book will cleanse you of the muck of modern education, especially of the public kind, and help you think more nobly. That is to say, clearly."},{"Title":"Paideia : the ideals of Greek culture","review":"Chalk me up as another mesmerized reader. Paideia will take you back to the beginnings of Western Civilization to examine how the Greeks conceived of excellence or arete and the disputes that arose as the new definition ran into the old definitions. Plato is the anchor of the three volumes, and Jaeger treats him with a sense of awe, while I found his ideas as listed in \\"The Republic\\" unnerving.The find of the books for me was Isocrates, the master of rhetoric and a hypochondriac who almost lived to 100. The stories of Isocrates and Demonsthenes renewed by interest in the study of rhetoric. Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Socrates, they are all here. Overall a fantastic trilogy."},{"Title":"Paideia : the ideals of Greek culture","review":"I really like the way Jaeger presents the philosophy of especially Socrates and Plato along with Aristotal and other notable Greek philosophers in context of their times and culture. Jaeger does an excellent job of analyzing the main points of Socrates and Plato including his own insights as well as the thoughts of and influence on other historical philosophers. I especially liked how Jaeger brought Plato's works into focus as a whole with common philosophial questions being developed by the works as a whole. The book is fasinating if you are interested in questions like, \\"How should men be governed?\\" and \\"What part does virtue have in politics and education?\\" It is amazying to see how much careful thought went into questions like these in ancient times and how they are still being debaited today. You can sence an historic split between the spiritual and material views of life.The concepts presented are well explained for those casually interested in philosophy but done so with a large vocabulary, lots of Greek words and assumes that you read the first book (which I did not). I found that a good dictionary and a bit of research online (for Greek words)was sufficent to allow a rewarding understanding of the material presented."},{"Title":"Paideia : the ideals of Greek culture","review":"A history of early Greek culture prior to the fall of Athens is the main focus of Jaeger&#8217;s first volume. As Jaeger states in the preface &#8220;literature is the chief concern of this book, which is intended to describe the paideia (culture) of the Greeks, and, at the same time, the Greeks themselves as the paideia of mankind.&#8221; Jaegers intention in this three volume work is skillfully carried out.Jaeger covers the early Greek development of their concepts of the ideal pattern of behavior as well as the basic accepted mores of Greek society; not only of the nobility, but the peasantry as well. The source for the day to day life of the peasant is mostly derived from Hesoid&#8217;s account - Works and Days. He introduces the term arte, which he explains initially had more to do with the concept of valor - but he follows the changing understanding of arte as it came to reflect a different ideal over time. The concept of justice is likewise developed in the same manner. Jaeger seems to immolate the path of Hegel&#8217;s historical method as a revealing of a progressive evolutionary path, as such the developmental nature of the evolution of the Greek culture is developed in a historical context.Not only is Athens dealt with in detail from a cultural perspective but the contrast with Sparta&#8217;s diverse cultural norms is also. Included is coverage of the effects of the sophistic movement on education, as well as the significance of Euripides and other tragic poets on the Greek society. There is not much that escapes Jaeger&#8217;s vision in terms of impact on the expression of culture in ancient Greece.Highly recommend to any having an interest in the history of Greece and its enduring impact on Western culture."},{"Title":"Paideia : the ideals of Greek culture","review":"Try as I might, I can only find the final volume of this masterwork available for Kindle.Where are the other two volumes?Back to the paperback for me..."},{"Title":"Paideia : the ideals of Greek culture","review":"I have read the Paideia in paper back and found it to be an incredible window on the ancient greek mind and spirit.

Long before that day, Karen Kruse knew the character of fire fighters and what it takes to join their ranks. In her book &quot;A Chicago Firehouse,&quot; she tells of the hearts and souls of all fire fighters. Yes, it's the tale of one firehouse, but that firehouse captures the spirit of firehouses across America and throughout our history. As Karen presents fire fighting, she defines familiar words and terms we thought we knew. The book is highlighted with dazzling photography from aged newspapers and Karen's own camera. Her unique perspective of growing up in a fire fighting family brings a loving touch to a moving story. Here's a tribute every fire fighter would love to own."},{"Title":"A Chicago Firehouse: Stories of Wrigleyville's Engine 78 (IL) (Voices of America)","review":"I loved reading what to me was a love story from a proud daughter to her fireman father.

Having read a large number of firematic books over the years , it compares very favorably to most if not all first efforts.

In writing as elegant as it is clear, Mumford makes plain the death urge that has always underlain civilization, which Mumford calls &quot;the machine,&quot; and later &quot;the megamachine.&quot; This is a social structure organized not around any organic human needs, but around the &quot;needs&quot; of the machines that have come to characterize and control our lives. These are crucial, incisive, devastating books. I cannot praise them highly enough."},{"Title":"The Myth of the Machine-The Pentagon of Power","review":"Nobody writes like this anymore. I hadn't expected the eminent urban historian to write such a brilliant paranoiac tract against the System and Established Order. Although often redundant, Mumford makes a heroic attempt at explaining the current problems of our times, with roots in the Middle Ages, and perhaps even the Age of the Pyramids. He echoes contempories like Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm and Marshall McLuhan, but instead of taking a Marxist, psychological or media perspective, he takes the more general view of an urbanist. The arguments are quite paralell, although considerably more holistic at times. One recognizes critiques that were earlier or later articulated by not only Marxists, but also feminists, environmentalists, and anti-Imperialists. There are also anticipations of the New Age Movement! (See Fitjof Capra's &quot;the Turning Point.&quot;)In short, this massive volume impressively combines much historical and cultural material in its critique of Modern Western Civilization. Although the tone of the book is quite bleak -- we would all appear to be trapped in this Megamachine, the High Technology of the Power Elites -- one also senses a hope towards last chapters that an alternative is possible. He seems to suggest a New Age style withdrawal, rather than any kind of organized resistance.

Make no mistake, the author is an ardent feminist. Where this book is a masterwork of criticism is in how it shows how anti-Jewish theology, sometimes centuries old, has innervated modern feminist analysis of the bible. The book starts with an introduction that makes the book worthwhile for any student of German or Jewish history, where the author describes her discovery of the atrocities committed by an older relative, and how the family sought to deny it. This watershed moment triggers her re-evaluation of her studies, and her discover of the insipid anti-Semitism that fills the work of many biblical scholars who work in the feminist arena. Goddess theology, views of Israelite religion, Christian feminism, these and more pass through von Kellenbach's filters. This book is the record of her search for a better feminist view of the Hebrew bible and a more accurate view of the Ancient Near East that incubated it. She does not seek to deny feminist readings, rather, she brings to light the flaws of scholarship that anti-Judaism has brought to such readings. The book is a work of literary scholarship, and is not in the &quot;for dummies&quot; format, so it is less than perfectly accessible. Some knowledge of the field of secular biblical scholarship and feminist thought is needed to understand some of the more complex points. Overall, the book addresses a serious issue in biblical scholarship, and it bridges many areas of study. If you are looking for either exultation or condemnation of Feminist views on bible, you have the wrong book. If you want to take the next step in your study of modern biblical scholarship, or you seek to build a better feminism, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The 13 Biggest Mistakes Parents Make and How to Avoid Them","review":"This book is a great tool for parents both young and old.

The rendering of Oregon's history and geography is too far removed from the truth for a novel that is supposed to be a fanciful tapestry of Oregon's history and geography--it's so fanciful as to merely annoy. The characters are not well-developed and are cartoonish. I can stand fantasy sequences (loved Dickens's Little Dorrit), but this endless ramble exhausted my patience. I kept waiting to reach the good part. I should have given up after the first 100 pages.H. L. Davis is a little-known and under-appreciated author whose works are not of even quality.

They have both contributed extensively to the theoretical &quot;foundations&quot; of GP and hence may speak with no small degree of authority about GP theory. As a physicist working in EC I like the balance that the authors have struck between mathematical rigor and understandable intuition. The book is not as rigorous as Vose's well known GA book. However, it is much easier to read. Neither does it take the &quot;engineering&quot; rule of thumb approach, as does Goldberg's book for instance. It covers very well recent important developments in the theory of GP and in that sense makes very good reading for anyone with a serious interest in EC theory. It is not for the novice, even though technically it is not a difficult book. It is really a research monograph and not a textbook. In that sense the title is a little bit misplaced. With the exciting direction the authors are pointing in I believe that in five years time another book of the same title should truly be able to lay out what are the foundations of GP theory and also show the theoretical unity that exists between the different branches of EC."},{"Title":"Foundations of Genetic Programming","review":"This book was published in 2002 to provide a survey of the direction research had taken in the field of Genetic Programming.

Chapter 2 discusses the problems with the fitness landscape. Chapter 3 - 6 discusses various schema theory approaches and proofs. Chapter 6 has a great explanation of effective fitness.There are numerous theorems and proofs in the book. There are informative examples of the max problem and the artificial ant (Santa Fe Trail) problems. Chapter 11 is about how GP convergences are a tricky matter and how subtrees can hide interesting incidences of convergence.This is not an introductory text, it is intended for graduate level or higher readers. There is much theoretical work here and a limited background in this area will result in limited understanding of the material."},{"Title":"Foundations of Genetic Programming","review":"Langdon and Poli do a fantastic job of summarizing the major theoretical results of genetic programming. The first chapter gives a quick and clear introduction to genetic programming. They continue with a comprehensive summary of previous research in schema theory, and then they present their exciting theoretical results. Their description of an exact schema theorem (microscopic and macroscopic) for GP is a bit dense, but they provide a good discussion of how to interpret these results. As a whole, this book is generally easy to follow, even with little prior exposure to genetic programming. Of course, this book is not intended to be a general introduction to genetic programming (one of John Koza's books would be more appropriate), but instead it is intended to present some of the theoretical foundations of the field."},{"Title":"Foundations of Genetic Programming","review":"This book can be usefully read along with a companion text by the same publisher - \\"Introduction to Evolutionary Computing\\".

A very useful metaphor of what you'll be attempting to do, as a researcher. However, the authors carefully point out the limitations of this idea.

The books that Webb gives consideration to are Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther.Webb's approach with this book is clearly spelt out in the introduction. He wants to examine the books from a biblical theology farmework. (The following is a quote from the book.)&quot;What is necessary here is for me to make clear the kind of biblical theology to which I am personally committed and will practise in the following chapters...Its focus is on the unity of Scripture, while doing full justice to its diversity. The key to this unity in diversity is found in the gospel preached by Jesus and his apostles, to which the New Testament bears witness. This gospel is everywhere anchored in the Old Testament, of which it is seen to be the fulfilment. In short, the kind of biblical theology that will be practised here is an evangelical one, not just in the sense that (some) evangelicals practise it, but in that it derives its rationale from the evangel (the gospel) itself.&quot; (p.15)The examination of each of the Old Testament books is divided into 3 sections: I. The first section is an attempt to let the book speak for itself. II. The second step is to examine the book within the wider Old Testament framework. III. Finally the book is examined in light of the &quot;New Testament gospel with its basic \`promise and fulfilment' structure&quot; (p.16).Webb offers some great insights into the text of each of the books while at the same time engaging contemporary scholarship. While demonstrating a great sensitivity to the text, Webb provides us with some wonderful insights - allowing the text to speak for itself, and allowing us to clearly hear what the text is saying. This book had me opening my Bible and reading with a greater clarity these five books."},{"Title":"Five Festal Garments: Christian Reflections on the Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Surprisingly helpful. Don't be put off by the size of the book; Webb packs a lot into a small space. In his reflections on Lamentations he states that he is constrained by the terms of reference he has set himself. One wishes he hadn't set such terms. And yet, this is what makes this small volume most valuable. Where many commentaries can tend to fill pages with irrelevancies, Webb is forced by brevity to be focused, and he states only what is necessary.Well worth getting."},{"Title":"Five Festal Garments: Christian Reflections on the Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"This has become one of my favourites. Webb gave a reflection each on the Garment of Love (The Song of Songs), the Garment of Kindness (Ruth), the Garment of Suffering (Lamentations), the Garment of Vexation (Ecclesiastes) and the Garment of Deliverance (Esther), which are excellent. In each section, he gave a summary of the structure of the book, reflected on its contribution to the Old Testament, its place in the Jewish liturgy, and its importance to the Christian canon, reflecting on its place in the New Testament. I have learnt and discovered so much from these \\"lesser\\" books of the bible through his short commentaries."},{"Title":"Five Festal Garments: Christian Reflections on the Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"This is the second of the works I have read comprising the New Studies in Biblical Theology series published by IV Press. Although this book was not quite as good as Dominion and Dynasty, it is still well worth reading. Author Barry Webb offers an interpretation of the five Old Testament books traditionally known as \\"the Scrolls\\": the Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther. They are among the most neglected books of the Bible--all of them are marginal in one way or another. They could perhaps even be considered \\"problem\\" books, raising unnerving and difficult questions. Webb offers an interpretation of these books, examining each in relation to the rest of the Old Testament, as well as to the New Testament gospel. In this way, Webb offers wonderful insights to these five neglected books. Reading Five Festal Garments certainly increased both my understanding and my appreciation of the place these five books have in the greater canon."},{"Title":"Five Festal Garments: Christian Reflections on the Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"The purpose of this little book is to look at the \\"five scrolls\\" in the writings of the Hebrew Bible from a Christian perspective. Dr. Webb notes that these particular books have gained a reputation of being difficult to interpret and apply. For this reason, they are often overlooked, ignored, or at the least, slighted. One of the key goals, then, of Five Festal Garments is to overturn this trend by not only showing the importance these books in their OT context, but their beauty as illuminating pieces in relation to the Christian witness as well. Webb uses an allusion to the \\"festal garments\\" that Joseph bestowed on Benjamin to describe how believers-in-Christ should view them. Like those garments, the scrolls number five, they are \\"festal\\"--since they are read at various Jewish feasts--and Webb believes that Christians should display them boldly and proudly as Benjamin might have done with the clothing his brother gifted him.Dr. Webb chooses one key word to describe the various \\"garments.\\" I have decided to use these words as a guide to summarizing each book.The key word for the Song of Songs should be no surprise: love. One must note, however, that this small book \\"is neither a philosophical treatise about love, nor a sexual manual\\" (18). Rather, the lyrics of the various poems are an overflow of feeling that celebrates the excitement of new love and commemorates the ongoing incorporation of romance into the essence of what it means to be human.One of the most important parts to understanding this book is to know who the actors and actresses are and how they function in the poem. The main characters are a man, a woman (who is perhaps the \\"star\\" of the show), and a group of onlookers (an audience), the daughters of Jerusalem. Solomon, who is often considered to be (mistakenly, according to Webb) an intruder in the story, is mentioned throughout in a symbolic way. This famous king became an emblem of romance in his day not least because of his hundreds of wives and concubines, but as well because of his wealth, wisdom, and fame. But in contrast to Solomon, the characters of this romance are common people who must deal with the normal obstacles and limitations of life that burden and sometimes prevent romance. Nevertheless, in their search for love, the couple feels they have every hope to find as much happiness in it as King Solomon himself.The best way to read this scroll is to understand that it primarily celebrates the romantic relationship between male and female as being designed and blessed by God. The New Testament also reaffirms the basic goodness of the body, sex, and romance, but it further shows that this relationship in particular was created to reflect on the greater significance of the relationship that exists between Christ and his bride, the Church. Nevertheless, it is a mistake to say that the primary purpose of Song of Songs is to be pictorial of this New Testament revelation of heavenly marriage; it is about love and romance, and it only images the relationship between Christ and his bride insofar as love and romance do.Webb designates Ruth as the garment of kindness. The story begins on a sad note, but throughout a great reversal occurs which displays the kindnesses of Ruth to Naomi, Boaz to Ruth and Naomi, Ruth to Boaz, and God to Naomi, Ruth, Boaz, Israel, and (through Israel's success) the world. The immediate plot recognizes God's grace in providing for two widows. On a larger scale, however, it shows how this provision also made way for the arrival of Israel's greatest king before the coming of--as well as being prototypical to, and in the line of--the Messiah.Lamentations chronicles suffering. Not only may one view it as detailing the specific sufferings and difficult questions of the nation of Israel after their brutal defeat and exile, but as annals of mortal suffering and human attempts to cope with it in general. Throughout the five poems in Lamentations, one may see a detail of Yahweh's anger as well as personal and communal confession within Israel, questions, and mourning. The confessions show that Israel--particularly the author of poem three--recognized their sin, but they do not fully understand how God can deal so harshly with his elect nation. Yet the questioning does not display an unresolved case against God. Rather, it ultimately capitulates to the overarching recognition of God's righteousness and Israel's sin. This leads Christians to understand that God's wrath is real, and it must be dealt with in Christ in order for anyone to escape it totally. And further, no one, not even the elect--especially not the elect--can expect to live a life free of suffering. Such suffering is a reality of life after the Fall, and rather than trying to ignore it, one should recognize it for what it is, view it in light of God's goodness, righteousness, and love, and in the face of what God has done in Christ, looking in hope and expectation to the coming restoration of the world where tears and sorrow will at last be no more.The summary word for Ecclesiastes is vexation. Webb chose this word carefully. It is used as an equivalent of the Hebrew word \\"hebel\\" which is often translated \\"vanity.\\" However, as Webb demonstrates, it is very difficult to boil this term down to one English word. Yet, his conclusion shows that hebel is a God-ordained force that exists in the world as a result of the Fall. Death is the looming shadow that ultimately evokes hebel, but the toil associated with the \\"thorns and thistles\\" of the curse also produce a seemingly meaningless struggle. Thus, it is inaccurate to translate this with English words that connote happenstance, such as futility, vanity, meaningless. The writer of Ecclesiastes presents the concept of hebel as coming from God; there is purpose to it. In short, Hebel results from God vexing the world on account of sin.However, the story does not end there. The New Testament tells Christians in detail what the writer of Ecclesiastes could have only hoped for and imagined dimly. The curses graciously reflect the reality of a world separated from its Creator, a world desperately in need of redemption and restoration. Christ has begun this work of restoration, which will be completed at the Second Coming, and as such, Christians have the opportunity to take part in work that is not futile or ultimately vexing. The work of the kingdom will have everlasting significance that will not pass away at death.Esther is about deliverance, but not just any kind. One noteworthy element of this book is that it never mentions God. However, this, far from weakening the case for God's care of Israel, shows that God works to save his people even when they are far from home, when there are no prophets or judges, when they do not recognize him, and even when he is punishing them. Even though some of the actions and attitudes of the hero and heroine are less than commendable, one must affirm that the outcome of all events works ultimately for the glorification of God and the good of his people. The story of Esther is a literary masterpiece that incorporates a compelling plot, romance, humor and a happy ending. It is very \\"Jewish,\\" which suggests that its proper place in Christian theology may in part have to do with detailing how one should think of the Jews. However, it's a grave mistake to stop there, because \\"the New Testament consistently encourages Christians to make the stories of God's dealings with Israel under the old covenant part of their own story\\" (130). Thus, Gentile believers should not associate with Haman as an outsider, but with the Jews as an incorporated member of the purified Israel of the new covenant. Further, the survival of Israel has important ramifications on the production of the New Covenant and the coming of the Messiah Jesus. As such, the deliverance of Israel from their enemies of flesh and blood is directly related to the deliverance of Christians from their enemies, Satan and death.In conclusion, there is not \\"good, bad and ugly\\" to speak of in Five Festal Garments. There are a lot of positive aspects one may note, a few negative, and some beautiful. In particular, though the nature of this assignment calls me to spend as much time on the negative as the positive, the book as a whole is very well done. Webb disciplines himself to determining the structure, content, and subsequent application of each scroll without delving into impertinent (or at least boring and endless) scholarly debates about certain issues. As such, he illuminates each book and ultimately achieves his goal of celebrating these otherwise obscure writings as important elements of the Christian Scripture."},{"Title":"What a Woman Wants","review":"I just got done reading this book and I have to say...WOW!

The other day, looking for a quick read, I pulled it off my burgeoning shelf of to-be-read books. Though IHM covers some well-worn territory (it was, after all, published decades ago, and wealth of popular mathematics books have been published in the interim), in the space of a very slim volume, it does so in surprising depth. Throughout, Reid's exposition is clear and incisive. At times, Reid leaves important concepts un- or only partly explained. Occasionally, I had to track these down in other books. I don't regard this as a fault of IHM though. The purpose of a book like this is to introduce the curious reader to new ideas -- in this case some very sophisticated ideas drawn from the world of higher mathematics -- and encourage them to make further explorations. In this goal, Reid and IHM succeed admirably. Coming into IHM I was already hooked on mathematics. Having finished IHM I am all the more hooked. I look forward to reading Reid's other books one day. IHM is a terrific book for the amateur enthusiast."},{"Title":"Cargo Ship Cruising: Sailing the world in passenger-carrying cargo ships","review":"This is not a reference book - it is more a description of the authors'travels. The book was obviously written by people with a lot of time on their hands. You'll find a lot of detail about changing money and visiting markets in foreign countries, for example. Still, if you have never travelled by cargo ship before, the book contains a lot of useful information, particularly about accommodation and the lifestyle on board."},{"Title":"Cargo Ship Cruising: Sailing the world in passenger-carrying cargo ships","review":"Okay, here's the deal. I'm looking for a great way to study for the bar. A thirty or sixty day cruise sounded like a great option. I wouldn't buy it again though.Although this is a fairly entertaining read, It's a bit pricey - it's privately published so you're probably not going to find it at your local bookstore. I was disappointed by its size, scope, and overall treatment of the subject.Best bet: if you happen to see this book at a garage sale - pick it up. Don't pay full price - you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Framework for Immigration: Asians in the United States","review":"I am a professor at the University of Indiana, and I have been looking for a textbook about Asian Americans and their life in the United States. There are books about Blacks, Latinos, basically every other minority group, except Asians. Segal is a Pioneer in this sense, and the book sets a standard that will be hard to match. Segal, an immigrant herself, shines light on the Asian communities individually, rather than clumping all Asians together, as previous authors have done. So far, this book has only received positive feedback from my class. It is much better and much more organized than the previous material I had (photocopies of varies sources). All my students, some of which are Asian, have embraced this book. I highly recommend this book, for &quot;it goes where no other book has gone before.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Forex Trader's Bill of Rights","review":"Banks are never anybody's favorite organization, but some of the things they do (like introducing delays into settling transactions... you wait for your money, they get to play with it a few more days) can be really dissapointing.

I heard a radio spot on this book and was intrigued. The story has a real emotional kick that I suspect will be relevant for many people. I read it for Father's Day and couldn't help but reflect on the message that this has about the decision to have children as well as the many other thoughts that are expressed about how we choose to live our lives. Variously introspective and contemplative about the world condition, the book grabs our interest with both ideas and art. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"It amazes me sometimes what you can find amid the mass of superhero spandex in the comic world these days. Don't get me wrong there is a large, and growing larger, area of comics that has nothing to do with superheros. But this book is a mix of both. Steven takes his mostly true tale of having the opportunity to write superman and the trouble he faces trying to write a character that he feels he can't write. He's know for his surreal vertigo work and getting superman seems just beyond him. How does a man that wants to be a serious writer and a serious writer of comics take on the biggest of american comic book icons? well you'll have to read this incredibly drawn and written graphic novel."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"Steven Seagle presents a wonderful journey into the mind of a writer and the search for meaning in an iconic character that has almost lost meaning as being the ultimate American hero. The author takes issue with the \\"reality\\" behind the fantasy and ends up seeing the strengths and the beauty behind Clark Kent/Superman/Kal-El.The art is whispy yet strong and striking. An oddity in modern superhero comics and manga influnced books, which is a shame.A very entertaining and enlightening book."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"This is the autobiographical story of writer Steven T. Seagle's struggle with an offer to write one of the monthly Superman comics. Why the struggle? Seagle has associated Superman with a disease that runs in his family. He resents Superman's perfection in relation to the slow, nasty death he fears awaits him. Despite being annoyed by the patent irrationality of resenting a fictional character, and the self pity about possibly dying of this disease (few folks' death is actually pleasant, after all), I found myself respecting the book for the skill with which the story was told. It's not easy to get inside a character's head the way this book does. Seagle's words are honest, and the art work is very expressive."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"This is really one of the best graphic novels I've read in a long time. It's about mortality and the relevance of a fictional invincible man in a cynical world."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"I first saw this graphic novel advertised in Wizard magazine a few years ago, and I was intrigued by the description, I was also familiar with Steven Seagle writing, I was hesitant to purchase it though because I've never really been into non-superhero GN's.I actually had this sitting in my Cart for quite awhile, when I finally did buy this GN I kicked myself for not buying it sooner. This was one of the best stories I've read, period.Just the person-ness of the writing is enough, the art is what I consider stark and on the dark side, almost Kubrick like if Kubrick drew comic books, Teddy Kristiansen's art is amazing!!!Buy this book!!!!"},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"A beautiful book that had me utterly engrossed. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially any family suffering with congenital disease. It tells a unique, adult story in a whimsical and heartbreaking way. I love too see the graphic novel used to such affect."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"I took this on a recommendation from a comic shop for a deep, moving book that grabs you like Blankets because I have read nothing like that since. This is a wonderful and searching story of this man's wrestling with his life and family. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"I spend a wonderful couple of hours this afternoon with the graphic novel \\"It's A Bird...\\" written by Steven T. Seagle and art by Teddy Kristiansen. This is a book that I think deserves a place among the all time great graphic novels, such as Frank Muller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's \\"Watchmen\\" (for any of you out there that are not familiar with these books- they are widely considered among the best mainstream comic novels ever produced)The book tells the story of Steve, a guy who has become a comic book author, a career path that surprises him since he spent much of his childhood not liking comics because he associates them with the death of his grandmother when he was five. When we meet the Steven of today, he is dealing with his father going missing, a long term relationship, and being offered by his editor the chance to write the character he most associates with the tragic events of his past, Superman.It's amazing the way Seagle weaves his charactersers views of the man of steel with the events going on in his life. Not once does it feel forced. They help us to see what is going on in (the character) Steven's mind, and his emotions.The art by Teddy Kristiansen is perfect for this volume as well. The style changes for the different aspects of Superman's world we look at, and there was not once where I thought he made the wrong choice.This book works on so many different levels, and doesn't misfire on any of them. From human drama, to superhero deconstructionism, and even as an insight to the creative process of an author. It's one of the finest comics I've read in a long long time, and I really hope some others out will share in the experience of this book"},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"\\"They're actually not funny anymore. People who read comics now want drama and adventure more than laughs\\", Steven T. Seagle explains to his doctor in It's a Bird.... This innovative novel reveals a new revolution in comic books. No longer are readers captivated with a super power (Steven's nemesis in the story), but are thrilled by more serious, realistic issues that capture the mind identically.When he was young, Seagle was in the waiting room of a hospital. His family had been called to the hospital as his grandmother was deathly ill with Hutchinson's disease. His father gave Steven and his brother a copy of Superman to occupy their mind in a time of sadness. This is how Seagle opens It's a Bird.... He finds a great trouble with Superman internally, yet becomes a successful comic and is eventually offered the job to redo the famous comic.In his own comic autobiography, Seagle creates sections of conversations with frames and word bubbles. Every scene is specific to one character or issue. Either with his girlfriend or doctor, Seagle uses illustrations and quotes to fully develop an idea in a nontraditional way. Regularly Seagle will separate these scenes with a separate comic strip. These brilliant placed short comics let the reader go inside Seagle's mind and allow Seagle to express more than is stated in his dialogue with the fellow characters. When in a car with Rafa, his automotive and friend, they start a discussion around the controversial Superman. Debating who would win in a \\"fantasy super-hero battle\\", Rafa promises that \\"Superman versus anyone? It's Superman. America, baby. Red, white and blue.\\" (40). Seagle goes to explain in his comic entitled \\"Red, Yellow, Blue\\" that really Superman is not all that American, rather his colors are the primary colors and each individual color could represent evilness, such as yellow being associated with the Nazis and red as fire (41).Yet Seagle uses his autobiography to create a comic strip that encompasses a complete narrative. He has to select specific scenes to get his story across to the readers. He brilliantly synthesizes his proposal to compose Superman and his journey to discovering if he has Hutchinson's disease. His mind will be captivated by the idea of drawing his nemesis, while researching the symptoms of the serious disease. Seagle is able to synthesize a story of two journeys, the decision to draw or not to draw Superman and discovering his disease, from one occasion that happened when he was a young child."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"I feel lesser for having read this comic book. I was hoping for a different take on Superman, but all I got was a whiny, self important diatribe on Huntington's Disease. If I wanted to read a whiny, self important diatribe on Huntington's Disease I would have picked up a comic entitled \\"A whiny, self important diatribe on Huntington's Disease\\"!I feel that somebody needs to refund me the time I wasted on this garbage. Oh and let's not forgot his jab that people that don't support illegal immigration are racist. You know, because Superman is an illegal alien. Get it?"},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"I bought this because of all the acclaim it had garnered. I expected to finish it and declare it to be one of the most incredible works I had ever read - be it comics or regular literature.I was disappointed. As a writer, I thought I could identify with the author's search for a story while having to deal with real life issues around him.What came across was a very self-loathing and somewhat pretentious tale. I thought the author was a little too pompous about his almighty artform, and too snobby about how he went about it. And the lines that connected the tale of Superman with his real life tragedy were not all that amazing in their revelatory presentation.I don't know. I was just annoyed by his whole approach to it, and it came across more like the results of a 17 year old comic book geek seeing a shrink and trying to figure out his relationship with his parents. And in doing so discovering that when he was a child he was scarred by a hospital visit where his grandmother died, and he attached a Superman comic that he was reading to that event, and therefore hates Superman subconsciously all his life.The whole thing is underwhelming. And most kids have those sorts of haunting stories and events that hide under the surface all their lives.As a playwright, one element that I thought was nice was the inclusion of a playwright friend of the author's who has better coped with a similar situation and found his catharsis in writing a play about it. By contrast, the comic book writer looks all the more whiny.I was hoping for something amazing and moving. What I got was something fairly predictable and over-reaching in finding the threads to connect it all together."},{"Title":"It's a Bird","review":"everything about this graphic novel seems half-assed from the artwork to the story. the artwork is painfully scribbled, and the story is a bit of a cop out. seagle gets assigned to write a graphic novel about superman, but instead he writes one about how much he doesn't want to write about superman.uh.if you want to read a memoir, try alison bechdel's \\"fun home\\" or craig thompson's \\"blankets\\"the storytelling is way more compelling."},{"Title":"The Myth of the Fall and Walker Percy's Last Gentleman (American University Studies Series Xxiv, American Literature)","review":"LOvely and brilliant.A highly whimsical kind of picaresque tale that outs one in mind of both Faulkner and Canneau"},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"An interesting, on-the-mark read, especially for those in higher ed, and even more especially for those of us who still teach at CCSN. My comment on this book is quite simple: Some things never change. Except, of course, when they get even worse."},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"Albert Einstein once said that great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. This may very well be the case of Lee Ryan Miller.While reading \\"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees\\" I found myself turning page after page, willing to discover more. It was as if I was reading an exciting thriller. Yet this is no fiction. This is what an innovative and enthusiastic young lecturer had to go through just because he was honoring his profession and giving the country the best possible service.Lee Miller is not that important in this story. People could have been named A, B and C. Dr Miller could have been a clerk in an office, a postman, a school librarian, a storekeeper or a handyman. Anyone doing anything can be innovative and energetic. Anyone can give his very best and, yes, by doing so stands out. And the nail that stands out gets pounded down. It's a true and sad story indeed. Yet the publication of such a book is extremely positive.This is an experience that Lee Miller is sharing with the world. He is offering a story of courage that should help all those who are willing to honor their profession and inject a dose of new life into their workplace.I recommend Lee Miller's book to those who stand out or to those who are willing to do so."},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"As a student, you don't really know what goes on amongst the faculty when they decide which instructor gets what course in the next term. Sometimes the best instructors for a certain class or subject get overlooked for no rhyme or reason. Lee Miller shares about his experience working with students that wanted to learn and faculty that could care less about the dynamic programs Miller offered. Tales of backstabbing, misuse of funds, unprofessional behavior and frustration fill the pages of this book. Read it and ask yourself if you would stand up for yourself and do the morally right thing. Miller went through a lot of grief from the faculty. He found that the rigors of being a professor extended beyond the classroom but with his bosses. Let's hope that fellow instructors and educational institutions do not fall into the pit that Miller went through at CCSN."},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"While studying for my various degrees, I recall many of my professors lamenting the stressful politics associated with being untenured professors. It wasn't until reading Dr. Miller's book that I fully comprehend -- empathized with -- their laments. Dr. Miller's honest account of his expreinces as a teacher in the Las Vegas Community College system is an amazing tale of good verses evil that delightfully holds a reader's attention for hours. It's a story of the sad truth of our educational system eroding away to where meritocracy is punished and mediocrity is encouraged. This is a surprisingly interesting story, perhaps becasue we all have at one time or another experienced similar struggles with dishonest men and had to wrestle with how to maintain our personal integrity and how far we are willing to fight. I highly recommend the book to all readers, but especially to those in the teaching professions. Good job, Dr. Miller. Good job!!!"},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"Lee Ryan Miller's Book is a perfect text book to clean up waste and what is ineffective about our Comunity College System. I can see that a henchman was sent to discredit.... but read it for yourself and see the patterns of the \\"underbelly.\\" I could add book # II to his list and maybe we're redy for the recepie. This book takes you into the bowels of the system and tells you where the next volley of shots will be fired.... you bet they don't want you to read this one, as it will change community college elections all over the US.And by the way..... go ahead and run for a public office like a board position and see how many \\"Sour Grapes\\" pop up.. you'll also get a chance to meet the true \\"underbelly\\" of the educational system and their buzzards that they keep circling for each and every little crumb and and :chink\\" in your \\"metal\\"... but keep the course and proceed as it will never change unless you take a grass roots approach and start with the drudeous tack of cleaning up the \\"underbelly\\"!"},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"This book, while using the trials and tribulations of Academia, isn't about Academia at all. Its about doing the right thing, for the right reasons, no matter what. Lee Miller went the extra mile, and showed what he is made of. He could have been a Marine, or a Bus Driver. The message is still the same."},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"Join the author on a strange journey into the mismanaged world of the college system in Las Vegas. Meet the crooks that operate behind the masks of higher education, whose interest lies solely in money, power, fame, anything but education. The author's vivid and straightforward approach brings true life to these characters you'll grow to love and hate: the villainous college administrators, the corrupt student government, the cowardly colleagues, and of course the kindhearted supporters. Follow the engaging plots that intertwine into a startling conclusion. Be sad, be entertained, and be enraged. And the bonus... these are real people, real incidents, real names. Once you pick up the book and start reading, it's hard to put it down. Highly recommended to college students, professors, those who seek teaching positions in a college environment, or anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"What a surprise this book turned out to be. As a college student, it's hard to remember that the professor assigning you hours of reading per night is a person as well. Dr. Miller shows that graduating from esteemed universities, genuinely caring for one's work and students, and working hard to provide the best education possible for one's students doesn't guarantee a cakewalk. Dr. Miller offers great insight into the world of red tape, hierarchy, and corruption that often times is college administration.Dr. Miller shares his trials of finding work, even with degrees as prestigious as his, opening his mind to new and different students and lifestyles (see the chapter titled The Ferengi, The Garbage Picker, and The Stripper), and coping with being an innovative, caring professor in a world of greed, deceit, and bizarre behavior.Teaching Amidst The Neon Palm Trees proves that there are still people who are willing to go the extra mile for their students, and stand up for what is right. As a future teacher, Dr. Miller has inspired me to work hard for my students, try new things as a teacher, and fight corrupt administration. It may be true that no good deed goes unpunished, but sometimes the bad deeds get punished too."},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"Lee Ryan Miller deserves an award for exposing political corruption in academia. His first person account of his experience as a professor in Las Vegas, enables us to better understand the term, \\"Sin City.\\"This book read like a novel. As each page unfolded, I became more intrigued with the story. Facts read better than fiction in this case. He is a gifted writer. Let's hear more from him.A first rate book from start to finish!"},{"Title":"Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees","review":"The author is a flaming liberal. We spend the entire book wondering why he is getting this rough treatment from superiors / colleagues which he documents in such painstaking detail. Amazingly, it is not until page 169 of this 175 page book that he casually reveals that the answer is AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. He explains that CCSN wanted to hire more Hispanics and that his supervisor was told to replace him with a woman. Incredibly, the author seems to sympathize with this goal and then quickly moves on to another topic. His downplaying of this issue is odd, because he mentions a dozen times that he felt his idea of free travel scholarships for poor students was a good idea. Hey, I think everyone could benefit from his class trip to Europe, but why in the world should taxpayers and the other students be forced to pay for those who didn't save their money? Tuition at CCSN is already greatly subsidized and all students have the opportunity to find a job and save money. Besides, maybe their choice of assistance would be something more essential than a free trip to Europe! The author also complains that he didn't receive money from taxpayers (in the form of unemployment compensation) because he didn't teach over the Summer. As a part-time CCSN teacher, I can verify that Summer jobs are not plentiful. Why in the world would a part-time teacher expect to receive a Summer teaching assignment, ahead of all the full-time teachers? If he was truly an educated and talented person, I'm sure he could have found work here, given our 3.5% unemployement rate and our conducive atmosphere for starting a business. He mentions that CCSN's budget for international student recruitment was $270,000, but doesn't seem to find anything unusual about this. Why are taxpayers paying this much money to bring foreign students here? We already have plenty of foreigners in this community... just look around. He briefly comments on the firing of Mike Meyers for using a possibly-derogatory nickname to describe Zelda Williams, but he fails to mention the biggest scandal of all at CCSN: Zelda received a $50,000 payoff by the CCSN President and Chancellor, even though a judge threw her case out of court and CCSN attorneys advised against awarding any money until they could investigate her claim of \\"emotional distress\\". The author also fails to mention the outrageous, multiple scandals where Wendel Williams abused his authority to take advantage of CCSN. The lesson to be learned here is that we should privatize the education system and stop abusing the taxpayers."},{"Title":"What do you say after you say hello?: The psychology of human destiny","review":"A thought-provoking and revealing book about human life and human interactions. Although written in the late sixties it is still very much relevant and not in the least outdated. Even if you do not accept the script theory as a whole (the system of thought with its jargon(which by the way is minimal compared to other theories of personality) and with the common myths that permeate it), this book provides valuable insights in many aspects of the human condition. Unlike other psychology books that present systems of thought attempting to encompass the whole spectrum of human life and end up missing out on all the finer detail by means of over-generalizations and an over-inflated writer's ego, this one uses the script theory ( that we all decide on important matters in our life at a very young age and live or act out our scripts accordingly)as a springboard for very profound ideas and observations put to paper in a simple and to-the-point language, revealing as I said rather than covering up with theoretical constructs and obscuring.A work by a very compassionate man and a pioneer in the field, who sadly passed away soon after the completion of the book.

This is the book that opened my eyes to the possibility of improving my life. After I finished this book and the process of assimilating what I had learned, I quickly devoured the remaining texts on Transactional Analysis (I'm Okay, You're Okay; Staying Okay; Games People Play; Born to Win; and a few more).

While the content is authoritative it reads like a novel and I had difficulty putting it down.I found the early chapters that discuss how the socio-economic environment, created in large part by the railroad, helped foster the events leading to the outbreak of hostilities particularly insightful. The chapters describing the events that took place around Washington and Baltimore in the early years of the war are incredible. Turner's tight prose describing the political shenanigans and war profiting in the Lincoln cabinet shows that little has changed in Washington in the 125 yearsI only wish that the book contained better maps of the regions covered.This book is a must read for American Civil War historians and rail buffs"},{"Title":"Victory Rode the Rails: The Strategic Place of the Railroads in the Civil War","review":"The title and subtitle of this well-researched book nearly tells the whole tale. The North entered the War of Secession with huge advantages in logistics, and the new name of warfare in 1861 was engineering. Not only did the North have far more miles of track, along which to transport the enormous armies mobilized with their huge burdens of equipment, but also the Northern rail system was better integrated and flexible. Southern railroads chiefly ran from hinterlands to ports without interlinkage. There were nightmares of incompatible rail gauges and services to the engines. The thesis of this book is that superior railroads provided the margin of Union victory; even if this seems simplistic, the author makes a good and detailed case.Grant beat Lee, as he had already beaten every commander the Rebels could throw at him in the west, by recognizing the mechanics of the new warfare. Grant's victory at Vicksburg was above all a triumph of military engineering, and Vicksburg was of course the battle that saved the war. Lee made what he could out of the Virginia railroads, particularly in hastening back and forth to Harper's Ferry, but the effort to keep openthe single rail supply line from the south to Richmond consumed more forces than the Secessionists could afford. The defense of Richmond was a huge and telling mistake from the logistical prospect of modern warfare. Lee fought Napoleon's battles; Grant fought Eisenhower's. Ironically, at Antietam and Gettysburg, mediocre generals beat Lee at his own game, leaving nothing for Grant but the bloody mopping up of the Slaveocracy's desperate stubbornness."},{"Title":"Victory Rode the Rails: The Strategic Place of the Railroads in the Civil War","review":"The history of the Civil War is intimately tied with the spread, refinement and development of new technologies. From iron-clad ships to rifled artillery to aerial observation, the military effort expended by North and South changed the face of the industry in the United States. Victory Rode the Rails looks at one aspect of this change -- the railroads and how they helped the North win the war.From the early skirmishes in Baltimore to the final rail movements surrounding the surrender at Appomattox, Turner does a magnificent job of making the railroads of the 1860s come to life. By keeping his focus on the railroads and their role in the various campaigns, Turner highlights a side of the war that is commonly glossed over in histories that focus on battle tactics.Starting with the differing North/South attitudes towards railroads prior to the war, which left the CSA with a rail network that was ill prepared for the rapid dispersal of troops and supplies that the war required, Turner celebrates the business plans, engineering feats and supply marvels that allowed the Northern commanders to continue their advances even as Southern troops worked to destroy the rails, and vice versa."},{"Title":"Victory Rode the Rails: The Strategic Place of the Railroads in the Civil War","review":"I enjoyed this book about the history of the railroad during the civil war.

Other signals recounted may be apocryphal, but such a good story.A German warplane was circling the convoy outside of gun range, and a destroyer radioed, \\"You are making me dizzy. Go round the other way.\\"\\"With pleasure,\\" replied the aircraft, which promptly reversed and circled the other way.Another small warship was riding the waves of the North Sea when word came over the wireless to \\"Commence hostilities against Japan forthwith.\\"The captain turned to his number one and ordered, \\"Commence hostilities against Japan forthwith.\\" Number One saluted and said, \\"aye, aye, sir!\\" Meanwhile one little ship kept bucking the waves, thousands of miles from Japan and any possibility of carrying out such an order, watching for U-boats and mines.This is an anthology of three books, with the first of the trio being the best. You do need to have an understanding of the British approach to life and the British Navy in order to understand all of the remarks and asides.This book is well worth the search to find it.

There has been a change in that passage which is of interest to me. I also compared it to another recent purchase \\"The Cruel Sea Retold\\" and I am disappointed not to have had reply from the author of that book.Marjorie Lockwood"},{"Title":"Monsarrat at sea","review":"This book is a collection of short stories and reflections bracketing Three Corvettes, Monsarrat's memoirs of life as a RNVR officer during WWII. During the War LT Monsarrat was assigned as a watch officer on a Flower Class Corvette escorting convoys in the Atlantic. After a year of this duty he was promoted to Executive Officer of a corvette on convoy duty on the East coast of Britain, and finally he became the first RNVR officer to command one of HM vessels when he took command of HMS Shearwater.The interesting thing about Monsarrat's memoir is the almost entire absence of action. There are relatively few passages about attacking or being attacked by U-Boats, E-Boats or German Aircraft. Most of the attention is focused on the normal pedestrian difficulty of life at sea in a small ship. The most common foe is the weather, especially in North Atlantic Winter. Monsarrat also does a good job of recreating the blend of tedium and fear of standing bridge watch during endless winter nights, trying to stay warm and dry while waiting for one of the merchant ships to be torpedoed. Monsarrat also excels in describing the aftermath of the U-Boat attacks. The oil soaked bodies pulled from the sea frozen in their life-jackets, the crew of the oil tanker faced with a choice of burning to death aboard their ship or jumping into the frozen Atlantic with seas running too high for other ships to rescue them. There is one story that sticks with me. One dawn a lookout on Monsarrat's ship sites a life raft with three men, half dead from exposure. The seas are too rough and cold for swimmers so the ship throws a line to the raft. One of the survivors ties the line to the raft and, after great exertion; two of the three men are rescued. The line parts. The crew throw another line, but the remaining survivor makes no move to grasp it. The deck officer on the corvette tells one of the rescued survivors that the man must grasp the line or, in this sea, nothing can be done for him. The rescued man tells the officer, \\"He can't. He has broken a leg and both arms. He told us to go first.\\" Eventually the corvette must move on, leaving the man to his fate. As the ship pulls away, the man waves good-bye.Aside from the core of the book, the short stories are pretty good as well. Monsarrat is a good writer, with something of a gift from describing interior thoughts of the protagonist. There is also a fair amount of humor in the books to relieve the gloom. For example, one morning on the way out of harbor, Monsarrat querys the local lightship \\"Did the Germans lay any mines here last night?\\" the lightship replies \\"We'll know in a minute, you're the first ship out\\".At the end of the day this is an excellent book about what it was really like to be a watch officer in one of the \\"small ships\\" that kept Britain supplied during WWII and won the Battle of the Atlantic. I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"First Friend: A History of Dogs and Humans","review":"\\"First Friend\\" offers a mine of information about the history of dogs and the humans who have loved them --- and a few who emphatically did not.Humans were buried with their pet dogs in ancient Jericho, Homer's tough warrior Odysseus wept at the death of his devoted old hound Argus, and greyhounds were valued companions to Roman and medieval aristocrats. The Stuart kings loved their toy spaniels, and the poet Pope (who preferred Great Danes) doubted the goodness of a man who experimented on dogs. In the nineteenth century, Scott created a gallery of engaging canine characters, Byron praised his Newfoundland for having \\"all the Virtues of Man/ Without his Vices,\\" Dickens regularly enhanced his characters by giving them appropriate dogs (Dora's Jip, Bill Sikes's Bull's-eye), and acerbic Jane Carlyle eulogized her Maltese mix Nero as \\"my inseparable companion during eleven years, ever doing his little best to keep me from feeling sad and lonely.'The love continues today, of course, with the difference that we are more apt to recognize dogs as equal members of the family. People are no longer comfortable calling themselves the owners of their dogs; humane societies are promoting the term guardian instead."},{"Title":"First Friend: A History of Dogs and Humans","review":"An interesting, if a bit dry and academic look at dogs throughout history. Ms. Rogers is an college professor and this has the feeling of a dissertation or thesis, rather than a \\"user friendly\\" book. She relies mostly on dogs as portrayed through paintings and novels, rather than social history or anthropology for her conclusions.That being said, there are some interesting facts and interesting commentary from various sources. My main problem is the latter half of the book, which is mostly devoted to 19th century fictional literature on dogs. Much of this, as the author acknowledges (without ever really explaining \\"why\\"), are cautionary tales about the abuse and even torture of loving canine companions. It was bad enough that in centuries past, things are dog fights were common. But it appears that almost every novel (including many long out of print) about a dog is in some fashion about that dog being beaten, neglected, starved, tortured and in the very worst examples, vivisected (exploratory surgery done on live animals without anesthesia).It appears that many of these novels were written with basically good intentions -- the desire of reformers to touch the hearts of decent people and dog-lovers, in the hopes that their outrage would end these barbaric practices, and at least partly that has happened over the decades. However, the sheer number of these books, the unremitting torture and bleakness, is staggering. I haven't even read the originals, and yet just Ms. Roger's description of books about vivisection will undoubtedly cause me nightmares for years to come.But this begs the question of exactly how common these practices were, and why writers felt compelled to create these books about the misery and torture inflicted on helpless, loyal and affectionate animal companions. Where they exaggerating, in order to achieve their goal of banning or eliminating animal abuse? What kind of madness affected physicians and scientists of that era that they could debase themselves by these digusting and scientifically worthless acts of torture? Did one single piece of medical knowledge worth obtaining ever come from the sadistic abuse of a living creature?Those are questions worth exploring, but are not delved into in this particular book. In fairness, given the title, I was expecting a more mellow and even light-hearted look at companion animals over the years. Certainly the paintings pictures alone suggest that despite the abuses, many dogs were greatly loved and well-cared for, and have been the closest companion animals to humankind for over 20,000 years. A little lightness to balance the dark might have been somewhat welcome here.While not impugning Ms. Roger's formidable scholarship, I feel the need to warn anyone buying this for a dog-loving child or great-aunt, that the unrelenting darkness of the literary examples here, many of them deeply distressing and even stomach-turning, would make this book highly unsuitable for most of the readers who would normally enjoy this subject matter. Please be warned, before reading and especially before giving this as a gift!!!!"},{"Title":"First Friend: A History of Dogs and Humans","review":"One of our dogs, Sammy, the fox terrier, has a behavior I find lovable. When I move in my library to my recliner to read, Sammy will get up from wherever he is to jump on the recliner's footstool and nap. He does not do so to get attention, for I don't thank him or pet him for doing so, and he has not gained in comfort, for he has usually abandoned a comfortable place on the sofa in order to walk over and jump on the footstool which has no more cushioning. He simply finds it more comfortable to be next to his human; I am complimented by this opinion, and I like him all the more for it, every time he joins me in this fashion. Sammy's behavior in this instance, and his behavior and that of my other dogs in many other instances, were on my mind as I read _First Friend: A History of Dogs and Humans_ (St. Martin's Press) by Katherine M. Rogers. Rogers does not include her own anecdotes with the book, but obviously loves dogs (her book is dedicated to her shepherd / retriever mix). This does not keep her from seeing them clearly; she disdains those who see dogs as equals, though she gives many examples of the impulse. Eugene O'Neill, for instance, wrote an epitaph for the family Dalmatian which praised \\"the only one of our children who has not disillusioned us.\\" Without regarding dogs as furry, four-legged humans, however, there is much to admire in them, and much to admire about the mutually satisfying relationship between the two species.Dogs and humans have been closely associated for millennia; the earliest dog fossil dates from 12000 BCE, and there is a grave from 10000 BCE in Israel that contains the skeleton of an elderly woman buried with a pup. It is clear that humans first found early wolfish dogs helpful, in scavenging and hunting, and humans selected dogs that were obedient and easy to be around. Samuel Johnson was behind his mid-eighteenth century times when he included only two roles for dogs in his _Dictionary_: \\"The larger sort are used as a guard; the less for sports.\\" There was disapproval that dogs should take any other role. The work ethic came partially from Christianity. St. Thomas Aquinas indicated that since God gave man dominion over animals, man could do what he wanted with them, especially since we could not have true fellowship with creatures that could not reason or attain eternal life. As late as the mid-nineteenth century, Pope Pius IX would not permit in Rome a society against cruelty to animals because such an organization might suggest that humans had duties toward animals. Descartes systematized Aquinas to teach that soulless animals were mere machines, and didn't really feel anything; this did nothing for the hapless dogs taken up by the vivisectionists or the bull- or bear-baiters. Samuel Johnson denounced such treatment, but it took the secular utilitarian Jeremy Bentham to destroy the religious foundations upon which the treatment was founded; a dog is more rational and more able to communicate than a newborn baby, he reasoned, and even if not, \\"the question is not, Can they _reason_? nor, Can they _talk_? but Can they _suffer_?\\"Humans cannot do anything perfectly, and mistreatment of dogs in history, and currently through puppy mills, is a theme here, but not a large one, because their partnership with us has been generally happy. Rogers gives scores of examples of famous people, especially literary ones, who loved their dogs. For example, Byron ended an epitaph on the marble monument of his dog Boatswain, \\"To mark a friend's remains these stones arise; / I never knew but one, - and here he lies.\\" She gives many examples of dogs in literature, sometimes used mawkishly, but often with great subtlety. A classic example is Odysseus returning home to find that only his aging hound Argus remembers him. Jane Austen didn't concentrate on her characters' dogs, but made them revealing. Sleek sporting dogs are owned by shallow gentlemen, and the pug of the mindless Lady Bertram in _Mansfield Park_ gets more attention from her mistress than do any of her family members. There are pictures reproduced here of dogs in painting and sculpture, behaving through the centuries as dogs always have, looking pert, pretty, and friendly. Toward the end of the book is a section on dogs as equals, emphasizing that people have come to recognize explicitly that dogs do have rights; the famous trainer Barbara Woodhouse maintained that dogs were fully family members and \\"should have the same consideration as any other family member... within reason.\\" But realistically, Rogers writes that we have a partnership between significantly different species, based partly on dependency and self interest on both sides, and no less loving or meaningful for that. Anyone who loves dogs will find much to enjoy here, and if you are one of the unfortunates that do not love dogs, no book will reform you."},{"Title":"Recursive Techniques in Programming (Computer Monograph Series)","review":"the technique of recursion - defining a function or process in terms of itself- is finding more and more applications in programming, and the need to provide for its use is affecting the design of programming languages and the computers themsleves.

You kind of feel you missed them getting to know each other as they've already been together a week.The main story of this book is that Gabriel Jones is presumed dead after a break-in at the house they were both staying at. So for Venetia to open her own business and not have to face prejudice she decide to pretend she is married and takes the surname, you've guessed it Jones.Now he is dead, right, so what has Ms Venetia to fear? Well guess what Gabriel isn't dead, he's pretending, so he can flush out the real murderer who he want to think that he is dead. Confused. Don't be. It's quite simple when you read it.Anyway Gabriel reads the paper one morning with his cousin in attendance and he knows straight away this woman who is a photographer, who has his surname, is Venetia. So he decided to go to her and see what she is about.He puts the tale about he is her dead husband returned from the dead. The tabloids weave a romantic story out of this. It's really her own fault.Now keep in mind Venetia has a special ability, she has paranormal gifts, but so to does Mr Jones. So they have some things in common. This is focused on a bit throughout the book. You also meet Venetia's family who are involved in the family business and her younger brother at times is quite funny with the way he says thing and then Gabriel's family are rather interesting also.Anyway to sum it up, this was funny in parts and a very enjoyable read for any Amanda Quick fan.

We don't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after they've already spent a week getting to know each other. Very disappointing from a romance novel.And I don't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels, but the plot in this one defies belief. It's never explained why the first murder even occurs. The hero's fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she's using the last name \\"Jones\\" is beyond ludicrous. If that was going to be a major plot point, at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together. But JONES?!All would be forgiven if the romance were compelling, but it wasn't in the slightest.

Deciding to make use of this opportunity, Venetia poses as Gabriel's widow and moves her family to London, where she opens a new portrait shop. Imagine her surprise then when Gabriel walks into to drawing room many months later, very much alive. Apparently, someone wants access to some papers that they think Gabriel has, and he had pretended to play dead in order to discover who had tried to kill him. But now, with Venetia pretending to be his widow, Gabriel is afraid that the killer will come after Venetia. Venetia is stunned, and a little miffed that her plans have come crashing down around her; after all a live husband was the last thing she expected to have to contend with. But with her life, and potentially that of her loved ones at stake, Venetia will have to put her ire behind her and work with Gabriel. But can she? For Venetia has secrets that she'd rather not share, esp with the man she's so terribly attracted to...I know that the last few novels by Amanda Quick haven't exactly been stellar ones --esp when one compares them with her earlier work \\"Seduction,\\" \\"Scandal, etc. But there's always been something, even in her less than stellar works for one to grab onto -- a good storyline, good chemistry between the hero and heroine, suspense. This time around, however, everything seems very flat and very formulaic. The storyline is a variation of one that has been used a number of times, the chemistry between the hero (Gabriel) and the heroine (Venetia) is almost nonexistent, and the villain of the piece not only sticks out a mile (the villain might as well have carried a sign saying \\"here I stand, come and get me.\\") Who would have thought that there would come the day when I would actually give an Amanda Quick novel 2 stars?The shame of it was that the storyline, although it was much used intrigue/mystery subplot, had quite a bit going for it. However, while one can overlook the fact that an author has much used a very familiar subplot, slightly harder to overlook is the fact that the interaction between the hero and heroine in \\"Second Sight\\" lacked sparkle. From the manner in which the first few chapters unfolded, I rather thought that I was going to like Venetia quite a bit -- she seemed intelligent and very capable. But while, thank goodness, Amanda Quick did not allow her heroine to behave in an extremely foolish manner even once, she did make her seem rather obtuse at times. Gabriel, on the other hand, was easy to like and take to, even if his character was under-developed -- and really, one has little choice but to approve of a hero who possesses a sense of humour. All in all, though, this was a disappointing read: the historical aspect was mere wall papering (and although I realize that for many readers this is not a priority. I rather like a little more detail in these historical novels), the suspense was lacking, as was the chemistry between Venetia and Gabriel, and the storyline just lacked energy and vivacity. If you are a fan, by all means read this book, but be forewarned, it is nothing like her earlier works. If you've never picked up an Amanda Quick romance novel, than choose one of her earlier works instead (esp her \\"S\\" series), you won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Seducing Gabriel Jones seems like the perfect solution. He's handsome, charming, and Venetia Milton knows she'll never see him again. And Venetia certainly doesn't want to remain a virgin for the rest of her life. When word arrives that Gabriel has died, she decides to become his widow. In Victorian England, widows have so much more freedom than unmarried young women--and Venetia needs all the freedom she can get to make her photography business thrive. A thriving business is all that keeps her and her family from poverty. When Gabriel walks back into her life, however, not dead at all, her calculations go out the window. Has she put herself and her family in danger, as Gabriel suggests?Venetia and Gabriel investigate the strange occurances that surround an alchemical discovery which Gabriel had made at the beginning of the novel. Someone has already stolen an alchemical notebook and seems intent on stealing the empty case that once held it. But Gabriel's investigation has gotten him nowhere in the months he was presumed dead and Venetia is convinced only she, perhaps using her psychic ability to perceive auras, can help him. Gabriel, in turn, wishes to keep Venetia safe and is frustrated by her willingness to put herself in danger.Author Amanda Quick (Quick is a pen name for Jayne Ann Krentz) is an excellent writer. Her characters come to life and her dialogue sizzles. It's easy to get hooked in SECOND SIGHT and it's a hard book to put down.Still, as I read it, I started feeling as if I had read this book before. I hadn't, exactly. Increasingly, for me, Quick's books are starting to fall into the same pattern--a poor but talented and ambitious female is making her own way in the world--but badguys are causing her trouble. Fortunately, there's a hero around who finds her quirky nature compelling, helps her overcome obstacles (while nevertheless making it clear she could have done so on her own).

But I can't help but wonder if she has anything else in store for us."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"If this book had been written by any other author, I would have given it 2 stars. I was very disappointed because I have read every book written by Ms. Krentz/Quick and have loved them all. I own them all! This one totally left me cold. I never got into the characters. I thought I would like Venetia at first, but I never really got into her. She was very stiff, formal and had no sense of humor whatsoever. She did warm up some during the love scenes, but even those seemed thrown in because they were necessary in the book. It was like the characters thought, \\"Oh yeah, we're supposed to be incredibly sexually attracted to each other, so let's have some sex scenes\\". The character of Gabriel was also like a shadow of all the other male leads in the Quick books. None of the relationships in the book were well developed. Venetia's and Gabriel's relationship didn't really develop either. It didn't seem like they were friends, let alone lovers. Finally, the mystery seemed to limp along. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me throughout. It then comes to an abrupt, unbelievable end. I hope the next Quick book will be up to the standard of her previous books."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This is my fourth time to write this review. If it doesn't work this time I will know that the paranormal forces are aligned against me and give up. The first two I erased myself. The third one disappeared into that great black hole in the Amazon computer (but only after two days) and it didn't even have any rants, raves, or rambling. Go figure.THIS REVIEW HAS WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER SPOILERS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM, STOP READING NOW!1. This is billed as a paranormal romance. Don't believe it. If you expect to learn anything about the Arcane Society from this book you will be disappointed. Why was the society formed? We are told that the society was formed two hundred years previously by the alchemist Sylvester Jones but that is on page 5 and no more information is given. Who were and are the members? How do you join? How have they maintained the strict secrecy concerning the society all this time? WHAT DO THEY DO? None of these questions, which are actually quite basic, are ever answered. Venetia was commissioned to photograph the \\"artifacts\\" of the society. Do you know that not one of them is ever described?2. What was the formula? What was it supposed to do? Again, no information. Just in the very last pages, what happened if you drank it, but what was its purpose?3. The editorial and artistic decisions made in printing this book just made me MAD! The print is so big I could read it without my reading glasses and I DID NOT buy the large print edition. Each chapter begins on the right hand page and half way down, at that. This results in totally blank pages, half blank pages and enough white space between other chapter endings and new chapter beginnings to form another blank page. I actually added it all up. At a conservative estimate I got over 63 blank pages (or their equivalent) inside this 390 page novel. Padding, padding, padding just to make it into a long enough length for a hardcover book. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the paperback version. FIX THIS! Also, the print is done in a washed out grey, not crisp black. Why? For atmosphere? Did I mention that the margins were \\"generous\\"?4. The heroine, Venetia Milton, was (according to my way of thinking) cold and calculating. This was supposed to be because she was \\"modern\\" in her thinking for the late Victorian era. She chose to seduce Gabriel Jones after finishing her photography job at Arcane House because it was an isolated location so there was not much likelyhood of getting caught, she would never see him again, and she was on the shelf because of her age and family obligations. She wanted to find out what passion between a man and woman was like but never wanted to get married. When she thought he had died she was sad enough to cry, rub his coat (which she had kept with her even though all her clothes and photographic equipment was left behind-but not the camera-during her flight from danger)and then decide that life must go on. She became a \\"widow\\" in London to ease her way into business and used Mrs. Jones as a name because he wouldn't be needing it anymore. Cold folks, cold. When he \\"came back from the dead\\", she considered him an inconvenience. There was no joy in seeing him, they never even touched! Good heavens, she called him \\"sir\\" for well over 2/3 of the book! And please, Ms Quick/Krentz, what in the world were you doing with the Janus Club stuff? Just more \\"modern\\" thinking? In order to provide a reason for blackmail? Very, very weak.5. The paranormal \\"gifts\\" these two characters had were piddly. She saw \\"auras\\", he \\"felt evil\\". Whoop-de-do! I kept waiting for something else to be revealed, but that was it. Sum total of their paranormal abilities. Why was it necessary for this novel to be set in late Victorian England in order to set up the contemporary novel under the Jayne Ann Krentz banner? This one is dull and boring. That is my opinion. Others love it and have praised it to the skies. I love other Amanda Quick books, just not this one. It is totally forgetable for me and I will never want to read it again.In short, it would have made a passably good 100 page short story. Nothing more.*****As an update, I saw the paperback version of this book in the bookstore yesterday and I'm happy to say that the publishers did address (to some degree) the problems of blank pages and other editorial decisions mentioned in my review. If you want to read this one, for goodness sakes get it in paperback.*****"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I've read almost all of Amanda Quick's romances and most of her work as Krentz. I liked Lie by Moonlight better than Second Sight because it seemed less predictable. Regardless, her writing is a notch above other romance novelists and it is always good for fast easy read with likeable characters and just the right amount of steam. If you are looking for great literature along the lines of something by John Steinbeck this is not it of course, but sometimes you need a little chocolate and a romance."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"The Arcane Society is a group of magic users who exist within a wider mundane world and have been organized since the 16th century. The author, writing under multiple pen names, has novels with this world view in both the late Victorian era and modern times. This is the first (chronologically) set in the 19th century and begins a series of at least three. (White Lies and The Perfect Poison follow.) I accidentally read them out of order, but each is sufficiently self-contained that it didn't matter too much. The &#34;bodice ripper&#34; sections seemed rather formulaic - spinster decides to get laid, target is in the Arcane Society, she has magic too, he &#34;takes&#34; her virginity, they beat the bad guys and get married. The individual plots are interesting though and it's a nice adventure as you learn more about the Author's theories of magic and how they relate to good vs. evil plotting. I picked up these because I really enjoy Mercedes Lackey's Elemental Masters series. These have more sex and less plot, but they're still quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I just loved this book!The characters are engaging, dynamic, and quite entertaining! Amanda Quick is known not just for her exciting adventures and steamy romances, but also for the comedic prose that has readers laughing out loud at the dialogue between characters.Venetia Milton is thoroughly likable. A young charismatic photographer with a sense of adventure, she cares for her younger siblings and elderly aunt after her parents past away. She is clever with a strong sense of responsibility, loyalty, and kindness. She is a heroine the reader can't help but admire! Little does she know that her life is about to change after she embarks on a project to photograph old relics for the Jones family...Gabriel Jones, the Jones family heir, is intelligent, dashingly handsome, and good at keeping secrets hidden. On a mission to discover who stole the recipe for the founder's formula, he embarks on a mission that can cost him his life and the lives of those he cares for. His protective nature, sense of humor, and compassion are a perfect match for Venetia and make him an excellent and thrilling hero.The characters in the plot from young Edward to Gabriel's parents are wonderfully scripted! With a robust cast of characters, a clever and twisting plot, and a hot and sultry romance, this book was one I enjoyed immensely."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"It is a good book, and it explains how the arcane society bagan. It is a little of a hard read. If you read this book first you will not continue, but I read 2 others and got hooked, so I needed to know how it starts. If this is the first Amanda Quick book you have read, put this down and read others and then come back to this."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"3 out of 5 stars. Another book I started out really liking and then grew bored with. It was ok I guess."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I've read a few books from the Arcane and Harmony Series, but had never read them in order, so I was looking forward to reading the book that started it all. I was a little disappointed with \\"Second Sight\\". It didn't seem like it was quite up to Ms. Krentz's usual riveting standard. The writing seemed almost a little sloppy at times, not as well constructed as later novels in this series.That being said, though, I did enjoy the book and was happy to start at the beginning of the Arcane novels. I'm also happy that I purchased it, simply because I like to have complete series in my library. I suspect that any sloppiness of writing was simply the author feeling her way through the new universe she had created."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyes this book. Amanda Quick, who heads off the Arcane Society novels series with this book has definitely gotten my attention. I can't wait to see what else she has in store."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"The plot was rather lame and didn't hang together too well. There wasn't much suspense. The evil one was pretty easy to identify and I'm not sure there weren't loose ends. The way people spoke was quite stiff; Victorians may have talked that way, but I wouldn't think so. The convention of the single girl with responsibility for younger siblings was there, but the younger siblings had little character or anything to make them stand out.At the end when everything was explained, the characters just took turns explaining what happened. Even the younger sister who really hadn't been involved in the plot had a piece to say about it all.The hero was a rather silly person who worried about his psychic powers making him a throwback, but fell in love with the heroine immediately (though she, like a modern, rather than Victorian woman, just wanted a night of illicit passion - another convention for these novels, in fact, this one used by this author already). In Victorian times, this is not credible. I was thinking how she could easily have gotten pregnant. She was only 27! (Supposed to be old in Victorian times, but with her sense, she'd have known that was a risk).Readable and OK, but really a rather dumb book!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"The Arcane Society novels are diverting paranormal adventures. I like the fact that Amanda Quick tends to create capable, self-reliant, career-oriented heroines who think for and act by themselves."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This was my first Amanda Quick book. It got off to a good start, but gradually declined into a boring state of affairs. I was finding myself wondering why the pace was so slow and ponderous while Gabriel's, Venetia's, and possibly Caleb's lives were in danger. I was wondering WHERE is this book going and WHEN are we going to get there!?? UGH! The logic behind their strategy to unravel the murders and mystery was so weak. For what is supposed to be a romance, there was no sexual chemistry beyond the initial contact. Gabriel seemed pretty dull. Venetia pretty stiff while flaunting the \\"I gotta be an independent female\\" thing. I made it halfway through - to the scene when Venetia dressed as a man - and it just put me over the edge. It's like the author was just writing whatever to fill the pages - so insipid and cliched. I can't waste my time reading this stuff when there are so many good books to be had. What a disappointment. I won't be rushing into reading any other books by this author."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I was very impressed with this work and read her later books because of it. Too bad the others were not nearly as interesting as this one. Great characters!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I love this author. There is not one book that i wouldn't buy with her name on it. Her heroines are so strong that the males have to do everything to catch her attention. I love it. The mysteries in Quicks regency's are very entertaining and keep you turning pages to find out who did it."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Pretty good book. In the same formula as many of her books, but then again how many different ways can you write about romance?"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Knowing her family needs money, photographer Venetia Milton obtains a gig at isolated Arcane House where she plans to seduce her employer Gabriel Jones. She succeeds on both parts, but feels despondent when she has to leave as she believes she is in love. However, not long afterward, she reads in the newspaper that her beloved died.Feeling like a widow, Venetia pretends that she and Gabriel were married. To her shock, Gabriel arrives at her home. Apparently, he arranged his death to fool his enemies who want his secrets that he possesses as the current ancestor of an alchemist who formed a clandestine society to study psychic phenomena; Venetia hides the fact that she sees auras from her \\"guest\\". As they fall in love, they team up to uncover killers, blackmailers, and thieves who covet both their secrets in a world filled with masquerades in which SECOND SIGHT can prove misleading.This is a delightful Victorian romantic suspense with a touch of the paranormal. The story line balances the kissing scenes with the perilous escapades so that the audience obtains a quick-paced fun thriller. Venetia is a wonderful protagonist struggling with her secrets including her desire for her \\"late\\" employer while Gabriel battles his enemies but has revised his life goals as he reciprocates his employee's desires. Historical romance fans will enjoy this charming couple who either are in the fire or causing the fire.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I'm so disappointed. I always look forward to an Amanda Quick book, although the last several haven't been her best.I can't believe this book was written by Jayne Ann Krentz! The characters were flat and had no life in them. There was nothing to show why the hero and heroine loved each other. The villan was boring and unrealized and the storyline uninteresting. I finished the book hoping for improvements but they never appeared.Sadly, I felt nothing for Gabriel and Venetia. Based on the first chapter I thought I was going to like Venetia but it turned out otherwise. Once she went to London she became hard and a bit unfeeling. I couldn't believe her reaction to Gabriel being alive and not dead - it was as though the woman in the first chapter had vanished and been replaced by this unfeeling person. Her attitude was that he should go away and let her focus on her business. She often unknowingly relayed that disinterested feeling to others. Again, a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Why do I feel that I have read this book before?Could it be because the protaganists are the same characters as in ALL the previous titles by this author? Or maybe because we have the pretend wife/widow plot AGAIN? Or even because there is a secret society of an archaelogical nature -as in the VANZA books?The whole thing is just a mish-mash of previously used ideas thrown together under a new title and with new names.For all that, it is readable. Certainly a great deal better that the Lavinia/Tobias series which I found to be a dead bore!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Photographer Venetia Milton takes the job to photograph the artifacts at Arcane House and spends one memorable night with Gabriel Jones only to be spirited away when intruders threaten their safety. Later the newspapers report that Mr. Jones has been killed. Venetia becomes Mrs. Jones to aid in her business as a fashionable London photographer. She is surprised to find that the death of Mr. Jones has been exaggerated when he arrives on her doorstep. He plans to protect her from the villian who has killed in order to steal an artifact. The two pretend to be married in the eyes of society as they begin the search for the killer.Quick has put together another intriguing couple and the supporting characters are intriguing. The paranormal aspects of the books have distinct similarities to the books written under her pseudonym Jayne Castle. The Victorians interest in the occult or paranormal is effectively interwoven into the novel. Overall, this is an exciting reading adventure."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Nice book to escape into. I always look forward to reading Amanda Quick and this book didn't disappoint me."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF SIMILARITY IN HER BOOKS AND THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE MORE PREDICTABLE THAN MOST BUT I JUST LOVE HER CHARACTERS. I ENJOY THE INTERACTION AND THAT THE WOMEN ARE USUALLY WITTY AND SELF POSSESSED. THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS ARE RIGHT ON TARGET. THIS IS NOT HER BEST BUT IT IS PRETTY GOOD AND I ALWAYS ENJOY THE WORLD SHE CREATES."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"If ever there were a book in need of copy-editing, it is this one. Averages one error per page. Compound sentences joined with \\"but\\"? No comma. Introductory adverbial clauses? No comma following.To read something so flawed physically is to destroy what may be inherent goodness."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Amanda Quick [Jayne Ann Krentz] has moved on to the Arcane Society and the early Victorian era. I enjoyed it - and found it amusing that the heroine was planning her own 'fall from grace'. It is an excellent book and an enjoyable read - but if I was only allowed one Quick book to take on a plane trip there are others I would pick first."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I love JAK contemporary novels and her \\"Jayne Castle\\" novels. I have been about 75/25 for the Amanda Quick novels as a whole but this one is right up to her form and takes into consideration both the historical time period as well as the paranormal elements.I read \\"White Lies\\" in hard back so I already knew something about the Arcane Society. The story opens with Gabriel and Caleb Jones, cousins, uncovering some amazing artifacts that an ancestor left behind including his own skeleton, books and a strongbox with a journal that has an alleged formula for increasing psychic powers!! The cousins enlist members of the village to help them load things and, of course, one of the villagers is greedy and steals the journal.We flip a few months ahead to where the lovely Miss Venetia Milton, an up and coming photographer, is taking photographs at the Arcane Society mansion of the many ancient books and antiques that they have including the strongbox. She is escorted by Gabriel Jones. Venetia finds herself very attracted to Mr. Jones who is also intrigued by Miss Milton. Venetia is almost 30 and beyond the \\"marriageable age\\" so she is looking for adventure and passion. She doesn't believe in marriage as her father set a poor example (explained later in the story) and thus is hoping that the \\"heat\\" she sees in Mr. Jones' eyes is some reciprocal attraction.Venetia is successful in seducing Gabriel -- or does he seduce her? However, Venetia also has \\"second sight\\" and senses strangers in the woods headed for the mansion. Mr. Jones summons his servants and sends them and Venetia out through a secret tunnel while he chases after the two strangers. Venetia with her handsome commission from the Arcane photographs goes to London with her aunt, sister, brother and housekeeper to setup a photo gallery.The comedy, complexities, mysteries and romance that then ensue are just fascinating. I read this book straight through and thought it was just great fun. There were enough plot turns to keep the reader guessing as to which person wanted the formula and plenty more twists on how all would be resolved.A fun but intriguing read!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Fabulous as always. I think these novels just get better and better. This one was a little easier to work out \\"who done it\\" than the others but still a fantastic read. I just wish Amanda Quick released more than one novel per year!!!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I love that I never feel \`had' when I buy a hardcover book by Amanda Quick since her writing is always so consistantly good.When Venetia Milton, a spunky photographer who believes herself to be on the shelf seduces her employer, it isn't just her psychic gifts she's keeping secret. But that's okay because Gabriel Jones has secrets of his own. Venetia is Amanda's standard spunky female lead and Gabriel is her standard alpha male trying to disguise himself as a Beta.One of the aspects that I found so interesting in this book is that she brought some of the characteristics from her Jayne Castle futuristic books into this historical thereby setting up a world view that is continuous across her genres. I would love to see her further pursue this line of thought and more firmly connect characters from her Amanda Quick world to her Jayne Castle world."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I was surprised by all the positive reviews of this book; it averaged one star with my book club. This is the 2nd Amanda Quick book I have read (the first being \\"With this Ring\\") and there is no comparison between the two. I really enjoyed her first book, but with \\"Second Sight\\", it felt like reading a different author entirely. The characters were bland, the dialogue repetitive, and there was no sexual tension whatsoever. This is light reading with a capital L. I'm going to try another of her older books, I hope it isn't as boring as this one."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I like Amanda Quick's books (and also the books she writes as Jayne Castle). I think they're fun, lighthearted, amusing - even if they can be rather samey and a bit, well, cheesy.Second Sight seemed a little different to her other Regency/Victorian books.Although the basic story is the same - romance mixed in with a murder mystery and a bit of psychic/mesmerism included as well, like Wait Until Midnight and some other books, this one felt a little... well... stale.It started off a little differently, with the requisite giving up of virginity to tall, dark, handsome rugged stranger at the beginning of the book rather than halfway through, and somehow the rest of the book didn't quite ever catch my attention fully.Our heroine Venetia is a photographer and she has a special talent in that she is able to view people's auras. Gabriel Jones, the tall dark rugged man, is a secretive chappie who takes her virginity and then gets himself killed. Venetia pretends she's his widow so that she can make her way in her photographic business more successfully than being a spinster - but then Mr Jones turns up alive and they start investigating murders and missing relics. It's all similar stuff to that which Amanda Quick has churned out before, but it doesn't quite have the magic that some of her other books have.It's noticeable that the chapters are shorter in this book and that there aren't any real cliffhangers - things resolve quickly, moments of scary fighting only last a page or two, and the resolution trundles along as expected.Some of the vocabulary in this book is remarkably similar to that in Amaryllis that Jayne Ann Krentz wrote as Jayne Castle. The \`hunting', \`primitive', \`throwback' descriptions of Gabriel Jones seem very like Rafe Stonebraker in that other novel; is she running out of ideas?Overall this book is a perfectly acceptable read, and none of her novels are great literature, but I usually find them better than this and Ghost Hunter, her latest Jayne Castle, was way better. This is still a step up from the Lavinia Lake books she wrote as Amanda Quick, though."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"outstanding book. Very good subject and very well written. I loved Venetia and her modern views."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"If you have enjoyed Amanda Quick other books you will find this one very entertaining. The characters are interesting and play off of each other well. The idea of both Gabriel and Venetia having paranormal abilities and both using them on each other was exciting. Both of their families were enjoyable to read about. I hope her next book is about Caleb, Gabriel's cousin."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I found this surprisingly good. I'm not much of a romance reader unless it is mixed with another genre, but I really liked this one. The characters were smart, funny, and endearing. The setting is historical with a touch of fantasy. The characters have some form of magical ability which they hide from society by being a part of the \\"Arcane society.\\" I thought the minor characters were so funny and sweet. Each was different and unique from each other. I'm looking forward to reading more in this series."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This was a pretty good story, and I really liked the interactions between the hero and heroine. I have always enjoyed Ms. Quick's characters, they are not your usual cookie cutter fare. This book is no exception, and it is very well written. I especially liked the elements of paranormal that were tied into the plot-and it was very smoothly done as well. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a touch of the supernatural in their romance, and also to all the readers like me, who will pick anything up with her name on it!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I've always been a fan of Amanda Quick's witty sense for verbal exchanges and amusing plots, but this is by far one of the worst romances I have ever read. The romance between the couple in unconvincing and unsubstanciated; the plot is silly and nonsensical. Do not read it; you'll be disappointed. Try one of her earlier books, like Mystique, that's a bit more plausible."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Upon her parents' death and the resulting financial devastation to her family, it is up to the inimitable Venetia Milton to support her younger siblings and her aunt, else they become destitute. Forging a career as a much sought after photographer in a time when women rarely hold jobs in male dominated professions, Venetia finally manages to obtain a job that will secure her family's fiscal well-being for some time, even allowing an advantageous move to London.Knowing a widow will be better received in Polite Society than an unmarried woman, she invents a late husband, adopting the last name of Gabriel Jones, the man who showed her one night of passion before his untimely demise. The plot succeeds better than she ever expected, and soon she is the toast of the town, an acclaimed photographer in high demand by the most fashionable names in London's elite society.But the unexpected rival of the very much alive Mr. Jones on her doorstep threatens her carefully laid plans, while the danger that follows him threatens her very life!This is the first book from Amanda Quick I have yet read. I was quite excited to read a book by this much lauded author, and the plot for Second Sight struck me as a story well aligned with my reading tastes. With a blend of the paranormal romance amidst a Victorian era setting, it is the kind of tale that I would normally find myself riveted to.The plot was indeed well done, with some very intriguing \`whodunit' twists and a suspenseful story that keeps the reader guessing until the end of the book. Where the book missed, in my opinion, was in the character development. The prologue to the story starred the hero and another male character, and neither intrigued me throughout the prologue. In fact, I could not discern which of the two men was the hero.The first chapter introduced the heroine of the piece, Venetia Milton/Jones, and it is her character that the reader can empathize with first. Through her eyes, we are reintroduced to the hero, Gabriel Jones, and become more interested in this character as well. Both are likable, attractive people, and I genuinely wanted to see them together, but found my excitement for the match dampened by the consistent formality between the pair, even while in the throes of passion.There was almost no real character development for the cast of supporting characters, including Venetia's family, who are present in many scenes. Throughout the first half of the book, these characters remained largely one dimensional, only becoming slightly more interesting in the second half of the book as we saw a bit more of their personalities. Still, having finished the book, I cannot tell you much about something so minor as Venetia's family's physical descriptions, beyond that her sister is 16 years of age and her brother is somewhat younger.With the lack of character development, I felt disconnected to these characters and the story. I could have put the book down at any time and not wondered again what had happened to them.Since reading Amanda Quick's Second Sight, I have discussed my impressions with friends who have also read her work, and they have found the same issues with newer books that I experienced in this one. Based on their opinions of her earlier works, I would like to give one of her older stories a read, as I understand those books did not suffer from the same lack of character development. If the characters are as well-fleshed in the older books as the mystery was in this one, they will be worth giving this author a second chance."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I gave it 4 stars but if available, I would give it 4-1/2 stars. Ms. Krentz never disappoints. I enjoyed this book as I have all of her previous books. I love her sense of humor, and the personality quirks she gives her characters as well as the strength and intelligence she gives all of her female characters. I love that I learn something new about the era she is writing about in every book. I anxiously await the second book in this series."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"It didn't take me long to read this historic romantic suspense novel. Amanda Quick has a way with prose that draws the reader into each chapter alongside the characters.In \\"Second Sight\\", photographer Venetia Milton has a romantic encounter with Gabriel Jones, heir to the Arcane Society, immediately after which she is whisked away to safety while he stays to try and capture intruders before they can steal any valuable artifacts. After reading that Gabriel has supposedly been killed, she moves with her family to Victorian London, using the alias of the widowed Mrs. Jones when she sets up her studio. What follows is a fun bit of suspense, a love story, and a tale of psychical powers all rolled into one."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I do have to preface this review by saying that I am extremely biased towards Amanda Quick books. Love her storylines, interaction between characters, quick dialoge, I could go on. However I was a bit nervous about this story, as I really liked her Regency novels, but I am not a big fan of the Victorian Era. But she came though again. Her heroine was plucky and quick-witted and brave and very take charge. Her hero was powerful and confident. Venetia Milton was a photographer (unusual profession for a woman in the Victorian era) with a family to take care of. She was the sole breadwinner in her family consisting of herself, her aunt and her younger sister and brother. She had no time to persue relationships so the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get herself ravished was too good to pass up. Her employer (and ravisher) Gabriel Jones had the eyes of a sorcerer. . . however soon after thier tryst, Venetia learns that he has died tragically. As a romantic whimsy to pay tribute to him, she takes on the guise of Mrs. Jones, a young widow and goes to London to pursue her career. However, Mr. Jones is not dead, and the people who wanted him that way, may now be interested in Venetia. The story gets better from there with nosy interferring family members and secrets aplenty.

The problem here is that I really wanted one when I bought this book. On the other hand the story'll keep you reading and trying to guess what'll be in the next page."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Late in the reign of Queen Victoria.....Gabriel Jones and his cousin Caleb uncover the remains of their mysterious ancestor and the founder of the Arcane Society in an ancient lab in a remote area of England. Their ancestor, an alchemist, was a believer in the paranormal and cloaked himself in mystery. Many members of the present day Arcane Society believe he took the formula for a mysterious potion among other treasures with him to his grave. When the cousins hire an upcoming photographer Miss Venetia Milton to photograph the relics in the alchemists lab, someone breaks in and steals a notebook written in code that may hold the secrets to the mysterious formula. Venetia must make a living for her family, but when she meets Gabriel she decides to seduce him knowing it may be the only chance she ever gets to taste passion. Shortly after she and Gabriel make love, intruders break in and Gabriel sends her off to London through a secret passage. Months later after not hearing from Gabriel, Venetia reads in the paper that he perished in a fire on the night she left him. To protect her image she assumes the identity of Gabriel's widow. Weeks later to Venetia's surprise a very much alive Gabriel arrives on her doorstep demanding she play out the role of his wife. It seems he faked his death to weed out those who stole the notebook and now Venetia is in danger from their enemies. What starts is a mysterious adventure to uncover the villians and Gabriel and Venetia's must reveal their own paranormal abilities to solve the mystery.I felt that the first two chapters of this book started out with a rush, promising to be a passionate, thrilling book. What happened is the story went downhill from there. The passion faded, the mysterious formula never really is explained (we're supposed to know what it does?) and some of the characters just didn't make sense. For example, the villan takes on a disguise and it is explained he intended to live out his life with this disguise but that just wasn't logical. (If I say more it would ruin it for the reader) His disguise was of a nature that it could have only been pulled off temporarily and his motivations just didn't ring true. Also, what happened to Caleb? HE's in the story at first but then nothing more is mentioned about him...wouldn't it seem logical that he too is in danger....and Gabriel's paranormal abilities just kind of seem downplayed....I expected a lot after the beginning but it just didn't deliver. Its not a bad book but it just started off so good and then left me hanging that I just couldn't give it more than 3 stars. I will read one more in the series to see if it improves but if it doesn't get better that will be the last."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I have read several of the Amanda Quick books and although some are very interesting Second Sight is extremely boring.

Frankly, I was disappointed in the book. I am a die hard fan of \\"Amanda Quick/Jayne Anne Krentz/ Jayne Castle, but....Yes, I do feel it was worth reading, but not in hardback. This book has interesting characters, an intersesting sub-plot with the Arcane Society going on, but it just felt like a longer book that had been whittled down for publishing purposes. The characters did not have the depth most of her books offer and the plot was a bit lame- just didn't feel like it was more than a detailed outline."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Set in the Regency era. Miss Venetia Milton's parents died over a year ago in a train wreck. Since then Venetia has had the responsibility of providing for her maiden aunt, Beatrice Sawyer, her sixteen-year-old sister, Amelia, and her nine-year-old brother, Edward. Having an excellent talent for photography, Venetia had made due. But when the Arcane Society employed her to photograph its collection of relics and artifacts things began looking up. The Arcane Society paid extremely well and in advance. Venetia left Bath, traveled to meet her new employer, Gabriel Jones, and earn her pay.Venetia and Gabriel knew each other less than a week. During the last time together they were intimate. Before they could speak about any possible future together, they were interrupted by two men attempting to steal a two-hundred-year-old strongbox. Gabriel had his coachman take Venetia to safety before going to hunt his prey.Gabriel Jones was a Hunter. The Arcane Society members consisted of secretive, reclusive eccentrics who were obsessed with the arcane and uncanny. Gabriel's psychical abilities made him a predator, a hunter. Once the two would-be thieves were taken care of, Gabriel decided to let people believe he was dead. However, three months later, when he learned Venetia had opened a gallery in London and has been portraying herself as his widow, he knew that she had unwittingly placed herself in grave danger. Gabriel had no choice but to pretend to be Venetia's returned-from-the-dead husband and move in with her family to keep her safe.**** Let me say first off that you should NOT read the first four books of this series in order of release. Instead, read them in the order events happened. Read in the following order:SECOND SIGHT, Book OneTHE THIRD CIRCLE, Book FourWHITE LIES, Book twoSIZZLE & BURN, Book ThreeI found this story to be very exciting. This author writes in such a way that the impossible suddenly sounds very possible and totally logical. Not many authors can pull this off.

It was a good deal only because of the book. A great one by the way, maybe not as good as some hit of Clancy's but still one of my favorite, good story line with a scary resemblance to reality. So that book deserve a five star for me. So does Rainbow Six so far(not over yet)."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"This was the first Tom Clancy novel that I have read and was something that I would have expected from him, given what I've heard about him. What makes this novel so intriguing is that it is a real and forseeable possibility. Clancy has really &quot;hit the nail on the head&quot; so to speak. The reader is constantly wondering who it is that financed the terrorist attack in New York City. For those of you who have seen/read Patriot Games, Politika has a similarly tenseful and action filled ending. The novel does leave a few questions unanswered, but they could potentially be answered in later versions of &quot;power plays&quot;.

I especially liked the Time Square part! That was extremely exciting. This is the first book that I have read from Tom Clancy. It seems to be a solid novel. With a very good ending. Although the ending was predictable, it was good. This is definitely something that could happen in the real world. I would recommend this book to others to read. The beginning requires some patience, but it is worth it.

The writing was lean and tough with a hard-boiled edge. The characters had depth, and their dialogue crackled with humor. The scenes built around the terrorist attack in New York -- I won't spoil things by giving away any more about it -- were especially powerful, largely because one gets the feeling they could happen in the real world. With this first book in what hopefully will be an ongoing series, Mr. Clancy is moving into new territory with assurance."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"The best part about it is that it is short. Shame on Tom Clancy for allowing his name to be put on this worthless novel."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"I read this book because first I thought it would be a nice book. As i read the beginning it was pretty interesing because the president of Russia dies from an illness. After he died the story of the book goes too slow. It makes you read so much to get one information and there were too many difficult words. Later on the story gets interesting again when the terrorist are blowing up U.S. Then the story keeps on going with a character named Gordian, in which he finally findes out the bad guy. I think the book wasn't that bad, but it also had some parts where you learn about planning missions to get something blown up. The good thing of this book was that you could learn many of those hard words if you really look for the definitions. For me, it was pretty hard for me to read. I know that I should recommend this book to the people who are smart. Also, one thing that was really hard for me was when I din't know the names of several weapons. I think this novel is just right for soldiers to read. So i don't really know if I could really recommend to a reagular reader like me.

Good book but don't read the next powerplays."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"I'm still confused about who wrote this: Tom Clancy? Martin Greenberg? Whoever did it, it seems less like a good, thick Clancy-style thriller and more like someone pretending to be Clancy, hoping to fool his readers. While the story isn't all that bad, and sometimes the writing actually gets you involved (I know the terrorist act that occurs midway through was enough to make me shiver at the concept), the main problem here is the characters.There is not a single character that I truly care about or can really distinguish from another character. To make it worse, Politika constantly adds new characters, which just adds to the confusion. I found myself constantly flipping back and forth, wondering who this most recent character was and why he was important, and why he was different from another character. There are also several characters introduced early on in the book and who reappear every hundred pages or so, but you have no idea what they're doing or why.While your usual Clancy novel generally has a huge cast, your usual Clancy novel also ties them together in a coherent way, and makes you actually care about them (even if you know they're going to die in two pages), and Politika fails on both of those counts."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"Politika is a book that has an intriguing plot, with different exciting events woveninto it.

The book is a rather grand book for those who haven't read a Tom Clancy style book before. I say his style as it's not truly his writing, at least the majority of it.

Read it!"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"This book isn't a horrible book, but not what people have come to expect from Clancy. First, the complaints. This book's biggest weakness is it's bad habit of jumping around, and jamming characters in for the entirity of three pages. Obviously, those characters aren't given much opportunity for development, and even some of the major characters seem to be either flat or generic. Also, the plotline,while serviceable, has been done before, and better, and there are many mediocre subplots. On to the good point. This book has some very exciting moments, especially during the (Potential spoiler)terrorist attack on New York. The rest of the book, however, tends to be dog slow. All in all, it's an OK book, but not on par with previous Clancy efforts."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"Super-vigilante Roger Gordian's private army sweeps the world fighting the forces of evil.

In his earlier series, Op-Center, he at least followed his own style of writing. Without his name on the cover, I could have never guessed he wrote it. The only way it is remotely like any other Clancy books is that it is a definite rip-off of the first Op-Center book. Read them both and look at the similarities: the man who loses his wife (Gregory Donald in Op-Center, the chief of police in Politika), the bombing (a convention in Seoul, New Year's in Times Square). This was not very good, at least not enough to read more than once. It had good points, but overall, he has written much better."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"This is bad. Really bad. I could expect this from another author, but Tom Clancy? Sometimes I wonder if he actually writes these series of books (Op-Center and Power Plays.)

I don't drop it in the middle. No matter how boring a book is, there is sometime a single page or paragraph or sentence which can justify the reading of that book. That holds true for most of the books but, sorry, not this one. I read this book from cover to cover and wondered for a long time how a writer of Calncy's reputation can produce such a book. It triggered an old and recurring thought in my mind; it's everybody's right to make as much money as he or she wishes but should he or she compromise the quality to make that money?"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"I have read almost all of Clancy's books and none have even been as close to a total bomb as this one.

Something like this Clancy would have loked into and realized that that is so ludicrouse an element that he would throw it out immediately. In short, don't buy this book, I would be ashamed to have my name on it, and I hope Clancy is."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"The storyline of the book is good but very underdeveloped, as well as seemingly rushed at the end.

I don't believe that this book lived up to Mr. Clancy's paotintial. Usually his books are full of information and insight on the world of polotics and warfare. I think he could of taken the idea of the book to the full potential. Presumably part of his problem was that the book is made for his new computer gamde with the name Politika. I found this bit of information at the back of the book after finishing it. There was a little add of about 10 pages of information about how the game works, where to buy it, and how to play it.the story begins with the presumable death of President Yelstin in office. The death leaves Russia in political chaos and an economic downfall which causes the loss of food for piple of Russia. Looking for assistance, the Russians turn to the Americans for help. The Americans offer food and maney to the Russians. Meanwhile you meet the main character of the book, Roger Gordain who is a self made millionaire. Roger was a fighter pilot in Vietnam where he was shot down by a missle and taken hostage. After being released, he felt that there was a need for a adavanced targeting and radar system in planes. He developed the most advanced and cheapest system in the world. This earned him millions and put hes firm at the top of communication groups. He is now working on global commmunications and is setting up a ground station in west Russia.The biggest event in the novel and probaly the worst event to think about, is the terrorist bombing in Times Square on the dawn of the millenium, New Years eve December 31, 1999. After the bombing the explosivesare traced to a soviet munitions plant. This is whin the saftey-concerened Roger Gordian decides to take matters into his own hands.

I liked it though. It was definately not written by Clancy himself: he needs more words to tell a story and the sex and violence are more explicit than in his own books. It is a fast read, the plot is exciting and not every hero is invincible (things that can't be said of Clancy's latest work &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;). One point of criticism: if Clancy gets so much help from other people to write a book (see the Preface), he should be able to find a person who can speak and write the Russian language properly."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"This book was fast paced-paced and exciting.

Well, he didn't. If the cover says &quot;Tom Clancy&quot;, then he wrote it. If it says, as Politika does, &quot;Tom Clancy's&quot;, then he only created the concept, possibly gave the real writer an outline. That's all.

It was horrible! I could have read any other book by Clancy. Gee another disaster hits America? Sum of All Fears? Clancy probably just cut and pasted this story out of his hard drive. The characters are one dimensional, the plot is laughable, and most importantly, I was unsatisfied with the reasons enumerated by the author as to why a corporation would need a militia.

The characters are poorly developed, the plot is poorly laid out, the action is poorly described. In summary,this doesn't even deserve a token scanning.

The characters jump from one place to another in such disconnected fashion that I found myself not caring for any of them. To me the story was predictable and--dare I say it--boring. There is none of the depth that early Clancy books possess. I had the feeling, like with Michael Crichton's &quot;Airframe&quot;, that this book was written for one reason: to make money via sequals, cd ROM's, and a movie. This does not make for good writing!"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"This book is a disgrace to the Clancy name and really is throwaway tripe. The wafer-thin plot, which could have been written by any schoolkid in a creative writing lesson, leaves a lot to be desired; and is in no way a geopolitical &quot;powerplay&quot; as the title suggests, and although the concept of a terrorist destabilising governments is not new, a real Clancy book would give it a twist, have detailed brinkmanship, deals, bluff and blackmail; this book misses out huge chunks of the process and is worse as a result. The characters are not developed particularly well, and the main hero is entirely unbelievable, as is his private army and desire to meddle incessantly with world affairs. His crack team's superiority to the whole of the American intelligence aparatus is suspect, but their ability to be able to take out any number of armed bad guys using only stun guns and without harming them at all is totally uncovincing. The various climatic battle scenes take only a few pages, and are very badly written, with very rapid and unconvincing resolutions as soon as the goodies arrive. The book is at least, short; though if the politics, battle and detective story were better written it could expand and be better as a result. The only good bit is the mass destruction of the terrorist attack, but, thinking about it, it is precisely the kind of attack which couldn't realistically happen.In summary then; this is nothing like a good Clancy book. It is terrible, and as long journey fodder is only marginally preferable to staring at the seat in front. Read any proper Clancy book, or a proper thriller; not this feeble attempt at imitation of the master."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"This is less interesting than most of Clancy's works, and since he appears to be making money hand over fist, you'd think he could afford a fact-checker.

I also own the computer game, which is taking me a while to figure out, but I'll get there! Anyway, the story is a good one. Yeltsin dies, and a massive famine hits Russia. Desperate Russian communist sympathisers bomb Millennium celebrations in NYC(this bit is brilliantly portrayed, hence a 3 star rating) and Roger Gordian, a millionnaire with a crisis-hit marriage(work, work, work) sends his private mercenaries armed with an assortment of high-tech gadgets into Russia to locate the perpetrators. The action scenes are undeniably entertaining, but the narrative is very poor in many places. Did we really need the policeman's graphic self-pity dragging on about his dead wife? That bit was so incredibly cliched and nicked from OP-CENTER(re: Gregory Donald) An unnecessary subplot distracting the readers from the real players(Gordian's private army and the Russians.) For instance, there are way too many references to TV, movies, actors and personalities to suggest a plotline or character study to a reader. As a reader and an aspiring writer myself, I've learned the hard way myself about this folly(thankyou to various critics and agents for pointing me in the right direction, wannabe writers take note!), it does not work. But Clancy can get away with anything, so it seems. Anyway, I'm glad this book came free with the game because I would not waste money on it. Ah well, I'm going to go back to reading Michael diMercurio, Dale Brown, and Stephen Coonts, to name but a few, REAL authors with PROPER storylines!

I couldn't get enough of his work. Sadly, I no longer make the claim. I think the crossroads started with the Op's Center series and now the Power Plays.I purchased this book probably ten years ago and just now read it. I could have waited another ten and not missed anything. If you buy this online (no matter how low the price is) look at the actual author. It isn't Tom Clancy, it's Jerome Peisler(?). On the cover of the book read the fine print carefully; CREATED BY Tom Clancy and Martin Greenberg. Clancy might have proofed this book, but he sure didn't write it. I felt cheated.There is none of the driving suspenseful style in the aforementioned works. This book is flat at best and lackluster.I can remember reading his earlier books, racing through them to find out what Jack Ryan or any of his characters were stirring-up and how they would end.

Well, what do you expect from a book based on a Stargey Game...?"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"All you need to have a big story is in it!!!A sinister plot altogether with the corresponding villains and their masterminds. There's outrage at the heineous terrorist attack, there's grief about the loss of innocent life. There's action. There's suspense. You even have a glimpse at the usual superweapons, although this time those of a non-lethal sort.But all those things simply fail to make a coherent story. No one in its right mind would go to a fistfight handcuffed or with his right hand strapped to his back.No one save some very stupid or very chivalrous or very heroic person.(Ain't they all the same?) But that's exactly what happens.There are some merits to this book however.Most of Clancy's books are about American interests, this goes beyond and realizes that peace and prosperity cannot be achieved if regional political considerations supersede the need for global stability and therefore the former Warsaw Pact nations have to be supported in their transition away from totalitarism and populism.So therefore the \`invention\` of a large communications-company which sees beyond the brim of short-term profit and tries to defuse potentially harmfull developments worldwide. A little idealistical maybe but not wrong in the mindset unless you deal in weapons.It's more a mediocre teleplay script than a really good book. But it doesn't deserve 1-s nor merit high grades.

It is such a compelling concept that I couldn't help but buying it.The first few chapters did not disappoint, as the plot moved quickly and set up much suspense. After the beginning, however, this disintegrated and the novel degraded into a sleep stimulator. By half way through this garbage it became a tedious snooze fest only useful for inducing a catatonic like sleep or as an ineffectual paperweight!This novel was such a disappointment, mainly because it had so much potential.

This book takes a long time to move along-unless 100 pages is acceptable to you-and only sparked my interest due to the New Years bombing. This isn't as bad as the newer Rainbow Six( which bites a lot).

The action sequences were well written. The overall plot is intriguing. It has the elements that would make a great start to a series of action novels.But it's missing a few things. It's missing a central character. There were several candidates, from the head of the Sword organization, to some of the team leaders for Sword. The police commissioner from New York was also a good candidate. But none of these characters were ever fleshed out enough to be considered the protagonist. The story moved in an orderly fashion, but the conflict that was central to the book was rather bland. There were no surprises and it was generally very predictable.In addition, the language and adult content simply detract more from the book. This has the potential to be a good series, but after reading the first novel, I'm not hopeful."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Power Plays: Politika","review":"Very dull.

I read this book from cover to cover and wondered for a long time how a writer of Calncy's reputation can produce such a book.

The third story in it, &quot;Melanctha&quot;, which is an adaption of her earlier &quot;Q.E.D.&quot;, has caused much controversy, mainly due to its racist remarks and stereotypical representations of African - Americans. It is what lies beyond this, however, that distinguishes &quot;Melanctha&quot; from 19th C novels and renders it one of the most important works within the Modernist canon. In her typical style of a &quot;continuous present&quot; and her free usage of a pseudo-vernacular she describes the relationship of Melanctha, a mulatta, with Dr. Jefferson Campbell, also a mulatto. Their struggle &quot;to understand&quot; is a battle of different modes of perception and thus connects the book to Stein's most important teacher, William James. Despite its racist depiction of African Americans, this book is a must for all interested in the beginning of Modernism presented by Gertrude Stein."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"This is not a great novella or a set of great short stories but it is a very fascinating use of prose to create drama and intense feelings. Readers expecting to discover another Tolstoy will be very disappointed. Her writing style is very unusual but she does not write great novels. Hemingway and Katherine Porter claim that she influenced their work. She probably did; but, she is a writer's writer presenting unusual structure and prose. She is not a great novelist.Stein published 26 books starting with this collection of three stories in 1909. This is her first book and she self published only 500 hard copies. She had to fight with the publisher to get it published her way. He wanted to make it more conventional. It was not written as a novel aimed at wide popular sales. She was seeking a smaller and a more critical audience.When it was written, she had left Baltimore and was living in Paris on money inherited from her father. She had the luxury of being able to do whatever she wanted. As a result, she bought paintings and wrote experimental fiction.This is a collection of three short stories. This particular book has an excellent introduction by Professor Ann Charters plus it has Q.E.D., which is another very brief collection of short stories and under 50 pages.What is she doing here? She uses very simple characters, stereotypes really, as a vehicle to try out her experimental prose. It is not stream of consciousness - that was made famous by Joyce a few years later - but rather it is repetition of blocks of prose to create mood. She got the idea of repetition from painters who use repetitive brush strokes to create paintings. It sounds like an odd ball idea but it is original and effective.There are three short stories here: The Good Anna, Melanctha, and The Gentle Lena. The first and last are about young German immigrant women and their struggle to control and be controlled, either by men or other women.The most dramatic work and the longest is the over 100 page novella, Melanctha. This describes a very turbulent relationship between a young black doctor and the mixed race, half black, Melanctha, in Bridgeport. They have a conflicted relationship filled with stress. Stein manages to effectively bring the stress to the reader by repeating blocks of their conversations with just slight changes, paragraph to paragraph. After a while the reader feels that they are in the room with the arguing couple.So, is this a great novel? No. But it is a highly original and interesting use of prose to create the intense mood of the story. It is considered by many as a milestone in American literature. Stein was tempted to follow in the tracks set by Henry James, but in the end struck her own unique chord.Of her 26 works, this is the first and one of her four most important works. The other three are Tender Buttons (1914), The Making of Americans (1925), and The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933). The last was a best seller and brought her widespread fame.For a good selection of her works, there is a 736 page collection by Vintage, March 17, 1990, ISBN-10: 0679724648 or ISBN-13: 978-0679724643 which contains all the good Stein works including Melanctha."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"This is an important work of literature. The use of language to tell stories beyond what can typically be told in narrative was radical at the time. Students of early 20th Century American literature, students of gender studies, students of American studies should all be required to read it. Not an uplifting book and certainly not a book to recommend to your friends who spend more time watching TV and going to movies than reading.There is a controversy surrounding the book's central character named Melanctha. It is unfortunate that television dominates culture in this era. It would seem that when a work of literature depicts a black person, a typical reader expects Cliff Huxtable to appear in one of his dandy sweaters to dispense advice to one of his children in DKNY clothing. Or readers of popular literature (books with bumpy covers) become offended when African American characters do not resemble one of Alice Walker's or Alex Haley's romanticized figures.Melanctha is realistic. She is most likely a composite of many of the women with whom Stein came in contact while studying medicine in urban Baltimore. Melanctha's tragedy is that her intellect will go to waste because she is black and because she is a woman. Her sin (to some readers) seems to be that she talks like a black woman from Baltimore at that time would talk. So don't buy this book if you are offended by the way black people acted or German people acted (there is a story about German immigrants, as well) in Baltimore in the early 20th century.If you are a fan of popular literature...Haley, Alice Walker, and the Cosby show are probably more up your alley. If you are interested in a very interesting experimental work from early 20th Century, by a woman who took her appreciation of post-impressionist art and tried to apply it to literature...this is it."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not. The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best. Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book. It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"read the other reviews and youll be surprised by the violent reactions of people to this book. richard wright, black activist and author, praised this book as the &quot;first true representation of an african-american in american literature&quot; and yet another famous activist labeled it &quot;senseless racist drivel&quot;What in the book provokes this controversy?The question is complex. Though Stein in all three stories uses words like &quot;black&quot; and&quot;german&quot; as undeniable stereotypes, there is no denying that these categories get deconstructed by the narrative and the style.If your read books for style, you cant go wrong here. Stein's experimental prose is poetry set to music, exploring all the auditory limits of the english language.There are 3 stories, The Good Anna, Melanctha and The Gentle Lena.The controversy is mainly about the second story. Not that the other stories dont have their issues. Eg: The Gentle Lena is probably one of the weirdest characters you will EVER see in fiction.So, buy this book and treat yourself to some pleasure in the english language!"},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"The trouble with the avant-garde is that they set themselves up to say that anyone who doesn't like what they do is, well, totally square. At the same time, those who convince themselves that they appreciate it in the correct way can lord it over the rest of us naifs.After having heard about this book for years from a dear Stein-devotee pal, I gave it a try. I must say that, not only was I disappointed in the so-called language experimentation, but I was just plain bored. I did not find the characters interesting; I did not get taken into their world view by the stream-of-consciousness writing style that is Stein's trademark; I did not feel like I learned anything. What truly convinced my pal that I am an artistic philistine - and I guess I am in her measure - is that I vastly preferred The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, which was written for a popular audience (this is, clearly written and not with all the obscure and in my view idioitic word play).Oh well, this review will no doubt get many \\"unhelpful\\" votes, but then, at least I looked at it honestly and and naively and gave it the effort an avant-garde classic deserves. NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"Returning to THREE LIVES after several years, I am again reminded of Stein's stylistic innovation and topical audacity. These are stories of working class women, one African American and two whose European heritage is still marked as &quot;ethnic&quot;, who live with modest hopes and even more modest contentment. Watching Stein imagine a narrative voice to these women of spotty education and limited worldview is itself important. This is not the stream-of-consciousness of Joyce or Faulkner, but rather a subject-verb-predicate world of simple people. That Stein can reflect emotional complexity and intellectual anxiety with a style that would seem well-suited to a reading primer speaks not only of her ability, but indeed might undercut the utility of more affected literary devices. Stein is forging into then largely ignored life and so it should come as no suprise that this book doesn't appeal to most. But there is something here that merits our attention"},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"This collection of three novellas is indicative of a major turn in avant-garde of American literature. Gertrude Stein's prose here functions through its lacuna's and omissions; it is minimalist in content, but her command of dialect is truly accomplished. Melanctha is the finest work here-the story of a black woman and her relationship in a society that hates her. Of course Stein has been accused of employing stereotypes-but such a critique fails to really live the text in its complexity. I can't say the other two works are as strong, Stein feels almost restrained in her commitment to the vernacular. Nevertheless, this is a seminal work."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"This may have been a groundbreaking piece of work in speaking in the vernacular of people of the American lower classes, but now it reads as a little stilted and (especially in the case of the middle story, about a black woman who grew up fatherless and who tries to find and make a life with an intellectual man) a little condescending toward her own characters.Clearly, the stories are meticulously crafted; she meant them to be this way. She just never gets inside the minds of her characters, treating them like marionettes on sticks instead of living within them, even for the few dozen pages of each story.I have to admit, I couldn't stop thinking, \\"You know, Henry James would have moved this along by now.\\" That may not be fair, and it's not like these stories are unreadable, not by a long stretch, but they're the literary equivalent of those hour-long documentaries on late night cable news stations: the camera-eye shows more sympathy than empathy, and it's understood from the get-go that a good end isn't really on the table for any of these characters."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"If you like experimental language and can still be surprised by linguistic expressions you thought to be impossible, you have come to the right place - get this book and read \\"Three Lives\\". It is a wonderful collection of short stories about three different women who struggle with life each in their own way, and Gertrude Stein's descriptions express linguistically, what the souls of these girls go through: Torture, boredom, helplessness, violence, love, sexual desire. Has there ever before been such an emotional language? I doubt it. The edition by Mondial (ISBN 978-1595690425 or 1595690425) includes an introduction by \\"enfant terrible\\" Carl Van Vechten, an essayist and photographer, who knew Gertrude Stein very well and delivers an interesting insight into her way of writing (and living) and the history of this book."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"A complex collection of three stories about women all living in a fictional American town during the segregation era. Melanctha is by far the best of the three short stories, and can be considered a novella. The Good Anna is extremely humorous. I don't think many can appreciate the innovative technique Stein uses, but a great read if you are interested in the Lost Generation."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"I sort of get it that Stein went \\"pedal to the metal\\" to smash all of the writing and stylistic conventions of her time. She wrote about women, the poor, the mundane elements of life that make the bulk of our lives; all that was on the fringe and to the left of center of what was considered important to write about. I get it that this is groundbreaking. Stein and this work should be applauded and recognized as pioneering, experimental and something just plain new. Stein put it out there because other writers were probably too chicken-s_ _ t to try anything new and she said what the hell. She definitely deserves major credit for that but it is still not a good read. It is a wonderful read if you are a reader who is deeply into style and form and theme and can compare and realize just how different it is point by point. If you know what she was trying to do you'll love it otherwise it is pretty boring to read as stories. The writer pyrotechnic are the star and not the stories and characters themselves, so it is not good story telling. Virginia Wolff did it stylistically much better with \\"To the Lighthouse\\" years later, but there might not have been a \\"Too the Lighthouse\\" if first there was no \\"Three Lives\\". Someone had to do it first. Stein was rich and already living outside the \\"normal\\" it did not cost her much to smash conventions. The only things that are conventional though are the stereotypes she uses. Half white and lighter skinned blacks are smarter than darker blacks. College educated blacks speak in fragmented english. Darker black are characterized as lazy and manipulative and mean. Stein used all of her innovation on style and not substance."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"I derived a great deal of pleasure from reading this book. I &quot;became&quot; each of these women. I wanted to live their lives and experience what they were going through. I identified mostly with Lena. I don't think she was as stupid as everyone said - she's a much deeper character that doesn't quite know how to express herself.I wonder if women tend to identify with these characters more? I would love to see these made into a movie.The language was difficult to follow at times. The patterns and rhythms were in the way sometimes, but if you allow yourself to &quot;give in&quot; to it - you'll be fine."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"In &quot;3 Lives,&quot; Gertrude Stein recounts the life stories of three very different women living and dying in the city Bridgepoint. With &quot;The Good Anna,&quot; we learn the story of a German maid, who maintains the homes of various grand ladies throughout her life. She loves taking care of stray dogs and scolding young ladies into what she deems to be their proper stations. She also cultivates a strong friendship with the widow Mrs. Lehntman, the great &quot;romance&quot; of her life. (Though, it's never entirely clear what is meant by &quot;romance:' either a very strong friendship or an actual intimate relationship.)In &quot;Melanctha,&quot; we are related the history of a young black woman, bright and intelligent, who wants to learn more about life and love. She develops relationships with many different men but learns most of what she needs during her &quot;wanderings&quot; with Jane Harden. After a time, she finally decides to settle down and to get &quot;really married&quot; to the right man. She thinks she finds that in Dr. Jeff Campbell, but neither one knows exactly what he/she really wants.In the final story, &quot;The Gentle Lena,&quot; Lena is a young German girl, brought to the States by a cousin. She is considered ugly and dimwitted so no one in her new family really takes to her. All the girls taunt and tease her. Finally, she is et up in an arranged marriage to a man who doesn't really like women (though it's never said flat out whether or not he is gay). They have children, and the husband falls for the children, ignoring Lena completely.All three women wind up alone, forgotten and eventually dead. But, that's not what I really didn't like about this book. Stein's use of language tended to get in the way, so much so that I could never really understand what characters were saying and could never empathize with them. In fact, with &quot;Melanctha,&quot; their constant repetition of names and long-winded sentences that turn around on themselves to regurgitate what was said in the preceding sentences, made the characters seem simple-minded. I never liked any of the characters because I never felt that I was given anything to like. And, if I was, I had trouble discerning it through the tangle of words. I re-read passages many times simply to try to understand what was happening or what a character was feeling/thinking and never really understood. They came across very two-dimensional.I forced myself to finish the book but still would have trouble recommending it, mostly due to the use of language."},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"I have been an admirer of Gertrude Stein's work and chose &quot;Three Lives&quot; in good faith. I wound up discarding the book because of the content of the second story in it, entitled: &quot;Melanctha&quot;. The story concerns a woman of African descent. The language and content of the story is racist, blatantly so. Why did the publisher choose THIS volume for its Dover Thrift Edition when something far better could have been selected from Gertrude Stein's vast body of work? (And why did Gertrude Stein write something like this at all?)"},{"Title":"3 LIVES","review":"This was my first book I read by Gertrude Stein, and frankly, it will probably be my last. Her subject matter is bland and uninteresting. I understand her rejection of conventional prose, and she does have a unique style of writing, but I just don't like it. I can understand and appreciate why she wrote it the way she did, but it barely kept my attention. And her use of stereotypes was extremely blatant."},{"Title":"The Spirit of Christ","review":"The Spirit of Christ by Andrew Murray, even though originally written in the late 1800's, explores all aspects of the Holy Spirit. It helps the reader to discover God's purpose for the Holy Spirit in the believer's life.

No age range specified. This is an Easter book without a religious message, which widens the audience to include non-Christian homes that enjoy the Easter Bunny more than the resurrection myth. This may offend those religious parents who are more interested in the religion than in getting their child reading; they'll want to pass this one up.Dora and Boots go on a rainbow egg hunt with the help of the reader, who also helps out by scaring off Swiper, who is trying to swipe the eggs before they're found. There's one egg for each color of the rainbow, from red to purple. The eggs are hidden behind lift-able flaps, as are other items that feature the rainbow colors. Spanish words are scattered throughout the text. At the end there is a reward for finding all of the eggs.The book is egg-shaped, a cute little novelty feature. The pages are thick board, which will stand up to much rough handling and are easier for small fingers to turn. The lift-able flaps are thinner than the pages and tear much more easily. The pages are also glossy, which makes them easy to wipe clean. Each page has small foil highlights that are randomly placed throughout the images that cover every inch of every page in vibrant color.Flaps are always fun for young children (ok, and me) and the added educational aspect with the introduction of a handful of Spanish words is awesome. Just like on the TV show, when a Spanish word or phrase is used, it is either followed or preceded by the English translation. With an increasingly global world, the knowledge of more than one language is an almost necessary tool and it's never too early to start the introduction.

Anyway, she LOVES this book like no other she's ever read. I sometimes have to read it to her 3 to 6 times a day. Sometimes twice before bedtime (my daughter has never been the type to ask me to read the same book twice in a row). She's even caught me in the middle of the night, if she wakes up, she actually asks me to read it to her again, even though it may be 3am. Frtunately, by this point, I've memorized it and all the flaps.The best thing about it is it really helps a child to learn their colors in English if they don't already know them, and definately in Spanish. We aren't a bilingual household, but my daughter has started picking up counting in Spanish from Dora. With this book, she's now easily learning her colors. The pictures are bright and colorful and the story is cute and typical Dora. Even Swiper makes an appearance.

Today, I believe these texts are one of the most important in the history of ideas, because it is the first time thinkers have questioned their ethical place in society, and under what conditions the Good is, in fact, a representation of the Beautiful. This is not only a reaction to Immanuel Kant's two books, Critique of Practical Reason and Judgment, but is also a reformation of the battle to weaken Reason in the face of the rising development of technology.The first half, Neo-Classicism, are essays by Hamann, Lessing, and Moritz. They are excellent essays that deal with reviving themes put forth by Greek Mythology, Virgil, and Homer. The last half, the romantics, Schiller, Holderlin, Novalis, and Shlegel, rethink Neo-Classicism and puts them under a new aesthetic light, which not only believe in the classical concept of perfection and beauty, but how it relates to ethics, where at its ultimate peak, all man strives to become \\"a work of art.\\"The essays may be very technical prima facie, but through reading other texts, such as Frederick Beiser's The Romantic Imperative, you understand the central concerns of the German romantics, and how these concepts are useful today."},{"Title":"Night Work: The Story of Task Force 39","review":"Great book about naval actions in Soloman Islands. Tip Merrill was a great admiral and fine leader. Plenty of action."},{"Title":"The Ritalin Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You","review":"After reading the two previous reviews, I had to say a word in defense of Mr. Breggin.No, Mr. Breggin is not a mainstream practioner. But if you do a little research (try finding Breggin's website) you will find that his credentials are certainly nothing to brush off. This guy is actually pretty phenomenal. He has studied this subject a lot longer and in much greater depth than your average Doctor Schmoe. And if you know anything about psychiatric drugs and the medical field, you will also realize that the average mainstream doctor got all he knows about these drugs from the drug companies themselves. The drug companies are the ones providing most of the education and nearly all of the research that our average family doctors rely on. So you've got to figure that the mainstream may not have a clear and unbiased picture. Add to that the fact that insurance companies are crazy about psychiatric drugs. Why? Because they sure are cheaper than paying a psychologist or counselor! And they are quick, effective and easy to document. Drugs are big money, and parents and teachers love them! (See reviews below).If you are really genuinely worried about your child's health, then you have got to be aware of the other side of the story regarding ritalin (and other psychiatric drugs). Dr. Breggin isn't the only person out there with a negative view of these drugs. If you look, you will find that this stuff is well backed-up. One of the earlier reviewers called Breggin arrogant, cold, and cruel. The person states with sarcasm:\\"Now, let's all go off medication together, have a jump in school failure and expense, increase aggressive and suicidal behavior, fill the ER's with children who ran into traffic. Let's have the child get punished and put down all day again. Let's disrupt all the classes these children attend, as the teachers try to get them down from the window sills.\\"Do you really have such little faith in our children?? They are people, not monsters.My question is where were all these kids fifty years ago? In the days before Ritalin? Why weren't they jumping out of windows and running into traffic? Are you going to tell me that our genes have changed? That is highly unlikely. What has changed in the last fify years is not our genetic make-up. Our kids do not have brain disorders. Look at our society and our families. Look at ourselves as parents. And look at the demands being placed on children. I am not saying all these kids are angels, but even being a brat does not qualify as a brain disorder. Dealing with a kid with bad behavior takes work. Dealing with a kid who can't handle sitting at a desk all day long takes some thinking outside of the box. Hyperactivity is sometimes a way that children (and adults) deal with stress and problems they don't know how to handle. Sometimes it is a defense. Pills offer a quick, easy and guilt-free solution, and too many parents are taking advantage of that. When you go into a classroom and know that half of the kids are on ritalin (which is an occurence popping up more and more often around the country), there is no denying this.Maybe you won't agree with the style in which Breggin writes, but I am glad he is out there. This is a subject that needs more attention."},{"Title":"The Ritalin Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You","review":"After reading this book you will not be ready to inspire world peace, end world hunger, or even balance your own check book. However, you will be a better parent for taking the time to educate yourself about a critical topic. The easy answer is to cave into an educator's diagnosis that your child is ADHD and get a prescription to dope your child. The educators are motivated to neutralize your child if they pose any teaching challenge. And what doctor won't write prescriptions?Everything that Dr. Breggin writes will not work for your child. However, traditional doping may not be right for your child either. Be a good parent, do your own research and follow your instincts. In conducting my own research, I found a father who lost his daughter to Ritalin - suicide. I Googled him and found his phone number. During our discussion, his most memorable statement was that he should have followed his instincts and taken her (daughter) off the Ritalin.None of the expert opinions should replace your parental instincts! Read contradictory pieces to formulate your own position. Without the courage of Dr. Breggin and others like him, we would only get to read the pharmaceutical industries position.Finally, regarding the input from \\"A Reader\\", who is the quack? The commentator refers us to \\"Quackwatch\\" to uncover some discrepancies regarding Dr. Breggin. However, what you find is that Dr. Breggin is guilty of his biased opinion. Just as the author of Quackwatch has his own bias. Additional Googling uncovered that the author of Quackwatch (Dr. Barrett) has also had his credibility challenged. As posted on the Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation web site, \\"under a heated cross-examination ... Barrett conceded that he was not a Medical Board Certified psychiatrist because he had failed the certification exam.\\" Maybe \\"A Reader\\" should have read a little more!Read Breggin's books along with the books of other authors. More importantly speak with other parents and learn from their challenges. Also, is your child just like you? Did you need doping? If not, why does your kid? Use a little logic and common sense."},{"Title":"The Ritalin Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You","review":"Dr. Breggin simply dismisses the notion that ADHD, ADD and perhaps autism represent biological states. Instead, he asserts the labels ADD and ADHD are no more than convenient excuses for lazy teachers and parents to commit temporary lobotomies upon their children and/or students. Breggin suggests the ADHD issue can be resolved by simply changing the parent and teacher's behavior . This thesis occupies about 20% of the book.The other 80% of the book reviews the horrific damage psycho-active drugs potentially cause children. Breggin recounts several cases where Ritalin is given to a normal healthy child who happens to act out at school one day. The drug causes more problems. Before you can say 1, 2, 3; the child is on 5 or 6 psychoactive drugs, displays involuntary ticks, and gets diagnosed with a bipolar disorder or acute early stage schizophrenia. Dr. Breggin saves the day by pulling the child off drugs. and allowing the normal child to reemerge.Dr. Breggin's logic is hardly compelling, but every parent thinking about giving their child psychoactive medications should read this book very carefully. Breggin may not be much of a neuroscientist, but his warnings should not be ignored. If nothing else, he does a good job of making the warning labels an interesting read. Be prepared."},{"Title":"The Ritalin Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You","review":"We were in the process of getting our child diagnosed with ADHD, and, after reading all the \\"standard\\" ADHD books, I decided to read a book from the \\"other side\\" - I like to keep an open mind.This is the first book that I have read by Dr. Peter Breggin, and I was impressed. He has a name for himself as an extremist, which he is. He also has something as a name for being cruel to children, which I don't think he is, I actually saw a compassion and commitment for children and their problems.Please let me explain.He admits in this book that his perspective is a skewered one - that since he treats children who were hurt by Ritalin and other psychiatric drugs, and he sees the ones who have the worst side effects, some of them irreversible, he tends to have a negative view of Ritalin.But what I really wanted to see was some alternative - great, Ritalin is no good, but what else is there? You can't just take away a solution without at least giving us another solution! And that is where I was, indeed, very pleasantly surprised. He has a chapter on what to do to help your child without Ritalin, and it is inspired, it is genius. It is hard to explain his method in this review, I couldn't explain it as well as he does, anyway. I recommend this book just for that chapter alone. And although his method makes sense, the proof is in the pudding - the proof is in the stories of children that he has helped, that he has taught to have self-control, and to be weaned off the medicine.Now, I would like to put in my own opinion here, if I may. Dr. Breggin is an extremist, and no extremist is ever 100% right. His practice is comprised of children (and adults - although he brings no adult case studies) who reacted badly to the medication they received, and he helps the parents wean them off, etc. In that case, it may be argued that he is really seeing only one side of the coin. He is seeing all the patients who had side effects, some of them *extremely* severe, and not seeing all the patients who were helped, and did well, on medication. It may in fact be argued that the patients he is seeing should not have been on Ritalin in the first place.I recommend this book, but with one caveat - take this as a warning, not as fact. Not all children who take Ritalin have such severe side effects. Many children who take Ritalin are helped, a lot, with almost no side effects. In fact, some people that I know call Ritalin a wonder drug. But, it IS a psychiatric drug. While it helps tremendously for those who need it, the way that it is being prescribed today - almost like Tylenol - does not say very much for the way we are treating our children. The side effects, when they are there, can be very severe, as Dr. Breggin says over and over again in his book. So my recommendation is first, to make sure that your child really does have ADHD before prescribing Ritalin (you would be surprised at how quickly some doctors will prescribe it with little, or no testing), and second, watch out for the side effects. Most doctors will not tell you what the side effects could be, and what to watch out for, which is why this book is so valuable in that sense. I am also surprised at how many people I have met who say they were prescribed Ritalin and it didn't help. Why in the world did they keep on taking a medication - a psychiatric medication - if didn't even help?Parents should not be cowed by schools and doctors - if you are a parent, you know your child best. And do not be frightened into giving your child medicine that you don't feel is right for him/her. Also, people will tell you that you should start as soon as you can - the earlier the better, they will say. That is simply not true. Ritalin is not a cure for ADHD, it is simply a drug that will help symptoms. Ritalin does not change anyone's brain long term, only for the amount of time that they are on the drug. So there is no danger in waiting a while - a month - a year - to see if they will outgrow it without the drugs. On the other hand, if your child is totally out of control (I find it hard imagining a five year old so totally out of control that he/she must be put on drugs, but I guess it could happen, although very rarely) then, yes, you must put him on drugs immediately!This is, I think, the part that this book is missing. True, Ritalin could have side effects. True, most children who are on Ritalin should not be on it, and can be helped with Dr. Breggin's wonderful common sense. But he totally overlooks a small, but essential, percentage of children (and adults) for whom Ritalin is absolutely a life-saver, in every sense of the word!"},{"Title":"The Ritalin Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You","review":"I have known people with children put on drugs like Ritalin since grade school.

After a highly regarded doctor found that I had ADD, I started to research the available treatments.There is a fantastic amount of disinformation regarding ADHD and ADD, and usually by people who will try to sell you something that will not work. First off, Ritalin is one of the safest medications ever approved by the FDA. In fact, in some countries Ritalin is available over the counter.Second, a healthy diet and exercise helps everyone concentrate a bit better and many studies have shown a strong link between these factors. That said, these are NOT a replacement for medication.Scientology and snake oil salesman/saleswoman have found a place where they can make money off selling books and herbal remedies that do not work. In fact, Congress formed a committee to research some of the studies and claims Scientology presented as fact. After some research into the studies and claims, the Congressional committee found so many issues they ended their research early and admonished Scientology for wasting their time.Unfortunately, I cannot link this information but I encourage you to do your own research."},{"Title":"The Ritalin Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You","review":"Contrary to his press release, Breggin is not a mainstream practitioner, but a charlatan exploiting the fears of millions of Americans.

The book is written in an hysterical style that makes it hard to take seriously and undermines his claims to legitimacy."},{"Title":"The Ritalin Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You","review":"Ritalin lasts for 4 hours. Everyone stops taking medicine once they feel better. Even doctors who should know the course of antibiotics for a strep throat is 10 days, stop after 5, once they feel better. The reason people take medications, such as Ritalin, is that the symptoms return if they do not. These symptoms are unbearable and harsh. They include hard outcomes such as self-injury and accidents from impulsity. Parents, children, and teachers continue it because the life of the child is improved.Peter Breggin believes he knows what is good for all the millions of people on Ritalin, each with unique circumstances and challenges. He believes he knows what is best for the individual child better than those who know him a lifetime and care about him the most. My doctor informs patients of most of the information in that book.Now, let's all go off medication together, have a jump in school failure and expense, increase aggressive and suicidal behavior, fill the ER's with children who ran into traffic. Let's have the child get punished and put down all day again. Let's disrupt all the classes these children attend, as the teachers try to get them down from the window sills."},{"Title":"Choo-Choo: The Little Switch Engine,","review":"Love this book, makes for a fun read for new readers.

Unfortunately the one who may have done this, Pope John Paul I was rapidly dead after taking office, and this book provides compelling evidence that he was murdered, and that the plot came from within the vatican. His death was never adequately explained or investigated, but it was highly, highly suspicious, and obfuscated!

The internecine wars among the Cardinals, the influence of huge amounts of dirty money, and the need for control of the Vatican are fascinating, if disturbing. It is a grim portrait to say the least. IN GOD'S NAME is an important book that deserves a new edition. Until then, pick up a used copy available here."},{"Title":"IN GOD'S NAME","review":"This book gives a terrible tarnished picture of the Vatican, even if the author is wrong and there was no murder or active murder (they could have let Pope John Paul I die, by not administering him his medicine).A Vatican controlled by a bunch of corrupt, merciless, avid for power, 'holy' cardinals (Villot, Cody, Marcinkus, Baggio), implicated in a web of depraved banking, masonic and Mafia figures like Calvi, Gelli and Sindona. (I recommend for the 'banking' part also the book by Richard Hammer 'The Vatican Connection').What is also intriguing, or should I say 'demonic', is the fact that the next pope didn't remove anybody entangled in these murky affairs from his office.The author gives also very plausible hints why, besides personal career interests, there were moral (the issue of birth control, for instance) and financial (money laundering to help friendly unions or parties) motives.A devastating book. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"IN GOD'S NAME","review":"I read this book shortly after it was published and given recent events, I'll be reading it again. It beautifully illustrates the paradox of political institution of religion versus the spiritual faith while investigating possible murder (Pope John Paul 1) and corruption (money laundering, etc) in the Vatican.Other contradictory activities are uncovered; e.g. contraceptive factories/companies whose existence/ownership is traced back to the Vatican which preaches against contraception. Some critics say the book names no sources and has no footnotes; why should he? The facts are so clearly described that you are able to confirm certain things if you needed to (what with other evidence cited like documents, etc) without necessarily interviewing his sources who obviously helped on condition of anonymity for their own protection.As much of a furor as this book caused, it's interesting to note that almost 20 years later, not a single allegation contained from within the book has been proven to be false. Rather, much of it has been officially established as true. (see author's site yallop.co.uk). I'd recommend to anyone, especially Catholics."},{"Title":"IN GOD'S NAME","review":"Wow! What a read. This non-fiction reads almost like a novel, but with LOTS of information. My head was dizzy trying to keep up with all the names of who did what and when. How did the author manage to keep it coherent? Anyway, I got the jist of it and was completely intriqued through all of it. It became obvious throught Yallop's investigation that Pope John Paul I was murdered. And, admittedly, he doesn't name his sources for their protection, but there's enough information to convince even the hard-to-convince. He mentions Freemasons and P2 (Propoganda 2), some clerics, and Mafioso persons who could stand to lose a lot of money by having this Pope in office. For a moment I thought I was reading the Godfather. As Yallop pointed out, was reality imitating art (or the other way around)?The web of deceit and manipulations that are weaved in this story is harrowing and endless. This is a must read for anyone interested in how our economy, politics, wars, and religions are affected by the Vatican (and have been for centuries), run by deceitful, self-serving or indifferent people choosing to play this dangerous game.Although this book is 20 yrs old, it's a great insight to the dangerous games played by those in power - at the final cost to the layman, citizen, and hard-working persons of the world."},{"Title":"IN GOD'S NAME","review":"This is a great book that takes an in depth look into the collapse of one of the worlds wealthiest banks, it's relationship with the Vatican, the mafia, politicians and freemasonry.

Yallop wrote four previous works (one caused the British government to reopen a twenty-year old murder case, another freed a man serving a life sentence for murder). This investigates the mysterious death of Albino Luciani, Pope John Paul I. He spent three years of intensive investigation using various sources in Rome, New York, London, and South America; they cannot be publicly identified.Luciano Albini opposed the looting of Banco Ambrosiano while Bishop of Venice. As Pope he would rid the Vatican Bank of swindlers, money launderers, drug dealers, and their allies. But these had connections with organized crime and certain intelligence agencies. Pope John Paul I was as doomed as President John F. Kennedy's attempts to curtail the military-industrial complex, and Big Oil.In 1981 there was an attempt to poison the Foreign Minister of El Salvador: the poison was to be put into his alcoholic drink. Nothing would happen for a week, then he would develop a flu-like disease, and die the next day. This poison could not be detected unless the coroner knew what to look for. This plot was exposed by the double agent recruited for the job, and a US diplomat was expelled from the country. The newspapers did NOT compare this to the death of Pope John Paul I.Pages 40-49 tell of a swindle using counterfeit bonds worth $635 million. They would be sold to the Vatican Bank, and the money used for payoffs, and buying control of a company. The bank would write this off as a loss. You can be sure of high-level corruption and collusion in the bank!The murder of Pope John Paul I may never be solved officially. Perhaps another Pope would continue his proposed reforms; we'll see in the near future."},{"Title":"IN GOD'S NAME","review":"I found this book excellent reading. It clearly outlines many unknown facts about the Vatican and the downfall of one of Italy's largest banks."},{"Title":"IN GOD'S NAME","review":"Back in 1958, when I was a student in a Catholic school, Pope John XXIII was elected. One of the lay teachers said that Pope Pius XI was bumped off to allow a \\"German Pope\\" to be put into power. That was before I was born and of little interest to me. Little did I realize that in twenty years another Pope would be bumped off to put another reactionary Pope into power.This book points out the politics and personalities that went into the decision to eliminate Pope John Paul I. Afterwards, some of the reforms did go thru, perhaps due to the banking scandals of the 1980s, and other events that followed Vatican II.Back in 1981 a State Dept. employee was kicked out of Nicaragua because she tried to poison their Foreign Minister (also a cleric). The poison to be used was said to be undetectable unless they knew what to look for. The symptoms made it look like the flu, and the cause would likely be overlooked. I wonder how many times this was used in other time and places?"},{"Title":"IN GOD'S NAME","review":"Albino Luciani was elected Pope and chose to be Pope John Paul the First. Not only becoming the first double name in the history, but also appended the first to it. He was known as the \\"Smiling Pope\\" and though his reign was the second shortest in history, only 33 days, he was loved the world over. This wonderful Pastor would have taken the Church back to its Gospel roots where it belongs. He was truly a Man of God. And you could see from his 33 days as Pope that he would have been the greatest Pope ever in the eyes the world.This book builds a very good case showing that Pope John Paul I was murdered, as many has always thought. It also exposes the corruption both within the Vatican and in the Diocese of Chicago during the years covered. All his research show ties between the Vatican, the Mafia and the Freemasons tied to financial corruption. Documented proof is uncovered and other governments have tired to act on them, but they are blocked by the Curia according to the book.The author names those involved in the illegal and immoral acts and their motives and opportunity to have Pope John Paul I killed. The author leads the reader to see that it is no coincidence that the Pope was killed the evening before he was going to clean house. Though I was surprised by how obvious the cover-up and lies were according to what we read here. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"IN GOD'S NAME","review":"A detailed and massively documented expose on the probable assassination of Pope John Paul I on September 28, 1978, after 33 days of rule. The author points to many coincidences and discrepancies that collectively lend themselves to the conclusion that the pope was subjected to \\"the Italian solution,\\" i.e., poisoned. For example, no autopsy was performed although there was precedent for performing this procedure after a pope was autopsied in 1830 out of concern that he had been poisoned. John Paul I was embalmed within twelve hours of discovery, contrary to Italian law which required 24 hours minimum. No blood was drained from his body before embalming, which was contrary to custom. Neither John Paul I's long-time personal physician nor the head of the Vatican's medical service was summoned to inspect the body, but rather a Vatican physician who was unfamiliar with coroner proceedings. Although the physician announced that John Paul I had likely died from myocardial infarction, he declined to sign a death certificate stating this on the grounds that no autopsy had been allowed. When John Paul I's personal physician learned of this provisional diagnosis, he refused to believe it since his patient had no history of heart trouble and was an avid mountain climber. John Paul I's body was discovered in bed in his private apartments around 5:00 am, yet the two brothers who served as the Vatican embalmers stated that they had been summoned at 4:45 am. Although he supposedly had died alone, no inference of foul play was made, even though it is law in many locales that a person who dies alone requires an autopsy to counter a legal presumption of murder.Within a few minutes of the body's discovery, Cardinal Jean Villot, the Vatican \\"Secretary of State\\", a veteran official of the Roman Curia, or Vatican state bureaucracy, removed from the room all of the pope's personal effects, including his spectacles, his slippers, his will from a desk drawer, a list of planned transfers and new personnel appointments, and a bottle of Effortil, prescription medicine that the pope had been taking for some months due to low blood pressure, and perhaps a cup of coffee. None of these items was ever seen again. Even more ominous, two weeks earlier a Russian archbishop had died in John Paul I's presence shortly after sipping coffee.Not only was Cardinal Villot himself prominent on the list of persons about to be removed by John Paul I, so were many other high-ranking figures in the Roman Curia, persons who had spent years in the Vatican and were far more familiar with its factions and power-plays and secret stairwells than the lone newcomer Albino Luciani. Luciani was a \\"dark-horse\\" candidate from Venice, who had rarely visited Rome, much less built a power-base in that city, and had arrived with only his secretary. He had been elected unexpectedly to solve a deadlock between liberals, who favored easing the ban on contraception, and conservatives who favored maintaining the status quo, or returning to the days before the 1963 Vatican Council II and the exclusive use of Latin in church services. After four voting sessions, the reformist-minded Luciani had prevailed over conservative Cardinal Baggio by only a few votes. John Paul I had only begun to realize the limits to a pope's power, however, and in the month since his election, the Vatican newspaper had published several articles in direct opposition to his instructions, and contradicting his previously published opinions. When Luciani ordered Baggio to leave Rome and take his place in Venice, Baggio indignantly refused in an hour-long heated argument one day before John Paul I died.John Paul I's dissatisfaction with Villot and Baggio was not merely personal, but likely stemmed from the fact that both were on a list of alleged members of a secret right-wing lodge of Freemasons called Propaganda Due, or P2, that had recently been published in the Italian papers by a disgruntled lodge member. Conversations that John Paul I had with others in the hours before his death confirm that he planned to remove all Vatican officials who were on the list and replace them with others whose loyalty to the Church was unquestioned. Also prominent among them was the American from Cicero, Illinois, Bishop Paul Marcinkus, head of the Vatican Bank, whose long involvement with the notorious Mafia figures Michel Sindona and Roberto Calvi had also recently become a matter of public knowledge.In September, 1978, Sindona was under prosecution in New York and wanted in Italy for bank fraud having been responsible for an international banking crisis that bore his name: \\"Il Crack Sindona.\\" Having swindled $1.3 billion, Roberto Calvi was later the victim of a Mafia hit and was found hanging from London Bridge in 1982. Both were deeply implicated in decades of banking fraud, having used the Vatican Bank, necessarily with the complicity and knowledge of Bishop Marcinkus, as a cover to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in heroin profits from New York and Palermo, and to aid in the illegal transfer of currency out of Italy in evasion of Italian banking regulations. The Church made huge profits on these transfers. After a long series of murders, bombings, assassinations of judges, and many Mafia-style \\"suicides\\" in which close associates of Calvi were thrown from the top floors of buildings, after John Paul I's death, Marcinkus was confirmed in his position as \\"God's Banker\\" by John Paul II, as were all those on the list of Vatican Freemasons whom John Paul I had marked for removal before his supposedly natural death from \\"a bad ticker.\\"While it is unlikely that murder can ever be proven given the secrecy and autonomy of the Vatican, bland pronouncements of comity in the city-state seem nave. Like any monarchy, the Vatican is rife with intrigue, privilege, opacity, entrenched interest, character assassination, and immunity from accountability. Popes, like kings, are prisoners of their palace, knowing only what their handlers want them to know, and the world usually hears of a pope only what the Roman Curia wishes the world to hear. No one is more isolated, misinformed, and vulnerable than a king on his throne--or a pope in his bed. In democracies, revolutions are made in newspapers; in monarchies, they are made by food-tasters. The head of P2, Licio Gelli, instructed all important P2 members, which included dozens of Italian admirals, army generals, and members of parliament, to carry vials of digitalis on their persons so they could commit suicide rather than be forced to divulge secrets. A few drops from one of these vials by just one P2 member in the Vatican slipped into John Paul I's coffee or now-vanished medicine bottle, accessed by a secret stairwell, would have been sufficient to end his life. Surely it was no accident that Licio Gelli would announce his surreptitious phone-calls to Roberto Calvi from exile in Uruguay by speaking the single word \\"Luciani.\\" And that Roberto Calvi would always--and desperately--respond by sending Gelli more millions of dollars looted from Vatican-owned companies. It seems that the puppet-master of P2 believed he had performed some important service that benefited Calvi involving that name, a service that Calvi wished not to be made public.Yet the assassination remains unproven. Perhaps what is of most value in this book is not the documentation on John Paul I's alleged murder, but the documentation on the Vatican's involvement in bank fraud and the growth of its investments after it signed the Lateran Treaties with Benito Mussolini in 1927. The Church is the only private corporation to have its own state, its own capital, and its ambassadors granted recognition by virtually every country in the world. The Church operates completely tax-free and the members of the Curia enjoy absolute immunity from foreign prosecution so long as they remain in the Vatican. Not only does the Church collect vast annual cash collections from its \\"shareholders,\\" most of which is forwarded to Rome and owned personally by the Pope, who is absolutely immune to all prosecution for any deed he may commit inside the Vatican, possessing the job for life, but the Church is the beneficiary of taxes collected on its behalf by the governments of many other countries. The Kirkensteuer tax, for example, levies billions annually from German citizens, most of which is transferred to the Vatican. Payment of these taxes in no way confers the kind of control possessed by rank-and-file shareholders in ordinary profit-making corporations. This Chairman of the Board cannot be removed and does not answer to shareholders. The Church is the largest private owner of real estate in the world, having owned, at least when this book was written, the Montreal Stock Exchange building, the Watergate Hotel, and entire city blocks of office buildings in many countries. It had business interests virtually everywhere, including 15% of Immobiliare, the largest Italian construction and real estate conglomerate (made famous by its inclusion in the plot of the movie Godfather III). It owned and may still own munitions factories, cement plants, railways, electric companies, water utilities, finance companies that charge exorbitant interest rates, a significant part of the gold at Fort Knox--even at one time a company that made contraceptives. These facts alone make this book an essential read for anyone who wishes to be informed."},{"Title":"Conformed to His image","review":"Oswald Chambers challenges my thinking about the Christian walk like few other authors can. His insights are always so profound, and yet at the same time awaken me to the realization that I am the one who makes the Christian walk something complex. In Conformed To His Image, I was yet again challenged to simply follow Jesus.Chambers brilliantly turns secular psychology upside down. He takes what psychology wants to ascribe to our minds and emotions, and brings it back to a Scriptural basis that puts these things where they are supposed to be: in the soul.The thought of being \\"conformed\\" rubs against the human desire to be free and in charge of our own destiny. Somehow being \\"conformed\\" feels like be controlled and giving up our unique personality. So Chambers contrasts the natural human tendencies for freedom and calling our own shots with what the Bible says about surrendering to God.Chambers presents Jesus not as some superhuman, extraordinary Man. But He shows the life of Jesus to be what we should all be able to live out daily. Jesus was perfectly conformed and submitted to the will of His Father. And, he says, if we will submit as well, the Holy Spirit will conform us into the image of Jesus.Beware: this book is not light reading. This is a heavy-duty, confrontational book that will challenge you to submit to the Holy Spirit as perhaps you never have before in your Christian walk. However, if you are ready to take the plunge into a much deeper, more intimate relationship with your Heavenly Father, Conformed To His Image is the resource for you."},{"Title":"The Treasury of American Short Stories","review":"This is a comprehensive collection of American short stories starting with Washington Irving and going through to Ann Beatie.

The characters in the novel were based on people he knew in that city during his long (105 years) life there.The protagonist is John O'Shaugnessy, a bon vivant and gourmand who operates the saloon of the title. His bosom buddy is \\"Poker\\" Lou Leibowitz, a pint-sized, shabby, down-at-the-heels gambler who can never make it to the big time. The two men meet up with Opal Pruce, a fast-talking con woman who sells quack beauty products in department stores. Opal and her son, Calvert, come into O'Shaugnessy's bistro one day and she samples a slice of a gelatin pie that is a specialty of the cook. She is so taken with the pie that she offers to buy the recipe and go into business selling the filling as a dessert called \\"Joy-Jell\\", using her son as a mascot on the packages. For those who are familiar with the Rochester area, it is no secret that JELL-O was invented in the town of Leroy, not many miles away.O'Shaugnessy and Poker Lou invest in Opal's company and the remainder of the book deals with the making (and spending) of fast money, Lou's infatuation with a Miami stripper a head taller than he, and Opal Pruce's desire to leave the confidence game and become a successful businesswoman and a \\"lady\\".Since the book was published in 1969, the reader has to use an inflation calculator to get an idea of the scale of the amounts of money that are being described in the novel."},{"Title":"A time to love ... a time to die","review":"The book was touching and beautifully written. While \\"Mr. P\\" was certainly a man of great intellect, compassion, and literary prowess, it became obvious that this was a couple that was terribly self-absorbed and narcissistic. Reflection can be beneficial, but they carried it to a pathological extreme. Diana was not a \\"saint\\"; none of us is. She was an exceptional woman of talent and sensitivity who was ill. This happens to millions of very fine people on a daily basis. However, in his grief, Lowenstein portrayed her as larger-than-life, saintly, set apart from humanity.

Should she marry her Black Prince who end her days as a single Black female?

The reader didn't have to guess what the heroine \\"was\\" like some other novels out here lately, but I was very disappointed with the book a whole.Lacie's former boss left and her new boss came in, but she didn't know he was her boss when the first ran into each other in the elevator. She just thought of him as attractive in a passing thought, because she didn't date white men. In addition Lacie's was running late on the first day she was going to meet her new boss.She didn't find out until later on that morning the attractive, friendly, white stranger from the elevator was her new boss and she would be working closely with him.Anothny \\"Tony\\" Douglas found Lacie's very alluring the first moment he saw her on the elevator and was very happy he would get the chance to work with her, however he soon found out that although Lacie was attracted to him, she didn't want to explore the possible of them being a couple.Instead she started dating his best friend and their new client at the firm Joe, that she had previously meet at a nightclub while trying to figure out a way to dump her current boyfriend at the time. Lacie finally dumped her old boyfriend Steven, because he wasn't giving her what she wanted. Yet, she still wasn't about to get Tony any encouragement.Lacie's whinning, boring family was another problem, I found with the book. The teenage little sister who gets pregnant by her boyfriend and the nosy, bossy mother who doesn't want her Lacie to date \\"Mister Charlie\\" is just too much. She thinks know how to keep control of everything going on around in in the book, but she really doesn't.Finally, after dating Joe for a while, he asks Lacie's to marry him and she agrees, but is really in love with Tony and doesn't know how to break things off with Joe. However, in the end she dumps Joe, fights with Tony some more about her feelings, but in the end Laci tell him how she feels.I never thought Laci gave Tony enough consideration in this book at all. He was always honest with her about him feelings from the beginning, but she kept him on the roller coaster ride of emotions until she was ready to give him what he wanted.I didn't hate the book, because some points of it was good. Like Tony never gave up on Lacie no matter how many times, she pushed him away.But I thought Lacie needed to spend more time with Tony and less with her crazy family, friends and neighbor.

Going so far as to become engage to Joe while having feelings and sleeping with Tony at the same time.This story made the relationships with all chacacters very simplistic. Lacie was very annoying, selfish and clueless as to what she wanted in life and who she wanted to spend her life with. Each male character she met in the book was reduced to a bed partner.

There wasn't enough of Tony's thoughts and clearly define emotions toward Lacie to show that he really cared for her. Adding the ex-girlfriend from Tony's past and having her as the racist was very predictable. The dialogue was juvenlle and boring. I just felt that a more comprehensive dialogue and a few unexpected turns in the book would have added the spice that was needed to make it work. The book was lame. I'm becoming really disappointed in the quality of interracial books that have been coming out as of late. With all of the many things that women are involved with today, someone could come up with a better plot and a witty dialogue. Without using the old \\"boy meets girl\\"; they have a color difference scenario, and everyone is against them. YAWN!"},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"What a total disappointment! I have yet to figure out why this book was placed in the romance section. 85 percent centered around Lacie, eating, her job and her family/friends tumultuous relationship, 10% around Joe (her fiancee)and 5% around Tony the man she's supposedly in love with and the one who is suppose to be the main male character in the book.Lacie and Tony are co-workers (he being her new boss) who fall in love. Now, when they actually fall in love is still a mystery to me because - aside from seeing each other at work - they rarely do anything outside of work together.The book started well. We begin to see Lacie and Tony getting to know each other then the book just veers off into another realm.At first I liked Lacie but then she turned into this put upon self imposed \\"saint\\" always being wronged. Her friends, ex-boyfriend, Joe and Tony are always apologizing or \\"gently\\" giving her advice and accepting her bad behavior. Even when she's in a bad mood and taking her anger out on them THEY are still the one's apologizing.Tony was more of a martyr always taking her abuse. You have to be a good man to love a self centered woman like her.In the end all the side stories (Dawn - her friends relationship with her abusive boyfriend; Renee - her sister - teenage hormones; Simone - Tony's racist ex-girlfriend; and Lacie's mother - probably the most bitter person I've ever seen - took so much away from the books potential possibilities!"},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"Written in the first person, Lizette Carter's \\"The Color Line\\" begins for all intents and purposes when the heroine, Lacie Adams breaks up with one man, then swiftly meet two men, within days of each other. One, Joe Taylor, is the \\"Perfect Black Man.\\" Rich, Successful, Handsome and would drink her bathwater, he loves her that much. The other, is her new boss, Anthony Douglas. His entering the room just \\"sets her off\\" even when she doesn't think anyone else notices.While the vast majority of romance books are written from the third person point of view and many allow the reader to view the story from the viewpoint of both the hero and the heroine, in \\"The Color Line\\" the reader is given exclusive rights into the mind of the heroine and the heroine alone.Now, while I'll admit, that at first I was a bit put off by this...I always want to know what's on the hero's mind...the particular point of view allowed me as the reader to really get to know Lacie as an individual and how she sees the world that she lives in.Lacie, is like most of us, always trying to please others. She's constantly aware of what's expected of her and not necessarily what she wants or what's best for her. She plain and simply wants to keep everyone happy and avoid an argument with her Mother. Constantly dealing with the past and present pain of not only her own life, but the lives of those around her, we see how Lacie could in an effort to please someone other than herself and keep the peace, deny herself the one thing that she wants the most, the ability and right to love who she wants without getting the approval of those she cares for the most. Her desire to please others rather than herself causes her to hurt some of those same people unintentionally. It's only in finally admitting that she's cross that invisible color line and fallen in love with \\"Mr. Charlie\\" that she and those people that she unintentionally hurt by her \\"pleasing others\\" can find happiness.While many readers may be disappointed with the amount of space the relationship between her and Tony is given, the real story isn't in them getting together. It's a romance. We KNOW there's a Happily Ever After in their future. The real story's in HOW she reaches the point where she finally says \\"I love you\\" and finds her own freedom in those three words. How she finds the courage to say to her family and friends, \\"I've tried your way, and it didn't work. It's about what makes ME happy\\" and sets about to undo the damage that pleasing others has caused.A well-written story, I enjoyed \\"The Color Line\\" immensely and for the first time in a very long time, found myself reading a book and not wanting to put it down until I was finished. I look forward to reading more from the pen of Lizette Carter and so should you."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"...I thought that the book did not explore Tony's and Lacie's relationship. Too much time was spent on Lacie's family problems and her mixed feelings for Tony's friend. It would have been great if Tony and Lacie had more romantic interaction. Maybe next time Ms. Carter will do better."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"I met the author of this book last year. The gracious Lizzette Carter introduced me to her debut novel and I was intrigued by the synopsis, so I purchased the book.THE COUPLE.Lacie and Tony meet on the elevator at her job. He turns out to be her new boss and sparks fly between the two. Working side by side they both realize that they have fallen for each other. Only one thing troubles Lacie; Tony is white therefore he does not fit the criteria of the successful, sexy black man she should be in love with.This is where the story starts and ends for me. The couple never gets a chance to explore their love.I assumed I would be reading about the trials and tribulations that interracial couples have to face. But I was wrong. Both characters spent the whole story with other people.JOE.Joe is in love with Lacie, but has no clue she's in love with Tony his good friend and business associate. Lacie leads Joe to believe she's in love with him and wants to marry him. Joe is deceived throughout the entire length of the story and is deeply hurt by the end. There was too much time spent on Joe and Lacie that I totally forgot that Tony and Lacie were supposed to be the couple here! Personally I think Joes character was too good to be true.MOTHER/SISTER.Renee, Lacie's seventeen year old sister is living with her. A teenager with raging hormones was the last thing Lacie wanted to deal with, but like Renee, Lacie does not get along with their mother, so when Renee begged her to stay at her apartment being the understanding sister she reluctantly agrees.Their mother is a cold woman and it seemed as if Lacie and her mother hated each other.Again the author concentrated too much on the bitterness between mother and daughter but never fully developed the mother's character enough so I could understand what her issues really were. Their relationship was too much for me and I was drained after reading one too many of their heated arguments. Renee had her issues which were totally predicted.THE FRIENDS.Dawn, Lacies girlfriend is in a abusive relationship so she had her own problems going on. Lacies never really opens up to her girlfriend about her love turmoil. Robert her gay neighbor is the only person who really tries to get Lacie to follow her heart and be true to herself.MY CONCLUSION.Lacie's character was not honest with Joe and Tony, or herself. I wanted to know more about Tony. His personality should have been all over this book along with his views from a white mans prospective. As far as I see it Tony and Lacie never really crossed the color line so frankly the cover and title of this book is deceiving. Lizzette G. Carter gets three stars for writing the story. but zero for content. She should have given it a different title.If you'd like to read a good story about an interracial relationship, I recommend reading \\"Fates Redemption\\" by Keith Lee Johnson.LocksieARC Book Club Inc."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"This is my first time reading a book from this author and I don't remember if this was her debut novel or not, but I was disappointed borderline agitated by the time I finished this novel.Firstoff, I had a REALLY hard time visualizing the charachters. There was just not enough development in building the charachters. What you got was a physical description of the charachters, but not enough to get \\"into\\" the charachter's skin. When something major happened to a supporting character, I was almost like \\"Who Cares--get to the point\\" because there was not enough development to make me care enough.Second of all, I found the charachter of Joe, Lacy's African-American boyfriend and Tony's college comrade EXTREMELY unrealistic. Supposedly, Joe was a goergeous, ex-player who had started his own mortgage company and was so successful that he had major investment companies vying to earn his business. Young, Black, Successful and Rich and willing to do anyting to please Lacy. There was very little mention of the issues that plague African-American women especially when dealing with successful black men. There was absolute trust and harmony (and as far as I'm concerned, complete fairytale) that just left me feeling like---where has the author been over the last couple of decades? Step back into reality!Thirdly, the novel intrigued me at first with the relationship budding between Lacy and Tony, but after the first brief interlude, I was waiting for more taboo interractions. There were none. There was almost no interaction between Lacy and Tony after the fact, and I found myself waiting to \\"see\\" more of this chemistry the book kept mentioning.I was so bored and annoyed with Lacy's immature mom and her best friend, Dawn and little sister, Renee that I almost had to skip over the chapters that focused on them. BUT, I couldn't do that for fear that I might miss something good, which unfortunately NEVER happened. Oh, and I almost forgot--about 2/3 of the story was about them; not the interracial theme that brought us to this book in the first place. Do I need to say the majority was useless, wasteful page fillers? To say the least, this book was totally predictable. There were NO surprises, twists, turns--oohs or aahs. The book never got into the complexities of an interracial romance. I never got into Lacy's head. Everyone in the book knew she had a thing for her boss, Tony. It was just too bad that, I, as the reader could not.In the end, after Lacy discovered what she truly wanted and who she wanted, I just could not understand her foolish avoidance game. I mean, what the heck? She went through all of that soul searching, just to casually let it all slip away without an answer or explanation. Without closure. At this point, I'm calling Lacy all kind of names and getting really annoyed with her character.To sum it all up, this book just doesn't work--at all. It was a waste of my time and money.

This story was not well developed at all. I mean how and when did she fall in love with Tony???? I could see some sort of development of love with Joe. Her family was crazy, then throw in the mix of her friends and I was confused. It seems like there should be a part two to this book. Lizette here are some hints for a possible part two, develop the love story between The two main characters. Since Dawn is moving to Miami, develop a relationship between her and Joe.

But towards the end of the book she kind of let me down. It was like her writing style was kind of melting down. I don't know if she just didn't have the same zeal for the book as she did when she first starting writing it, but something happended. She left me hanging also with the romance of Lacie and Tony. I was expecting more to develop between the two of them, but it never happened. According to the book, in my opinion, Joe was the better catch than Tony. He seemed more into Lacie, whereas Tony seemed to be more infactuated with her. It was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"One reason that I love romance novels is the pure adrenalin rush that comes from exciting chemistry between the main characters. From the moment the characters meet in this book I waited for the electricity. It was written like the writer was given a four book deal and one of the books had to be an Interracial romance. Lacie Adams is supposed to be a mature woman with an education and life experience. Tony Douglas, her love interest is written like a high school senior. I expect to feel swept away by romance, not dragged through a jerry springer like experience. There was so much time spent on the storylines of other characters, I almost forgot the two main characters were supposed to be involved. I love it when a writer creates a love story that is grand, passionate and does not apologize for being a romance, no matter what the ethnicity of the characters."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"This story was a little disappointing.

In The Color Line, Lacie and Tony meet each other and the initial attraction is there. Then they find out that he is her new boss.

She confronts the issue that Tony is not the sexy black man that she should be in love with. However, Joe, Tony's friend and business associate, is a sexy black man who happens to be in love with Lacie. While confronting family issues with her younger sister and mother, she keeps Tony at a distance and continues to date Joe, even though she is not sure that she loves Joe. Right up to the end, we watch as Lacie tries to decide which man she will choose and whether she will cross the color line!

The ending weak and disappointing. There was dialog that made the story pick up and me laught out loud even say \\"I know she didn't\\" I Was really let down with the story line on Simone.I waited for a final out come and the story just let me down.The failuar to commit to the charator was a real let down."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"Unfortunately the concensus on this book is correct...the romance was a let down.

The mother reminded me of a few of my friends mothers (do what I say, not what I do-attitude)...the mother was more likeable than Lacie.Lacie's rational for not getting with Toni wasn't believable.

Overall this is a great book, a real page turner."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book!!!!!! I feel that Lacie's experience is typical of what many Black women in the coporate world encounter. Black women have a tendency to want to remain faithful to Black men. Lacie tried to hold back her feelings for Tony but in the end was unable to. I found the book very easy to read and after finishing each chapter I didn't want to put it down. The compeling drama kept me intrigued enough to forge on a little further. This book had substance, not just a continuous flow of sexual encounters. As in real life, our decisions are strongly influenced by our circumstances and beliefs. Lacie had to make many decisions amongst having to deal with Renee and her Mom. She errored and Joe was hurt. But in the end she made the right decision for herself. I respected her for that. The ending of the book leaves me curious and excited about the future for Tony and Lacie. Perhaps, we'll find out more about Tony's family and how they will react to their son's crossing of the color line... I can't wait for the sequel!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"The Color Line was a fantastic book. I think that the author touched alot of important spots the have to do with interracial relationships and the things you have to think about before crossing that line. To the author if you read your comments. I hope that you don't even think about the nasty comments people make. It takes a lot of hard work to write a book. I think you are a very talented and gifted writer. I am definietly waiting for you to write the sequel. I think that The Color Line 2 will be fantastic as well. Personally from what I saw in this book I would buy anything you write. In the story I think that Laci did what she had to do to come to a decision about Joe and Tony. She couldn't just be with Tony because she thought he was attractive when they first met. I think that made for a good story to have them fall in love at the end. My heart raced throughout the whole book. I have never read a book of that size in 2 days. I was glued to the book from the very first page I read. All I can say is I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!! I think it is something that people should buy and I think if they understand it, they will love it as a did."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"Lizette Carter's debut novel, \\"The Color Line,\\" is a refreshing voice and a welcome addition to the growing body of BW/WM interracial romance. Laci is an administrative assistant wanting to impress her new boss; on her way to meet him (she's late, of course), she bumps into an attractive (albeit white) man on the elevator and they share a \\"moment.\\" As luck would have it, the stranger from the elevator IS her new boss, Tony. As they begin to work together, their initial attraction grows, but (of course- it's an IR) Laci panics, not only because Tony is her boss, but more because of his skin color. She runs from her growing feelings by hiding behind a relationship with Joe, Tony's perfect, rich and handsome (and Black) best friend. But true love persists and Tony pushes the envelope until Laci is forced to acknowledge her fears and confront her rigid beliefs.I truly enjoyed Tony's character; Laci, however, seemed to protest the relationship way beyond any normal sense. And her superwoman ways wore one me after awhile. Joe was wonderful, but boring; his character lacked depth. And the cast of supporting characters, with the exception of the neighbor and the friend from work, were a bit much. They had too much drama to interfere in Laci and Tony's relatiionship, and we never got to really understand why their love was so strong, especially since it was almost instant.Lizette Carter writes snappy dialogue and actually gives her secondary players a story, which may romance authors neglect. And the story has enough realism and depth to make \\"The Color Line\\" a true page turner. Looking forward to seeing more work from this talented newcomer."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"In \\"The Color Line\\", author Lizette Carter introduces Lacie - an administrative assistant with aspirations for career growth and an improved love life. At the start of this tale, Lacie is facing a change on her job as her boss has moved on. Lacie literally runs into her new boss, Anthony Douglas (Tony), on the elevator. The physical attraction between them is obvious, yet Lacie is not interested in pursuing her instant attraction with her Caucasian boss.Before things begin to develop beyond the physical for Lacie and Tony, Lacie has a second encounter with a man she'd briefly met in a nightclub. Joe, a wealthy and handsome African American male, happens also to be good friends with Tony. As Joe represents - on paper at least - all that Lacie has ever wanted in a man, she fights her physical attraction to Tony and begins to pursue a relationship with Joe. The trouble comes when the initial attraction between Tony and Lacie won't die a quiet death. Lacie soon begins to wonder if she'd dare cross the \\"color line\\".The great majority of the book deals with Lacie fighting a battle of wills with her self. Throughout the story, other characters are introduced with their own challenges. The side stories involving Lacie's pregnant teenaged sister and embattled mother, Lacie's best friend Dawn and finally her neighbor are not developed to any degree of satisfaction. I never came to fully understand the root of her mother's bitterness and detachment. At the end of the book, I still wanted to know why/how Dawn ended up in the situation she did. Details of each of these characters are introduced and skimmed over, but never developed enough to satisfy me as a reader. In this case, the sub-plots only become distractions.The author spends most of the book trying to address the tension Lacie faces due to her competing interests in Tony and Joe. However, by the time Lacie confronts her feelings for Tony (in the last 10% of the book), it just felt like it was too little too late. The author wrapped up the most intriguing part of this story - the confrontation - in the last few pages. All in all, I felt that all the makings of a compelling story where in place, but the intrigue and interest were not fully realized. In the end, it was a very unsatisfying culmination of a disjointed story."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"I like this book, I like the different angle it took regarding the IR romance it is more about a woman's struggle to accept a relationship with a white man rather than the relationship itself hence the triangle aspect between Joe, Lacie and Tony. My only complaint is I think too much is happening in the book, the drama with the mother, sister and the best friends issues. The men also come across as too good to be true, Tony patiently waits for Lacie to accept him, Joe comes to accept too quickly the broken engagement. As for Lacy accepting Joe's proposal cos he is the right colour I suppose there are people who would rather follow society's unspoken rules rather than follow there heart - so that was realistic.All in all not bad for a debut novel perhaps a sequel to see what happens to Joe and to see if Lacy and Tony make it would be interesting."},{"Title":"The Color Line (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"I've read the majority of the reviews and I've found that we all have one thing in common. We wanted more romance between the main characters. In truth, the author doesn't give enough time to the romance between Lacie and Tony, nor does she develop Tony's character. Personally, I wanted to know more about Tony and less about Joe. Other than that, it was an interesting and entertaining read and a definite ACCOMPLISHMENT for a first time writer.

You would think that the main characters would be Lacie and Tony but apparently the author decided that a triangle would work best hence Joe enters the picture.

Okay my rant is over now (sort of)Lacie who is black and Tony who is white meet on an elevator and are instantly attracted to one another. They soon find out that they will be working together and the romance soon begins. Had the story stayed focus on these two characters and dealt with Lacie's issues regarding loving a man of another race in a mature fashion it would have been more satisfying. Instead we have Lacie in love with a wonderful white man who LOVES her and she him decides to starts a relationship with another man Joe who is not only perfect but BLACK. Did I mention that he was also Tony friend and business associate? How mature is this? So it comes down to her toying with Joe's affection because she is too afraid to acknowledge her relationship to Tony to the world which in this case also means standing up to family.Okay I indicate that there was a \\"but\\" in this review so here goes; But if you can read this and focus solely on Lacie and Tony whose relationship could have been explored a lot more than the wasted efforts of the triangle the story might not irritate any level headed woman.

For a long time he has lived in the world of the white man, though he still remembers the teachings of his grandfather, the shaman...The rest of the town is full of normal everyday people, and a few odd ones who are just as much a fixture of the town as the desert land.When Wally Grier unearths a Native American burial ground with his backhoe, none of them are safe. First one, then another, and then another fall victim. No one is safe from the Night Things...I love stories like this. Not the premise, per se, but the many great characters that make up the story. Sheriff Lopez was not constructed to be one of those good-ol-boys stuck on taking care of everything themselves. He is willing and eager to accept help when he knows he needs it. He is a honest, friendly and open man, whose character is easy to figure out and like. He is by far my favorite character in the book, though others have larger parts.An odd mixture of people join forces in this book: a newspaperman, a sheriff, a deputy, a professor of anthropology and old Charlie who has the knowledge of a shaman. Its amazing to me how the author was able to combine the many different personalities and actions in this story and make them work. Each chapter is covers the actions of a different person, going back and forth between the major and minor characters. The writing is very good, enabling me to comfortably swing from one character to another without losing the flow of the story.With all the makings of a great B-horror movie, but many great characters to achieve even greater status, Night Thins is a wonderful read, sure to thrill all those horror fans."},{"Title":"Night things","review":"I purchased this book brand new and completely cold off the shelf. I knew nothing of the author, but simply from seeing the cover and reading the excerpt on the inside I felt it should feed the overwhelming addiction to horror and gore I was fully under the influence of at the time. Getting home on a friday afternoon I read it front to back and re-read it again, over the weekend. Needless to say bing very satisfied with the choice to buy it and totally entertained by a great story filled with native american mysticism, gore, suspense to be sure but a lot more as well, it was simply a great read.Here we are 25 years later and I have been for ever-and-a-day trying recall all the images this book had left permanently etched into my slowly fading memory. You see, I have been trying to find this book after having foolishly lent it to someone else and never getting it back all those years ago. As time has gone on I've tried every couple of years to dig into the drudge and/or find help to track a copy down but had been becomming more unsure of the title (funny how age has that effect on the mind! That and not being able to recall the authors name.) The net has not been a help either, constantly getting listings for the book by Michael Talbot or lyrics for Ronnie Milsap tend to leave one feeling empty. Low and behold tonight I was lucky enough to stumble into here by pure chance and read the other reviews below. POW!! I've struck gold!This is a really fun ride and I have had a special space on my shelf just waiting for this gem! Finally, after 25 years!! The copy I just purchased should be here by this weekend, I guess I can wait a little longer...Thanks for the help and hopefully this helps someone else."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics: H. P. Lovecraft Volume 4 2002 (Graphic Classics)","review":"HP Lovecraft is an author that has faced many, many terrible adaptations. His stories seem to work best the way they were originally intended, as prose stories, with his vocabulary and writing style painting a picture no visual can match. Nothing else quite captures that unique flavor.However, Graphics Classics, with these illustrated adaptations, seems to have scooped up generous portions of the Lovecraft feeling, enough to make \\"Graphic Classics: H. P. Lovecraft\\" one of the few gems. All of the illustrators involved have their own flair, and most work surprisingly well with the source material. This is the updated second edition, and contains over 75 pages of new material. They definitely kept the best stories, cut out some of the ones that didn't work so well, and have created a must-have for Lovecraft fans.Included are:A Memory - An illustrated poem, sliced from A Fungi from Yuggoth. A beautiful introduction to what you are about to experience.The Shadow Over Innsmouth - One of Lovecraft's greatest yarns, a tale of buried and cursed genealogy. It is artfully adapted by Simon Crane, who captures just right that \\"Innsmouth look\\".Dreams in the Witch-House - Old Keziah Mason and Brown Jenkin won't let something like death and a couple of centuries stop them from completing the geometric rites demanded by Nyarlathotep. Artist Rich Rainey adds just the right claustrophobic fear to this tense tale.Sweet Ermengarde - This one I had never actually heard of before! A comedy of eight acts depicting the faithlessness of a woman's heart. No tentacles or monsters, and almost more Mark Twain than Lovecraft, but a fun read. Adapted by Rob Lott and Kevin Atkinson, who pump on the comedy on this rare gem.Herbert West: Reanimator - A round-robin style piece that has several artists taking a few pages of the story. A bit disappointing, because styles are too drastically different. Would have been much better if Richard Corben had done the complete story, rather than only the first few pages, but that is just because I like him so much. All of the artists represent well.The Cats of Ulthar - Exactly what it should be like. Artist Lisa Weber's unique style works perfectly with this fanciful tale of feline furry.The Terrible Old Man - A great bit, with perfect art. Onsmith Jeremi makes a creepy tale even creepier, with his cartoonesque depiction of those yellow eyes.The Shadow Out of Time - Another creative adaptation. I am surprised that Matt Howarth managed to compress this novelette into 22 pages without losing anything important. I really wouldn't have thought this was possible until I read it!"},{"Title":"Graphic Classics: H. P. Lovecraft Volume 4 2002 (Graphic Classics)","review":"I think the previous reviewer has covered the material fairly well. So I will mention mostly points of divergence.\\"Herbert West: Reanimator\\" - I thought having each section illustrated by a different artist captured the essence of the serialization of the novel. To my mind, it was always rather jarring to have each section of the story reintroduce the previous events; having a different artistic style with each installment acknowledge this.\\"The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\\" - it should be pointed out that these are only excerpts. It would otherwise be a much longer novel, but still it should be said.\\"The Outsider\\" - I happened to enjoy this. It is Gothic horror without the Cthulhu-squishiness. I always enjoy a little something different.\\"The Cats of Ulthar\\" - Here I agree with the reviewer; set in HPL's Dreamlands, the illustrations are very dreamlike - somewhat caricatured and abstract, with flowing outlines carrying a hint of menace.\\"Fungi from Yuggoth\\" - I don't have \\"fungi\\" in any of my collections, so i was just glad to have it here."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics: H.

I also use this book heavily in my Classics course - so it has a multitude of uses.Overall, a thorough, unbiased, but easy to read account of western civilization.

Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"Admittedly, I expected a lot from this book. I had just learned about Bernays from Stuart Ewen's book Spin: A Social History of PR &amp; was looking forward to getting a balanced picture of this alleged master. Tye's book did not fit the bill and, unfortunately, most of Bernay's books seem to be out of print. My main problem with the book is that Tye does not document the connection between Bernay's schemes &amp; their outcomes - were Bernay's efforts smoke &amp; mirrors that simply presaged natural turns in public opinion or did they actually manage to influence public opinion? This is the main question that I wanted the book to address, and it simply did not do it. Furthermore, the book is structured non-chronologically, and Tye does not have the skill as an author to bring Bernay's life together coherently in this manner; at best the structure is a good idea poorly executed. Check out Ewen's book for a more cogent history of public relations (including Bernay's innovations)."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"You've seen Wag the Dog and Primary Colors, you've watched politicians talk out of both sides of their mouths, you've seen the President get into trouble only to have the spin doctors bail him out. Ever wonder where it all started? This book is what you new to read to find out.Larry Tye gives you the reader an in depth look at Edward Bernay's and the birth of public relation or the beginnings of spin. From Bernay's start in the 1920's to his revolutionary ideas of parading women down the streets of New York to promote smoking you'll get a fist hand look at how spin works.Read through the 260 plus pages and see why we use spin, how public relations can and does affect public opinion. Watch and learn from the father or master of the public relations. Larry Tye has a well researched and extremely detail account of the beginnings.Fascinated and educated are the two words to describe what I walked away from this book with. Fascination about Bernay's ability to make things come out his way and sway the public to follow, educated has to how spin control works in today's culture. A great read for all!"},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"Bernays is generally acknowledged as the Father of PR. But, is he also the Father of Spin?Tye writes a fascinating biography of this key communications individual, filled with the key episodes that earned Bernays his moniker. From getting women to smoke to getting people to eat bacon, Bernays always seemed to figure out a way.But, Tye focuses heavily on these episodes and gives short shift to the implictions and consequences of Bernays's actions beyond fattening the bottom line. While it is true Bernays could not have fully appreciated all the consequences, his relentless drive to serve his clients reveals a man who forgot that public relations means being the conduit between the public and the client, not being another salesman, no matter how clever.If you're interested in seeing the modern fruition of Bernays's tactics, then I suggest Michael Levine's Guerilla PR: Wired, which updates Bernays's ideas into the digital age.Overall, this book is well-worth reading if you're interested in a man's actions. But, if you're interested in seeing how a man's actions can affect the world, then you might be better off with another book."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"The book is entertaining in parts and provides interesting information to someone who has no prior knowledge on Bernays. But considering the impact Bernay's ideas &amp; work made on PR and spin and consequently the American way of life, I found the writing style to be rather flippant; and the book, as a whole, skimpy. From the research material available and the interviews which he had conducted, Tye could have written a more substantial if not a scholarly piece, irrespective of his sentiments for Bernays the person. Perhaps, that was not his intention. However, Tye did make a bold claim with his title, and I naturally expected more from his book."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"You can't possibly understand the history of the 20th century without coming to grips with Edward Bernays. Bernays bragged in his autobiography that Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels valued his book &quot;Crystalizing Public Opinion&quot; above all others in his library. Bernays, a relative of Sigmund Freud, applied his formidable intellect to corporate-sponsored tasks such as convincing women to smoke and demonizing movements for land reform in the Third World. Sadly, this thoroughly amoral individual's outlook on life - bend the truth for the highest bidder regardless of who is harmed - has become the norm, not the exception, among &quot;communications&quot; professionals who apply their craft with a charm and polish that belies the often deadly consequences of their &quot;campaigns.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"Tye's book is a must-read for any self-respecting PR wizard. How Bernays was able to engineer PR strategies for such diverse products as books and bananas, from Mack trucks to Lucky Strikes and even foreign countries, is ingenious and artful. His creativity hath no bounds. He elevated the practice to a social science, and build roads for the profession. He drafted a historical argument, outlining 5 stages of PR history in America, the last stage being the most interesting to me. This was the &quot;Period of Mutual Understanding,&quot; quote: &quot;a time when PR came to mean 'not a one-way street for giving information to the public for our clients but rather one of interpreting the public to the client as a basis for their action and, after the action had been carried out, interpreting the client to the public.'&quot; If only all of us could be so articulate with our clients! Entertaining accounts on how he performed the craft (i.e., selling books by selling builders on the inclusion of book shelves in new homes)and his allegiance to &quot;Big Think,&quot; were my favorate parts and I could not hear enough about them. The book explores the complex, contradictory nature he possessed and a surprise revelation in the end (and at the end of Bernay's life), will have you spellbound in disbelief."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"Tye is accused of not offering a definitive judgment of Bernays because he offers too much &quot;one the one hand&quot; and &quot;other hand&quot; descriptions. Others feel the story should have been more chronological. I think these criticisms reflect the readers' problems rather than Tye's. I am interested in coming to my own conclusions, and Tye's descriptions and topical arrangements help me do that. I do not want to merely swallow a biographer's perspective without also considering other material about the person and the topic in general -- books such as Ewen's and other material. This is a fascinating story told well and offers a useful focus on one aspect of a much larger issue, which is how we are constructed as consumers and voters in late 20th century America."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"As a non-PR person, I thoroughly enjoyed The Father of Spin because it confirmed my suspicion that a large part of our history was and today still is &quot;manufactured&quot; out of the offices of spin. Larry Tye's portrayal of Bernays seems very balanced. However, having read the contents of the book I am inclined to say that the credit given to Bernays is somewhat over-rated by naming him the Father of Spin. One question needs to be raised: Is the information and news we see everyday inspired by commerce or actual events?"},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"I stuck with this book hoping that its entertaining portions would yield to something carefully crafted and insightful. Instead, I finished the book somewhat entertained, but hankering for more substance.What EXACTLY did Bernays accomplish? What REALLY is his legacy? What drove the man? Tye offers no detailed answers, just anecdotes and weak analysis. Indeed, Tye regularly confuses detail for substance, telling readers about the various office addresses Bernays retained, but not getting to the nub of Bernays' relationship with Freud.Tye presents neither a thorough chronology of Bernays' career nor a thoughtful review of this enigmatic man's persona and pysche. In the process, he relies much too heavily (for my liking) on family testimony (I, for one, couldn't care less what Bernays' grandkids thought of their grandfather).As a former PR flack, I appreciated the facts surrounding some of Bernays'campaigns. But as a reader, I was frustrated that Father of Spin never really took me anywhere new, leaving me ambivalent about Bernays and his legacy and unconvinced that the book's title is appropriate in the least."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"Larry Tye takes on a subject that few journalists would regard of savory: the biography of a PR man. One might dismiss PR people as not meriting attention or even toleration. But Tye walks a fine line here because the life of Eddie Bernays has some tension and complexity, and the book makes that clear. He is a worthwhile character study, not just for people in the communications industry, but also those in business more generally, politics, or interested in consumer and opinion issues. As Freud's nephew, Bernays carried around more heritage than most, and how he shoulders that burden creates interest. Bernays also placed himself at the forefront of an industry's development, and that creates another set of issues. The book is fraught with the same conflict that many deal with in communications: are they adding egocentric bias to information, or warping it for vested powers? Lastly, Bernays had a role in helping leaders develop their visibility, but does he stand as a peer at their shoulders? Tye does a great job at making us reflect on these issues in this highly readable book."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. Tye chronicles Bernay's lifeand times well.

Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"This book does a disservice to its subject in its failure to communicate the big picture of Edward Bernay's life and work.

If you think you're free to choose you're not. You're programmed from the very beginning of life."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"While the first few chapters of the book are entertaining and informatative, the remaining chapters seem to merely add detail to what was already said.Because the book is not structured chronologically, you are forced to jump back and forth through some 75 years worth of events. In some cases, this forces you to revisit the same events in several different chapters. This makes it very difficult to place events in context. Also, the chapters didn't seem to carry equal weight.The book is very well researched and reported. However, it tries too hard to be objective. For every positive thing that the author says about Bernays, there is a negative thing to counter it. After completing the book, I am left with no opinion about the man and I'm unsure of what exactly he did accomplish."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"Larry Tye tells the fascinating story of Eddy Bernays, one of the major figures in the development of modern Public Relations. Bernays was a nephew of Sigmund Freud and much of his business was based on appealing to peoples psychology. He made the following analogy: Public relations isn't like pool, you're not trying to put the ball into the pocket, it's like billiards, you're trying to bank the ball off of a couple rails.When tobacco companies realized that the social taboo against women smoking in public was costing them half their business they turned to Bernays. He had a parade of women march down a New York City avenue bearing their &quot;torches of freedom&quot; &amp; soon the taboo was gone. When the changing pace of life started to cut into bacon consumption, folks weren't taking the time to eat breakfast, Bernays got doctors &amp; public health groups to make public pronouncements about the importance of breakfast &amp; soon bacon &amp; eggs were back in force. And when Ivory soap couldn't appeal to kids, bernays started soap carving contests &amp; soon millions of kids were carving millions of bars of ivory soap.All of these stories and gimmicks make for interesting reading, but even Tye seems to be ambivalent about their effectiveness. Was it parades or massive social forces that broke the cigarette taboo for women? Did kids actually use Ivory or just carve a bar of it &amp; lose interest?The interesting question he raises is, what was Bernays social responsibilty for his campaigns &amp; methods? Doesn't he bear some moral culpability for encouraging smoking, cholestorol, etc? &amp; what of Joseph Goebbels praise for Bernays methods? What does it say that the Nazis approved of his methods? Tye asks all of these questions, but he doesn't really take a strong stand in answering them.A more important problem with the book is it's narrative structure. Each chapter basically consists of Tye's reporting on a discreet topic, so it reads like a series of stories on Bernays &amp; Tobacco, Bernays &amp; Freud, etc.. It makes the book pretty choppy.All in all though, Tye's story of Bernays' career casts an interesting light on many episodes and issues of the past century &amp; it's amazing how pertinent Bernays' methods are in this Age of Spin.GRADE: B-"},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L.

Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"The story of Bernays and his impact on the industrial and post-industrial eras are a worthy topic to read about.Unfortunately, Tye's writing style is clunky and amphibolous - the words used seem to be an attempt at injecting some flair into the writing style, but fall flat when the words used take on many meanings depending on interpretation, or due to loose context. Re-reading sentences numerous times to establish what the writer intended to mean is not my idea of a good read.Tye also names a number of people who participate in an event (generally altogether at the beginning of a sentence - without giving context) and then proceeds to refer to 'he' or 'him', 'they' and 'others' etc. without being clear as to whom he refers.Take this sentence as an example:\\"And it's possible that the bolder claims in the stream of profiles on him were pumped up by reporters who knew it made a stronger story to credit him with everything from orchestrating a presidential visit to relocating an inventor's lab, and by columnists like Walter Winchell who Bernays says started the rumor that he, rather than the post office, was behind the Edison stamp.\\"Hanging sentences, undefined terms, ambiguous wording and run-on (to the point of run-away) sentences all detract greatly from this book. I would recommend looking into Bernays' life and work - even to the point of reading this book - but don't buy it with the expectation that it is well-written."},{"Title":"The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations","review":"Around one hundred years ago, the age-old human practices of hyperbole, bragging, gloating, pomposity, persuasion, incitement and rationalization evolved into the public relations industry. In all that time, no one has added anything of significance to the theories, methods and skills that were formally described, practiced and ballyhooed by Edward Bernays.Bernays personified everything good and bad about PR and its practitioners. Practicing PR without knowing about Bernays is like practicing psychiatry/psychology without knowing about Freud.

If you are working with web pages and want to make use of sounds, video, text, still images, or any other other kinds of media that QuickTime supports, you should buy and read this book.The book is chock full of information, but it's anything but a dry presentation. The author is witty, precise, and instructive. He approaches the subject in a way that presumes very little prior acquaintance with either QuickTime or HTML. Little by little, he teaches us how to do some amazing things.If you are a web page designer, a webmaster, or an HTML author, this book belongs close at hand in your office!"},{"Title":"Quicktime for the Web: For Windows and Macintosh (Quicktime Developer Series)","review":"This is an important resource for anyone who is serious about maximizing the potential of Quicktime.

I call this book 'a rare find', as it is great for beginner through master, leaving few questions unanswered or stones unturned. The text is a good mix of &quot;how to&quot; information combined with &quot;tips and tricks&quot; to get your implementations to work.I purchased this book for its material regarding steaming content over the Internet, and learned a great deal in the process. The chapter on QuickTime VR answered my &quot;how do they do that?&quot; questions, and has led me to explore the use of this technique for my upcoming projects.The QuickTime VR chapter is a good example of the depth of knowledge used to develop this text, as it gives in-depth information on photography techniques that only a mid- to experienced photographer would know.My only criticism of the book is that it only begins to explore about half of the knowledge needed to set up your own streaming web server, but I can hardly fault the authors for that -- it says right on the cover &quot;A Hands-On Guide for Webmasters, Site Designers, and HTML Authors.&quot; It says nothing about being aimed at System or Network Administrators. If your main interest in this book is the setup of streaming servers, you might want to consider another book (or better yet, purchase this book along with another to round out your knowledge).With the ... QuickTime Pro included, I can say without reservation that this is one of the best computer book values I have ever purchased. The book paid for the rest of the cost by showing me how to trick Microsoft Internet Explorer / Windows Media Player in such a way that it will not try to open your .mov files (great in a Windows-dominated environment)!Highly recommended, even if you have only a passing interest in QuickTime."},{"Title":"Quicktime for the Web: For Windows and Macintosh (Quicktime Developer Series)","review":"This book is excellent.

They are trapped by unseen aliens on their ship--aliens who create various distortions in reality, such as the disappearance of the port replaced by \\"a smooth, seamless curtain of impenetrable black.\\" The aliens test the crew members to see what their breaking points are.This is only a mystery in the science-fictional sense, but very like the locked-room variety. The strangeness of events and the pressure-cooker atmosphere give it the sense of an old Twilight Zone episode (before Twilight Zone existed). This isn't whirlwind paced, so maybe that's what one of the readers complained of, but it is a fascinating examination of what humans are capable of withstanding (i.e. can you take six impossible things before breakfast?).A well-observed writing sample: \\"Paresi was the Doctor, and had many a salve and many a splint for invisible ills.

It is an \\"I can read\\" book, designed for young readers, but it is rather lengthy, which is why I think I ended up reading the book to my niece. Plus the dialogue is a little forced... a lot of repeating the phrase 4 times in a row \\"Oh no oh no oh no oh no\\". I understand a little repetition is good in children's books, but this one kind of was overkill.I think kids starting out with reading will get bored half way through the book because its rather long. And the older kids that want longer stories will get bored with the actual story line.I did pick up on the craziness of the \\"hallucinations\\" after the medicine.

It's almost embarrassing on EK's part for how little proofreading they do. I've never seen so many typos and blatant errors in printed text before these books.Secondly, and more importantly, this book doesn't reflect the current MCAT. The current MCAT is focusing less on content and more on critical thinking, interpreting data, etc .

In going through the lecture passages, I've found that very few of the questions deal with the information presented in the corresponding EK bio book lectures, or even in the passages themselves. In fact, almost every question requires information presented in later chapters. This means that anyone who desires to do well on these questions will need to read the entire bio book before attempting these passages. This has become very demoralizing for me, and has caused me to lose much of the confidence I had while doing the exercises in the EK Bio lecture (which, I might add, ALWAYS correspond closely with the lectures), which I did quite well in.In addition, I have found several poorly written questions and/or answers that have lead me to select an incorrect answer where I wouldn't have if the author had been paying attention to his wording. Honestly, I'm having trouble trusting in this book and I wonder exactly how much help it's going to be if I can't use it to reinforce the lectures because the content is different. I think the book may have actually been worth buying if it had been written by John Orsay (the author of the other EK 1001 and EK lecture books) instead of some third year med student (the actual author) with no editor, and who apparently didn't read the EK bio book at all.Basically, if you want a practice book that will frustrate and demoralize you, give you questions that you have no chance to answer because the information was not given in either the corresponding lectures or the passage itself, and provide a plethora of errors in grammar, punctuation, and syntax then BUY THIS BOOK!Thanks,Phil S."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Biology","review":"My ExamKrackers 1001 MCAT Biology Questions book came in a short time in brand new condition. I enjoy that it provides both passage and open-ended biology questions just like the real MCAT!!"},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Biology","review":"Bought a used copy, just not happy that there was too much writing in it. Writing practically on every page which made this book kind of useless."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Biology","review":"OK, it has been a week since I bought this book, and I've already gotten a pretty decent feel for what the MCAT Bio questions are all about. In my opinion, there are three basic types of bio questions: stand-alones (where memory recall is needed the most), questions that solely rely on what's stated in the passage, and questions that involve a mix of both passage and recall.For a little info about me, I've just started studying for the MCAT, and I plan to take it next year (Summer 2012). I have all the 1001 question series books and the subject-matter Examkracker (EK) books so far (Berkeley Review books are coming next week). To be honest, what I score on the MCAT is not a big deal to me, and I would only take it a maximum of two times if needed. My undergraduate GPA is 3.97 (Pathologist's Assistant major), I have relevant clinical work experience, and I will have volunteer and shadowing experience by next year. So I'm not worried about this exam at all. Even if I do score poorly, I have a feeling I'll get in (and frankly, at least one medical school has to accept me...they'd be stupid not to). Worse comes to worse, I'll apply to Caribbean schools as well. I spoke to quite a few med students who got accepted with MCAT scores of 22 to 26 (!), and they said that the MCAT is BS. It is not an appropriate gauge for how well you'll do on USMLE Step 1, since the med students I spoke with passed that exam although they did poorly on the MCAT. But enough about my medical school rant...For 1001 Bio, I feel that it could use a lot of work. For one thing, the book is not consistent at all with EK Bio. 1001 Bio attempts to categorize the passages into lectures corresponding to EK Bio, but it fails miserably in this regard. Just taking a look at the first passage on water, there are questions involving subject matter that's covered in LATER lectures! Therefore, there's no way to possibly answer those questions correctly until you study all the material in EK Bio. Follow me so far?EK Bio does a fantastic job of dividing the subject matter into nine discrete units with about 6 or so questions interspersed at random intervals within the units themselves. Those questions relate directly to the material previously discussed. Also, all of the passages in the in-class exams at the end of the book are totally relevant to their corresponding lectures. In 1001, this is not the case.As a result, the student is left with the task of having to study all of the content in EK Bio first before tackling the bio questions in 1001. If you don't do that, then you're going to have a hard time trying to nail every single question in 1001 on the first go, and you'll literally think that something is wrong with you (a previous reviewer mentioned this, and I can see why). The fact that this book was written by Alex Merkulov, a third-year medical student, is most likely the problem. I bet you that if this book was written by Jonathan Orsay, the author of the EK subject matter books AND the other 1001 books (!), the questions would be better aligned with the appropriate lectures. I guarantee you that would be the case. Merkulov acknowledges Orsay in the beginning of the book, but I highly doubt he actually consulted him for this particular book...and if he did, Orsay would have probably shot him.So in summary, yes, you should buy this book, but be prepared to get started on the questions AFTER you've gotten EK Bio down cold."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Biology","review":"This book is full of errors.

From my experience with the book 101 passages in Verbal Reasoning, I was impressed with Examkracker's accurate represenation of real MCAT questions. However, I soon found numerous errors in the questions used in this book, and I confirmed that they were wrong with several physiology and biology professors. From that point, I gave up on the book, because it caused more harm than good."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Biology","review":"I bought this book to help me brush up on my biology for the MCAT and to get a feel for what the questions would be like. While this book does have some moderate degree of usefulness, I would probably not buy it again. As others have said, this book is FULL of errors! It's both time consuming and frustrating. At times I was convinced that the author (a 3rd year med student who hopes to be a surgeon, according to the back of the book) had no idea what he was writing about (seriously, take a look at the passages in the \\"Microbiology\\" section. 1) They have almost NOTHING to do with microbiology and 2) The passages themselves are very choppy and incoherent, 3) The questions seldom have anything to do with the passage.) The book is good for the covering the areas which you know almost nothing about (i.e., stuff you covered for a week in Bio 1, but haven't taken another class in or thought about since.) If you have knowledge beyond the Bio 1/Bio 2 level of the subject, feel free to skip that section because the mistakes will drive you crazy in a hurry and just make you doubt your awesome self. You will save yourself a lot of time and one big head ache. All in all, there was some good information, and there were a lot of questions, but I'm sure that there are better books out there. If you do decide to go with this book, just keep this in mind; If you THINK the book is wrong, it probably is. Don't sweat it. Move on.UPDATE: For what it's worth, I ended up getting a 14 in the Biological Sciences section of my MCAT. I still think this book has a lot of silly errors, but I guess I would have to say that it definitely helped me improve my score.

I don't understand how people could rate it so low for the SMALL mistakes the book had. The mistakes were so minor, just like a misspelling or something extremely minute. NOT A BIG DEAL, not so problematic that a normal person can't overlook and continue working. This book gave me much needed practice, review and it did it while duplicating the real MCAT format in terms of passages followed by questions. With a few estimations on time you can actually time yourself like I did and go through the book/chapters timed like on a real MCAT exam. The explanations were thorough and understandable. You can definitely improve by at least 3 points when you finish this book. I strongly recommend timing yourself through each chapter, treat the chapters like mini exams."},{"Title":"Examkrackers 1001 Questions in MCAT Biology","review":"This book contains 101 MCAT Biology passages and 1001 questions overall.

Many of the questions asked are very good thought questions and I didn't find as many mistakes as other reviewers had noted. I ended up doing each and every last question in this book I didn't think there was much improvement to be made once you hit double digits but I was happily surprised. For self-study before the new MCAT format comes out I totally recommend the these 1001 question books to solidify that science base."},{"Title":"Trusting Thy Word","review":"I enjoyed James Draper's book, Trusting Thy Word.

In fact, that is part of the reason he married her. In contrast, Marcello struggles mightily with what he considers his abnormal tendencies. As a child he killed lizards for sport as any boy might, but felt uneasy about the wanton slaughter, and so sought from a friend and his mother some indication that killing lizards was okay. Later he kills a cat, although this is mostly accidental, and as a young teenager shots a homosexual limo driver named Lino. He feels something akin to consternation for these actions, not guilt exactly, but an unease since doing such things is not what he thinks normal people do.It is his need to be--or at least to appear--\\"normal\\" that drives Marcello to conform to society's mores and persuades him to embrace fascism. He only feels really at ease when he sees himself as part of the common herd, on the installment plan, buying ordinary furniture, living in an apartment like a thousand others, having a wife and children, reading the newspapers, going to work, etc. He is not a peasant of course, but an educated functionary in the Italian Secret Service, a man with impeccable manners who seldom says more than is absolutely necessary.The idea that fascists in general follow the herd and adopt a superficial and uncultured world view is no doubt largely correct, but the essence of fascism is the belief in authoritarian rule, the stratification of society, intolerance of diversity, and a willingness, even an eagerness to use force and violence to obtain such ends. The psychology underlying Moravia's portrait is the idea that Marcello sees in himself the violent and selfish tendencies and so it is only natural that he should adopt a political philosophy that condones and acts out such tendencies.Moravia treats fascism in the person of Marcello more kindly than I believe he imagined he would when he began the novel, given Moravia's hatred of the fascist movement that seduced much of Europe following the First World War. But this is the necessary consequence of being an objective novelist. In drawing a living, breathing portrait of Marcello, Moravia allows us to see him as a complex person with strengths and weaknesses who deals with the trials of life sometimes in a despicable way, and sometimes, indeed often, in a way that most of us would choose were we in his shoes. Therefore it is impossible not to identify with him to some degree. It is an artifact of Moravia's artistry that we do in fact in the end identify with Marcello and may even realize that in his situation, we too might have embraced fascism or at least tolerated it.A secondary theme in the novel is that of unrequited love or of desire that is not returned. All of the main characters, Marcello, Lino, Giulia, Quadri and Lina love someone who does not return their love. Marcello briefly falls madly in love with Lina who is a lesbian who despises him. Lina in turn is desperately in love with Giulia who only has eyes for her husband, who does not really love her. The inability of the characters to love the one who loves them is played out partly through a disparity in personality and political belief, and partly through differing sexuality. Lino and his latter-day incarnation in an old British homosexual who drives around Paris picking up indigent young men seldom if ever find their love returned although they might temporarily quench their desire. No one in the novel experiences love both in the giving and the receiving.Part of Marcello's unease with himself comes from his ambivalent sexuality. He cannot return the intense passion that Giulia feels for him although apparently he does manage to perform his husbandly duties adequately. Perhaps even more to the point, he seems to project a need for the \\"abnormal\\" experience. He is twice mistaken for a homosexual, and he falls in love with a homosexual of the opposite sex--thus the \\"Lino\\" and the \\"Lina\\" of his life. Marcello seems to have a blindness about invert sexuality just as he has a blindness about human morality. He is a man who does not what he thinks is right but what others think is right. He fears his natural impulses. Moravia illustrates this by occasionally having him nearly give into what he feels inside, as in the case of Lina, only to have him realize that to act from his heart is dangerous.In the final analysis Marcello finds that \\"the normality that he had sought after with such tenacity for so many years...was now revealed as a purely external thing entirely made up of abnormalities\\" (quote from near the beginning of Chapter Nineteen).Moravia (born Alberto Pincherle) is in my opinion one of the great novelists of the 20th century and The Conformist is representative of his best work. Incidentally this was made into a beautiful film by Bernardo Bertolucci while not entirely true to the novel, is nonetheless very much worth seeing."},{"Title":"The conformist","review":"Six reviews in 12 years. What a shame. This is a great book taking on a small story from Italy's war legacy.What happened in Italy from the 1920's to the 1950's is so overshadowed by larger events that one may not fully appreciate the drama that unfolded. Post WWI Italy probably had more economically in common with Mexico or Brazil than any of the other Western European countries. Low literacy, a high birthrate, underdeveloped industries and largely agrarian it was hardly yet a country but a series of regions sharing a passport.Moravia is one of the few voices that succeeds in taking on some of the stories of what it was to be Italian. Many wanted to believe in fascism and buy into Mussolini's plan to expand and industrialize. I don't know much about that period myself but in \\"The Conformist\\" Moravia's everyman characters realistically portray some of the likely people that lived and worked in Rome.Marcello Clerici is a young boy of 12 or 13 in 1920 who is the product of a bad union. His wealthy father is unpredictable in his anger and temper and his mother is young and more uninterested in parenthood. Moravia tells us that Marcello has a vague sense of the indifference that his parents have towards him. Birthdays and Christmas come and go with perhaps a gift or maybe not. There is an overwhelming desire to fit in somewhere, to conform; and equally it is unbearably embarrassing when called out. He is bullied at school. They force him into a skirt. As horrible as it is Moravia tells us he is not totally unhappy with the attention. Other disturbing incidents occur. Small animals die. He exposes a fury and temper that he obsesses over.The book jumps to the late 1930's. Marcello is now a fascist supporter. He is called upon to prove his loyalty by exposing an old professor as a traitor. He does but with wrinkles and twists. He is on his honeymoon. His wife is young, simple perhaps and not unlike his mother whom he now despises. At every point of the story Marcello considers every action. He both fits in and sees himself in the third person fitting in. He reflects his doubts about his professional and personal life and tries to reassure himself that he is on the side of right.As the tide turns and Mussolini is forced out he knows that his is a lost cause. Italians are happy and angry. War is over and yet it continues.It's a convincing tale with an evocative atmosphere. For a casual reader looking for some anecdote to discover what was happening it a worthwhile read. For Moravia's first Italian edition I wonder what the reaction would have been. In 1951 most of those working in government or security were likely the same ones as 1941; limiting civil liberties, eliminating opposition, arresting citizens, and mobilizing for war - all with disastrous results. What's the path to reconciliation? Probably blaming the boss and denial. One must wonder how long the scars remain."},{"Title":"The conformist","review":"Excellent and perceptive novel of italian fascist period and its effect on people in that period.

He's such a strange writer, yet when I'm reading his works I feel like the strange worlds they describe are totally normal.

It was truly one of those books that you don't want to put down. Truly a gripping story, even up to the last paragraph! I'll definitely be reading more Moravia works."},{"Title":"The conformist","review":"This novel is fairly difficult to follow at times, but the entire story comes together at the end. You do not have to really be into Moravia's other novels to enjoy this one, but you do have to have some patience. The good parts of the novel are only made better by the rather dull beginning. Read it if you have some free time and you want to get a taste of Moravia's talent."},{"Title":"The conformist","review":"This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself. This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie. Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel."},{"Title":"The Mafulu mountain people of British New Guinea","review":"This Kindle edition leaves out 100+ photographs which were in the original book.Since the text is largely a commentary on the plates, this version is rendered 95% useless.Another problem is the many charts are gibberish in this Kindle presentation."},{"Title":"The Mafulu mountain people of British New Guinea","review":"This book is a specialist item that will appeal to those with an historical and ethnographic interest in the peoples of Papua New Guinea. Th Mafulu (now called usually North Mekeo)are the people described and the research took place in 1910. Fortunate to have Sacred Heart missionaries, unlike others in nearby regions, their customs were respected and serious scholarship by the Fathers on kinship and language greatly aided Williamson's work. Sometimes tedious in thoroughness of its descriptions, with effort the book repays the reader. I purchased the Kindle edition and it is completely portable rather than on a university library's shelves."},{"Title":"Native Genius in Anonymous Architecture","review":"There's not other architectural history book out there that covers as much territory about \\"nameless\\" buildings as Sibyl Moholy-Nagy's Native Genius in Annymous Architecture. It continues to stand on its own in this regard even today, over 50 years after it was published.This book, published in 1957, examines several examples of different buildings in North America (and some in Europe), that have no architect's names attached to them. Moholy-Nagy looks at them through the lenses of their historical context, use of materials, and purposes/functions of the buildings. The one highlight of this book is her opening essay, which describes in detail the idea behind identifying anonymous structures, and how they came about. The second half of the book consists of an analysis of selected buildings and their locations. The book is well illustrated throughout, especailly the second half.A side note:Mrs. Moholy-Nagy, widow of Bauhaus artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, made a name for herself in the 50s and 60s on the architecture scene as a critic and teacher. Her writings contained larger-than-life ideas, and had thought-provoking statements about the current and future state of architecture. She published many articles in architecture magazines, wrote four of her own books, and contributed to two. After her early daeth in 1971, some of her criticisms seemed to fall by the wayside, almost to the point of being forgotten (not to mention all her books have since gone out of print). If she had lived through the rest of the 70s and beyond, I'm sure she would've been as active as she was in the previous decades, writing books and sharing her extensive ideas with the world."},{"Title":"The Observer's Year: 366 Nights in the Universe (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"The Observer's Year is a fascinating potpourri of sky observing delights; a book destined to serve many an astronomy buff as tattered-ear reference for years. With succeeding nights of the year as context, Patrick Moore opens a treasure chest of astronomy. Specific stars, galaxies, the Moon, planets, meteor showers, nebulae and clusters are described and discussed with a casual randomness not often seen in books of science. The author often pays homage to famous, and not so famous, heroes of astronomy, to great accomplishments or to noteworthy events. He marks many dates by describing an &quot;anniversary&quot; or &quot;future point of interest&quot; in margin notes. Tables and charts accompany many of the stories, and simple star maps are included for each month. Most welcome, this book is designed for those viewing the sky with naked eye, binoculars or small telescope, but the armchair astronomer will read and reread this book as well. The index is weak and, considering the randomized placement of the stories, makes finding specific items difficult. Also, the lack of photographs is often disappointing. But, all in all, this book is a good companion to any introductory astronomy text, and a great gift for the practical observer."},{"Title":"The Observer's Year: 366 Nights in the Universe (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"This is not the book to get if you have a telescope - the entries for each day of the year are oriented to naked-eye or binocular observing. The selections for each day of the year are a bit strange - e.g. lunar features are scattered throughout the book and tied to specific days but what you can see on the Moon will depend on the Moon's phase which will vary from year to year for each day of the year. This is likely to confuse beginners if they think they will see the lunar features he describes on any particular day. Better for Moore to have chosen from the long list of wonderful deep-sky objects whose visibility is certain for any day of the year.Patrick Moore is the &quot;grandfather&quot; of British observing books and was knighted for his contribution (some 70 books) to amateur astronomy. But he was 75 years old when he wrote this book and he spends a lot of time conveying his opinions rather than simply presenting objects for beginners to view. Two of many examples are: he throws in irrelevant diatribes against astrology (a subject on which I strongly suspect he is ignorant), and he states that telescope users must only observe the Sun by projecting its image on a screen, which will certainly surprise the thousands of telescope owners who regularly and safely use solar filters on their scopes for direct solar viewing. To his credit he does discuss objects to view from the southern hemisphere but he only discusses this with respect to Australia and New Zealand, ignoring the possibility that there might be amateur astronomers in South America or Africa.Moore does include interesting historical notes on many of his selections. But there are much better observing books around, and also much better books on the history of astronomy.I was disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Heinous Truth! about Utah!","review":"Well, I've just spent two of the most fantastic weeks in Salt Lake City and the state Utah, and just before I left, a dear friend of mine gave me a copy of this book.Back home I read it and just couldn't stop laughing, it's all so recognizable, witty and to the point.The power of this fantastic book lies in repeatedly naming everyday stuff, but in a way that is so sarcastic that it hurts you stomach from laughing out loud all the time.A must buy for everyone who's ever set foot in Utah, or intends to do so..."},{"Title":"The Heinous Truth! about Utah!","review":"&quot;Green Jello and Red Punch: The Heinous Truth about Utah&quot; is a perfect book for people who live or have lived in the Beehive State.

The lighthearted, humorous look at the eccentricities in the government, the people and their often unusual behavior was a nice reminder of what we loved and loved to hate about Utah. I disagree heartily with \\"offcenter\\" who sounds a bit defensive and appears to have expected an academic treatise rather than a lighthearted look at an unusual state-which appears to be what the book is actually about. What is suspicious though, is the need to question another reader's motivation for liking the book.

He states in millions of disclaimers put into the book that he's never been in Utah and knows nothing about the thesis he's written for the book, but it's obvious he's educated on what he's talking about and stretches every topic into a fabricated lie and manages to be extremely insulting. I personally am not a Mormon, which the book mocks, but I am from Utah and this \\"Heinous Truth About Utah\\" doesn't exist. The only truth about Utah that you need to know is that there aren't many Religious Fanatics, despite what uneducated people say. It's a nice place to live with scenery that's to die for.

Taylor is a book about how physics and nature come together and how physics explains nature. Now, before you get all huffy and discount reading this book, let me say this, the author has taken great pains in explaining the mathematics in this book, making a very understandable and highly readable book.This book has two major themes associated with its writing. First, there is a pattern of unification, the major example explained by the author is between magnetism and electricity, Research has showed that electricity and magnetism are interconnected... not that they are the same thing, but they are two aspects of a unified whole.The other major theme the author brings out in the book is that quite often, different branches of physics have seemed to contradict each other when taken together. As the contradiction is resolved in a new, consistent, wider theory which include the two branches. This is called the resolution of contradictions.What is so nice about this book is this, you'll need some knowledge of mathematics and physics, but the explaination is very understandable. There is a fascinating insight into the development of our fundamental understanding of the world, and the apparent simplicity underlying it.The author takes us on an interesting path that leads right to the heart of physics, but never forgettting that his readers are not as skilled at physics as he is. Therefore, he uses pictures in explaining the mathematical priciples associated with explaining the problem, translating the equations into words or pictures.I found this book to be highly readable and very understandable, explaining physics in terms that a layperson can gain the concepts and have a workable knowledge of what physics is all about. This book will get you on the ground floor."},{"Title":"Hidden Unity in Nature's Laws","review":"The author obviously has an amazing command of the complete range of his subject, physics. This book is both a an excellent history and an excellent narrative of the unfolding of man's search for the fundamental nature of the micro and macro nature of matter and the universe.My only fault with this book is a paradox: the author assumes that the readers &quot;don't know much about math&quot; so for most of the book he painfully avoids writing equations, and substitutes wordy explanations. In doing so some of the beauty of his narrative is lost. The paradox is that anyone whe is going to plow into this book and get anything out of it, had better have a good handle on math at least algebra."},{"Title":"Hidden Unity in Nature's Laws","review":"I don't know whether it's because the author is British or else my expectations were too low, but this text presents several communication problems. The syntax is frequently poor. E.g., \\"It was Clairaut who also correctly predicted the return of Haley's comet in 1759.\\" What happened in 1759? Clairaut's prediction or the return of Haley's comet? Words are frequently introduced early and explained later. Maybe most people in Great Britain know what a \\"parallax\\" is, but it is used five times before it's defined. Fortunately, an adequate, but by no means expansive, glossary is available. Many sentential structures are opaque, like \\"if the situation could exist, the work done on a particle in a closed curve would not be zero.\\" Antecedently, curves aren't even mentioned, nor are particles. Whence this expression about conservation of energy? This text causes a lot of similar kinds of confusion; many passages had to be reread several times to get its sense. (It can be done, but it's extremely time-consuming and highly annoying.) Mathematical formulas are introduced pages before their explanations (if one is even given). Reading science can be fun, but this book was absolutely no fun at all. I've read scores of science books, but none was as convoluted and contorted as this one.

A welcome read if you have just spent the last few books in heavy intense thrillers or of the like.The writer obviously knew what they were talking about as some of the details are not only incredibly interesting, but also incredible at creating suspense. The details do not bore you at all and treats you like you are intelligent enough to understand what is being said, which is a massive relief from the spoon feeding of other writers.The book is a well written breath of fresh air. Like tea on the porch in the fall. lol."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Seen the movie, now read the book. This is an adventure tale about Charlie Allnutt and Rose Sayer set in WWI and was written by C.S.Forester in 1935. The book has been over shadowed by the 1951 film which starred Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn. The book stands on its own as a classic and centres on the relationship between the unlikely match of Charlie and Rose with the war as a backdrop. Charlie is a gin loving engineer and Rose is a religious missionary who manages to convince Charlie to take his rickety old boat, The African Queen, down a treacherous river to destroy a German gunboat patrolling the lake at the end of the river. The inter play between the two characters is developed beautifully as they influence each other to form a formidable team. Forester may have meant it to be many things, but to me it is a great love story. Two people who shine in the presence of each other. The novel is relatively short and keeps the suspense and sense of adventure high throughout. The ending of the book turns out to be more realistic and poignant than the film and just by reading it you will appreciate the brilliance of Bogart and Hepburn even more."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I really loved the movie, but just want to warn you that the last part of the book is wildly different than the movie, and pretty much of a bummer....... Neither of the characters come off as being very likable. I was very disappointed and wished I hadn't read it. I am a big fan of C. S. Forester's Hornblower series, but it's obvious that he has a very cynical view of women and married life, and it comes through much more strongly in The African Queen."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Rose Sayer, bent on avenging the death of her English missionary brother, enlists, or drafts, the cockney Charlie Allnut, captain of the steam launch Afican Queen, down a mighty river in 'German Central Africa', to enter \\"Lake Wittelsbach\\" and there, with makeshift torpedoes, sink the Konigin Luise, the German Navy steamer that then controls the lake for the Germans in 1914.Thanks to John Huston, Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn, everyone is familiar with the titular film, which is virtually the only cinematic representation of the East African Campaign of 1914-18. Stretching himself, CS Forester rises above his usual stock characterization in filling out the figures of Allnut and Rose, the latter being somewhat (and thankfully) more attractive than Katherine Hepburn. He really excels at describing, in an engaging way, the exhausting journey down the 'Ulanga/Bora' river, with all its attendant perils - heat, crocodiles, mosquitoes, hippos, leaches, etc. This is 'Heart of Darkness' but written in such a way that you can and want to finish the book.Once the African Queen reaches the Lake, there to confront the German gunboat, history intrudes. It is also at this point that the film, wisely, diverges. Without naming the actual participants, Forester introduces the fascinating story of the real-life Royal Navy expedition that, through incredible exertion, crossed Africa with 2 motor gun boats and fought the Germans for naval supremacy on Lake Tangayika in 1915. CS Forester's conclusion to this story, after effectively building tension and also spinning quite a nice little romance between his two heroes, is distinctly anti-climatic. Forester also includes several minor historical inaccuracies, such as the Germans arming their native troops with Martini rifles, and that these same native troops were rather dimwitted and rather cowardly. Given that the Germans, only a few hundred strong, fought a successful guerrilla campaign in WWI East Africa with only about 7,000 native troops, puts the lie to Forester's account, even if fiction.Michael Kitchen does a fine job in narrating this tale."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"The first C. S. Forester novels I ever read were the eleven volumes comprising the Hornblower series of nautical adventures in the British navy. Years before encountering those, which, by the way, are superb reading and far better written than the Aubrey/Maturin maritime novels of Patrick O'Brian, perhaps their closest competitors in readers' affections, I saw a movie entitled \\"The African Queen.\\" I was far too young then to know or care about the inspiration behind that 1951 film and was not even acquainted with the novels of C. S. Forester. That film must have made quite an impression, though, for, decades later, I can still hear the throbbing of the steam engine driving the Queen down the Ulanga and Bora River, so, when I chanced to encounter Forester's novel, there was nothing else to do but dive into it.The story line in THE AFRICAN QUEEN rushes along even faster than do the plots of the Hornblower novels. The story, set in Africa at the beginning of World War I, is replete with deathly disease, conquering Nazis, and never-ending derring-do amidst cataracts and rapids plunging down boulder-strewn canyons toward huge Lake Wittelsbach, whose waters are patrolled by the Konigin Luise mounting the Nazi iron cross flag. Oh yes, we mustn't ignore the love element that evolves between the spinsterish, virginal Rose Sayer, steeped in her brother's missionary zeal and stern religiosity, and her companion, Charlie Allnutt, a cockney with a highly questionable past. Primarily, however, this begins and remains an adventure story, and there's just enough love element to spice things up a bit.The novel is not without its flaws. There are undoubtedly critics who take it to task for the ease with which Rose loses her austere countenance (not to mention her virginity), given her strict, traditional upbringing and her circumscribed life. Her assuming almost instant command of the steamboat, her fanatical self-imposed mission, and her sheer strength of mind and unwavering determination appear too atypical for someone of her background. For our other protagonist, Allnutt, his ability to repair or cobble together everything the couple come to need as they careen down the racing Alanga or laboriously pull their boat across the stagnant delta of the Bora is nothing short of phenomenal. The reader's credulousness is sorely tested when Forester has Allnutt create a workable forge on the banks of the river and repair a kinked drive shaft and a broken propeller in the middle of the jungle.Still, this is adventure fiction, and the reader must not be overly critical of characters who find themselves in dire straits with only their imagination and ingenuity (or at least with the imagination of the author who created them) to succor themselves. I dare say that THE AFRICAN QUEEN, written in 1935, has yet to be bested by any more recent adventure stories--equaled perhaps, but not bested. The book is a very fast read and is not easy to lay aside, and I feel that any reader, from adolescent to antiquarian, who enjoys the vicarious mystery, challenge and excitement of a fine adventure story will not find THE AFRICAN QUEEN lacking.And just who is the real African Queen, the steamboat or Rose Sayer?"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"A Great read. I recomend this to any fan of the movie or good adventure stories."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"The lady has the will, and the cockney has the ingenuity. Between the two of them they conquer incredible obstacles.Their great goal is to strike a blow for England in the war against Imperial Germany, but just as we might suppose, the efforts of two &quot;very ordinary people&quot; don't change the course of history. Nevertheless, it's an inspiring tale of courage, intelligence, and mutual respect. Each makes the other a better person."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"First off, I want to say I wholly agree with the other two star reviewer.The basic set up:Missionary Rose Sayer is left high and dry after the Germans kill the villagers and her brother Samuel. Cockney boat owner Charley Allnut lets her ride along with him on his creaky old boat and Rose gets the brilliant idea to use the explosives on the boat to torpedo the K&ouml;nigin Luise and convinces Allnut to go along with it. Why he goes along with this is any one's best guess (I was sure scratching my head over it). But to get to that point, they must travel the river, avoiding the Germans and their guns, shoot rapids that no one has ever shot before to reach the lake where they will find their target.Shooting dangerous rapids in a creaky boat, being fired upon by evil German soldiers and risking all to strike a blow for freedom and Britain. Wow, that should be even better as a book, right? Not. Boring, boring, boring.I just never bought into the relationship that develops between Rose and Charlie, nor could I fathom why he'd merrily follow along on her cockamamie plan to blow up the Germans. How a sheltered on-the-shelf missionary managed to learn how to hold the tiller and guide them through rapids like no one has done before them really stretched the credulity meter, but even worse is how it all ends once they reach the lake and the K&ouml;nigin Luise. I won't spoil, but if you're expecting a big bang like in the movie, think again - it's a snoozer, albeit a mercifully short one. This was so dull it almost put me to sleep on the treadmill, and I only finished as it was I needed an Africa book for a reading challenge. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"The lady has the will, and the cockney has the ingenuity.

Weak. Good, but weak. The movie may have won an academy award but the book comes up short. More of a novella, or screenplay than a book. The author could have doubled the text and it may well have been a good book. I appreciate the drama of the two people pulled from separate worlds that are changed dramatically by unfolding events and raise themselves to previously unimagined feats of character and bravery. Still, it was a wasted effort, two little to hang it all on and a pointless ending."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Forester's novel appears to be a fairly straightforward adventure tale, set in German Central Africa during WWI. Rose is the sister of an English missionary, who dies at the beginning of the novel after the Germans have driven off his &quot;flock.&quot; She is picked up by Allnutt, a Cockney mechanic who works for a Belgian mine, running supplies up the river in the flat-bottomed &quot;African Queen.&quot; He's basically a coward who will follow the path of least resistance, and so allows himself to be browbeat into a harebrained scheme by Rose. She intends to pilot the boat down river, through rapids that are generally agreed-upon to be unnavigable by a boat like the &quot;African Queen,&quot; and onto a lake the Germans dominate thanks to a giant gunboat. There, they will rig some explosives Allnutt has on board and ram the ship, blowing it--and themselves--up, thus striking &quot;a blow for England&quot; and avenging Rose's brother's death. Depending on how you read it, this is either the stuff of great derring-do, or a critique on the futility of heroism in WWI. As an adventure tale, the characters are rather too flat. Allnutt is drawn as too pliable a character, especially for one who has somehow ended up running a boat in the middle of Africa. Rose somehow becomes an expert pilot in a matter of a week, managing to master the nuances of a creaky and unwieldy vessel in extreme poor conditions. Along the way she sheds her proper upbringing and godfearedness with rather unlikely alacrity (unless, that is, Forester was trying to say that such beliefs are rather ephemeral anyway). Their love affair more or less works in the context of the adventure they're on, but it's very hard to imagine it continuing in the outside world. The ending is somewhat more interesting, foreshadowing some of the bleakness of Pierre Boulle's novel Bridge on the River Kwai."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I was shocked to learn how bad this book really is. The title is so beloved by many as the Bogart/Hepburn classic, and one would expect the book to not only match the Hollywood translation but to dwarf it with typical literary superiority. Not so. The basic plot itself is brilliant enough in its simplicity: two unlikely characters (the archetypical Cockney grease monkey and the chaste maiden) have an adventurous float down an untamed river on a cocked-up mission to sink a German gunship. Ok so far. What Forester does with this promising seed is ridiculous and leaves the reader wondering whether this was all just a vehicle for Forester to deliver a little saucy \\"maiden-missionary-loses-her-virginity\\" stuff mixed in with his clearly evident views that missionaries are idiots. Forester's story is outrageous on all levels. From the timely and chance first meeting between Rose and Allnut, to the mere minutes that it took for Rose to hatch her ignorant plot to sink a German warship, to Allnut's agreement to participate, to the absurd success of the journey, to the ridiculous \\"Cockney ingenuity\\" with which Allnut fashions a propeller out of a coconut or some such stunt, Forester lays a number of eggs. The creme de la creme is Rose's glorious fall from grace. This whole angle of the book borders on soft porn, at least by 1930's standards. Are we to believe that this apparently devout missionary woman has maintained her purity for all these years just to give it all to this unbathed louse? Forester clearly delighted in this stuff: at one point, he actually describes Rose's 'chests' as literally levitating with her newfound vigor and energy - having replaced her former existence of Christian bondage with a new life of unbridled jungle boogie. Come on. Last criticism, with a SPOILER ALERT: the movie's ending is much better than the novel's. Whereas the movie made the boat (the very namesake of the book) into one of the main characters that ultimately sunk the German gunboat, Forester sinks the Afican Queen early and unceremoniously, and then takes the reader through an irrelevant account of Belgian naval manuevers and German military justice. Anyway, I've written enough: stick to the movie."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"C S Forester knew his business. He knew a plausible method of turning an old river steamer into a torpedo, he knew the hellish consequences of losing a prop blade, of mooring in a mangrove swamp, of finding still water in a rapid.. And as he has proven so many times in the Hornblower novels, he knows the way of knaves and gentleman... This is a book for any age."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"There is really not much to say except that the Hollywood movie is not really very much like the book. (Why does this not suprise me?) The story and the characters are much more human, possibly because they are not &quot;Katharine H. and Boogie&quot; and this is not Hollywood. The thundering falls, the hunger,the heat, the gloomy swamps, the smother lake of water lillies, the endless toil and hours...and then, in the end, to see their mission fail. As heart breaking and riviting as any book ever writen."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Some authors have the gift of putting words together in a way that entertains and enthralls the reader. C. S. Forester is one of the best. When Forester tells a story, the reader feels personally involved. We feel like we know the characters in a personal, intense way. If you have read Forester's Hornblower novels, you have read Forester at his best. The African Queen was made into a memorable movie starring Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. The book is more intense, darker, and far less triumphant than the movie. If you thrill to the successes of Horatio Hornblower in Forester's navel novels, you might find African Queen a little depressing at times. If you like depressing novels (and apparently many readers do) you might give this book five stars. The story is set during World War I and involves the attempt by a missionary lady and an alcoholic English boatman to travel down a river in Africa to do battle with the Germans. The interaction between the characters and the river creates a riveting story. Like Hemingway, &quot;I recommend Forester...&quot;"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I will not reveal the ending; I will say only that it does not end with the German captain of the Louisa marrying the protagonists just as the ship impales itself on the overturned African Queen's torpedoes. C. S. Forester's ending requires less suspension of disbelief, less \\"deus ex machina.\\" Throughout the voyage of refugees Rose Sayer and Mr. Allnutt down the Ulanga and Bora Rivers in German Central Africa at the outbreak of war, the reader is treated to C. S. Forester's literal, high resolution realism. Forester would not have felt the need to depart from that realism to enhance the final drama. Forester reveals the characters of protagonists Rosie and Allnutt as successive adversities beset them on their voyage. Their steam launch, The African Queen, is their vessel in both senses of the word: if course it is their boat, but it also represents a container in which the protagonists' spirits are blended in a purposeful collaboration. it is a touching human drama, and the realism is such that the reader's ears ring unceasingly with the high-pitched whine of mosquitoes."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Throughout most of the book, I found myself thinking, \\"This is one case where I like the movie better.\\" Although the plot for the first 3/4 of the book is the same as the movie's, the characterization is a bit different. For example, the movie portrays Rose as a determind, principled, yet prim woman who slowly learns to love; in the book, she comes across as a bit immature, supposedly the result of being repressed by men her entire life, and is so thrilled with the freedom earned by her brother's recent death that she decides to kamikaze a German boat. Personally, I found the movie's Rose more realistic and likeable; the book's Rose felt too much like a poster child of feminist propoganda.In general, most of the novel is a bit heavy-handed is describing the character's motives, characters, and thought processes, and leaves very little to the imagination. Subtlety, apparently, is not Forester's strong point.The only thing keeping me from giving this book a lower rating is the ending. Forester truly redeems himself in my eyes with the ending, which is far darker and more realistic than the movie's. The ending calls into question everythng that you assumed that Forester was trying to tell you -- all the notions of heroism, patriotism, and true love. The last line is probably one of my favorite of all last lines,(Spoiler space)forcing you to ask yourself: Are Charlie and Rose truly soulmates, or has an extreme situation simply brought them together and instigated passion? While in the movie it is clear that Charlie and Rose truly love another, the book suggests that their \\"love\\" may simply be due to the arousal that arises during a near-death situation. For me, this very human, bittersweet ending enabled me to forgive Forester for his earlier heavy-handed treatment of the characters."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"When her village in German Central Africa is destroyed at the start of WWI, a missionary is rescued by a gin-loving river miner.

With this love they conquer the impossible, and by a miracle they survive to see the destruction of their enemy"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I find it impossible to discuss this book without referring to the 1951 movie. The first 80 percent of the movie and the book are mostly similar. The endings are quite different. I slightly prefer the movie's improbable ending, although the endings of both have serious flaws.Reading the first 80 percent of the book is a joy after having seen the movie. If you are like me, you will see and hear the movie in your mind as you read the book.In the first 80 percent of the book, you will find more in the book than in the movie. C.S. Forester is able to tackle interesting themes in the book that were too delicate for Hollywood. Also, he employs an amazing mastery of the technical details in describing the African Queen's voyage down the Ulanga and Bora rivers into Lake Victoria. You will almost feel like you are reading science fiction from the time of H.G. Wells, as Allnut and Rose keep making something out of nothing.To me, the best part of the book is that the contrasts between the &quot;civilized&quot; conventions and the &quot;natural&quot; instincts are drawn in extreme and fine detail. It will make you re-examine how you think about what is the right thing to do in your own life, which is what good literature should do.To me, the weakness of the book is that the attitudes that The African Queen challenges are very far removed from our experience today. What was very scathing then now seems quaint. Somehow, the outrage behind the story is diffused into a dreamy period piece. Are there many women now of 33 who are so completely dominated by their brothers that they do not lead their own lives? Would many people today be inflamed by love of country to want to strike a personally fatal blow against the oppressor against all odds? Does the arrogance of colonialism seem believable, or just a silly notion to caricature?Ultimately, Rose's instant rise from docile creature to Wonder Woman does seem to strain credibility. It's inspiring fun, though, like any book about brave heroines who are undaunted by the odds and convention.After you read this book, think about where your assumptions about what you should be doing have not been re-examined by you in a while. What are you doing because someone else tells you it is a good idea? What should you be doing because you think it is a good idea?Take the initiative to do the right thing with full speed ahead!"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"&quot;The African Queen&quot; is a very decent classic which I enjoyed very much.

I felt like Charlie and Rose, having escaped the lilies or the mangroves... Here is an author who knows when description is called for and when action must take the lead; when relationships must be built, and when the setting needs a nod. And Forrester does it so well. What a delight.\\"The African Queen\\" is a road trip, where a cockney steam engineer and a British missionary's sister take a boat down a fictitious river, over countless literary waterfalls and onto a make believe lake with a gunboat that never existed; along the way, necessity insists that they discover themselves, and each other, and, being that it was written in 1935, there's not a lot of hullabaloo about it, they just look up, rather Monty Python-like and go \\"Oh, okay\\" and get on with it. And there you are, reading it all, and lapping it up. Unlike the movie, there is nudity, and sex. Unlike \\"Shantaram\\" both are very nearly erotic. Although I couldn't get Bogart and Hepburn out of my mind so I was somewhat impaired...Sadly, by the last two chapters, the author has developed cold feet. It seems he feels wicked for leading us on this ridiculous tale and he attempts to make up for it by creating new characters and events that will make everything right, at least very realistic, albeit off the mark of the original plot. Forrester is so convinced that his story won't hold up, he wrote a new forward to the 1940 edition (which I read) saying how the editors removed the last two chapters, for the first printing, and celebrating how he put them back.Forrester was SO wrong.Fortunately, there is the movie. Where Forrester got cold feet, John Huston knew a story when he heard one, and the movie fixes the ending, although the book's version is still very nice.\\"African Queen\\" is a very good story, very well written. For an English author of the period, it's also very concise and efficient, yet still melodic in its use of the English language.

These late books are interesting and though not masterpieces themselves there is something in each one that makes them well worth your while. The young man in Arrow of Gold has fallen under the allure of old Europe in the form of the lovely Spaniard Dona Rita (Conrads most complete and most attractive portrait of a woman) and finds himself involved in her schemes to smuggle guns to her countrymen from Marseilles. High adventure ensues, including a breathtaking boat chase, but every cause and every ideal is corruptible and Conrad with this book contrasts the heady ideals of youth with worldly experience and wisdom. In these last books(Rescue, Arrow of Gold, Rover) it feels as though Conrad felt he had already tackled his great themes so there is a calm in the writing of them that is very pleasing and one imagines he is enjoying the writing of them in his retired captains easy chair as much as we enjoy the reading of them. The arrow is a gold pin, a rich symbol, the fate of which must be left unknown to potential readers. The historical setting of 1870's Marseilles is one Conrad knew well as that is the port from which he set off to sea for the first time and the gun running episode as well as the boat(especially the boat)Conrad spoke of with great fondness in his memoirs."},{"Title":"The Deuce","review":"Walt Whitman once said: &quot;It is the job of the poet to resolve all tongues unto his own.&quot; In this regard, Robert Olen Butler is a true poet in the way he goes inside the head of a teenage Vietnamese American boy to create a living, breathing character that anyone with a heart should be able to identify with.

The author shows the main character's struggle with figuring out his identity and the different types of people who live on the fringes in New York City. A great fusion of 1970s Saigon and 1980s New York."},{"Title":"The Deuce","review":"THE DEUCE, originally published in September 1989, was the sixth of ten novels written by Robert Olen Butler. This review is for the Henry Holt and Company paperback edition, 303 pages, reissued in January 1994 after Mr. Butler received the Pulitzer Prize for his collection of stories, A GOOD SCENT FROM A STRANGE MOUNTAIN.In late August 1974, on Wandering Souls Day, a Vietnam War vet named Kenneth returns to Saigon, bargains with a prostitute and claims his then six-year old son, Thanh, an urchin. Kenneth renames his son Anthony James Hatcher and takes him to Point Pleasant, New Jersey where Tony has his own room with a soft bed, TV and computer.The wondrous rescue from the rancid and dusty alleys of Saigon doesn't go well; Tony cannot assimilate the affluent American culture or bond with his father. He struggles for an identity. He wants to be Vietnamese, but his eyelids expose his half-breed origin and he feels caught between two cultures, unable to blend into either. And although Tony hears the echoes of his mother's moans with a rotation of GI's, and recalls her mannerisms that he now recognizes as drug addiction, fond memories of mom haunt him. So at the age of sixteen, Tony runs away to become a street urchin again, this time in New York City.In the first 67 pages, Butler weaves Tony's recollections of Vietnam and the early years with Kenneth into the psychological turmoil of the boy's mid-teens. The remainder of the story centers on Tony's struggle to survive in the environs of sleazy forty-second street and the Port Authority Terminal. Butler's vivid descriptions of that pathetic environment in the summer of 1984 started to depress me and I began to despair waiting for the climax, which I suspect is precisely what the author wants us to feel before he finesses the five-star ending.Within the first three pages of this literary, first-person narrative, I recognized the author's writing voice from THEY WHISPER. But unlike that novel, Butler arranged THE DEUCE into chapters and used conventional paragraphing. THE DEUCE is an engaging, readable story."},{"Title":"First in Line: Tracing Our Ape Ancestry","review":"Dr. Gundling presented fascinating scientific information without excess use of \\"jargon\\".

So when buying, remember that you must get both books for the whole body.The book is solidly constructed, \\"hard-bound\\", and the pages within are of a high quality. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful with structures thoroughly labeled as un-obtrusively as possible.Some erroneously believe that Netter's atlas is better, and while I do not disagree that Netter's atlas is a fantastic atlas, one must be careful as Netter's atlas has many errors in the labeling and depiction of certain structures. Netter's atlas also overwhelmingly and often redundantly labels structures.So to summarize, Sobotta is certainly the best Atlas available. With 829 pages (429 in volume 1 and 400 in volume 2) of exquisite renderings of human anatomy without the mistakes published in other atlases, Sobotta will certainly make a great addition to any medical students library.One last note. Of course, anybody stuyding human anatomy should have not only an illustrated atlas like Sobotta's, but also a photographic atlas as well, like Rohen and Yokochi's."},{"Title":"Moving the earth;: The workbook of excavation","review":"Moving the Earth starts with descriptive details on land clearing, surveying, properties of rock, soil, mud, different methods to digging basements, ditching and dewatering, lanscaping, roads, blasting, tunneling, and pit operations.

Chase uses French cooking standbys, butter and cream, along with Burgundian ingredients like Dijon mustard, Chablis and red Burgundy wines. But she also spices things up with a liberal use of Creme de Cassis--the recipe for Candied Shallot and Walnut Croutes is worth the price of the book alone. Other outstanding recipes include one for Baked Oysters, a lovely Pain d'Epices and Potato Gratin Dijonnaise. If the book has a weakness, it's probably in the meat dishes. Most are pretty similar to recipes found in other French Bistro or Americanized French cookbooks. But this is still a very worthy, not to mention beautiful looking, cookbook that belongs on the pantry shelf of any serious cook or cookbook aficionado."},{"Title":"Pedaling Through Burgundy Cookbook","review":"I agree with the reviewer below: the author takes frequent liberties with traditional recipes. I, however, think this is a good thing. It's analogous to the difference between dining out at a traditional French bistro vs. a French inspired more nouvelle cuisine type of restaurant. They each have their place, they're just different.It's totally understandable to expect this book to have traditional Burgundian recipes and it largely doesn't. But this doesn't mean that it, and the companion Provence cookbook, are unworthy of spots on your cookbook shelf. The recipes are creative and come out consistently well, plus the book is a good read. I made the asparagus in aigrelette sauce last night and served it with seared salmon as the recipe suggested-- incredibly fast, easy, different, and delicious.

The author, apparantly, knows best. For example, the author thinks that the traditional escargot baked in shells with snail butter is too rich and too old-fashioned, so she offers a Italo-American creation of her own (using proscuitto!) instead of the original. She does not like coq au vin, made in the traditional fashion, either; it suffers a similar fate. The delicious (to my mind, at any rate) starter of ham and parsley in wine-flavoured aspic, Jambon en Perseille, is another traditional dish of Burgundy that the author disapproves of; it too is only offered as an unrecognizable &quot;improved&quot; (Americanized) creation. Without the aspic, of course. Boeuf Bourgignonne, the quintessential slow-cooked red wine stew of Burgundy, indeed, THE regional specialty, is also too rich and old-fashioned for her tastes, so she does not offer the traditional recipe at all, but rather another of her &quot;improvements&quot;: BBQ beef kabobs with a red wine sauce.To be scrupulously fair, there are some actual traditional recipes of Burgundy included: Gougeres, the little cheese puffs that are such a wonderful accompaniment to the wines of the region, and gingerbread, another Burgundian specialty. And some of the soups and salads are at least in the spirit of Bourgogne.So in summary, if you are planning to visit Burgundy, this book may prove useful, but if you are seeking recipes of the classic cuisine of Burgundy, you had best look for another cookbook."},{"Title":"Strange Colors on the Canvas","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but alas I found it to be self-indulgent, overly verbose and ultimately un-readable.

Araujo's discreet life in one of the islands that make up Cabo Verde's archipelago shows itself to be complex and certainly rambunctious when he details it in his last will, using no fewer than 387 pages to disclose his doings. Such ease in writing had never before been guessed at by the islanders. His discourses on his family members, his employers, his employees, and above all his detailed and methodical unraveling of a life full of--until now unknown--love affairs, is met with disbelief. That his fortune is not left to his nephew as expected but to an out-of-wedlock daughter with a former employee is shocking. And from event to event, from specific requests for his funeral arrangements to suggested business methods that might be just on the outside of the law, we are able to view the life of Cabo Verde, a country of 10 islands, divided into small towns, distant from each other by a lot of sea, and divided in 300,000 inhabitants.Araujo very easily stands for Cabo Verde itself. His solitude, methodical manners, controlled and reclusive life keep him insulated from the town. Even after becoming a very successful business man he was still rejected by the local club. The void around his life is sensed everywhere. But when dies, and his will detailing his adventures is read, we and his neighbors and acquaintances discover that his life within was different, very different. Richer in excitement. Fuller in emotions. He lived indeed as an island, isolated, no one knew the Napumoceno within.In an interview given to Fernando Nunes of \\"ZonaNon: revista de cultura cr&iacute;tica\\", in 2003, Germano Almeida described the independence Cabo Verde in 1975, as having been a \\"true revolution\\" causing an unbelievable growth from 1975 to 1990 that had not been foreseen and certainly had surpassed expectations. The country grew at a much higher rate than in the 500 years Cabo Verde was Portugal's colony. This exultation about Cabo Verde's inner potential, inner abilities, is akin to those we discover in Araujo's world. Richer than expected, even though no one believed it or could imagine it.But this is not a political book. This is not a historical book. This is the portrait of a man in his complexity, someone like our neighbors, like our friends and family. People we believe we know, who all of a sudden, unexpectedly, show a different side that had only been lived and carried on within.Germano Almeida received in 2005 the award -- Fundao Casa da Cultura de L&iacute;ngua Portuguesa -- an award given every two years to distinguish personalities or institutions that have notably promoted Portuguese Speaking Cultures in the world. The award was established in 1990, by Oporto University."},{"Title":"The Last Will and Testament of Senhor da Silva Araujo","review":"Though this book is quite short, only about 150 pages, it left me with a lot to think about. It tells the life story of one Napumoceno da Silva Araujo, a respected and rich Cape Verdean businessman who died at a very old age and left a shocking will that was over 300 pages long and bequeathed everything to the bastard daughter no one knew he had.The story, particularly in the beginning describing the funeral, is extremely funny in its way. The book is also notable for showing how various people's perceptions of the same events can be so different as to be come almost unrecognizable. Araujo's nephew, for instance, through his eyes is a slimy, arrogant, deceitful Uriah Heep type character, but his newfound cousin Maria de Graca sees him as a likable enough man (holding no grudge against her, although he had expected to inherit and she got it all instead), and they become friendly with each other.Normally I can't stand overlong paragraphs and run-on sentences in books, and this book had plenty of both, but for some reason I didn't mind this time. I didn't think I would enjoy reading this nearly as much as I did, and I wish I could seek out the author's other novels, but none of them have been translated into English and I can't read Portuguese."},{"Title":"The Jungle Law","review":"THE JUNGLE LAW by Victoria Vinton brings the author Rudyard Kipling to life -- fictional life, that is, as Vinton presents her interpretation of what may have happened when Kipling and his wife, Caroline, moved to Vermont in 1892. It was there that Caroline bore a child and Kipling developed the character Mowgli of The Jungle Books. Now, this is beautiful literature.Vinton invents the Connollys, neighbors for the Kiplings: Joe, a boy of 11; his mother, who does the Kiplings' laundry; and Joe's jealous, abusive father. The adults are kept apart by class barriers, but Kipling and the boy become friends.For Joe, Kipling's house \\"is like a marvelous treasure trove, filled with all sorts of riches.\\" And when Kipling talks, it's exciting, colorful and lyrical. Joe is fascinated by him. Kipling introduces his young neighbor to the Law of the Jungle and to the world of wonder inside his own mind.The book centers around their relationship, but it's really about imagination -- the glorious treasures inside Kipling's head and the boy's budding curiosity about ideas and possibilities. In the midst of his mean, hard life, the boy daydreams about Kipling's travel tales. His dreams become grander and his mind becomes more free -- and his father hates the result.Her characters are complex and she evokes vivid emotions, but it's Vinton's language that is simply gorgeous, with lush images. The book is a pleasure to read: \\"Light falls through the trees in bright dapples, glancing off the fruit in the trees and the wings of the monarchs that flutter and perch on the Queen Anne's lace by the roadside.\\" Pondering the differences between India and Vermont, Kipling \\"knew right away that here was a place where he could concentrate and work, if only because it was so different from the India he'd known, where the seasons went from wet to dry and the dead never seemed to stay dead and the walls of gardens were set with old bones and vultures were as common as crows.\\"Ooh, this is a lovely book -- a graceful read, a perfect fit for the reader who loves to be in the company of splendid language."},{"Title":"The Jungle Law","review":"\\"Jungle Law\\" is Victoria Vinton's fictionalized historical account of the period, in the late 19th century, when author Rudyard Kipling and his wife, Carrie, came to live in Vermont, USA. This is where he wrote the glorious stories later called \\"The Jungle Books.\\" In her imaginative debut novel, Ms. Vinton mingles fact with fiction and vividly brings to life Kipling's early years in Bombay, India, where he lived a pampered existence as the only son of a well-to-do British family. She connects his very early experiences in India, as well as later less agreeable ones in England, with the material he used to create the wonderful books and characters that have delighted children and adults for generations.Kipling was born in Bombay, where his father, John Lockwood Kipling, was an arts and crafts teacher at the Jeejeebhoy School. His mother was a sister-in-law of the painter Edward Burne-Jones. Ruddy, as Kipling was affectionately called, was brought up by an ayah who taught him Hindustani as his first language. At the age of six he was taken to England by his parents and left for five years with extended family, virtual strangers. This experience, the abrupt separation from his parents and India, his first home, proved to be a traumatic one for the little boy. He was to write about his feelings during this period later in life, when he dubs his foster home, \\"The House of Desolation.\\" .In 1892 Kipling married Caroline Starr Balestier, the sister of an American publisher and writer. The young couple moved to the United States, to Brattleboro Vermont where the author wrote the stories which comprise \\"The Jungle Books.\\" The most familiar, and perhaps best loved, are the Mowgli tales where an Indian baby, Mowgli, is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan, (the tiger), kills his family. He is taken to safety by Bagheera, (the black panther,) and placed with a wolf family that has a brand new litter. The stories tell of how Mowgli is reared by his foster parents, alongside the wolf pups. Over time the child is instructed by a series of animal mentors in the rules or \\"Laws\\" of the jungle. There is also great enmity between Mowgli and the tiger Shere Khan who killed the boy's parents. Kipling portrays the natural world, and especially its creatures, in a logical anthropomorphized manner, so entertaining to both children and adults.Rudyard and his proud, pregnant wife Carrie arrive in Brattleboro to build their dream home, Naulakha. Kipling left the hectic literary life behind in London, searching for a quiet, rural setting to raise his family and to write. The year is 1892 and the twenty-six year-old author has very little money. However, he brought with him to America something of great value - the seed of an idea, a gem of a story about a feral child raised by wolves. He wants to develop that theme in this new world.The Connolly family, Jack, Addie and their eleven year-old son Joe, are the Kipling's nearest neighbors. Jack, a struggling immigrant farmer, is an angry, disappointed man, who labors under constant, backbreaking work for little monetary gain. He fears the harsh winter months ahead. He also resents the Kiplings, and what he believes to be their high and mighty airs and easy circumstances. Addie takes in their laundry, which fuels Jack's anger even more, although they need every penny. But young Joe is entranced by Rudyard. He has never met a more magical person in his life. As they become friends, Kipling tries out his tales on his young admirer, and it becomes evident that Kipling is as much inspired by the boy as Joe is by him. Joe, in fact, becomes sort of a muse. Kipling asks the boy questions and Joe's responses are necessary to flesh out Mowgli's character and life. Joe responds with enthusiasm, and begins to identify with the imaginary foundling. Unfortunately, when the boy returns home after his stimulating conversations with Kipling, he faces an angry jealous father.The parallels, contrasts, and interactions between these two families, and the mutually rewarding relationship that Kipling shares with Joe make for fascinating and rich reading. The narrative is extremely well written and the descriptive passages, whether of the landscape or conversations between Joe and Kipling which conjure-up Mowgli and his magical friends are wonderful, absolutely superb at times. The complexity and intensity of the characters, and some of the situations they face, leave the reader with a sense of sadness. There is grief here. The creative process comes out the ultimate winner, I believe. Joe, with his extraordinary imagination will always be the \\"changeling child,\\" with too much in common with the fictional Mowgli for his own good. Jack is an unhappy man, but perhaps is better off living with his rage than with the understanding that he can never give his son what Kipling can. And Kipling, is hampered by haunting boyhood memories, a domineering wife and so much loss.A most unusual and original novel. Highly recommended! Kudos to Victoria Vinton!JANA"},{"Title":"The Jungle Law","review":"Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936). English short-story writer, novelist, and poet, was remembered for his celebration of British imperialism and heroism in India and Burma. Kipling led a rich and varied life, and in 1892 married Caroline Starr Balestier, with whom he collaborated on a novel, The Naulakha (1892).The young couple moved to the United States where they settled in rural Vermont. Kipling was dissatisfied with the life in the America and eventually took his family back to England and settled in Burwash, Sussex. During these restless years Kipling produced The Jungle Book (1894).It is the years in Vermont that forms the core of The Jungle Law, a delicately written meditation on literature, hardship, and the callous beauty of the natural world. Kipling at twenty-six, is full of the passion of youth, and while he comforts and consoles the heavily pregnant Caroline, he tries to obtain literary inspiration from the quiet beauty of the surrounding countryside.Just down the road lives the Connolly family, Jack, Addie, and Joe, their 11-year-old son. They're poor, simple folk, who have spent most of their lives scraping a living from off the land. Joe helps Jack milk the cows and other chores, while Addie takes in Caroline's ironing. For Joe, this life is the only one he knows; this place with its harshness and its meager rewards, it's the very nexus and definition of home as he knows it.Initially distrustful, Joe is gradually seduced by Kipling, beguiled by his stories of Mowgli, the boy raised by wolves, Shere Khan, a ferocious Bengal tiger, and Baloo a brown bear. Compelled by whim and by instinct, he steadily falls in love with the Kipling house, \\"a treasure trove, filled with all sorts of riches.\\" He even begins to imagine he's just like the boy in the jungle, and that he too could recruit a forest, press all the animals into his service, and enlist all the streams and trees.After a terrible accident lays Joe up for several weeks, Jack and Addie are forced to shoulder much of the burden of running the farm. And with winter fast approaching there is much to be done. Busy with the tasks of harvesting, Jack is indifferent to Kipling, and jealous of the man whom he feels has stolen his son's attentions away.Along with an all-consuming rage and desire to be rescued, Jack feels as though he is saddled, compromised and drunk, forced to pull the teats of cows while his wife takes in other men's washing and his son looks down the road longingly \\"yearning to be the friend of a man who can't even drive his own trap.\\"Joe sees all his life as a \\"harbinger of frost,\\" while Jack tries to control all the indignant, put-upon and self-righteous fury he's been grooming and feeding. He sees Kipling as intrusive and absurd with his condescending airs, trespassing to make those insidious inroads into his mind and his son.When Jack actually sees what Kipling can give Joe, he realizes that he can offer his son nothing except his indignation and sanctimonious contempt. He feels suddenly overwhelmed with all that he can't control - \\"the march of seasons, the designs of his neighbor, the pitch of the sea, and the health of his loved ones.\\"And what of Addie and Caroline? Addie, who is fearful of Jack's outbreaks of drunken and abusive rage, also worries about Joe, whom she calls her \\"changeling boy,\\" because of his tendency to daydream and collect odd useless things. And there's Caroline, who is also not without her fears. The accoutrements of a baby seem too fragile, too impossibly small for her to manage, and confined to the house, her days are filled with worry and waiting.Author, Victoria Vinton's novel is intense, psychologically complex, elegant, and highly solid in its development of overlapping themes. The characters are constantly in counterpoint, to each other, each of their actions affecting the others in unforeseen ways.Kipling's relationship with Joe leads to unexpected consequences for both, while Jack is able to reconnect with his son, only until the enticement of whisky becomes too much for him to resist. Kipling sees Jack as bitter and stunted, worn down and defeated by years of hard, profitless work. While the snobbish and preoccupied, Caroline, carefully keeps her distance from Addie, aware of the boundaries between servant and master, even when their relationship becomes surprisingly intimate.Exquisitely written, the characters in The Jungle Law fully embrace their fates, their complicated relationships ripe with anguish, lonesomeness and neglect, and also a vestige of hope. Kipling is besieged by a swarm of memories from his old Indian life that transforms the bleak, wintry New England landscape: \\"the rains of Lahore, the tumultuous riot of muezzin cries and opium dens, of hawkers and lepers and filth.\\" He creates a world of \\"flickering shadows and moonlight,\\" a world of beauty, that captives Joe and also enthralls us. Mike Leonard October 05."},{"Title":"The Jungle Law","review":"Victoria Vinton, whose stories have appeared in a variety of publications including \\"Prairie Schooner\\" and \\"Sewanee River\\", has a gem of a first novel in The Jungle Law. Using what has been described as a literary footnote, Vinton has crafted an imaginative, engaging tale of Rudyard Kipling and a small neighbor boy, and the exchanges between them which led to the very famous Kipling work, The Jungle Book.In an effort to escape increasing fame, Kipling moved his then pregnant wife to Vermont in the late nineteenth century. It is in the backdrop of the rural Vermont countryside that VInton introduces us to Kipling, his wife and their nearest neighbors, the Connellys. Young Joe Connelly's lively imagination helps to spark some of the details that any Jungle Book fan would readily recognize. Many of the characteristic mannerisms of the Jungle Book's \\"man-child\\" Mowgli are descriptions of Joe at play with Kipling urging the boy to imagine he is the man-child being raised by jungle animals.Vinton weaves the story of young Joe Connelly through the story of the Kiplings in Vermont, but the strongest thread in her tale is that of the evolution of The Jungle Book.Kipling spent part of his early life in Bombay. His family was filled with eccentric members whose stories infused a love of words and storytelling into the impressionable and imaginative Kipling. A move to England catapulted the writer into a literary mecca where he kept company with many notables. Because his privacy was far more important to him than fame, he moved to rural Vermont in the hopes of finding a place where he and his Daemon (the equivalent of his muse) would be able to take the seeds of a story and see it through to its end. The roots of those story seeds were in his days in Bombay. It is from the Hindi names for various jungle beasts that Kipling gave names to his Jungle Book characters: Baloo, the bear; Bagheera, the panther; Tabaqui, the jackal. Drawing from his imagined man-child's movements, he assigns the name Mowgli from the Hindi term for Little Frog.In the jungle, there is an unspoken law by which the beasts abide. This law--The Jungle Law--becomes the backdrop for the lessons the jungle beasts present to Mowgli. The Law was \\"a set of rules and protocols that all the animals followed in order to live peaceably side by side, in relative good faith and order.\\" In truth, it is in the tradition of the Law that Kipling and Joe both live among their family members and friends. The friendship between the two is, in many ways, as unlikely as Mowgli being raised by jungle animals and schooled in jungle law. Yet, their friendship is what gives voice to that man-child, his jungle family, and the simple laws of life which provide a framework for peaceful living among others.Vinton paints word pictures as vivid as the film version of The Jungle Book. In doing so, she thrusts her readers into the nineteenth century life of Rudyard Kipling and into the mind of a creative soul developing one of his finest works. Opening the pages of this book is like opening an invitation into another lifetime, some other place, and some other realm--the realm of make-believe where those who believe can make anything seem real.by Lee Ambrosefor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"The Jungle Law","review":"The descriptions were lovely but seemed to be the raison d'etre for the book. I kept thinking it would get better. If I hadn't bought it on CD I would have abandoned it quite early on. Characters were not engaging and seemed unapproachable. I thought it might have been the reader at first but I don't think so. Kipling seemed a caricature of himself."},{"Title":"The Jungle Law","review":"The unusual friendship between Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) and an impressionistic neighbor boy, Joe Connelly, is the crux of Kipling's Jungle Books in Vinton's imaginative tale. In 1892, the newly transplanted writer has settled in Vermont to build his dream house, inspired to write without the exotic distractions of India. Forming the skeleton of his new tale, Kipling finds both landscape and boy a source of inspiration: \\"The cold and the snow were like a revelation, with stark and unspoiled purity he'd never beheld before... here was a place where he could work... where the seasons went from wet to dry and the dead never seemed to stay dead.\\"Joe's imagination is caught by Kipling's words, the tale of the boy, Mowgli, yet forming in the author's mind. With Joe as inspiration, man and boy confer, Kipling sharing the bits of adventure yet to be written, the boy taking ownership, ignited by such freedom, the color and warmth of India, the lush jungle so different from the icy scene of Vermont. Reaching into the Vermont landscape, Kipling builds Mowgli's world, peopled with all its enchantments, dreaming Joe into the verdant fantasy, while the boy's parents watch their son with chagrin, determined to recapture him. The two families could not be more different, yet Kipling and Joe form a bond that transcends circumstances in Vinton's fictionally believable account of a creative endeavor and a budding friendship. The prose is striking, contrasting the stark Vermont countryside with the India of Kipling's youth, the tales of Scheherazade and the burgeoning adventure of a boy raised by wolves.Joes' father, Jack, is an Irishman come to America to escape the famine, almost killed while working on the railroad, now toiling on his own small farm for meager sustenance. A man burdened by disappointment, the ideals he once nurtured dashed by the reality of hard labor, Jack finds solace in his jug at night, but the drink turns him bitter, shamed that his wife, Addie, does washing and ironing for their strange neighbors, the Kipling's. Jack doesn't trust Kipling, views him the same as the wealthy landowners who passed the starving Irish peasants without a nod. What can such a man do when his son is threatened by the fascination of new ideas, called to a world so unlike what his father can provide? In his wanderings, a conflicted Joe has come face to face with his own limitations, Kipling's words a heady drug that leads him into the dark and unforgiving night: \\"How foolish to think that he was heading forward... when in fact all he's done is wind his way back to another story's beginnings, one that leads only... to dull compromise and sharp regret.\\"Vinton has brought all together in a fierce, magical tale, filled with the intimate details of Kipling's life, his pampered childhood; his removal from the security of mother and home, placed in a hostile foster home until his mother rescues him and his sister; Kipling's friendship with Wolcott, who introduces the author to his sister, Carrie. After her brother's untimely death, Carrie marries Kipling, now pregnant with their first child. Vinton's brilliant prose introduces the reader to the inventiveness of the writer's world and the power of a fertile imagination unrestricted by geography, fashioning a compelling story from Kipling's rich history, building on the writer's life with layers of her own imaginings, the pages scattered with images that transcend time and place in the heady prose of the creative mind. Mixing fact and fancy, Vinton has indeed written her own jewel, a novel to be savored and passed along. Luan Gaines/ 2005."},{"Title":"The Jungle Law","review":"I am disappointed in this book.

Keep in mind that originally hypocrisy was specific to religion, although today it can be used with regards to politics, sex, or even uncontroversial subjects.The central character in &quot;Tartuffe&quot; is not the title character, but Orgon, a reasonably well to do man of Paris who is married to his second wife, Elmire, and has a song, Damis, and a daughter, Mariane, from his first marriage. He also has the misfortune of living with his mother, Madame Pernelle. Tartuffe is a religious hypocrite who worms his way into Orgon's confidence in order to take him for everything he is worth. Orgon is completely duped, and disinherits his son when Damis tries to prove Tartuffe is fraud. The other key character in the play is Dorine, who is Mariane's maid and the smartest person in the house, which allows her to both manipulate the action and comment on the play.There are three crucial scenes in the play that readers should appreciate, even if it will not be covered on a future exam. The first is the opening scene (in Moliere's comedies the scene changes every time a character enters or exits) where we are introduced to Madame Pernelle, who promptly proceeds to criticize everybody in Orgon's household while praising Tartuffe.

I also think it is the funniest of his plays."},{"Title":"Le Tartuffe ou L'Imposteur","review":"Intriguing and entertaining, the play Tartuffe is a satire displaying the scandalous truths and facades of the seventeenth century. Although initially written for the people of King Louis the XIV, the book can be read by an every day high school student or adult. Through reading the play the audience is able to see the deception of people and that we can not always judge by what we see. Moliere brings about this concept through his witty play, and in such a manner that you can't put it down. In Tartuffe, Moliere uses the characterization, rhyme scheme, setting, and irony to effectively inform an every day audience about the distinction between appearances versus reality.Characterization of TartuffeThe perfect example of a hypocritical facade is displayed in the characterization of Tartuffe; in fact the name can be defined as one resembling false piety of religion. Tartuffe's character doesn't appear until nearly the middle of the play and the first image the audience receives is of him demanding his servant to, \\"hang up my hair-shirt, put my scourge in place, and pray Laurent for Heaven's perpetual grace. I'm going to prison now, to share my last few coins with the poor wretches there.\\" (Tartuffe 3.2). The scourge and hair-shirt are used as a means of penance and chastisement. Religious ascetics will operate these items in private, showing their true devotion to God and to no one else. Tartuffe, however, made it obvious to the entire household what he was doing. Cleante, the character of reason, expounds upon Tartuffe's character, \\"those whose hearts are truly pure and lowly, don't make a flashy show of being holy. There is a vast difference it seems to me, between true piety and hypocrisy.\\" (Tartuffe 1.5). If Tartuffe was truly pious, he wouldn't need ratification from others for his good deeds, self-satisfaction would suffice. Although Tartuffe appears holy and raves about his goodness, in reality it is just for show.Another example of Tartuffe's hypocrisy occurs with Dorine. He tells Dorine to \\"cover that bosom, girl. The flesh is weak; such sights as that can undermine the soul.\\" (Tartuffe 3.2). Tartuffe might appear offended by the act of seeing a women's chest, however, he doesn't have a problem with sleeping with another man's wife. In the next scene Tartuffe's counterfeit faade is dissolved with Elmire and he offers her \\"love without scandal, and pleasure without fear\\" if she will commit adultery with him. To Tartuffe \\"it is no sin to sin in confidence\\" and though \\"some joys are wrong in heaven's eyes, heaven is not averse to compromise.\\" (Tartuffe 4.5). In the scriptures, committing adultery is the third worst sin to commit in God's eyes. Moliere uses this example of Tartuffe's character to expose the many scandals occurring in the seventeenth century with the priests and their inability to remain celibate. Despite the fact priests and those who act pious [such as Tartuffe] appear holy, in reality they sometimes use young girls, committed adultery, and partake in many other scandals.Not only does Tartuffe aspire to sleep with another man's wife, but also he indulges in the seven deadly sins. While Orgon is away from the house, Tartuffe ate \\"a leg of mutton and a brace of pheasants,\\" \\"snored away until the break of day,\\" and \\"drank four beakers full of port.\\" (Tartuffe 1.4) Tartuffe is supposed to be a devout follower of the son of God. Nonetheless he overstuffs himself, eats too much meat, drinks and oversleeps. Orgon tries defend Tartuffe by saying he \\"gave him gifts, but in his humbleness he'd beg me every time to give me less.\\" What Orgon doesn't understand is that a Christ-like figure would not accept gifts, and Tartuffe still takes them in, along with wishing to overtake Orgon's household. Tartuffe's sanctimonious display allows the audience to effectively see that he is a hypocrite. Moliere makes it a point to the audience that just because someone appears holy, it does not always hold true and in reality they could be hypocrites.Characterization of OrgonMoliere uses the characterization of Orgon to portray a father attempting to control his household when in reality Orgon is gullible and Tartuffe is running the household. Orgon enforces his \\"fatherly role\\" upon Mariane telling her Tartuffe is \\"to be your husband, is that clear\\" because \\"it's a father's privilege.\\" (Tartuffe 2.1). He also repeatedly orders the other members in the family around, announcing he is the one giving the orders in the household. (Tartuffe 3.6). Although Orgon attempts to be the one giving the orders in the house, Tartuffe depicts Orgon as growing \\"more gullible by the day\\" and that he \\"could lead him by the nose.\\" (Tartuffe 4.5) Tartuffe is able to get Orgon to sign papers to make him Orgon's only son and heir and eventually Tartuffe takes over Orgon's household. Moliere uses this example to effectively inform his audience that even though we appear to be in control of situations, giving someone too much power and being gullible can lead to a reversal of fortune.Rhyme SchemeAnother tool Moliere uses to show the difference between appearance and reality is through the rhyme scheme. Moliere employs rhymed couplets to amplify the reading tempo. A rhymed couplet is two lines where the ending syllable of each line rhymes. For example: \\"there is nothing that I more cherish and admire than honest zeal and true religious fire.\\" (Tartuffe 1.5). The prompt reading symbolizes the frantic disorder of Orgon's household. Although the family tries to put on a faade that they are a perfect aristocratic family of the time, in reality turmoil and conflict subsist throughout the household. This example was true of many families of the time and is also true today.SettingThe setting also portrays the turmoil of the home and augments the pace of the play. The whole play takes place in the same room in Orgon's home and the characters are constantly entering and exiting the room. This causes chaos and confusion resembling the situation of the family. Moliere efficiently informs the audience that although households [in the 1600s or today] may appear to be perfect on the outside, if you dig a little deeper into the reality, they can be muddled.Dramatic IronyMoliere also utilizes irony to expose the difference between demeanor and veracity to the audience. On two occasions the play uses the dramatic irony of Damis or Orgon hiding in a closet or under the table while a conversation between Elmire and Tartuffe is occurring. The first instance has Damis hidden in a closet and the audience gets a whim of Tatuffe's true character. Although Tartuffe \\"may be pious, he is human too.\\" (Tartuffe 3.3). Tartuffe starts touching Elmire and proclaiming his lusts for her and his pious mask becomes undone. It is not until the second occurrence of dramatic irony that Tartuffe's faade is completely gone and the reality of his lasciviousness is unveiled. Tartuffe tells Elmire \\"to be his pupil\\" and he will show her \\"how to conquer scruple.\\" (Tartuffe 4.5). Once again the audience can see the hypocrisy of Tartuffe. Moliere uses this tool of dramatic irony to show the audience that we can not always believe what we see because, once we truly get to know someone they can be a completely different person than they appeared.I would highly recommend this book to all people fifteen and over because not only does Moliere give you insights on life, but also he is very entertaining and satirical. Due to the rhymed couplets, the book is a very quick read and it is enjoyable because of the irony and witty diction used throughout. Tartuffe is guaranteed to make you laugh and it will institute deep thinking for those wanting to read an academic work."},{"Title":"Le Tartuffe ou L'Imposteur","review":"Fast-paced and oft hilarious; Moliere's &quot;Tartuffe&quot; was one of the most controversial plays of its day. However, I myself do not believe it to be so much a satire on religion (contrary to what was believed at the time) as a satire on religious hypocrisy. Not once in the play is a specific religion or religious belief eluded to, and Cleante (who serves as the play's voice of reason) praises piety (so long as it is honest) in the beginning of the fifth act. What the play is satirizing is how easily people follow and accept what they are told by their leaders, whether religious, political, or otherwise.In the play Orgon places so much faith in the mischevious Tartuffe that he nearly gives away everything (including his own daughter) to him. Both the strong-willed, weak-minded Orgon and the devious Tartuffe (of whom one could say &quot;thinks with the wrong head&quot;) as well as the quick-tempered Damis, the clear-minded Cleante, and the wise-cracking maid Dorine are memorable characters all of whom are wonderfully developed despite the brevity of the play.

The story is original and interesting. The actual writing is what captivated me. So witty is the dialogue, so humorous it is at times, that I laughed out loud. It is quite amazing that such ancient text sounds like something you would hear on a sitcom. This is not boring or confusing speech, like in Shakespeare; this is very down-to-earth. Aside from the alluring rhyme, Moliere has an incredible ability to take a page-long theme and express it perfectly and succinctly in one sentence, and with poignancy. If I were given the task of writing dialogue about the theme of hypocrisy, I would write page after page of ineffective, watered-down, wordy dialogue that repeatedly misses the mark of expressing the point well.

The theatre-goers thought that Moliere was undermining the very basis of religion, and in France at this time, religion and Catholicism were sacrosanct. Instead, Moliere was making an attack on false piety and on hypocrites. The play is a comedy, and a very funny one at that, but the points that Moliere makes in this play are obvious and clear. He does not suffer fools gladly, and has no use for false religious piety. I think that he leaves a number of questions unaswered in this play. For example, who was Tartuffe and was he once pious? Is the play meant only to be a direct hit on religious heretics, or was Moliere pointing fun at all hypocrisy as displayed by politicians and world leaders? I'll leave you to find that out for yourself. Read the play and draw your own conclusions. I must say that I really would like to see this play performed on the stage."},{"Title":"Le Tartuffe ou L'Imposteur","review":"Moliere's Tartuffe has been a great favorite of mine for years. It's just so witty and so truthful. Moliere's satire hits religious hypocrisy harshly, and that's such a valuable message, even several centuries later. Moreover, Moliere's play isn't anti-religious; there is instead an appeal to true religion and toward the development of virtue. So few writers have ever been as witty as Moliere either. There are so many hilarious scenes here, my favorite being the table scene. And the dialogue throughout it just extraordinarily clever as well, particularly during the exchanges between Orgon and either Cleante or Dorine.Wilbur's masterful translation just enhances the joys of Moliere's classic play. It's a terribly difficult thing to make the couplets of Neoclassical France tenable to a contemporary audience, but of course, Wilbur has made them so. All of the sharpness, the liveliness of the lines is preserved, making Tartuffe accessible, intelligently, to today's audience. Of course, Wilbur's other translations of Moliere are excellent as well.Wilbur's translation of Tartuffe is really one that can't be missed.

But since Restoration was in fact inspired by the spirit of French farce, all this proves is that Wilbur's translation is not only readable, but historically adept (the whole idea of the Restoration was that Charles II brought French culture back to England with him on returning from France--the link isn't imaginary).

It has the classic comic narrative, which starts at the top, goes down, then comes back up (like the lips of a smiley!). Alazons include some of the main characters, but my favorite, Elmire, is an Eiron. Meaning, Orgon, Pernelle, and Tartuffe are characters that are blocked from or blocking the truth or are deceived/deceiving (Alazon characters). Elmire, Cleante, Dorine, Damis, and Mariane are Eirons, which are the \\"knowers\\" of the story; they know everything going on and usually save the day.

Tartuffe sends up hypocrisy, religious and otherwise, in a bourgeois farce of escalating absurdity.This particular translation won the prestigious Bollingen Prize. The only thing going against it is that you can essentially get two-for-the-price-of-one by getting Wilbur's Tartuffe and The Misanthrope together in another book.

Shakespeare cleans up with sophistication and, for the most part, plausible reasons, but Tartuffe builds up a situation that puts the hero against the wall, and by no action of his own, his situation gets resolved. The comedy at the end relies entirely on the delivery of the actor playing Tartuffe when he says: \\"Who? I, sir?\\" and \\"To prison? This can't be true\\" (161). When his usurped world falls apart, a rapid denouement brings us to the ending. The falling action of Shakespeare takes a long time and raises many questions to entertain the audience.

The reader must realize that at the time Moliere was penning this work, he was in debtor's prison. His clever incorporation of monarchial laud was his means of finding favor in the prince to possibly mitigate his sentence, as well as for him [Moliere] to raise enough to set bail. &quot;Tartuffe&quot; is a boring play satirizing Catholic religion and ignorant people who are duped by a wily man using God to deceive and rob a family who cannot see the true nature of Tartuffe.

The story ignited a new interest in volcanoes and pond-life in my son's imagination. His interest in volcanoes and caves became so keen because of this book that we spent hours in the volcano exhibits at the Natural History Museum and made a special trip to Carlsbad Caverns!

I've colleced a lot of Haida and Tlingit art over the years and was so pleased to find the book's illustrations were both historically and aesthetically accurate. Between this book and the author's Storm Boy, kids can see Haida button blankets, Chilkat blankets, coppers, wooden chief's masks, the carved and painted interiors of long houses, the woven reed clothing worn in past eras, and of course totem poles. I loved the scale of the illustations in scents in the Frog longhouse, with the little girl so dwarfed by all the big carvings and sculptures. I have to say that these two books are among the best-illustrated kids' books I've seen in years. If I were on the prize committee, I'd award the author/illustrator a Caldecott Medal for sure."},{"Title":"Frog Girl","review":"I really like it when I can find a book dealing with the NW Native Americans.

It draws on diverse written and oral sources, and includes some 1300 recorded songs, interviews with singers and numerous eyewitness accounts.McLean went all over New Zealand with a Grundig tape recorder in the 1950s and recorded over 800 tribal songs. He seems to have spent the next 40 years analysing those tapes and building on the knowledge he gained.There are lots of interesting anecdotes as well as musicological information.

A recovered alcoholic and long-time member of Alcoholics Anonymous, Arthur has much to share not only from his own experiences, but also from the experiences of others. As an alcohol counselor for over thirteen years he has helped many people deal, not only with the battles over alcohol, but also overcoming the grief which accompanies much of the behavioral results of alcohol. A facilitator of The Grieving Indian Seminars, Arthur has helped hundreds of people walk down the same path he has walked. A book every alcohol counselor needs.

I've learned more about their culture in other books (Tony Hillerman is probably the best for that), but The Grieving Indian helped me understand how there can be such an undercurrent of sadness in even the very young.

The transformation that took place was the emergence of \\"a system of slavery that was basic to the political economy of many parts of the continent,\\" a system that expanded through the end of the 19th Century, structured on the \\"interaction between enslavement, the slave trade, and the domestic use of slaves within Africa.\\" The transformation occurs in three stages: from 1450 to 1600, the Islamic trade; from 1600 to 1800, the Trans-Atlantic trade, and the 19th Century, the internalization as a result of the breakdown of exterior slave trade."},{"Title":"Borderline personality disorder and childhood abuse: Revisions in clinical thinking and treatment approach (Work in progress)","review":"Anyone interested in Slavery in Africa must pick this book up. The author, not interested with the fate of the slaves but rahter focusing on the actual process and transformations of slavery in Africa lends his qonderful analysis to the Altantic slave trade and the Islamic slave trade. Here he gives the reader all the important facts. FOr instance he documents how more then 2.3 million slaves were shipped by Arab slavers to North Africa and beyond from 1600-1800, at the same time as 7 million were shipped across the atlantic. Drawing on a wide range of sources this book tells the tale of slavery down to the minute detail. From who were the buyers to where the cources of slaves were, to the brutal methods used to kidnap the slaves themselves. A social and economic analysis as well as a cultural understanding is given to the slave trade. Most important this book casts light on the huge numbers of slaves sent across the Sahara to the slave markets of the Islamic empire. The only small drawbacks are a few minor generalizations made in the introduction but otherwise this is a masterful account.Seth J.

Remember them? Strange, obsessive, handmade and side-stapled little bundles of rad? What happened to them? Was it blogs -- did the internet kill of zine? I miss them!Well, for those of you who never knew what a zine was (or do & miss them like me), allow me to introduce you to Jennifer Blowdryer's \\"White Trash Debutante,\\" a collection of stories, photos, ticket stubs, album covers and grainy photocopied fliers, which is like a syringe full of zine straight to your heart.\\"White Trash Debutante\\" tells the story of one girl's descent in 70s & 80s West Coast indie rock culture. It's full of all the things which made zines so great: catty gossip, bad behavior, one-sided ranting, sparkling vulgarity and buckets of TMI. At its best, \\"White Trash Debutante\\" un-self-consciously recalls the energy of the scene, dishing the dirt about venues, bands and live-fast-die-young art stars. But at its weaker moments, Blowdryer becomes an indulgent and sloppy narrator -- muddying timelines, not finishing storylines, and giving herself diva-ish passes to behavior she openly finds abhorrent in others.Still, I feel like Blowdryer has written the book she wanted to write, and it serves an effective time capsule for both a time in music (West Coast indie rock) and a time in publishing (zines)."},{"Title":"Your questions, God's answers","review":"In question and answer format, Peter Kreeft addresses, for teenagers and young adults, the questions of the ages: What's the purpose of this life?

Private Passions is another addition to the Coles, Sterlings, Kirklands and Delgados saga and another masterpiece. Ms. Alers' novels will leave you breathless.

If you're not a fan, after reading this beautiful story you will be. Take a chance -- you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Private Passions (Arabesque)","review":"This book had a great premise. The idea's were excellent and for the most part, I enjoyed the book. However, there was just to much family information. Is all that necessary to keep up with the main characters. Must the reader have identified to them every relative in existence with the Coles, Delgados, Stricklands and Kirklands and must we know what they are doing or how the came to be. If Ms. Alers had left some of that out this book could have been better. The other aspects of the book I did not like were the character of Emily and how she tied things up to quickly and neatly in the last 3 to 4 pages. I agreed &quot;Chris&quot;, she said she loved him but didn't much act like it. What 8 month pregnant women who claims to love her husband and unborn child would go to a meeting with a very powerful man and expect everything to go O.K. That was completely stupid!! She was also just on the annoying side with her &quot;independent woman&quot; thing. Like I said the premise was good, the idea of trying to have a marriage in secret with two people that are in the public eye but it could have been put together better had some of the other things I've mentioned been different. This is the second book I've read of Ms. Alers and I hesitate to grab another because I don't want to read about the endless list of family members but after a time, I probably will. By the way &quot;No Compromise&quot; was a very good book and had just enough information to help you understand connections but not an overload."},{"Title":"Private Passions (Arabesque)","review":"Once again Ms. Alers has written a great book. I have read all the books written by Ms. Alers and can't wait for the next one. If you have read the other books this one is just as exciting. If you have not read the others, get them. Youll read them more than once. This book give you hope for the woman who wants it all(love, children and a career).

I wasn't sure how I would word this review, but I can only tell you that if you don't read this book you will definitely miss a treat.Emily Kirkland has loved Chris Delgado since she was twelve. Chris has loved Emily just as long. Emily was a successful journalist and Christopher was a Senator for the state of New Mexico.Emily never thought in a million years she would actually marry her long time love, but as fate would have it she did. Emily also loved her work as a journalist and was one of the best. But, Emily is assigned to Chris' rival for the office of Governor and now they have to keep their marriage a secret. Emily also finds herself a witness to scandal. Christopher himself has some demons to slay. Together they learned so of the much precious lessons this life has to offer.I loved the way Ms. Alers combined all of the other characters from the Hideaway Legacy and Daughters and Sisters trilogy. There were so many lessons in this book that it really gave me joy reading it. The way she healed the hurt between Chris, his father and even his mother was wonderful. It was so well written, it seemed so real. I love the way Ms. Alers includes a scripture in the front of the book. Each scripture she chooses is inspired by God. Ms. Alers is one of the most talented and seasoned writers in our time. I am always excited about anything she has written. To get a full understanding of this book you must read Hideaway, Hidden Agenda, Vows, Heaven Sent, Harvest Moon, Just Before Dawn in that order. If not for yourself, these books make wonderful gifts."},{"Title":"Private Passions (Arabesque)","review":"What could you expect from Rochelle Alers latest book? Nothing but the best.

When I first read of Chris and Emily in Regina's story, I was pleased to see that she brought them closer together in Sara and Salem's story. I could not wait for this book to come out. This story was well worth waiting for. I could not put it down. I liked how she kept Chris and Emily's marriage a secret at first. It did present some conflict. She also brought drama and mystery into the book with the murder of Emily's old friend. I love to read her books.

This book has the right mix of romance and suspense to keep you glued chapter by chapter in the tradition of the Hideaway series.

It was such a plesure to read this book, and also to hear about the entire gang. Vanessa, Joshua, Matt,Eve, David, all the family. I just love the way Rochelle ties in the family tree. I enjoyed reading this book, after all, I can remember when Emily was born, and Christopher, I can remember when he met his father (Matt) for the first time. A true love story, Emily grows up and so does Christopher, they did well for themselves. I totally enjoyed this edition, and continue to keep us reading good and interesting material."},{"Title":"Private Passions (Arabesque)","review":"I found this book quite boring. I can't say too much without spilling the story. However, I can tell talk about what hindered movement in the story or took away from the potential quality of the book.1. Extreme perfection2. Beauty...not so beautiful in my opinion3. Too Many Pointless Details#1 PERFECT PEOPLENeither Emily or Christopher have any real flaws. Both of them are PERFECT. This is what makes them seem out of touch because they are so unrealistic. Nothing is ever their fault and they never make a decision they regret. Real people have fears, regrets, and can't do everything from cook like a chef, ski like an Olympain, speed like a racer, and the list goes on...#2 NARROW DEFINITION OF BEAUTYBefore I begin, I must say the following. I have read great books about white characters and do not feel a black person always has to be part of a storyline. I am a huge Jackie Collins fan.However, this book is clearly marketed towards a Black audience. Consequently, I don't expect almost everyone in the story to be light in some way. It seemed a little too coincidental that both of these characters, are mixed, with light eyes, wavy hair, and I quote, \\"straight\\" noses. (Incase you are wondering, I am fair skinned. One can't help but wonder when reading this part of the post.)You might be thinking, \\"Is that so horrible that Emily and Christopher are mixed?\\" Not necessarily. But under this book's circumstances, it raises an eyebrow. You see what Alers fails to do is implement diversity outside of Christopher and Emily. For instance, if you're going to make both main characters mixed, with light eyes, wavy hair, etc., have at least one character vital to the plot that looks like Viola Davis for instance.This would have more accurately reflected the diversity in the community this book is geared towards because not all black people look like Emily and Christopher and all of the light people around them in this story.#3 DETAIL OVERLOADThis book could have easily been beneficially shorter, thus making it plot move faster, if so much erroneous detail was not constantly given about minor that are meaningless to the plot. For some reason, if their name is merely mentioned in a conversation, the reader must get what feels like a background check on them. It is a waste of time and makes reading this book feel like a task rather than the pleasure one expects it to be."},{"Title":"Private Passions (Arabesque)","review":"i absolutely loved this book. passion and love from beginning to end. i loved catching up on the Kirklands, Delgados, and Coles. one of the very best since Hideaway. i couldn't put it down. i read it in 2 days. if you're a fan of ms. alers and the hideaway clan, this is a must read!!!!"},{"Title":"Private Passions (Arabesque)","review":"I loved this book, I literally could not put it down.

That being said I was unable to finish this book. My first issue was that Emily took the whole independent woman thing to far. There were times that she would cut Chris down that I actually cringed. **Spoiler** When Cris asked her to go with him to see his father (clearly a BIG moment in his life) Emily automatically said no. There wasn't a let me think on it until he practically begged her and she was still snotty about it. That is where the book ended for me. Emily had one too many snappy remarks, stay out of my business, I can handle this on my own moments for my taste. Next and final issue is that this book was so slow. I can devour most books in a two day period. This one just dragged for me.

Due to the false announcement of Emily's impending marriage to her current boyfriend, Chris is spurned into action. Letting her know what his true feeling are for her. Add meeting up with his ill long lost Father, and the recipe for their secret nuptials is born. Emily's job as journalist is one of the reasons they must keep their love under wraps.

Despite being in love since adolescence it was not smooth sailing for Chris and Emily.

Little did Emily know that Chris has been keeping his feelings undercover for Emily as well.It takes the intervention of baseball legend, Keith Norris, and Sara to set Chris and Emily on their way to privately uncovering their passion for one another. When Emily departs for a well deserved vacation, Keith openly puts a ring on Emily's finger and later publicly announces their engagement. Emily's family and friends, as well as Emily, view the announcement on televsion.

Sara sets him straight and tells Chris that Emily has been in love with him for years and waited for Chris to notice her.

I am a supporter of greater utilization of faith-based congregations and organizations delivering welfare services. When reading A Limited Partnership I had preconceived opinions about what to expect from Bob Wineburg. I just knew he would use his wit and persuasive voice to stifle the momentum faith-based initiatives has been gaining around the country. Another social work scholar pushing his extreme liberal agenda. By the end of Chapter one (Devolution or Devilution), the reader will be surprised (as was I) by the author's recognition of the extensive network of services already delivered by faith-based organizations. Likewise, while summarizing the history of devolution he is clear in making the distinction between the Christian right and mainstream religious efforts. Particularly enlightening is the distinction between the political attention and policy debate drawn by the Christian right in shaping welfare reform and the actual provision of services being delivered more by the domain of mainline American religious denominations. This becomes support for the general thesis of the book. Politicians and the Christian right's ideological political agenda is an agenda without prudent planning or understanding of what is already in place and how it will play out at the local level. Dr. Wineburg does not criticize politicians or the Christian right for their lack of data that can guide policy development. Instead, he quickly turns in Chapter two (A Blip in History or a Slip in the Academy), to an apparent archaic system in higher education that finds value only in research that can be generalizable and devoted only to issues at the national level.

No detective fiction fan could possibly fail to LOVE these novels."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"According to the introduction, 'Postmodernity allows for no absolutes and no essence. Yet theology is concerned with the absolute, the essential.' Not meaning to be postmodern to the extreme, this statement can hardly be taken as an absolute, either in regard to postmodernity or in terms of theological development. So, where does one start?The definition of postmodernity is difficult to formulate. The modern is more easy to situate, in that it occurs in or after the Enlightenment, and the different developments in intellectual and philosophical areas that that entails. Postmodern, as the name implies, is defined in relation to (and in contrast to) the project of modernity. 'Postmodernity is upsetting, intentionally so. Postmodern thinkers have overturned the table of the knowledge-changers in the university, the temple of modernity, and have driven out the foundationalists,' according to editor Kevin J. Vanhoozer.The book is divided into two primary parts. In the first part, there are essays by theologians such as Kevin Vanhoozer, Nancey Murphy and Brad Kallenberg, George Hunsinger, Thomas A. Carlson, Graham Ward, David Ray Griffin, Mary McClintock Fulkerson, and D. Stephen Long. These look at different types of theology that might be classified as postmodern - postliberal theology, postmetaphysical theology, deconstructive theology, reconstructive theology, feminist theology, and radical orthodoxy. No one form of theology in this list holds a monopoly on the term postmodern; no one form of theology in this list fully qualifies under all the parameters by which one might judge something to be postmodern. (Vanhoozer playfully comments that there are eight chapters, a sort of eightfold-path to enlightenment.)In the second part of the book, various aspects of the traditional structure of systematic theology receive a 'postmodern' treatment. Most systematic theologies are divided broadly into sections that look at scripture, tradition, the Trinity, method, God, creation, humanity, Christology, soteriology (salvation), ecclesiology (church), and pneumatology (Holy Spirit). These are drawn together in essays by Vanhoozer, Dan Stiver, David Cunningham, Philip Clayton, John Webster, Walter Lowe, Stanley Grenz, and David Ford.Prior to this collection, I was very familiar with many of the theologians (Ward, Griffin, Cunningham, Grenz, Ford), and had fleeting acquaintance with the work of many others. They constitute an interesting and diverse group to approach this particular topic - postmodernity as an enterprise eschews the idea of conformity and lock-step methods, and these writers approach their subjects from vastly different areas. For example, David Ray Griffin has been one of the leading lights in the school of process theology, but here writes on reconstructive theology, stating that 'not all process theology is properly called postmodern.' Graham Ward is known to me more as a writer in the area of radical orthodoxy topics, but here is developing the idea of deconstruction a la Derrida as applied to the theological task. Stanley Grenz is on the more conservative side of writers here; I was surprised (in a pleasant way) to see him dealing with the issue of ecclesiology through the lens of narrative theology.This is a really interesting text, one of the most interesting theology books I've read in a long while. It is a good text for introducing many of the strands of modern, er, I mean postmodern (okay, contemporary) theology in a brief but systematic, clear and accessible manner."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"This book is strong meat for anyone interested in the postmodern interfaces with theology. It is balanced, constructive and contains ideas that are 'dynamite' in every chapter. Particulary good are Vanhoozer's own chapters and the chapter by Walter Lowe on Christ and Salvation. It is certainly among my top five best buys on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"This 2003 volume is a broad, most useful, yet relatively brief (cf. theThe Blackwell Companion to Postmodern Theology (Blackwell Companions to Religion)) introduction to many of the currents of contemporary theology.Here are some quotations from the book:\\"For to be postmodern is to signal one's dissatisfaction with at least some aspect of modernity. It is to harbor a revolutionary impulse: the impulse to do things differently.\\" (Pg. xiii)\\"The postmodern condition thus pertains to one's awareness of the deconstructability of all systems of meaning and truth.\\" (Pg. 13)\\"(T)he postmodern condition is essentially, that is, structurally, messianic: constitutionally open to the coming of the other and the different. FAITH, not reason---faith in a religionless (viz., messianic) religion---is thus endemic to the postmodern condition.\\" (Pg. 18)\\"At the heart of this theology is its naturalistic theism. This theism is naturalistic not in the sense of equating God with the world, or otherwise denying distinct agency to God, but simply in the sense of rejecting supernaturalism, understood as belief in a divine being that can interrupt the world's normal causal principles.\\" (Pg. 103)\\"Postmodernity is not what comes after the new; it is the 'dissolution of the category of the new.'\\" (Pg. 127)\\"What is radical orthodoxy? ... It is a Christian metaphysic that does not begin with transcendentalist assumptions that predicate knowledge of God upon a secure knowledge of ourselves. Instead it assumes that participation in the church makes possible a theological knowledge that must then mediate all other forms of knowledge. But this mediation must take place within the terms in which it has been received---as gift.\\" (Pg. 144)\\"Indeed, seen in this light, sola scriptura sounds positively postmodern to the extent that it questions whether any single human point of view captures universal truth.\\" (Pg. 167)\\"Yet postmodernism has rather famously tended to drift toward highly theoretical and abstract accounts of its subject matter; and these accounts are sometimes woven together into precisely the sort of 'metanarrative' that it had so heavily criticized.\\" (Pg. 199)"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"Vanhoozer has collected a great selection of essays to introduce current moves in theology. He concisely presents the intellectual shift to postmodernism through the many disciplines in which it has emerged and focuses in on how it has effected theology. There are then another 15 essays on various issues of relevance for 21st century theology, namely: understanding the self, theological method, investigation of post-liberal method, traditional doctrines such as trinity, pneumatology, ecclesiology and Scripture, responses to late 19th century deconstructionism (via Foucault, Derrida, etc) and the theological aftermath, post-metaphysical theology, radical orthodoxy, etc.There are a many great things to learn from the essays, even if only to understand the trends and the historical development of the current state fo theology. Most are very accessible and clear, though the essays on Deconstructive Theology and on Postmetaphysical Theology get technical at times.One disappointment with the book, is that the essays dealing with 'God and World' and 'Reconstructive Theology' - the only two dealing constructively with metaphysics - are written from a process theology perspective. This may be appropriate from an editorial/historical stand-point as Process thought is a unique and original development (maybe the most unique and original) in the last century of theology, but it is not the only metaphysical theory available and it is arguable if it even qualifies as postmodern in form.it is a great collection of essays, and the two on Process thought are also good despite my critique. The contributors are high-caliber theologians, the topics covered are diverse and essential. Each essay also has a section with suggestions for further reading, making a very good resource into a great and perhaps invaluable one for the studying theologian in the 21st Century."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"In my unending search to discover a way in which the sacramental life of the church, LCMS, may be used to intersect post-modernism, I ran across this collection of essays. The collection is very good, however it tends to lean heavily toward the philosophical; I am much more concerned with the practical day to day life of the church. The work contains essays that deal with a range of theologies in the post-modern world. There are several that I thought were quite helpful to my own thesis: D. Stephen Long's Essay on \\"Radical Orthodoxy,\\" and both of Vanhoozer's. The work also includes a \\"for further reading\\" section at the end of each essay that I also found helpful."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"Very good book, it expands the spectrum for postmodern thought and keeps the theological aspect close at hand.

The action steps up a few paces as more information is revealed about the drub/crime lord Gino Carlos and the unyielding hold that he has on the small, sleepy Mexico border town of Santa Anna. Carlos was raised from a boy by the benevolent local priest Father Gerardo. Carlos disappeared to Columbia for a number of years before returning to Mexico as a changed man and now a ruthless drug lord and something more. Despite numerous attempts on his life, attempts that no ordinary man could possibly survive, Carlos has continued to thrive. All this is related to Nicholas Bane by father Gerardo.But they may all change now with the arrival of the mysterious vampire hunter Nicholas Bane, who has been drawn to the town by the taint and smell of the creatures of the night. But Bane may not even be the worst threat facing Carlos. As we saw in the second issue, a ravaging, wolf-like beast has been systematically hunting down Gino's men and tearing them to shreds. Only the intervention of Anna manages to save Bane from the beast's attack as Bane will finally confront Gino in the latter stages.Claws of Darkness is a beautifully produced comic/graphic novel series. It's printed on thick, glossy stock paper and the colors in the painted book by Jozev are dazzling. The comic-sized book is produced in traditional Manga format to be read from right to left. As a person who reads a lot of black & white Manga titles, it was nice to read one in full-color and a larger format than the more traditional digest-sized books.

Strawson has a metaphysical project that is at once inspired by Kantian issues (and insights) and independent of them, which is more elaborately developed in his Individuals. Here, Strawson offers us an eloquent exposition and critical discussion of the CPR. He is not altogether sympathetic with K's TI. However, most Kant scholars agree that Bounds of Sense is not a defense of Kant's metaphysics--Strawson's Kant is not a Kant that a student should walk away with as the genuine article. Nevertheless, Strawson provides us with elegant philosophical prose, while highlighting both areas: marks of Kant's genius and piteous incoherence (or obscurity).Despite the fact that Strawson's attribution of inconsistency to K's TI isn't well argued or defensible, there is still much to learn here about good analytic philosophy (although not in terms of historical accuracy).I also recommend: Guyer, Longuenesse, Allison, Langton, Stroud, Forster, McDowell's M and W, and A. Brueckner's UCLA dissertation on Kantian anti-skeptical strategies, as well as H. Ginsborg's Harvard dissertation on judgment. Also see Stern on Transcendental Arguments (Oxford UP).Part One in Bounds of Sense is the General Review, which is important reading, especially the conclusion with its most elegant (and longish) last paragraph. This provides us with compelling reasons to take Kant seriously in our contemporary philosophical climate, despite Strawson's charge of the Second Analogy as a non sequitur of numbing grossness (a famous quote, p 28). Strawson is correct to hail the insights of the Trans. Deduction, which he says &quot;are very great and novel gains in epistemology, so great and so novel that, nearly two hundred years after they were made, they have still not been fully absorbed into the philosophical consciousness&quot; (p. 28). Outside of Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Berkeley, Strawson is likely right in this characterization.Part Two, Section 2 is useful reading. Strawson's work in Section 3.2, 3.3, and 3.8 is also useful (on permanence, objectivity, and the refutation of idealism). Part Four is important yet controversial (on K's TI). Part Five is also most valuable; it is on K's geometry.Although this is a problematic and controversial text (and overall interpretation of Kant), for all that, it is also valuable and often insightful. I recommend this text in conjunction with reading Strawson's Individuals and K's Prolegomena (Cambridge or Hackett)."},{"Title":"The bounds of sense: An essay on Kant's 'Critique of pure reason'","review":"I'm baffled by a previous reviewer's claim that Strawson's book &quot;offers the typical idealist interpretation of Kant.&quot; The principal achievement of Strawson's excellent book is to break AWAY from the traditional idealist interpretation of Kant."},{"Title":"The bounds of sense: An essay on Kant's 'Critique of pure reason'","review":"Strawson's work reigned as the supreme example of Kant scholarship in English for several decades. It might have been ok for its time, but it offers the typical idealist interpretation of Kant, and attempts to separate the contents of Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic from his Transcendental Analytic, arguing that only the contents of the latter have merit. But the two sections play the similar roles in Kant's revolution and to wholly reject the aesthetic and not the analytic is, I believe, impossible. Strawson does not even take seriously the arguments of Kant's aesthetic, probably because he is English and the English always get nervous around the aesthetic. While one may still have to deal with this book if writing a paper on Kant, as Strawson is still held in fairly high regard, I would recommend this book only for one who is not familiar with the traditional idealist interpretations of Kant."},{"Title":"Legends of Cricket (New Speciality Titles)","review":"If you are an avid cricket fan you should own \\"Legends of Cricket\\" even if you don't agree with the author's rankings.

Every awful fact of life is in here somewhere; madness, incest, alcoholism, child abuse and more. The author presents these things as normal from the point of view of each member of the family. Scary, but riveting, and it gives some more background for the second book."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I bought &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; expecting a novel full of cute anecdotes about eccentric and memorable Southern people. Certainly, the blurb on the back cover led me to expect nothing else. And for the first few chapters, the book lived up to my expectations.But after the first few chapters, Rebecca Wells takes the reader into much darker, sinister places, into the realm of skeletons in the closet and things that we don't talk about. And while it is disgusting and tragic, it is powerful stuff.&quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; succeeds on many levels. Wells takes her time developing the characters so that all of them seem likeable and fun in the first half, but then as the book continues, we see that things aren't as rosy as they seem, and in fact, things are quite black. Wells also writes about things just as they are, and the stark narration of the most harrowing parts makes it all the more disturbing.I find no faults with &quot;Little Altars Everywhere.&quot; It never caves to sentimentality or rushes to an end as does its companion novel, &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.&quot; From start to finish, &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; is outstanding. It was Rebecca Wells' first novel. May she write many more!NOTE: &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; is the prequel to &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.&quot; Be sure to read it first!!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I may be the only person on earth that has read this book and not yet read Divine Secrets. This is a good book by a potentially great author. Wells' ability to capture the point of view of chlidren, with subtle shifts in mentality as they mature, is brilliant. She reminds us of what it's like to be children, in wonderful and painful ways.In the end, this book is about family. It's about dealing with people you can't stand and loving them anyway. It's a theme older than dirt, but it's done well.This book may make some people uncomfortable, in that it starts out so bright and shiny, then suddenly slaps you around with dark family secrets. Of course, you really should expect it. Any book worth it's salt, in dealing with family problems, will inevitably delve into such issues.All in all, a funny-sad book, of the type we all know well, with strong emphasis on character perspectives."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"What a wonderful book about love, hate and the survival of the dysfunctional. It quickly becomes clear that all is not well at Pecan Grove. The characters are wacky but believable, and most aren't lovable. But you care about them because (through an interesting literary device) you are allowed to know them and see why they (and all people) grow into the people they become. I laughed, cried and clucked my tongue. I only wish we could have heard from Lulu. Try reading Pat Conroy's The Prince of Tides for a beautifully written book about other survivors of less-than-ideal childhoods. Can't wait to dig into Divine Secrets."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"i read this book in 2 days. i couldn't put it down. rebecca wells has such a dynamic way of writing. the stories of all the characters in this book are so real and even though they are tragic the humility and humurous way wells writes you can't seem to cry you just seem to smile and think and keep reading. i was told to read this book first and now that i'm reading the second novel...i recommend everyone do the same. this book is an amazing read you must try it!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Sadder and much, much darker than Ya-Ya Sisterhood, Little Altars Everywhere is really about what went on before the Ya-Ya years. However, I'd advise anyone who hasn't read either book to read Ya-Ya first; otherwise, you might not be able to feel compassion for some of the characters, and the laughs would have a hollow sound to them. Lots of background information and character studies of a huge list of folks - but it's pretty tough to read in spots.Bottom line: Read Ya-Ya first and enjoy it fully. Then, if you're up for it, read Little Altars - but pour yourself a stiff drink first, and keep topping it up."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Altars Everywhere should be read before Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,and it is also written by Rebecca Wells. I was impressed by the connection between the two books: In Ya-Ya Sisterhood it is hard to understand why Sidda is so angry at Vivian Abott Walker, her mother. Yet here in Little Altars Everywhere we see the world through the eyes of each member of the Walker family - Not to mention though those of the hired help. We experience the lives of Vivi's children: Sidalee (&quot;Sidda&quot;), Little Shep, Baylor, and Lulu and how they all struggle to maintain their dignity. Their lives are very much shaped by Vivian's anger and horrible treatment, and it more than explains Sidda's comments regarding her mother. I enjoyed reading the book and it certainly made me understand the other book. But, Little Altars Everywhere also contradicts Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya Sisterhood in that Vivi is a horrible person that the reader may find hard to forgive. In Ya-Ya, Vivi was at least human. But, there comes a time when excuses don't cut it and we have to take lives into out own hands. Vivi was a complex, multi-faceted character that was not believeable by the time I was done with this book."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read this book some time ago, when Divine Secrets of the Yayas was first popular. I just loved the title and that some of it was from a child's point of view. I have not read the second book as of yet. I enjoyed reading the book greatly, I felt it was honest and moving. What troubled me is that there was so much emphasis on feeling that Sibba should be able to forgive her mother, when her mother was incapable of expressing any regret or remorse for her treatment of her children. Wells almost seems to say that children are responsible for whatever happens to them at the hands of their parents. I worry that this message in the book could continue to have others who have been victims of abuse believe that their only choice is to try to forgive the unforgiveable."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Had I read 'Little Altars Everywhere' first, I might have avoided Ms. Wells second novel. And that would have been a shame, for 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood' has a charm and grace which is lacking in most of this first novel.The episodic form of 'Little Altars' is somewhat disjointed for the telling of one unified story, but I admire the author for trying something different. Because I already &quot;knew&quot; these characters, and some of the back story about them and their relationships, I was able to use 'Little Altars' to flesh out my knowledge of the Walker clan. And that is always a fascinating experience.I found some of the subject matter distasteful and occasionally even shocking because Ms. Wells is uncompromising in her need to tell the complete story. It's not a sugar-coated, prettified and washed-behind-the-ears version of events. These people were sometimes down and dirty, often selfish, careless of themselves and others. Both restless and reckless in the choices they made. I ended up liking ViVi and Big Shep a lot less with this outing and realized that I understood less about them than I thought I knew after reading 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'. On the other hand, Siddalee's brothers and sister became &quot;real people&quot; for me in this book. Each had one or more chapter devoted to themselves relaying incidents from their childhood. Then during the visit home when Sidda's godchild is baptized gives us a chance to meet Baylor, Little Shep and Lulu all grown up.Although Little Altars isn't without it's painful moments, I think I NEEDED to read this book and I'm glad I did. Rebecca Wells has given us a fascinating glimpse into the soul of a small town southern family. Her talent for storytelling is a gift without measure."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This prequel to Divine Secrets is really a volume of short stories which provide glimpses into the Walker family life. Narration is by the 6 members of the immediate Walker family and their two servants. Each character's perspective provides an intimate look into the very troubled family dynamics of growing up with an alcoholic abusive mother and an alcoholic escapist dad. We get to know the Walker family over 2 generations , as parents and children and later on, as grandparents and parents.While the volume unquestionably has its weaker and stronger links, this book contains some really beautifully written, touching chapters. These very perceptive stories focus on interesting issues.- Service on the local draft board of a small town during Vietnam places Mr. Walker in some very emotionally trying situations .- A confused and lost elderly black field hand who is futilely seeking nonexistent mules on developed land elicits a truly empathetic reaction and melancholic reverie from Mr. Walker. .He realizes his farm has become totally enclosed by sprouting condos and 7-11s. Having watched the neighborhood farmlands being paved over, there is recognition that the inherited family legacy is destined to suffer a similar fate as his own progeny chose more profitable and often less satisfying trades-. Race relation challenges provide story plots. The black tenants and servants of the Walkers, Chaney and Willetta ,are presented with a real moral challenge when they find themselves inadvertent witnesses to an awful episode of child abuse out of control -next door at their white neighbors . With total economic dependence on their employers and landlords, they are faced with a very difficult choice regarding intervention. An earlier reprimand from Vivi (reducing Willetta to her servile status and very clearly warning her to stay out of Walker family affairs ) only makes this choice so much more difficult.It with these kind of touching stories that Rebecca Wells so skillfully builds and develops the empathetic characters we come to care about and relate to in this book.While Little Altars is a collection of short stories told from the perspective of many characters...Little Altars is much more deeply disturbing and adult in its content. It's repertoire includes alcoholism, abuse, and molestation. Both are very well worthwhile for mature readers.I look forward to the sequel! Incidentally, don't skip the unusual introductory \\"Note to the Reader\\" by Wells about reader-author interactions."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Everyone knows the success of the Ya Ya book, but this one is actually better (if that's possible)and should be read first to get the true vision that the author had in mind. The writing just flows, and you will be swept away. It was one of those books that I savored right down to the last page, and then I went back and read the intro again."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book was great, I think that it should be read before &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; since it is the first in the series. It was not disappointing at all! It was quite funny, but like the &quot;Divine Secrets&quot; it was sad in some parts. This is a book that is hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I loved the first two chapters of this book. I thought it was going to be a funny novel. But there is nothing funny about the tragic turn the childrens' lives takes. Also, the second half of the book was pretty confusing. But Siddalee was a wonderful character and made this novel enjoyable. Overall, I enjoyed the novel - especially the first half - and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book is quite an experience! It is honest, funny and real,but sad at the same time. I started the Divine Secrets first,but then went to read Little Altars. The author told the story the way she experienced life. I liked her style and her sense of humor."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I found this book to be moving,hilarious, sad...everything! This book has everything! ( so does the next one &quot; Divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood&quot;. I suggest reading them in order. Two big thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; first. Therefore, &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; was tremendously depressing and heartbreaking. It was heartbreaking not so much for the story itself, but because it &quot;Vivi&quot; was a monster. I loved Vivi. Yes, she had troubles. Yes, she wasn't the nicest of people, and certainly she wasn't the best mother, but she had heart and pain and love. &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; destroyed the love each reader has for &quot;Vivi&quot; despite her difficulties. I don't recommend that anyone read this novel, not after having read &quot;Divine Secrets...&quot;"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Having read The Divine Secrete of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood first, I had already invested my time and emotions in the Walker family and the extended Ya-Ya's when I came upon this book. I felt the characters were very rich in the Divine Ya-Ya's, but they seemed lost and shallow in this first novel. The horrors the children endured from their mother is unexplained until the second novel, when her past is exposed. The end is vague and incomplete, plus it does not connect well to the second novel.All in all, I was not as pleased with this book as I was the second."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Rebecca Wells' books backwards. Although I didn't care much for the characters in &quot;Devine Secrets,&quot; I admit to being curious about the prehistory of that book. So I read &quot;Little Altars.&quot; What little interest I had in Vivi, the main character, plummeted to disgust. I feel that any human being (particularly one who has hired help,etc.) who has the desire to have children should do everything in their power to simply do &quot;right&quot; by them. I would have had ten million times the respect for Vivi had she taken care of her &quot;needs&quot; down at the local bar, or worse, as opposed to invading her own children's bodies. It really concerns me when characters in popular literature, who commit crimes against children, are treated as sympathetic and redeemable personalities. In A Map of the World, the author attempts to create a forgiving character whose criminal neglect results in the death of a child. In Little Altars, the mother, Vivi, sexually molests her children. In the sequel, we &quot;learn&quot; why the mother has violated the most important trust a human being should honor, and we are asked to forgive it. No! This supposedly bright woman has no excuse! She should have done everything to avoid such exploitive behavior. She had three friends who, along with herself, call themselves the Ya Ya girls. It would have made more sense had she &quot;called&quot; out to these friends for help. (Of course, then the author would have had to work at creating an interesting story about a less disgusting character.) I once read a book about the middle ages ( a very bleak period) called A Distant Mirror. The author explains that the overwhelming reason it was such a terrible period of history was due to the fact that children were simply chattel to be used at the owners' discretion. The result : children who attained adulthood were brutes, because that was what they knew. Sometime ago, I met a young mother in the education section in my library. She asked me if I knew of a good book for raising children. She told me her own mother was very violent in correcting her. She did not finish high school, and yet, she felt there had to be a better way of raising children than what she experienced. When I read this book, my most basic and internal beliefs as a human being, woman, mother, and friend were offended. I simply don't understand how a woman could give birth to a child and then hurt it as dramatically as does Vivi. And I could never befriend someone whose approach to life is so bizarre. This book disgusted me ! I would much rather read a book about that poor mother I met in the library. What a truly enlightened individual she must be! A final amazing thought about this book and its sequel is the number of grown women who love them. Are any of them mothers?"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This was a nice easy read for high schoolers or adults. It's written in a laid back style with everyday language. The way it's written in all diferent voices and including tons of different points of view also kept it interesting. There were, however, some very disturbing parts and the cover and title seemed misleading to me."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book was recommened to me by my college Pysch professor. I thought that it was one of the best books that I have ever read in a really long time. I bought it for my mother and then read it and highlighted the parts I knew would touch her soul. My favorite chapter would have to be the one where Rebecca talks about wanting to be like her poor friend, and how she hurts herself because she needs to be a good Catholic. The parts of the Mother inflicting abuse were done so wonderfully, it is not said over and over or with any graphic detail, but the reader still has a great idea of what is happening in that house. I would reccomend this book and the on that follows, The Ya-Ya Sisterhood. They are wonderful reading, especailly for mothers and daughters who are trying to understand each other without knowing the past."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Didn't I see this family on Jerry Springer?"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"If you like the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood then don't read this book. It takes all your favorite characters and ruins them. I had been really looking forward to reading this book and it ended up making me cranky."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Wonderful book, makes me want for Ya-Ya's of my own. Read this and Devine Secrets. Makes you long for life long friends!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I along with many others read Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood first. I LOVED it!!! It was one of those books I didn't want to end! I was elated when I found Little Altars everywhere at my local thrift store. I can't believe the diffence between the two!I was caught off guard immediatley with the lesbian chapter. I had no idea that's where R. Wells was taking it. I had to read and re-read where the mother molests Little Shep because I was sure I was taking it the wrong way. I felt sympathy for Vivi in DSYYS, but not after this. If you want my opinion, read Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood and forget about Little Altars Everywhere. It's trash, plain and simple!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Why I did this to myself, I will never know....I thought the Ya Ya was totally overrated and BAD...and then I decide to try this one...and it is equally a bad book. Is there a conspiracy out there to PRETEND these books are good? Both this and Ya Ya? Well....save yourself the time and find something worthwhile! BELIEVE ME!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"The book is a good read but I found that I could not finish it...The lesbian angle was disturbing and very offensive. The struggle between the Faith of these women and life is very clear but the choices are always the wrong ones....I felt it made a mockery of catholic life...I was highly offended and fearful that my pre-teen would pick it up...."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Though this wasn't my favorite book, it did keep my attention. I am not an avid reader so it takes me awhile to read a book and at this great price (used book), I was happy to not have to worry about getting it back to the library or losing it. The book arrived quickly and was in good shape."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"First off, this is not the Divine Secrets in style or tone....It's better! Wells has the ability to make you identify with even the most flawed and damaged characters. You find yourself repulsed by the things the character does, but at the same time still loving the character. This novel makes the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood look like a walk in the park for Sidda and Vivi, so be warned. This is a darker and more gritty story written in beautiful prose that drops you immediately into the action. A must for any Sisterhood fan.A word about the style. The novel is written more like a collection of short stories from different characters much like the Joy Luck Club. I don't think there was any other way to tell the story other than to use this shifting point of view. As a writer, I have used this style before as well and sometimes it is the only way to let the story unfold.An excellent read and a must if you liked Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Little Alters before any of the other Ya Ya books. I was disgusted by some of the things Vivi did. Who wouldn't be?! But after reading Divine Secrets I realized that Vivi is a deeply wounded and flawed character. I didn't so much take the scene between Vivi and Little Shep as molestation. It seemed more an emotionally devastated woman trying to connect with her son in a highly inappropriate and ultimately selfish way. To me, Vivi is a giant gaping wound trying constantly to fill the void. There is not a lot of thought about how her actions effect others. I can see how a childhood such as Vivi's might produce such a wounded broken soul. I think these stories are vital to the Ya Ya legacy that the fans know and cherish."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I do love the Ya-Yas. All 3 of the books about them. It is so well written, it really takes you back to what the hot summer days in Louisianna could be like. I loved the characters. I saw the movie of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood years ago and could not remember a thing about it. I did order the movie so I am really anxious to see it and see how or if it takes on some of the story lines in books 2 and 3."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book was fabulous - not quite as groundbreaking as the \\"Divine Secrets..\\" but still fabulous nonetheless. It made me smile, it made me think, and it made me cry - all the things a good book should do and more. Buy it - read it! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"\\"Little Altars Everywhere\\" is the story of four siblings growing up on a Louisiana plantation. The book is divided in two parts: the first part takes place in the 1960s and the second part is set in the 1990s. In the first half of the book, the Walker family appears to be a little quirky, but also a lot of fun. Vivi Walker and her \\"Ya-Ya\\" friends can be crazy at times, but all the children adore them. Siddalee runs away briefly one night as a young girl, Lulu has a small shoplifting habit, and one night Vivi and Big Shep have a massive fight that results in Vivi dragging the children out of the house and leaving their father for a grand total of about five seconds, but that's about it. Everything seems okay on the surface.In the second half of the book, things are completely different. The Walker children are all grown up and they reflect on their parents' alcoholism and the violence and abuse that went on in their home behind closed doors. All of the Walker children have been deeply affected by what went on during their childhoods, but through it all they have remained a family (a very dysfunctional family, but still a family nonetheless).Rebecca Wells does an excellent job of shifting around and giving the reader the perspectives of many different characters in the novel. However, in some ways the structure of the book also presents a problem because only a couple of chapters are allotted for each character, which isn't enough to bring the story full-circle. I think the book might have worked better if Wells had concentrated on telling the story from only two characters' points of view, like Siddalee's and Vivi's. Despite that flaw, \\"Little Altars Everywhere\\" is a good book. Some chapters are much better than others, but I liked the book enough that I'll definitely read \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\" to find out what else happens to the Walker clan."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; before I read &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot;. I know that it should have been the other way around, but I was unaware of this book before I read &quot;Divine Secrets...&quot; While I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Divine Secrets...&quot;, I was not a huge fan of &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot;.This book basically gives you background information about the Walker family from the perspective of each family member. Even the hired help put their two cents in, especially when describing the heart-wrenching beating of the Walker children. While in &quot;Divine Secrets...&quot;, Vivi Walker is portrayed as a free spirit. &quot;Little Altars...&quot; portrays her as a selfish, ruthless, alcoholic, bad mother. These characteristics do flow into the next book, but for some reason Vivi didn't seem so bad. In this book, however, you almost hate her. I can understand why Sidda had so much resentment for her mother. I'd probably be the same way.Each family member has approximately two chapters each in this book. Some of the chapters are very interesting, while some of them get boring after a while. I found myself skimming through a couple of them. That's why I couldn't give this book as high a rating.Overall the book was pretty good. I wouldn't necessarily say to read one book before the other because, in my opinion, &quot;Little Altars...&quot; doesn't explain that much more than you would find in &quot;Divine Secrets...&quot; I can tell you one thing, you will probably have varying views of Vivi after reading this book. Go and try it out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Reading Little Altars Everywhere prior to Ya-Ya Sisterhood is key to better understanding Ya-Ya.

Ms. Wells is a very good writer who knows these characters well and clearly cares about them. Each of our narrators has a distinct voice and point of view and was very believable. Siddalee, especially, is an admirable, three-dimensional young woman who comes alive here. And yet (here comes the ambivalence) I am appalled that just about everyone is so enchanted by Vivi, dahling!, that they forgive her just about everything. And worse, I get the impression that the author feels the reader is supposed to feel this way, as well. Vivi is a narcissist who abuses those who love her most. The fact that she speaks colorfully and has kept her complexion despite 40 years of smoking, drinking and drugging does not make her any more lovable. Her own painful childhood is an explanation, not an excuse. I would have enjoyed this story more if the characters were less in love with Vivi and more involved with the lives of her poor children. I felt the most admirable characters, beyond Sida, were the couple who lived at Pecan Grove and worked for the Walkers for decades. The brief glimpse into the lives of these two was fascinating and left me wanting more. I hope someday Ms. Wells gives them their own story someday."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"When I found out the Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya Sisterhood had a prequel, I immediately had to go read it.

I took this book on vacation with me and read by the pool -- I realized people were staring at me because I was laughing out loud!

It was easy reading, and there was so much emotion squeezed into that small book. Wells painted a vivid picture of those childrens' bumpy lives, and it made me feel like i was one of their neighbors. I laughed, i cried, i wanted to pounce on their mother. I can not wait to read The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood!PS: I saw Wells on Rosie, and they are making it into a motion Picture.

All of them become your friends and everyone has their own favorite that they can relate to the most. Don't miss this book!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This was a wonderful book, but read Divine Secrets first, or you'll be clueless the whole time. I can not wait for another novel by Rebecca Wells, she tells about how life really is, and can make me feel the heat and humidity of the bayou even in the dead of winter. A MUST-READ for anyone who reads just for the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Altars precedes the Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood, but I recommend reading the latter first. Both are excellent and touching, but Little Altars actually reads better in the context of Divine Secrets. Rebecca Wells does an amazing job of capturing the pain and beauty of maturing relationships. Each of the voices in this book is distinct and powerful."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Unlike the best-selling follow-up Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, this novel is rarely funny and often cruel. It chronicles the lives of the Walker family of Thornton, Louisiana from varied personal perspectives. Viviane Abbot Walker (mother of Siddalee who is the narrator in Divine Secrets) appears in this story as a crazed alcoholic child abuser. The horror of what the Walker children went through at the hands of Viviane is only whispered in the latter book, but screams out here. Ms. Wells' writing style is impeccable, of course, but I would have done better to read LITTLE ALTARS first-or not at all as it soured the joy of her sequel"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read this book for a book talk. Part One had me thinking I had read all this before. But Part Two has so much power and excellent writing, any reader will be moved. Being male, I found so much understanding of the human condition that it was hard for me to sleep the night I finished it."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I'm from Southwestern Louisiana and this book just made me so homesick because Rebecca's description of the south and the people there were so real to me! I loved Sidda and Vivi and read this book in one afternoon...then immediately started on Ya Ya's. I have never been so fascinated by the characters in a book...I felt like I knew them all by the time I finished!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Real people populate Rebecca Wells novels. Her multi-dimensional characters are all at once self confident, insecure, self destructive, hurtful, loving, and playful. In a nutshell, the characters are as flawed as real people, and that's just what makes them so interesting. We've all met people like this and wondered what goes on behind closed doors. Rebecca Wells shares their lives with us."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This story is beautifully written and packed with humor but it is impossible to overlook the truly twisted and very tragic content. This is a story about children (of many generations) who have suffered flagrant physical and emotional abuse. Still, they continue to grow and enchant us. The comedy, the love and the bonds may never have evolved without the very dark thread that binds this story. I found myself excusing horrid abuses due to character charm and wit. Abusive relationships are everywhere...but these characters DO learn to get out."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I loved this book! It's a funny, sometimes very sad story of a dysfunctional family in Louisiana. I loved all the characters, especially Siddalee. Her quest for happiness amongst all the emotional upheaval of her family is heartbreaking. This book grabbed me from the first page and never let me go. The last chapter was especially touching. I read &quot;Divine Secrets ...&quot; which is also an emotional rollercoaster, yet I keep wanting more. I hope Ms. Wells will continue the saga of the Ya-Yas and their Petite Ya-Yas!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"&quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; takes you into the psyche and sultryness of the Deep South. This tale of friendship, loss, love, and life, Southern-style, is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Each character has a distinctive but recognizable personality. Big Shep's memories are especially poignant, but Sidda! I think I went to grade school with Siddalee. Someone told me Divine Secrets is even better. I find that hard to believe. Can't wait to find out."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Finally -- a book to reinspire the disenchanted reader. After searching through many novels in vain for fiction that inspires I finally came across &quot;Little Altars&quot; by accident and boy did I feel vindicated! Beautiful language, full character development. I didn't want to leave Pecan Grove or any of its inhabitants and fortunately I didn't have to (just yet) because of the wonderful &quot;Divine Secrets&quot; which followed."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I LOVED this book! As a native of Louisiana I thought Ms. Wells did a wonderful job of describing the south. Lying on a cool floor to escape the heat and sprinkling clothes with a water filled soda bottle for ironing were things I did as a child growing up in Southwest Louisiana. The Ya-Yas antics had me laughing out loud and losing too much sleep. I hope to see more from Rebecca Wells soon!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I stayed up until 4 am reading this wonderful book! Highly recommended. It reminded me of Michael Lee West's CRAZY LADIES and of Louise Erdrich's THE BEET QUEEN."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I was very moved by this book (and her next book The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood). &quot;Little Altars&quot; was great because Wells brings you inside of the minds of her characters (entering into the mind of Vivi Abbott is like a riding rollercoaster- lots of ups, downs, and unexpected turns!). Each chapter is like a snapshot into the world of the Abbott family- sort of like a family photo album. Some of the photos make you laugh out loud, some make you cry. This was a great book. I can't wait for her next."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Read this book!!! It is one of the most stirring, soul-twisting, provoking, hilarious and salient works to be published in recent history! Wells' relating the story from various voices and her time travelling left me breathless! Thank you, Rebecca, for giving voice to all children of &quot;crazy tap-dancing mothers&quot;, whatever their genesis or particular modus operandi! The elves and fairies dance and laugh, and this book enlightens us that THEY are the ones who truly know us.....even when we're unsure of ourselves."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book and it's counterpart are two of the best books I ahve ever read. When i first got the book I set aside because it didn't look like something i would read. But one rainy day I ahd nothing left to read and I picked it up and couldn't put it back down again. Even the movie base on the sequel to this book was good. Read these books and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Like many people I read Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood first and hungering for more of the clan, read Little Altars. At first I was merely wildly entertained, laughing out loud in several places. By the end I was completely sucked into their world and very disturbed. This book was one of the catalysts that finally compelled me to seek counseling for dealing with my own dysfunctional family, that is how real these characters are.In my own search for knowledge I have learned about Borderline Personality Disorder and am positive that Vivi (and Buggy, and later Lulu) have this! Either the author did very good research or she based these people on real cases. The whole family dynamic could come right out of the excellent book: The Borderline Mother. Check it out! Vivi is a Queen and a Witch, for sure! Her behavior is 100% consistent with someone with this disorder, lack of regret and all.I feel like in many ways I AM Sidda, though my mother is more of a Hermit than a Queen. What a great book!!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I took this book on vacation with me and enjoyed it so much I re-read it. It's even better than &quot;Divine Secrets&quot;. Each person in the book has a very distinctive narrative style and I admire the author for pulling off that tricky feat first and foremost. Second,it's just a very well-written,hilarious and heartbreaking book. I wish that Ms.Wells would write another book. It would be just &quot;YaYa&quot; if she did..!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"**awesome, thought-provoking read** i wish i hadn't read these reviews before i read \\"little altars everywhere\\". they ruined parts of the book and almost scared me out of reading it!! but i have to say i enjoyed this read so thoroughly and certainly much more than \\"divine secrets...\\" (also great!). rebecca wells develops the characters' so much more fully and deeply- i became completely engrossed in the characters lives and experiences. wells has a fabulous way of portraying her characters (w/their good and ugly sides) in such a way that you always get attached to every character and his quirks. true, this book can be kind of dark at times as it deals with some ugly real life struggles and dysfunctionality. however, it is just that aspect of the book that makes it an entirely REAL experience. if you can dig deeper than surface level, you'll find this to be a real gem!! cheers! hope y'all love it as much as i did :)"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"not anywhere near as awesome a read as divine, but wow.... i read this after divine so maybe that influenced my feelings, but i was disturbed by the emotions this book brought out in me towards vivian... what a horrible woman.... from the trailers i saw of the divne movie... i think they glossed over the true vivan... i can only hope that these novels were not reality based..."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Rebecca Wells certainly played with my emotions in this book: I began by enjoying the first several chapters and was engaged in Siddalee's character. The switch in perspectives was abrupt and unsettling, and I kept wanting to get back to Siddalee's point of view. (Certainly I have read and liked books with multiple perspectives; I just don't think it was well done here.) Midway through the book I found myself getting bored, but was committed to finishing it since our book group was discussing it. Then, as it grew darker, I think my strong feelings against Vivi interfered with my ability to appreciate the book. I haven't read Divine Secrets and don't feel in any rush to do so now, although I am aware the tone of the second book is quite different. As far as I am concerned, I can't imagine finding anything amusing about Vivi after knowing her story."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood before I read Little Altars, and I think I should have read them in order. While I Loved the Ya-Ya's and found so much to take away with me from that novel, I had questions about Sidda and her family, especially her mom, Vivi. I found Little Altars to be a darker, sadder novel than the Ya-Ya's, but it gave me the history of the families and the background to fill in the blanks. If you only read one of Wells novels, read the Ya'Ya's, but if you have the inclination, start with this one. It is good and will leave you anticipating the next one. Debbi"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Are you looking for a book that contains humor and keeps you on the edge of your seat? If the answer is yes, then Little Altars Everywhere, by Rebecca Wells, is the book for you. This novel is full of exciting anectdotes which are written from different characters points of view. Being one in a family of six is hard enough, but when your mom is Catholic and your father is Baptsit, it can get a little rough at times; however, this is what makes the story so brilliant! The kids feel as though there is no way out from their werid family and crazy mother; the parents feel the only two ways out are to drink or to leave. By reading this book, you get a feeling of what it is like to be in everybody's shoes at different times in their lives. I found this book to be very thrilling. It was a fast read because I kept wanting to know what was going to happen next. The way that Wells wrote this novel in all different perspectives amazed me! I like the way that each chapter was a little story in which a different character told. It really makes the reader feel all of the different positions. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes different, exciting novels. I can't wait to read The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which is the sequel to Little Altars Everywhere."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Divine Secrets first as it appears a lot of other people did. I am glad that I did because I'm not sure if I would have read it if I had read Little Altars first. Little Altars is an incredibly sad story. This story gave me some insight on the characters that I was familiar with, but it made me think less of them then I had before. I liked this book, but mostly because I loved Divine Secrets so much. I would still recommend this book to others, but only after they read Divine Secrets! This book is written beautifully and I look forward to more of Rebecca Wells' work."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Little Altars after reading Divine Secrets. Some suggest reading the two books in order but I felt I understood Vivi better from reading Divine Secrets first and I'm not so sure I would have gone on to read it, had I read Little Altars first. I expected Altars to make me laugh as much as I did with Secrets but I found that to be the case only in the first few chapters. Then it became darker and sadder with each chapter as Wells put the reader in every situation, from being eleven year old Sidalee blowing her piano recital to being Wiletta and Chaney who were powerless over the alcoholism and dysfunctionalism in the Walker household. Even though this was not what I expected, I found I just love Wells way with words and her ability to make a reader feel like they have been somewhere they have never been. (In my case, the south). I hope to hear more from this fabulous author."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"What an awesome book!!! It made me laugh. It made me cry. A very easy read. I highly recommend it. Way to go Rebecca Wells!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I expected &quot;Little Altars&quot; to be another laugh-out-loud story with some touching,tender moments like &quot;Divine Secrets&quot;.. But there was nothing to laugh at with this story, which centers around child abuse and alcoholism. Also, I wasn't a fan of the format of the book, in which each chapter was told from the point of view of a different character ....It read more like character sketches than a story. There was too much disfunction in &quot;Little Altars&quot; - and I almost didn't finish it."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"&quot;little altars everywhere&quot; is indeed a suitable title for a work dealing with the rich, religious culture of the deep south. i wish i could be friends with siddalee and talk to her about her past, and remain friends with her as she divulges the divine secrets of the yayas. i would recommend reading little altars, first, then go and read divine secrets. little altars gives you the background of the lives of an entire family. then when you read divine secrets and meet sidda as an adult, it's like talking to a friend whom you've known your entire life, grown up with, shared secrets with, and now you enjoy drinking tea together and recalling past hellish experiences with a smile, a dunk, and some more sugar."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"For a first novel, Little Altars Everywhere, packs a punch that we don't often find in contemporary literature. Rebecca Wells combines humor, abuse, alcoholism, love, religion, fear and tragedy in a novel that shakes our complacent foundations and wakes us up to what parents do to their children whether they realize it or not. And along with that, we learn how the children deal with parents whom they love above all but whom they come to realize are far from the perfect parents they once envisioned. Rural Louisiana is the scene, and it is rich with imagery of live oaks and Spanish moss and the colorful culture that accompanies life in Louisiana. The mother, Vivi Walker, and her childhood friends, the Yaya sisters, live, love, drink and play cards while the children at times lead charmed lives in their presence and at times are subject to abuse as result of their mothers's excesses. Each chapter is told by a different character so that we are able to know the perspective of all the people--adults, children and the notably perceptive viewpoint of Willetta and Chaney, the Black couple who live on the Walker's property and work for them. The contrast between the two families, so close yet so very far apart, is interesting and a moral foil that exposes the excesses of the priviledged class in a not very flattering light. Overall, Little Altars Everywhere is a great read whether one chooses to delve into the deeper realms or simply enjoy it as a novel of family and relationships rich with humor and life. Read it, and then go ASAP to The Divine Secrets of the Yaya Sisterhood, a charming and entertaining book about Vivi and her friends and all their children that will keep you laughing and crying from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I liked this book more than the latter release of the bestseller of Ya Yas. I am repulsed by Vivi and feel sorry for her family and all that know her. She is mean and selfish and traumatized her children. I pity her and find her to be a villainess, an interesting one at that. This book was easier to read, more consistent and I kept the pages turning in comparison to the the Ya Ya book. It's lighter and when you add reading this book with the Ya-Ya book... both books together is a decent time if you have the time. Read both if you must since it's more worthwhile than reading just one or the other."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Altars and Ya Ya were the best novels I have read this year. The friendships and family were very entertaining. I laughed and cried."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"It at first started slow I thought but I must say the feeling in Rebecca's words and thoughts are very pulling on your thoughts and feelings and again a very important begining to The Divine Secrets- and I believe so much more could be done with both pieces"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I was very much disappointed . It was a soap opera told from varying points of view but with one major intention to shock the reader with its descriptions of alcoholism, child abuse, and adult irresponsibility. The Yayas' bonding seemed to be only an excuse to escape the confines of marriage and motherhood. The title and the description of its significance appears to be a pathetic attempt to add literary value to a novel without it."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Rebecca Wells I want to thank you for this book. I grew up with alcoholic parents and you really hit the nail on the head with this one. In more ways than one I relate to this book. Siddalee saw things in the perspective i did when i was a child .Really the only thing missing was a tear jerking Hank Williams record. Thank you again."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Well..you coudln't really say it's an excellant novel because the Divine Secrets is definitely better. I too support a reader who said that everyone should read the Divine secrets first before reading this. Because this is really just a compilation of short stories of the Walker Family.It doesn't really tell much. BUt as a short stories collection, I still find something to laugh at..."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Well this book was not at all what I expected! It's so much darker than I thought it would be. I thought the Ya-Yas where a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky kinda group (I'm basing this on the few previews I saw of the movie)...but no...not at all. I didn't expect constant drunkiness, child-abuse, and cruelty. It did make for a very entertaining read though...as awful as that sounds.I couldn't put the book down! The messed-up world of the Walker family is funny, tragic, happy and sad all in one. I really recommend this book. I've just picked the 'Divine Secrets', and am really looking forward to what more this family can get themselves into!! Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read this book in two sittings. It was easy to read, and enjoyable. I like getting inside the heads of characters so different from myself. I would recommend it to my mom and my girlfriends. Probably not much of a guy's book.A great book for a long airplane ride!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood first, and if you are considering reading this series of books by Rebecca Wells, I suggest the same. Although Little Altars Everywhere was written first, it is far less interesting a book, and on its own is very depressing. Having read Divine Secrets first, I feel I understood the stories told in Little Altars better, and I was able to remove some of the gloom from the book knowing how things turn out in Divine Secrets. Had I read Little Altars first, I would never have ventured to read Divine Secrets.Overall, a decent book, but one that I would not recommend unless your curious after reading Divine Secrets."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I loved reading \\"Little Altars Everywhere\\". I did enjoy it better than \\"Divine Secrets\\", but I liked that too. Some people can't handle a sad book, if so don't read this. But, my gosh, that's life, and its not really sad, I prefer to call it \\"bittersweet\\". Anyhow, I couldn't put this down. I found each chapter enthralling, and its so believable, you start to think it was the authors life. I think everyone should read--I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I listen to audio books while I am slogging away on the elliptical trainer so in the course of a year I &quot;hear&quot; a lot of them. And I can tell you that bad narration ruins the greatest books. (NEVER--listen to me audio book publishers--NEVER let an author read her own work! Unless, one small caveat, the author is Maya Angelou, who reads prose like it is poetry.) In narrating &quot;Little Altars Everywhere, Judith Ivey is simple perfection. Probably the book is good on its own and I would have liked it just as much had I read it in the traditional manner. But Ivey is so great that I find I cannot set her narration aside to review just the book itself. Ivey eases inside the characters from whose various points of view the chapters are written, and she takes you right along with her. Her southern accents are a delight, and she never misses a beat. Rebecca Wells should love this woman."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read this book as part of a book club organized by my church. I had never heard of this book before hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it immensely. I envy the relationships the Ya-Ya's have with each other, and the memories they share. But even so, this book isn't ALL happy-go-lucky goodtimes. Just as there are bright sides there are also dark sides in the Ya-ya's history. Merge yourself into the lives of the Ya-Ya's! You will not regret it. Recommended to everyone, even though I imagine this novel will probably not appeal to men as much as it would to women."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This is a very well written and interesting novel, I could not put it down. The characters are not extraodinary, but they are so real. Author's style of writing really makes you a part of the Walker family experience. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book is more a series of vignettes or little snap shots of a dysfunctional family in Thornton, Louisiana than it is a novel or story. Vivid, the book evokes pictures of family cruelty and ruthlessness. The whole feel of the book is disjointed, lacking cohesion and feels more bitter than meaningful. This books is a disappointment compared to her other, the Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, which is peopled by the same characters (though is characterized nothing like them) and has more grace and redemption. Bypass this book in favor of Divine Secrets."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I am so sad that I read this book. After I finished reading &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;, I wanted to be like them. I loved the characters and actually missed them after I finished the book. Although it is well written and the stories are great &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; ruins what I thought of Vivianne and Shep. She is a horrible woman and I am so glad that I read Ya-Ya's first."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"After loving Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, I was rather disappointed with this book. At first its very intriguing because now all of Vivi's kids are telling their stories. It starts off light and funny but ends rather dark and disturbing.Granted, you can see throughout both novels that Vivi isn't quite emotionally stable but in Little Alters, she comes out to be a monster of sorts. At the end you leave the book feeling rather icky and upset. If you are into dark books, this is the one for you.Unfortunately, it was a little too dark for me."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Like many people, I read The Divine Secrets first. I loved it - it moved, amused, and even changed me a bit. But having read Little Altars, I don't feel that way about the sequel anymore. The character Vivi is ultimately is too horrendous to excuse, as we are asked to do in Ya-Ya. And the friends we grew to love for their loyalty were nothing more than co-conspirators and enablers. The women that you love in the second book, turn out to be monsters. I find nothing endearing about alcoholism, child abuse and molestation. I find it even more disturbing that Vivi, throughout her entire life, is never able to see the error in her actions and never able to apologize. There is a line in the second book where Siddalee says that her mother &quot;owes&quot; her something. The YaYa friend she is speaking to, says that her mother owes her nothing because she loved them and raised them in style. Um actually not only does she owe her children at least an apology and explanation, she deserves some jail time.Little Altars is a tragic and haunting novel and is only worth reading because it's author is unbelievably talented. She is the first author who has been able to move me to tears. I hope to see more from her in the future, although hopefully not involving the heinous character Vivi - or her abhorrent friends."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I heard that Ms. Wells denied this book was her family's autobiography. I pray she has not told that lie. There are details here that could not have been gleaned from the uninitiated. There are thousands of us who, before we could see over the dash of the car, knew to grab for the ice bucket and the Smirnoff bottle when Mama hit the brakes. Suffocating on the backdraft from cigarettes lit end to end, we cruised with our mothers and their friends like little hostages around our small towns looking for lost high heels and worse. We had stools and steps in front of the bars at our houses and were proud of the dexterity we displayed for guests. Many of us knew how to mix drinks in a moving car- the enormous bottle cradled in our small arms- honored to preform this priestly task, the true eucharist of our alcholic homes. Some of us from the south were rescued from the insanity inside our houses by black employees who dutifully and lovingly served our sick families like the literal angels we now know them to be. We know about whippings- belt whipping, hand whipping, barelegged whipping, know the diffenence between a whipping and a stomping- and all of us know about the flash of light that terrible instant before the crack when Mama slapped us, followed by the dumbness and numbness. We have staggered back to our rooms and sat on our beds in shame and confusion and unspeakable anger. We are also a crowd whose mothers and their attendants- because this is a matriarchy- were our heroes. For all their faults they were our terrible goddesses and ruled over our lives like narcissistic gladiators. We were just audience but our seats were too close to the stage. They smashed around like Vaulkries with no real intent to hurt us. How many times have we heard, fix Mama a drink dear. That's a love, now take the others and go play in the traffic. God they were beautiful to look at but hard to touch. Honey don't touch Mama's dress with your dirty hands. Available to each always, though never to men. They ruined their men, belittled them. They were more beautiful, accomplished and intelligent and they never missed an opportunity to remind their sullen, usually hardworking, well-meaning husbands how much they passed up in marrying them. No, there is precious little fiction here. There are too many of us who know the truth for Rebecca Wells to tell that tale. She cannot, must not be allowed, to own the story and deny it's legacy. For the record- my mother was a brainy, chain smoking small town Zsa Zsa strapped to vodka bottle in her late teens, my father was a rich farmer, the maid who raised us was named Sarah and her husband, Booley, drove Daddy till his drinking got so bad Daddy fired him and hired Marshall away from French Ricard. Marshall was dusty black and Daddy said he looked like Satchmo. Marshall lived with Ma'am who would keep us when there was trouble. And this last- Mama drove a T-bird from '56 on. There were 5 of us counting Sarah. Daddy and Marshall were behind in the Jeep. I tried to read the Ya Ya book but saw instantly that it was derivitive and apologetic and quit on it to save Little Alters from distortion. I will read it, but I have some work to do first."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"On Friday I stopped on the way home from work to buy &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; by Rebecca Wells. It has been on my wish list for about a year now and I didn't even know it was related to the Ya-Ya Sisterhood until last week!Anyway like I said I got it on Friday afternoon and finished it by dinnertime on Saturday - it was THAT GOOD.Each chapter was told in a different characters' point of view. There were several by Sidda and a few from Vivi, but there was also some insight from Big Shep, Willetta, and Sidda's siblings Little Shep, Baylor and Lulu. This format provided better insight into the family's troubles than just Sidda's POV would have.The story overall is disturbing and sad - especially the chapters with Willetta and Little Shep. Plenty of happy memories are visited throughout the book but they are overshadowed by a dark cloud in every chapter, usually the result of something Vivi has done.Reading this book helped me to better understand its subsequent &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; and I would highly recommend it with FIVE STARS!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I just finished Wells' Little Altars Everywhere, and with having already read The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, I wasn't sure if this novel was meant to be read before or after each other? Little Altars is a good book by itself, but since the two are tied together, Wells must have given some consideration as to the reaction her readers would have after finishing both books.Simply put -- they don't match each other. Yes, the characters are the same, and yes, you do have stories that criss-cross each other -- but if you read The Divine Secrets BEFORE you read Little Altars, you might be a bit put off like I was. There's a lot more delving into the physical, emotional, and alcohol/drug abuse that all the characters go through. And we go from when the kids were little to when they're adults (which means the Sidalee's parents are older too at the end of the book), and I just felt like I was not reading about the same characters. I was actually quite sad to realize that Wells wanted the characters to go through more emotional/physical (and yes, sexual) abuse than we were led to believe. With The Divine Secrets, you know there's more underneath it all, but you only get glimmers. And I guess I have to wonder, is this enough? Do we really need to know more?With that said, I've decided to just read Little Altars as its own novel, without being attached to The Divine Secrets. It just makes me too sad to think of the same characters in these different facets. And I truly hope no one decides to make a movie out of Little Altars. Unless the plot is fluffed up a bit, I think the movie would just be too depressing. Little Altars was written in snippets from everyone's point of view, which is an interesting concept (albeit, not a new one) and keeps the story as a whole together. You finally get some answers and you also get to know the brothers and sisters more. Two thumbs up - but be forewarned if you've already read The Divine Secrets - you might be a bit put off like I was."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read &quot;Divine Secrets&quot; before I read &quot;Little Altars&quot;. Once again I was swept away by the excellent writing, dimensional characters and enrapturing descriptions. Little Altars gives you an even deeper look into Vivi and her clan. As a reader I understood Sidda's distress even more after Little Altars. As with Divine Secrets, all I wanted after I devoured this book, was MORE, MORE and MORE! As with all my friends, we ask Ms. Wells to write again, and never stop!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Little Alters everywhere on recommmendation from a co-worker after reading Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. It almost ruined Divine Secrets for me. Incestuous Vivi is stomach churning. What was Miss Wells thinking? It's practically not the same Vivi-acious character. I recommend the second book highly, but this one...should be Vivi-sected."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book is more about Vivi's growing up years and her special friendships, her turbulent relationships with her parents, her lost love, her relationship with her daughter Sidda. This is a thought-provoking book where it shows the darker side of Vivi's life ~~ why she turns to alcohol to escape from her sadnesses and frustrations. Though Vivi presents this happy, carefree person to the world, she deals with depression and a sense of loss throughout her whole life. She is not a happy person and though she tries to avoid it, it does affect the lives around her.Rebecca Wells writes with humor and she touches in places that most women hide from the world ~~ even from their own families or those closest to them. This is a book for mothers and daughters to read for every daughter longs to know exactly what her mother is really like and every mother longs to remain the most important person in her daughter's life. Wells really explores the mother-daughter theme with grace and humor. It isn't a book easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This is a more realistic story than Divine Secrets. I read Divine Secrets a few years ago and enjoyed it. However, the story is a bit contrived. I think we're all pretty familiar with the eccentric southern woman character. It's been done to death. And the Ya-Ya's were just a bit too over the top for my tastes. It unfortunately glossed over their abuse of alcohol. However, Little Altars is a more realistic story. It shows how the Ya-Yas have a lot of fun but destroy the people who care for them.It's a much more depressing story than Divine Secrets. The sexual abuse was pretty shocking but believable given Vivi's family history. I disagree with the other reviewers that Vivi is \\"evil\\" in this book. She's not as likable here. In fact, she's not likable at all. But she doesn't seem \\"evil\\" to me but instead very damaged, doing to her children what was done to her.In summary, alcoholism and physical and emotional child abuse were hinted at in Divine Secrets but glossed over by the eccentricities and funny antics of the Ya-Yas. Here we see that their alcoholism isn't funny and almost destroys their children so I think it's the better novel."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Definitely this book gives a darker picture of Vivian than the second, which sort of implies Vivi's abusiveness toward her children was largely limited to one episode. But that's not the only reason I found this book darker and less affirming. What hit me was that, in the first part of the book, except for the obvious heavy drinking, Vivian seemed a high-spirited woman who thrived on attention but also found social bonds and responsibilities as suffocating as they can be supportive. But she was an extremely likeable character. For example, she was concerned about teaching her daughter how to be popular, but she wouldn't stand for her daughter to be mean or cruel to somebody else, even the unpopular Edie. Viviane obviously flaunted convention, but still had a kind heart and was extroverted to the extreme, and loved to be a local socialite.However, when the reader reaches part 2 of the book, he or she discovers that Viviane has a darker side. A MUCH darker side, if child abuse bothers you as much as it does me! The drinking we have seen, but the physical abuse of the children becomes more graphic and seems much more severe, and we find she sexually abuses at least one of her sons. These were hard revelations to me, though obviously in keeping with much of \\"Southern\\" gothic fiction, from Blanche Dubois on. But I hate to think that perhaps something of the point is that creative and free-spirited people are also child abusers and emotional leeches. Yes, one can argue that these negatives make a character more \\"three-dimensional,\\" and maybe the author is making the point that such flamboyance has its dark side, but that's a pretty dark side!Furthermore, once these aspects of Viviane were introduced, particularly the sexual abuse of Little Shep, I think it is a real shortcoming of the two novels that these issues are so briefly alluded to but not resolved further. Maybe Wells planned/plans more novels about the Walkers? Maybe we can get the men's points of view?However, the above criticisms should not keep someone from reading these books. They contain a marvelous sense of times and places, particularly Louisiana from the 1930's on to the present. And there are many luminous moments among the dark parts."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"What a wonderful book about love, hate and the survival of the dysfunctional. It quickly becomes clear that all is not well at Pecan Grove. The characters are wacky but believable, and most aren't lovable. But you care about them because (through an interesting literary device) you are allowed to know them and see why they (and all people) grow into the people they become. I laughed, cried and clucked my tongue. I only wish we could have heard from Lulu. Try reading Pat Conroy's The Prince of Tides for a beautifully written book about other survivors of less-than-ideal childhoods. Can't wait to dig into Divine Secrets."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"She does an excellent job of changing her style of writing to give a different feel to the read for each character. One of the best for this style however, it left me cold after reading the Ya-Ya Sisters. The Ya-ya sisters glowed with relationships and culture and this just read dark."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I prefer this book over the hokier Yaya Sishood. I find its dark depiction of Vivi the child molester and the POVs of others besides whiny (grown-up) Sidda and vivacious Vivi of Divine Secrets fame refreshing. I cannot believe some recommend skipping this novel to protect the images of the Ya Yas they gleaned from reading the sequel. These are Wells' characters, and she has chosen to make them three-dimensional and complex. What's so offensive about that? If you truly loved the Ya Yas, you shouldn't be afraid to read this novel. In fact, I was relieved to discover the neglect and abuse that went uncovered in the Divine Secrets...druggie alchies are not always the bright, shiny French-spouting debutantes they appear to be. Merci, Rebecca Wells!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book is not exactly a continuation of The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya sisterhood, but it has some of the characters in it.The book details stories about the Walker family as told by members of the Walker Family as well as Willetta and Chaney who worked for them.You get to know Sidda, Lulu, Little Shep and Baylor a little better because of the stories that are told in the book, but Vivi and Shep Sr also get a couple of chapters as well.Some of the stories detail Sidda's relationship with her dance teacher and how she got mad when her Aunt Jezie started to hang out with the dance teacher and they would not spend as much time with her. She also details the time when at a friend of the Ya-Ya's Caro gave her a hair cut that she hated.Lulu talks about shoplifting different things and how she got to be so good at it, until she got caught trying to steal a hat for her father.Little Shep details that because of the things that his mother did he had a hard time getting close to his children and how a girl at school helped him to tell his mother that he did not want her to do what she had been doing to him anymore.Baylor tells about the town that they all grew up in and how their crazy mayor got an idea to save the town by putting catfish in an old pool (they all end up dying because of the chemicals left over from when it was a pool)Shep Sr. details how he had been on a recruitment board during the Vietnam War and how making the decision to enlist a neighbor as well as the younger brother of Chaney affected him.Chaney and Willetta have their own stories about how watching the Walker family made them realize that even though they were African American and poor in some ways they had it better than the Walker family and gave thanks that they had what they did.Overall, not as good as Divine Secrets, but an interesting read."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Rebecca Wells wrote \\"Little Altars\\" in 1992, well before Divine Secrets was written. It's a shame the latter received more attention than the former. We see the good and the bad that make up the Walker family. The nay sayers that believe Vivi Walker's \\"appeal\\" is ruined are missing an amazingly written book that shows rich characters beyond the trivialness of the Divine Secrets, which chose to celebrate an alcoholic, child abuser and her equally culpable friends."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Altars Everywhere is a brilliant telling of the Walker family and all of their trial and tribulations. She brings to life all the pain and happiness experienced by the family in their day-to-day life. Wells' use of character is beyond outstanding. She makes one embrace each character to the extent of not wanting to put the novel down. When reading this novel one becomes a part of their family and can relate to many of their situations. Also, one experiences a certain amount of shock due to some of the outrageous behavior of the characters.The character Siddalee goes through a lot of pain when she deals with her mother, Viviane. Sidda is a vivacious little girl who never stops talking and is always on some adventure. Her character is a loveable, high-spirited young lady who deep down really loved her mother. Her mother is an abusive alcoholic who is so obnoxious that the story was actually strengthened by her malice. She was so strung out that she even beat her little naked children with a belt. It is hard to believe that this self-centered woman gave life to such a positive and vibrant person.Wells' gets the reader so wrapped up in the lives of the Walker family, one actually feels a part of it. Sidda is one of the easier characters to connect with because of her natural joy for life. Wiletta is also easy to associate with because of her mother like qualities and virtuous nature. This sometimes funny and sometimes sad novel will leave anyone wanting more."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I've read a lot of books in my day, but this author is the only one who can make me laugh out loud. You will enjoy this one, as well as the sequel!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Altars Everywhere is one of the best books i've read in ages it conveys a real life family showing the ups and downs in a comical, yet truthful way. I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a REALLY good read after a hard days work."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I found this book really great, but not as good as Divine Secrets, which I read first. I loved the &quot;feel good&quot; feeling I got from Divine Secrets and expected the same from Little Altars. I think I read these books out of order but still enjoyed both immensely.I hope Rebecca Wells writes another Ya-Ya saga! I have recommended both books to my Ya-Ya's and they loved them as well!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Love her characters and their ways of dealing with difficult subjects like alcohol abuse and family discord--not too seriously! Hope Wells is hard at work on another book about these people."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I love this book. The characters are so rich and human. This book deals with pain, but it is also one of the warmest stories I have ever read. I laughed out loud while reading this book. The depiction of women of the South is very true to life. I cannot wait to read Little Altars Everywhere"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I just finished Little Altars and I feel very sad that it had to end. I couldn't put the book down but at the same time I found myself reading very slowly as to savor every word. I read YaYa's first and I'm glad I did because this book is a continuationINTO the lives of the Walker's.I think we all can relate to their family along with all their dysfunction since our families share some also. It is a book of revelations for Siddalee where she can accept her family for all of the good and bad and realize that it made her the person she is.We as adults can only hope to do the same. Although in Part 2 Vivi goes too far. I lost my empathetic feelings towards her since there are somethings that are unforgiveable! I hope Ms. Wells writes again I really Like her style!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Altars Everywhere is one of those books you feel enter your person as soon as you glimpse the first paragraph, and you don't want to put it down for fear of losing something of yourself when you do. It sensitively explores both male and female perspectives, on childhood as well as adulthood. It provides the backbone, and background, for Wells's Ya-Ya Sisterhood; it comes FIRST chronologically, and to appreciate it fully you want to read it before you read the Ya-Yas. If you haven't read either book yet, both are 100%, heartfelt recommendations, but read Little Altars first, and you're bound to devour The Ya-Ya Sisterhood too, to continue your connection to all of these wonderfully crazy ladies."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read the Divine Secrets first and throughly enjoyed it. Then I read Little Altars and was shocked to see how truly dysfunctional this family was. Vivi in Divine Secrets, while addicted to pills and drink, was at least a somewhat sympathetic character. She was totally hideous and unlikeable in Little Altars. I would be interested in knowing if the author plans on writing a third volume on the Walker family."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood first and loved it. Little Altars was a let down. It was depressing but I kept reading to get to &quot;the fun part&quot;. I never found it.Read &quot;Divine Secrets&quot; and enjoy the memory without botching it up with &quot;Little Altars&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Altars Everywhere is tender, passionate and extremely real! It is true southern humor with a universal appeal. I saw many of my family and friends is Siddalee's world!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Just finished LAE. At first, it read like a series of heartwarming stories about a nice childhood w/ some sauced parents. Suddenly, it all takes a very dark turn and this was a difficult transition. It became very depressing and dark. I enjoyed the writers wordsmithing. She is somewhat poetic. I will read DSOYYS because I hope to read that something good happens to these poor souls. Wells certainly managed to extract emotions from my gut (some that I would rather keep tucked away)."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I was amazed with each child and their memories of the family growing up in the South. Each one had something that drew me to them and made me care about them. Vivi was a woman driven, driven to be the best but became the worst. Something or someone haunts her and she never becomes capable of dealing with it. She is strange and perverse yet somewhat very likeable at times. I recommend the book as a good read but be prepared that things are not always as they seem--just like normal life. One never knows what goes on behind closed doors or in the minds of others. I look forward to more ya-ya books. Let the story continue--pleeeease."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I started reading this book on a 10 1/2 hour flight from Los Angeles to London.I bought Little Altars Everywhere and The Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya sisterhood at the same time. I instinctively read Little Altars Everywhere first, which is the best way to read these two books.Vivi Abbott Walker is truly the star, the others must be content to simply be in her orbit. The minute you feel you know the characters, they totally surprise you. I really liked that. Also, the way you see the family through the innocent eyes of a child and the battle torn eyes of an adult is brilliant. Wish I could write like that!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"As the prequel of Ya Ya Sisterhood it sets the story straight, if not a somewhat somber way.You become emotionally tied to the characters, despising some, adoring others...trying to understand their mindset, motives and/or dysfunction.A worthwhile but not always light and happy read."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I gave up three days of my life to finish the Divine Sisterhood. I cried unconsolebly for 2 1/2 hours starting with the final chapter. For anyone searching for what made their mother's tick, I beg of you to stop looking and embrace her. Vivi is in all of our mothers and in all of us. I became Sidda in one brief moment on Cape cod on a hot humid Sunday and I thank Ms. Wells for granting me these perfect characters. I added 10 years to my life and my mother, always the heroine became a goddess in my eyes. Ya-ya yes- Little Altars, here I come-"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"While the many first person points of view can be a bit confusing, this first novel was remarkable for introducing characters with strong, original, sharp, funny, and moving voices. Painful but honest. A sharp contrast to the highly overrated Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I just read a few reviews and was intrigued and somewhat dissapointed by what many of those who have read &quot;Divine Secrets...&quot; have to say about &quot;Little Altars...&quot;Yes, LA is hilarity interspersed with painful sadness, but so is life. That's what makes it such a wonderful book. So many of you seem upset that LA is &quot;darker&quot; than DS. For those of you who feel that way, I think you're missing something. LA did not leave me feeling depressed. It's all about what people go through, to get to the other side, and come out okay. There's nothing morbid about that."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable. I enjoyed &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; much more. Definitely worth reading, though."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book is a wonderful character study to accompany Rebecca Wells' second novel &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;. However, it reads a little like an study for the second novel and not really as a fully realized novel on its own. I recommend this book but only after you've read &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;. It seems to work better that way."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"What begins as a light-hearted, predicatable story takes an unexpected twist mid-story without any transition. It was drudgery to finish."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"&quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; is a beautiful book that deals with much of what's meaningful in life: love, death, friendship, and the complex relationship between mothers and daughters. It deals with the complexities of life itself and how our childhoods can affect our grown-up lives - and how to move beyond that to find the positive. The characters are fully developed and complex - Vivi, the mother, is beautiful and vivacious; she is also capable of ferocious jealousy and rage. But the flawed characters only serve to make this book and its characters more beautiful and more human. The Louisiana setting that dominates most of the book comes to life on the page. You can literally smell the shrimp cooking, the scent of flowers and cut grass, sweaty bodies and cool water. You can't read this book without being moved."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I could not put this book down. I was instantly drawn into this family's world. Every page is precious!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"If you liked the &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood&quot; you will surely enjoy this book as well. Ms. Wells gives us a vivid picture of what it is like to be a child of Vivi Abbott Walker, which is to say pure joy juxtaposed with pure hell. Vivi Walker is a woman of extremes. On one hand her day isn't complete unless she takes time to sit and enjoy the simple, yet sublime pleaure of viewing the sunset from her backyard, on the other hand she is as mean a drunk as you could ever hope to avoid.Be forewarned that if you fell in love with this character in &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood&quot;, that a dark and very disturbing facet of her personality is revealed in this book."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book brought back very strong memories. In DEVINE SECRETS..., I was introduced to the Ya Ya's and I fell in love w/ them. LITTLE ALTARS is much darker. However, there was enough nostalgia that I was transported back to my southern youth. There is a Siddalee in every southern woman today."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Loved this and am buying it as a Christmas gift for 1 of my 6 , 5 of which are genuine, &quot;ya ya&quot; sisters. This book will catch you from page one, enthrall you with its descriptions and surprise you in the manner and the situations in which the sisters end up supporting each other."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Even though this book is supposed to be read before The Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, I read it afterward; like most folks. In any event, it was a good book and I recommend it, however....I was hoping for more insight. Again, I read it after the YaYas had already enveloped my psyche. I was a die hard YaYa and wanted more. This book, although very good on its own, made me feel like I still wanted more. And I'd hoped it would have answered more questions about ViVi, Shep, Sidda, and the lot.What I really like is that every family/friend/character had his/her own chapter. From that you could reason and view their own perspective of this wonderful family story."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Sometimes it's difficult to read stories with depth and truth...but it is the reality of life. Families aren't perfect and we all have secrets. After reading &quot;Divine Secrets&quot; I wondered if I would enjoy the backward order of my reading. But I think that I might not have found the Ya Ya's so endearing had I read &quot;Little Alters&quot; first. This novel had depth, humor and profound sadness...but it was very real. It hurt me so much to read of the pain of Sidda and her siblings' childhood but it reminded me of mine. I appreciate that."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"a truly enjoyable read...though not quite as good as Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood...read this second, although it was written first. Like others, I was really emotionally involved in reading these books. For the few days it took to read, I was truly engrossed in the characters lives."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I first heard of Rebecca Well's when I saw her on the Rosie O'Donnell show. I have always been captivated by the mystery of Louisiana and I picked up 'Divine secrets&quot; first. I read that one so fast I could hardly take a breath. I wanted to know more about where this story came from so I picked up ' Little Altars'. I am so glad that I did. I could hardly put it down and I got some strange looks on the bus when I chuckled out loud. The last section of the book is sad but I enjoyed the perspective of all the characters. Once I finished it I wanted to read the &quot;Divine Secrets&quot; again. I love Rebecca Well's characters and story telling."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Obviously all of you non-southerners just DON'T GET IT! This book was so heartbreakingly REAL! I could not put it down. I found the story to be fluid and captivating. I read it in one sitting. The story is not disjointed; that's just the way a story is told here in the south. Rebecca Wells is a jewel. Yankees, chill out!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I did not like this book. I didn't find any of the characters to be very appealing. The fact that the mother sexually abuses her children gives me absolutely no motivation to read about her life and friendships in the second book, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Why glorify an alcoholic child-molestor?!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Written from multiple points of view with believable perspective that I find astounding. I'm totally in love with this book and its sequel, Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood. Thank you, Rebecca Wells!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"After watching the movie and reading \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,\\" I felt sympathy and compassion for Viviane, whose upbringing left a lot to be desired. However, after reading this book, all that compassion has evaporated. Viviane is a horrible, small-souled women who beats and humiliates her children at every turn. There are a few loving memories included in this book, but they are by far overshadowed by the verbal, physical, and sexual abuse detailed in this novel.Rebecca Wells is a truly talented writer, who brings her characters to life. Her gift is such that I read this entire book, despite my feelings of loathing and disgust toward Viviane. I would have been better prepared for this novel if it was portrayed as less of a \\"feel good, humorous\\" book, and more of a \\"dark, emotional, and deeply felt\\" book."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Rebecca Wells completley draws you into her world with this book. Her writing style and charcters are a welcome change and keep the reader glued to the pages until the stories over. It is an emotionally draining novel that leaves you light headed and happy. I found that it is the type of novel I could read 10 times in a row and still not be tired of it!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"The life of Vivian Walker and her three best friends told from the perspective of her daughter Siddalee. Truly an amazing work that is true to life and easy to identify with. No matter what age you are, from 15 to 115 there are surprises waiting for you in this book. Read it once, then a year later read it again, etc., etc., etc., you'll always find a story within the weft of the book that relates to your life now; from teenage angst to the immense pain of blows delt by those you love. READ IT!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"After reading Diving Secrets all I can say is who is Vivi Walker? The character in this novel was a smoothed over version of herself in Little Alters, where she was represented as physically abusice, manipulative, and alcoholic. Here she is simply an overwhelmed mother left alone too often with four young children. Sure she breaks down, but this novel should also be about Vivi's reconciliation with her past, not only Sidda's. I was so disappointed with this novel"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read and loved Divine Secrets of the Ya-Yas. It even brought back the memories of growing up with my two best friends. I was so excited to read more about the characters I grew to love in Little Altars, however when the darkest facet of Vivi's personality was revealed I wanted to through the book away. All of a sudden I didn't identify with these women any more. I felt disgusted with the rest of the book!!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Meet the Walker family of Thornton, Louisiana. Vignettes told by the children, Sidda, Little Shep, Lulu, and Baylor, alternate with their parents to give a picture of growing up in the 1960s South in a dysfunctional family.At first the mother (Vivi) seems eccentric and a bit too much a good-time girl. Then as the accounts add up, and the years pass, we see the complete disintigration of the family as alcoholism takes its toll.It's all there, told in little stories; the catholicism, treatment of blacks, child abuse, Southern manners, Viet Nam, the remnants of Southern aristocracy and so much more. Your heart goes out to these children and you can't stop reading the sometimes funny, sometimes sad, events that make up their lives."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Altars Everywhere is a captivating novel, not only for its interesting story, but for its complex characters and familiar scenes. The novel tells of a Southern family's struggles to love one another despite their alcoholism and quick tempers. Rebecca Wells makes it impossible to either love or hate the characters completely, for with every personality flaw comes an adorable trait. This makes the characters entirely human. Vivi's escapades with the Ya Ya Sisters make the story hilarious. The realistic dialogue and characters make the read more enjoyable. Although the tale is a depressing one, it is ultimately a charming southern story."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"When I first picked up this book I had this nagging feeling that I should read the Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood first, I should have trusted my instincts. Everybody keeps saying what a great book that was and how Little Alters ruined it. Here you are presented with a picture of a hopelessly disfunctional family, and the qeustion is: For what purpose? No resolution or message is conveyed and your left with the horrible vision of Vivi Abbott Walker, an alcoholic, abusive, child molester. In this book the cruel (Vivi) and fake (Sidda) are given the spotlight where the strong (Little Shep)and the noble (Chaney and Willetta) are shoved into the background. This novel seems to thrive and celebrate life crippling disfunction."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"You must read Little Alters Everywhere and The Divine Secrets of the YA-YA sisterhood in that order or you won't get it. If you read them in this order you will really enjoy them. Otherwise, The Ya Ya's don't make much sense. Give them a try!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I first read Divine Secrets... and then read this book, and very much felt lied to by the author. In the second book the mother is basically lovable, well almost, but flawed. Then I went and read the first book Little Altars Everywhere and read that the mother is sexually abusing her children. This did not come up in Divine Secrets at all and to me seems like a bunch of bull crap. I know that Divine Secrets is mostly from the daughters point of view and that the mother was sexually abusing her sons, but evenstill. On its own it would be a much better book."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I saw the movie and read both books. Here's my opinion: this book was the best out of the two. I felt it really gave the most detail for all of the characters of the Walker family. Maybe not so much for the Ya-Ya's, but I felt the other book didn't do much for them either. I really enjoyed this book. And I'm not just jumping on the band wagon, really!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"AWFUL simply put the book was awful. I love the Divine Secrets book and read that one first. Little altars was a waste of paper in my opinion. I don't quite understand how a character (Vivi Abbcott) protraited so richly in the Divine Secrets was so extreamly evil, cruel and hateful in little altars. Frankly I wish I had never read little altars. It turned the slightly demenented characters so like in Divine Secrets and pretty much destroyed them. -10 in my book"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"The plot of this novel is disjointed, like Lamb's This Much I Know Is True. The move from idyllic to horrific is too abrupt and aggravating. The authors should read Roddy Doyle's The Woman Who Walked Through Doors and Paddy Clarke. Altars is still a decent book, but not worth all of the hoopla."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Ms. Wells Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood before I read this one. I am glad that I did because I think I understood Little Altars Everywhere a little better - I knew the characters already.Each chapter is it's own story - some hilarious - some sad - some you just need a few minutes alone to reflect upon. I think Buggy needs her own book!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"After reading &quot;Divine Secrets&quot;, the four lovable, ahead-of-their-times, Southern divas had a strong hold on me. I fell in love with these characters. I wanted to know what went on in Sidda's childhood to cause her such grief. I wish I hadn't have. Reading &quot;Little Altars&quot; presents on of the most depressing views of a dysfunctional family that I have ever encountered in literature. If you've already read &quot;Divine Secrets&quot;, and are in love with Necie, Vivi, Caro and Teensy, do not read this."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This isn't *really* my kind of book - it reminded me eerily of something like Margaret Laurence's \\"A Bird In The House\\", given it is a collection of interwoven short stories told from the perspectives of different members of a small-town Louisiana family, most notably from the character of Siddalee.So why am I giving it four stars? Well there wasn't anything I didn't like about it. I found the prose easy to get through and imaginative. The stories for the most part were captivating and enchanting. The characters were well developed and familiar despite our polar opposite lives. The plot moved enough from section to section to keep me interested. I can't justfiy giving it a lower mark just because it's not my preferred style (ie: novel over short stories) or preferred subject matter (ie: modern day as opposed to the past).The stories revolve around two points in the character's lives - their childhoods in the 1960's and their relatively young adulthood in the early 1990's. Vivi is their eccentric, perhaps dangerously so, mother who also features in the ya ya sisterhood book. Interestingly enough this book was written before (and publicized after) the ya ya sisterhood - yet there are frequent mentions of the ya ya's and some dark secret they share and so on...so I'm guessing that book was simultaneously in the works as this one. Big Shep is Vivi's husband, a working class man who makes a few poor choices that make him forget how to love.Their children include the eldest daughter Siddalee, who is probably the most identifiable as the main character in the book. Sidda goes through several phases of independence/autonomy and relying on her family for guidance. Her younger brother Lil Shep doesn't feature much in the book other than his desire to be freed from the nasty secrets his family is keeping. I can't remember the next siblings name, I think it's Lulu, who stars in my favourite story in the book about petty theives and liars. Finally there is Baylor, the youngest, who lives in a dream both as a child and an adult.Overall this is a nice, slow read...it's enjoyable to drink up on lazy summer days in bits and pieces, and very much personifies the southern climate it describes."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read 'Little Altars Everywhere' for my English class this year...it is a wonderful novel. The main character- Siddalee Walker- is not only intelligent beyond her years but she also possesses wit and quirkiness that makes a reader want to hear what she has to say. This book takes you through her life from her view and the views of everyone in her family plus some friends. It really gives the story more depth to have it told this way. It takes place in south and so the speaking style the author uses are really fun to read. Vivi says some funny stuff but I reallllly don't like her. Although there are some evil twists, I still would recommend this book. My favorite character was Big Shep. I thought there was a lot more to him than what the rest realized. My least favorite character was Vivi for reasons you will know if you read the book. Overall I think this was a really worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Reminiscent of Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD or THE DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA, this stellar read is bound to please. It's so well written and the characters are wonderful. I highly recommend this great story to anyone with a pulse.Also recommended: THE BIRTH OF VENUS"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Little altars everywhere because I really enjoyed the movie. This book was good, but I think the author might have described things too much at times, and it just dragged on. It was also a little confusing at one or two parts. It didn't leave me feeling changed at the end though. I though i was rather... unfinished! I'm reading Dive Secrets now, and hope it will be more fufilling!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This is a potentially a better novel than Divine Secrets - more honest and hardhitting but I'm afraid it was spoiled for me by the way it was written - split down between several narrators. It is too bitty and distracting and some of the narrators - especially Big Shep are so boring that I skipped past their part. When I'm reading a novel about a dysfunctional family I want to read about THEM and what makes them tick, not a load of rubbish about catfish or something like that. Essentially the story is about the relationship with Sidda and Vivi and I think that Wells should have concentrated on that instead of giving a voice to so many other characters. Also having read the prequel I understand even less the fuss about the YaYas in Divine Secrets - about their unique style/friendship etc. In this book they come across as a bunch of rather vulgar women who spend their entire time getting drunk. Vivi is particular is a horrible mother and a horrible person who deserves to be punished for her actions rather than getting off scot-free."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"The award-winning author, Rebecca Wells, introduces audiences to the extraordinary Walker family in the speculator novel, Little Altars Everywhere. The success of the novel inspired the Louisiana native to write a sequel, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which hit the big screen in the spring of 2002 and instantly become a blockbuster hit. Audiences are intrigued with the remarkable lives of the Walker family as they cope with life in the beautiful Southern town of Thorton, Louisiana. The novel captives the difficulties and life obstacles each member endures and struggles to surpass. The Walker family consists of Big Shep and Vivi, the parental units and their adorable children: Siddalee, Little Shep, Baylor and Lulu. The novel grasps the innocence of the children as they suffer from emotional and physical abuse from their demented mother. The family strives to cope with religious, social, moral and ethnical issues. Rebecca Wells adds humor and wit to the novel by incorporating Vivi's spontaneous and outrageous childhood friends, the Ya-Yas. The novel's dramatic and emotional situations entice audiences around the world. Little Altars Everywhere is perfect for those seeking a story filled with love, abuse, passion and witty humor. The novel permits audiences to view the perspectives and actions of the Walker family in the 1960's and in the early 1990's. Rebecca Wells vivid descriptions capture the natural beauty of the land allowing audiences to personally connect with the environment and scenery. Rebecca Wells incorporation of controversial issues and criticism towards double standards and Catholicism fascinates readers. Little Altars Everywhere, inspires people to learn to cope with life's obstacles and gives readers the hope that in the end all will be well."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I just can't recommend it. I'm sure there is an audience for it...but I wouldn't be one of those people. I very much enjoyed the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, but this book was depressing and went nowhere in a hurry. There was none of the charm and wit of the original. In fact, I couldn't believe that this was written by the same person. I didn't become attached to any of the characters, and there is not a light moment in sight. By all means, read Divine Secrets....it's great, but if you are in the mood for more of the same, and aren't into tragic childhoods that scar you forever, I'd choose something else."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"As a woman, I am embarrassed that so many women embraced this book as touching, wonderful and full of rich southern heritage. As a mother, I am horrified. I had to force myself to finish it, so that I would know my negative opinion was fully justified.The story does not flow well with each character chiming in with their own observations. Each is on a different track. Nor did I see the point of this book. A book about a sick, alcoholic woman who abuses and neglects her children can not be heartwarming, funny or entertaining. Since Vivi doesn't seek any professional help or even feel the slightest bit of shame, I found no redeeming qualities in this story.I cringed when I read the reviews which reinforced Wells' descriptions of the Catholic church, small, southern towns and growing up poor as wonderfully realistic.Overall, I found it disturbing and without real-life value. I have no idea what to do with my copy, except throw it away."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This is such a wonderful book! It's very nostalgic and enjoyable. Wells's tone is comfortable and confiding. It's hard to explain the plot because it's broken up into lots of different stories. I have read Little Altars Everywhere at least four or five times. You're not going to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I thought this book would give more. But was disappointed in it. The book was just taking excerpts from Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood and making another book. No new stuff. It was well written as was the previous book, but not worhting purchasing in my opinion. Just check it out at the library or borrow from a friend."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"&quot;Little Alters Everywhere: A Novel&quot; by Rebecca Wells is a great summer read. Wells does have a gift for many voices. I can understand why &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel&quot; was a #1 New York Times Bestseller over &quot;Little Alters Everywhere&quot;, and why &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel&quot; was turned into a movie; it had a better plot and was more intriguing. Not the &quot;Little Alters Everywhere: A Novel&quot; didn't, but it left a lot of questions unanswered. And, in this novel, you don't get a great sense of Vivi. You know she is mentally unstable, but I think in Wells' follow up novel, it goes in much great and more interesting detail. I, personally think &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel&quot; should be read before &quot;Little Alters Everywhere: A Novel.&quot; I recommend."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book took me on a magnificent journey. I went inside the lives of the Walker family and felt the hot summer weather of Louisianna. The book is broken down in such a way that it makes it impossible to put down. By knowing what each character is experiencing and thinking it puts you on a very intimate level with them. Rebecca Wells brings to life the innocent summers of youth and the hardships of love. I can't wait to see what awaits me in the &quot;Ya Ya Sisterhood&quot;. Two thumbs up for Little Alters Everywhere!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"While the characters are not always likeable, the book is still engrossing. A tale of a family's trials and tribulations in smalltown Louisiana, this book is rich in Southern traditions and imagery. Wells is especially adept at sharing the perspectives of multiple characters as they cope with the challenges of daily life."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Alters Everywhere was a great way to get to know the characters of the Ya-Ya's more in depth. From Sidda locking herself in the bookmobile, to ViVi and Caro dancing it up at a local bar, this book from Rebecca Wells is one that you can read over and over again and always walk away with something new. A great book to curl up with on a rainy day."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"this is poorly written about a nasty dysfunctional drunk southern family. sometimes when you get a book you enjoy it so much you either don't want to stop reading at all or you want to read it slowly so you have more time with it. well, this does not fall into either category. save your money."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This book had me laughing and very sad all at once. I fell in love with Siddalee and her brothers and sisters. I felt compassion and pity towards her parents and can't wait till the next book comes out in March 2005. I would recommend this book to anyone. It isn't graphic just colorful of those times and rich with characters and emotion! I haven't read the first one but will now. I bet it is better than the movie, but isn't that the way it goes anyway?!?!? Add this one to your library you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"okay I read secrets of the ya ya sister hood first unknowing that it twas the second book in the series. I was VERY disappointed, I really didn't need a repeat of my childhood I mean jesus. I may seem a little cruel about this, but I just couldn't follow the stoey and even some parts didn't make sence to me at all. The characters were very generic, and I was at a loss when I began reading knowing that Siddalee Walker wasn't the main character of this novel too. It sadened me deeply, but I guess some books will do that. Hey If you read this Ms. Wells don't be angry with me, I'm just being honest about it. I thought the other book was much better."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Alters Everywhere is a well written and initially funny book. I was really excited when I started reading it and began recommending it to all my friends and coworkers. However, I have to tell you that it takes a somewhat unexpected dark tone on towards the end that sort of bummed me out after the humor incorporated into the first part of the story. I know a lot of people will disagree with me. For many I'm sure that the darker tones at the end of this novel made the story more appealing. However, for my tastes the book took the turn from day to night a bit too fast. I still recommend this book because it is really much better than a great deal of junk that's published. However, I don't think I'll go on to read the prequel, The Divine Secrets Of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood. (As if you care.)"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I think this book has to be read after Divine Secrets. It seems to put all the hardships the girls faced, into perspective. I'm glad I read Little Altars second and I look forward to further books by Rebecca Wells."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"After reading &quot;Divine Secrets&quot;, I was excited to read another of Wells' books. Unfortunately, this book falls short in many ways. The storyline is confusing and the characters are not developed in any redeeming way. I'll still give Wells another read when she decides to write another novel, but wouldn't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Having Read the Ya-Ya's, I was excited about reading the prequel -- learning more about the earlier years. But this book lacked the elegance of the Ya-Ya's. The strength of that book was what was not said. The failing of this book was in trying to explain every detail. I came away from this book hating Vivi-Darling for her abusive, alcoholic self. This book made my stomach turn. Do yourself a favor and read the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and skip this one -- or use it to line your trashcan!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read this book anticipating the enjoyment that I received when I read the &quot;Yahoo Yahoo Sisterhood.&quot;. It is written by the same author but has all the sadness of growing up in a childhood filled with alcholism &amp; child abuse with very little humor within. The &quot;Yahoo Yahoo Sisterhood&quot; I passed to everyone to read &amp; even bought as birthday presents! This book &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; when I finished I threw in the garbage &amp; told everyone do not bother reading."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"The delivery on the book was very fast and it was in great condition. I was pleased with the condition of the book because it was a gift to my daughter."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"With the complexities of the subject matter, there is no way you can get the full effect of this book when chapters like \\"Snuggling\\" are left out of the audio version of the book. While what portions of the book on CD are brilliantly written and read by the author, I wonder what the point of recording it was when the written version is so much better. It is like \\"reading\\" two different books."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"By the author of Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. Seems to be almost a pre-quel to the better known book. Short stories from the different characters from Little Shep, Sidda Lee, Lulu, Big Shep, even Chaney and his wife - the black crop worker and the maid who takes care of the children. I did not like or understand the purpose for the incest scenes, and felt they were out of place. Otherwise, it gives insight into the characters I got to know in Ya Ya."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Alters Everywhere shows the darker side of the \\"Ya-Yas,\\" demonstrating the consequences of frivolity and alcoholism, abuse, and racism. Characters that start out so fascinating and glamorous quickly devolve into a depressed and dysfunctional family. Wells successfully navigates many different voices, struggles, disappointments, horror, and forgiveness. Written with captivating southern charm she opens the the door to a nostalgic world that teeters on the edges of both bitter and sweet."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I am a little confused about how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong I thought that the book is good and has a closer look at the Walker family and of course Vivi Abbot Walker. While the Divine Secrets of the Ya-ya sisterhood is a book that shows the past of the indomitable Ya-Yas and the trail of forgiveness and love between Vivi and Sidda..Little Altars is darker and sad. There is a closer look at the Walker children and the hurt they have showed in their past and it explains the reason behind the hurt that Sidda and her siblings feel. However, the characters portrayed here do not resemble the others from The Divine Secrets and Ya-yas in Bloom. The sexual abuse Vivi inflicted on her children is not mentioned in the other two books and while I understand that it is unsettling it seems that this is something that the mother would never have done.I just feel that the Walker children could have forgiven the emotional and physical abuse of Vivi Walker but not the sexual. It seemed like it was swept under the rug or never even existed. This seems like a stand alone novel that has little basis on the Ya-ya series itself. It's a good book but not a \\"ya-ya\\" book."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I bought and read this book based on recommendation from a good and trusted friend. Ever since hearing about it 15 years ago, I had always thought it was a book for girls and women, and that the Divine Sisterhood movie was a chick flick. All that may be true, but I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Little Altars and marvel at its insight and humor. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This is a book with many of the same problems as Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, except it is even less entertaining. This bunch of disfunctional people who form ugly family units and are surrounded by co-dependant girlfriends ...see themselves as the most popular and beautiful in town. Beauty is only skin-deep and I think the talented author could give the Ya-Ya's: courage, compasssion, and sober them up. They all lived charmed lives as pampered house drones and celebrate every blissful summer with swimming, song, sun, and Scotch while their kids watch in shame! You can write better than this...I'd bet you a dollar. Please try again!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Luckily I read the DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA- YA SISTERHOOD first and loved it so bought LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE, which is a story set over 30 years.What a let down. It is good but no where near the level of DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA- YA SISTERHOOD I felt it was missing detail and I wanted more in it. I hoped it would have answered more questions about Sidda, Big Shep, Lulu and ViVi and others.Personaly skip this one go straight to DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD. What a read.!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"The companion to \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,\\" this story is told from the vantage of Sidda and her siblings. Growing up in 1960s Mississippi, the children suffered greatly at the hands of their mother Vivi, who simply could not accept the fall from beautiful, popular teenager to farmer's wife and mother of four stairstep children.Despite the underlying severity of the Walkers' childhood, the book - like \\"Divine Secrets\\" - is also hysterically funny. No matter what else happened, the kids did have some great times with the Ya-Yas, which helped shape the people they later became.If you aren't a big fan of flashbacks, this might not be the book for you. However, Wells seems to do a good job, moving seamlessly from past to present and back. I highly recommend giving it a try!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"\\"Buggy, Momma's mama, has got the meanest little lapdog you ever laid eyes on. One of those puny butt poodles that's nothing but bone and fluff.\\" Little Altars Everywhere is a hilarious read. Though the plot isn't what you'd call \\"funny\\", the author has a way of making you cry and laugh almost simultaneously. The story is about a family whose members are so different, that functioning as a \\"family\\" isn't easy. The book is a collection of stories, each told from a different family member's point of view. They range from heart throbbers and howlers to weepers and book throwers. The two main characters are Siddalee and Vivian. Siddalee is the eldest daughter who adores books and uses religion to escape her problems. Vivian is a wacko mother who's skills as a mother and wife are less than desirable, as she has sexual abused her eldest son, whips her children, and drinks and fights with her husband constantly.This story is an emotion roller coaster, but well worth the ride. The second part of the book is an eye opener as you get to witness how the events of the children's childhood affect their adulthood. The author, Rebecca Wells, has also written The Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which I also recommend."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I must say, the fictional people in this novel are ALIVE! I loved every last bit of LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE. It's not a typical story that moves along in a linear, chronological fashion. Instead the book paints individual portraits that make up a bigger picture of a story when you put them all together.Despite the serious nature of the content, this is a fun, delicious read... the kind where the well-selected words are just so savoury it's easy to finish in one sitting. It's that delightful."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I can tell you that the writer Rebecca Wells is very talented.This is a woman who knows how to write.But I found this bookvery disturbing.The incest part was very painful to read.I willnot be rereading this book any time soon."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Like many of you, I read Divine Secrets before Little Altars. First, let me say Rebecca Wells is one of the finest authors I've ever read...let that be a guide, whatever order you choose. It may be helpful to use Little Altars as a &quot;readers guide&quot; to Divine Secrets, as it allows you to have a deeper understanding of the dysfunctional Walker family. Personally, I'd recommend reading Little Altars first, get to know the characters...and then move on to Divine Secrets, the way Wells intended."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"After reading and loving &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,&quot; I have to say I was very disappointed with this book. Wells' second book was much, MUCH better, because you get to see the characters at their best as well as their worst, which is all I felt like I saw in &quot;Little Altars Everywhere.&quot; Although parts of this book are really moving and strongly drawn, many parts are slow or unconvincing, and the frequent changes of viewpoint are distracting. Also, you don't get to know each character well enough to really feel for them going through their painful experiences, especially since most of them don't give you any reasons to care, any hint of anything beyond self-involvement and self-pity."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This was the first in the \\"Ya-Ya\\" series. We flash back and forth from the 60's to the 90's and learn of the Walker family through the eyes of the parents, Shep and Vivienne and their kids, Sidalee, Little Shep, Lulu and Baylor as well as their maid Willetta and her husband Chaney. All the adventure, dysfunction, local color, booziness and general mayhem is conveyed little by little, through memory or through present-day experience and we also learn of the Ya-Ya's - the girls Vivienne grew-up with and is still close to.I must admit that I don't have a good memory of the movie. That could be a good thing because I loved the book - from the style of one chapter in a given person's voice to the the content of each chapter. You couldn't hate Vivi, but despised what she did to the kids. You pitied Shep, but wanted him to rescue the kids. All were believable, complex and well0developed, worthy of the sequel."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I thought Little Altars Everywhere was very well written. Not like anything else i have read before. I enjoyed reading every minute of it. I wanted to learn more about the Walker Family. Each page was full of interesting comments or stories."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I wish that I had read this before its sequel, &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.&quot; With the background on the life of Siddalee Walker and her siblings offered in this fecund tapestry of family dysfunction, I have a much better understanding of Sidda's &quot;whining.&quot;This is a disturbing tale of a prominent family in small-town Louisiana and the hidden rot at its core. Viviane Abbott Walker is a self-centered, immature woman who would have done better to collect dolls than have living, breathing children to annihilate. The best answer the narcissistic Vivi can come up with to the everyday problems of life is to drown them in alcohol. Under its influence, she systematically physically abuses and emotionally batters her children, indelibly damaging them for life. Her weak husband's solution to the domestic battlefield is to flee to his hunting camp for days on end and drink himself into oblivion. This bittersweet novel was excruciatingly painful to read, but I wouldn't have missed it for the world.There were divinely funny moments interspersed with heartbreaking passages that make one so angry you forget that this is fiction. I suspect that many of us can identify with key issues of this profoundly touching novel. I know I did. This is one of those rare jewels whose lessons to live by can change your life."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Richer, darker and deeper than the second book or the movie, this book truly is a 'must' read if you want to understand the Walker family, especially the mystery who is Viviane Abbot Walker.Starting as a simple short story (&quot;Looking for My Mules,&quot; with Shep, Viviane and an old man lost on their farm), Rebecca Wells' tales of growing up in Louisiana in a less than perfect home grew first into Little Altars Everywhere, then into the Divine Secrets book and movie. Each chapter contains a well crafted short story, told from the viewpoint of different characters. Each chapter offers a title with the name of the narrator and year they are talking in. In some cases, the titles are enough to draw you in (Catfish Dreams; E-Z Boy War; The Princess of Gimmee.)From the 60's to the 90's, each story offers a simple, but meaningful slice of the entire Walker family's story. Some are told in the present, some are memories of what happened long ago. The chapters weave together to give you a wider view of what was going on from different perspectives.As you read, you'll find yourself piecing together the story of Sidalee, her siblings, her mother Vivi and father Shep, as well as Willetta and Chaney, the black couple who were hired help, and who have an outside view of the family.Don't stop reading with this book, or you'll miss a view of the whole person -- doting mother, child abuser, unloved child, shattered schoolgirl, broken hearted, passionate lover, distant wife and mother as well as a view of Shep as a fallible human being and how he contributed to Vivi's 'condition' and the affect it had on their children.A treasure of a book, you may find it more unsettling than the movie or the second book. Excellent writing, it will leave you wanting to know more (unless you've already read the second book!)"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; a couple of years ago and fell in love with it. When I found out there was a book that came before of the same characters I had to read it. The book was good and a must-read for anyone that reads the Ya-Ya's. BUT be prepared. It's definitely a more disturbing picture of Vivi. While we get a better look into Big Shep's head (Sidda's father) and learn that his compassion runs deeper than Vivi's but he just either doesn't know how to show it or feels there'd be no point to it anyway. Vivi's dark side is much more than I'd suspected having read the second book first. Her alcoholism is plain as day in Altars whereas in the Ya-Ya's she just seems to be a social drinker. (Same goes for Big Shep) And you can see more clearly the emotional scars all of her children carry and how they truly feel about their mother. This book left behind some disturbing images in my head and I wish that I had been left with the ones I garnered from reading the Ya-Ya's. One's where Vivi's motherhood crimes did not seem so vicious and contemptable."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I loved &quot;Ya Ya&quot; so much, I immediately went out to find this novel and read it. Equally as brilliantly written and captivating it is well worth the read. The only thing I found was that it changed my view of the characters in a way that is kind of upsetting. With &quot;Ya Ya&quot;, I felt for the mother, I felt her life and struggles damaged her and made her the way she was, but that deep down she was a good mother and a loving mother that did her best with what she had emotionally. In &quot;Little Alters&quot; I had no love left for her character, not even a lot of like. She did inexcusable things that are only ever so slightly alluded to in &quot;Ya Ya&quot;, and it changes your view.This book is fantastic, but, if you have fallen in love with the Ya Ya's as you percieve them in &quot;Ya Ya&quot;, I reccomend NOT reading this book. I know that sounds strange, but, it's impossible to respect them the same way, to wish that you and your girlfriends will be them someday etc., when you read &quot;Little Alters&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Every now and then a book comes along that just grabs you by the emotions and won't let go. I read Divine Secrets first and then rushed out to buy Little Altars, and although the writing style is quite different, each book has amazing strengths of its own.Little Altars is a short book (the trade paperback is only about 224 pages), but it packs a big punch. Each chapter is told by one of the characters in a reminiscent style. I really liked that the male characters are more fleshed out here. Wells lets us in on the inner workings of Shep, Little Shep, Baylor, and Chaney; this is an aspect that really isn't present in the female-centric Divine Secrets.These stories are fantastic! It's been quite a while since I laughed and sobbed so often while reading the same book. &quot;Cruelty to Animals&quot; had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe! &quot;Snuggling&quot; and &quot;E-Z Boy War&quot; were two stories that simply made my heart ache. Wells is wonderful at creating characters that stand on ther own; she gives each one a unique voice and then simply allows the story to tell itself. The writing is simple but powerful, and all of these &quot;little&quot; stories combine to create a vivid picture of this Louisiana community. In Little Altars, we really get to see the characters for who they are; this isn't so much one character trying to figure out her mother, her family, and her own place in all of it. This is more of a combination of stories to show that every family has so much more meaning underneath its outward appearance. Be prepared to be shocked by some of the more horrific things you learn about Vivi in this book. And if Willetta's chapter doesn't shake you to the core, then this type of story-telling might not be for you!Little Altars is a bit darker than Divine Secrets, but it is just as enjoyable. It's an emotional roller-coaster, and I'm glad I took the ride!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"As a guy, I was fully prepared to dislike what I thought was an emotional chick book written by an egotistical wannabe actress. After all, I panned that fatuous bimbo Candace Bushnell in my review of \\"Four Blondes.\\" I even gave One Star to Macho Super Author Robert Ludlum, although I felt badly when the big guy died just after my review was posted. This is all my way of saying that I don't throw around these Amazon Five Stars lightlyWell, let me tell you, \\"Little Altars Everywhere\\" is outstanding. Author Rebecca Wells gives gripping and believable voices to each of the six members of the dysfunctional Walker clan and to their black employees (read \\"slaves\\"), Chaney and Willetta Lloyd. Each of the 17 chapters is told first hand by one of these eight characters. The first half of the interconnected vignettes are set in the 1960s; the rest in the early 1990s.As an actor/playwright, Wells is well versed at stepping inside her characters and in getting each person's dialect and emotions just right, even across the book's 30 year span. Southern speech is mimicked perfectly without being overbearing or hard to understand, and the emotional descriptions and scenes are touching and effective without being maudlin. Just when I think Wells is about to go too far with one of her characters or scenes, she stops with exquisite timing. It's almost as if Rebecca Wells has multiple personalities herself.Wells writes about what she knows and describes her native Louisiana in convincing style. We're oppressed by the heat of the low country; we hear mosquitoes buzzing, radios blaring and air conditioners whirring; we see big old cars and pickup trucks speeding along dusty roads. We smell the good earth and the crops. We touch the Walker kids in their moments of supreme happiness and abject sadness and we can practically taste the alcohol swilled by Viviane and Shep Walker and their friends. We feel their hangovers. And, of course, the massive dysfunction of the Walker family attacks all our senses. All this from the printed page...The author deals with sensitive sexual topics with discretion and taste. Wells leaves much to the theatre of the mind, which is a hallmark of the mature writer that she is. You want graphic details? Wait for the TV movie, which would likely miss the humor and comedy that Wells spreads throughout her wonderful book. I can assure you that you'll keep a closer eye on your kids after reading about the kleptomaniac Lulu and her five-fingered discounts. Wells sprinkles hilarious little zingers and social comments everywhere, and is good at time-locking her situations with references to music, literature and historical events of the period. You'll laugh and smile throughout this book. But you'll also purse your lips, clench your teeth and swear at Viviane for the destruction and havoc she wreaks. As Tolstoy said at the beginning of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, \\"All happy families are the same; all unhappy ones are unique unto themselves.\\" You'll understand this reference when you read \\"Little Altars.\\"Viviane Walker is a vile excuse for a mother, wife and human being. If she were a dog, she'd be taken out behind the barn and shot. As it is, she's encouraged by her ridiculous Ya-Ya friends and tolerated by her cowardly husband and cowering children and by a Southern culture that gives full rein to her preposterous behavior. Of course, Viviane does show occasional signs of compassion towards her husband and children, just as Hitler did toward Eva Braun. At least Hitler shot himself.Wells left the door wide open in \\"Little Altars\\" for her sequel, \\"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,\\" which I'm now reading. You see that review soon. Many read these books out of sequence, since \\"Divine Secrets\\" has gotten more recognition than \\"Little Altars.\\" It doesn't matter, since \\"Little Altars\\" can be a revealing flashback if you read the sequel first. Either way, don't miss these two gems! They are both insightful commentaries into a complex family and into a way of life that is fortunately alien to most of us."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Parts of this book made me breathless with its heart-breaking beauty. Parts made me laugh out loud. Parts have taken up their places in my mind and won't go away.Much of the content of this book is difficult, although it ultimately is about survival. Alcoholism, abuse, casual racism.Although many have called this book a novel, it is more a collection of related short stories told in various voices, most of which seem very authentic and real.Like many people, I read the 2nd book &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; first.

I found &quot;Alters&quot; to be much more of a downer, going from how mother Vivi, a raging alcoholic, physically abuses, sexually abuses, and verbally abuses her four Southern children.However I was still very impressed at the author's ability to narrate from a childs point of view. With such innocence, and raw humor, you almost forget it wasn't Lulu, Sidda, Baylor, or Little Shep who wrote the chapter.The author weaved in with the tragic reality of how Vivi is traumatizing her children with hysterical, and twisted humor: such as the ugly dogs 'babies', and so on.This is definetly a good book, but I definetly consider &quot;Ya Ya&quot; a reward to read after this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Ms. Wells introduces us to the Walker family and various other players in the small town of Thornton, Mississippi. This book did not take me through the emotions that her second book The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood did. I couldn't wait to read this book and was somewhat dissappointed in the less than captivating story. I gained tidbits of information about characters I already knew and that helped me enjoy this book a bit. Ms. Wells has the gift to create wonderful characters and make them real to life. Every emotion that the characters feel is there for you to see and feel. Personally I missed the refreshing sense of humor that the second book displayed. I am glad that I read the book but could not say it keep me enthralled like this author's other work. Ms. Wells please give us more about this interesting group of lost souls but please remember that humor is often nature's balm to a bad situation."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I read Divine Secrets a few months ago and absolutely loved it. It was one of the best books I've ever read. Little Altars Everywhere was a book I began with much anticipation and did not let me down. It amazes me how Wells makes the reader hate and love characters at the same time. This book gives more background on the children and is one of those books you devour in 2 or 3 days time. I finished the book feeling sad, feeling happy and feeling that my life may not be perfect, but it was blessed to not have a mother like Vivi. The Ya-Ya series are some of the best written literature I have ever read. I recommend it without reservation, to female readers aged 18-45."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"This story about dysfunctional Southern families seemed to get to the real heart of the characters.

She allows the reader to part the curtains and have a peak at other peoples lives and their unique lifestyles. The chapters are written by different family members and friends allowing for an objective and subjective look at their experiences, both dark and brooding and some uplifting and fun, very reminiscent of the 60's . The control of a parent over their children, no matter their age, is quite disturbing and powerful. Overall the book was a good read and got better towards the end. Spanning over 30 years, this story is rich in tone and mood and takes a special writing talent to produce a saga that you feel can go on indefinitly."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"To say I loved this book may be misleading. In many ways, I felt manipulated by it. The first half of the book illustrates an off-the-wall, although not entirely disfunctional, family.

It isn't until the second half that the reader learns the awful secrets of the family and, because the characters are so powerfully drawn, is deeply affected by each character's childhood."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I am not someone who only enjoys a book if it is about a functional and happy family; I loved ANGELA'S ASHES. But something about LITTLE ALTARS made me a little sick. I didn't care about any of the characters because they were so awful. From the first page to the last, I found nothing compelling about this book, only characters who are smug about their skewed world.

Their life is all twistedup. There are four kids, and all of them have a bad example of life. This is shown in many ways.One way is both of their parents drink. They drink often and that makes them not able to realize what they're doing totheir kids. For instance in the book the mom is mad at the dad. So the family drives of in the middle of the night.They go to friends' houses and wake them up. Their mom thinks its funny but the people they are waking up don't.Another time Willetta the maid was watching the kids. The mother came home from a party andWilletta left. After she left the mother was whipping them with a belt. Willetta called their grandmother to pick them upand take them to her house.The Kids names are Siddale, Little Shep, Lulu, and Baylor. Siddale starts off the story introducing herfamily and her life in her house. She writes about how her mother embarrasses her. It can be Girl Scouts to justdriving in the car. In the end of the story when the kids are all grown up they realize that their parents couldn't helpthem through anything. Willetta and Chaney her husband were more parents than their real ones.I feel that Siddalee was one of the most significant characters. She talked most in the novel. She hadstrong feelings. She is the one while reading this book most people feel sorry for. She was the oldest child and shewitnessed most of the conflicts between her parents. She realized she was not growing up in an average household.When she visited friends her home life was not like her friends. It was much different. At her friends houses therewere more family dinners and less arguing among the adults. These are just some examples.Yes, I would recommend this book. Little Altars is an interesting book and well written. However, youneed to keep track of who is talking in each chapter. While reading this book one can learn the importance of being ina family that everyone gets along with. He reader would evaluate its own family and try to make adjustments so theirlife is not as complicated and dysfunctional. Another reason I would recommend this book is because I enjoyedreading about the life of others."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Rebecca Wells'use of language...change in character was extraordinary...her story though extremely sad, showed such humor and made it all just a pleasure to read...Can't wait for Ms. West to write more...."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Really loved Divine Secrets and was so excited to sit down and read Little Altars.

I read it cover to cover in one day and enjoyed it. I can understand why many of those who have written reviews here before me are upset over Vivi's character as portrayed in &quot;Little Altars,&quot; but that is no reason to not like the book. Perhaps Vivi's wickedness makes her the more realistic as Wells shows what a life of heavy drinking can do to a person. I did not find the switching of narrators confusing from chapter to chapter. It was interesting to read their points of view. Wells does a fine job of giving them separate &quot;voices.&quot; As I grew up in the 60's, raised Catholic, I could identify with the references to the absurdities of &quot;Holy Mother Church&quot; and how it planted bad mind trips on both Vivi and Siddie. I also enjoyed learning about southern farming and how it changed in just a few years, and could see why so many farmers, everywhere, had very little choice but to sell out and allow the Wal-Marts, Taco Bells, etc. to buy up their land and ruin the beauty of the country. Wells also gives us a good idea of what it was like to be on the draft board (through the eyes of Big Shep) and what a terrible waste the Viet Nam war was.There is a lot packed into this short novel. It is well written and easily read. Vivi and Big Shep stay together and toward the end they make comment on how quickly life passes by. This is one of this book's themes: life is short."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"My sister-in-law gave me this book, and I immediately began trying to identify the people and places of my hometown in Louisiana. Since I grew up in about the same time period as the setting of the novel, it wasn't difficult to begin identifying the characters. Ms. Wells should be very careful about revealing present day &quot;real life&quot; characters."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I'm sure to be in the minority in considering this book to be highly over rated. I had no sympathy for the problems of its characters, nor did I find it to be worthy in any way of the best seller status it has attained.

This is a well done abridgement, done in a short story format from the viewpoint of different characters, and was a delightful escape into another time and place. Even the Two Teen Terrorists enjoyed the story about Miss Pepe the poodle. If you grew up in the south with a crazy mama, you will need to listen to this story and or read the book. And the ya-ya summers at spring creek will bring out the child in just about anybody. Mules really moved my middle-aged heart. Yes, there is a dark side to this collection - but love and hope are laced through - along with that miracle drug: a sense of humor. Now I've got to go out and buy the book, to see what I missed in the abridgement."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Alter Everywhere shows serious potential in her first novel. The story can't decide if it wants to be funny or sad, like life, and we can't decide if the characters are good or bad, like life! There are many inconsistancies in the novel that have to do with facts and dominant personality: Is Teensy a Ya Ya or what? This a good example of a book who takes over the author, a book that's not well thought out or well set up. This author, however, will get better with time, she shows great potential, if she just will stop on occasion, and remind herself of the &quot;purpose&quot; of her novel, even if the purpose is that it has no purpose, which I doubt is true, and tie it together."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"I imagine, that since I jumped on the Ya-Ya bandwagon a little late, I am one of the minority of people that read this book before devine secrets. It was a different style of writing, small fragmented short stories from each characters point of view, little morsals of a rich expirience that makes you want to know more. Welles makes each character so different, so unique, funny, real, and touching, and it really is a fine collection of stories, if a little dark and akin to something one would discover in family therapy.

Then I read Little Alters and really really liked it. Don't bother with the Sisterhood and go straight to Little Alters."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Little Alters Everywhere by Rebecca Wells is a witty and tragic novel. The characters, Sidda, Shep, Little Shep, Viva, Willetta, and the others are each such profound characters with such diverse and distinct personalities. Wells begins the novel with a special style of humor that quickly turns to sadness. The reality of this southern dysfunctional family quickly overruns the humor at the beginning of the novel. She shocks the reader as she portrays, the mother Vivi, as an alcoholic and as a child molester. The father, Big Shep, is not man enough to stand up to his wife so he often just leaves the family to stay at his hunting camp. The problems the children face are heartbreaking. The black hired hands, Willetta and Chaney, are probably the most stable adults in the lives of the children. I found the book to be enjoyable but it left me with uneasy feelings as well. I'm anxious to read the sequel, The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, in hopes of finding out what led Vivi and Big Shep to their evil ways."},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"Reading &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood&quot; before reading &quot;Little Altars Everywhere&quot; is like sitting down to dinner and eating the chocolate mousse before the filet mignon. &quot;Divine Secrets&quot; is a sweet read, but &quot;Little Altars&quot; provides the meat for this literary feast. Understanding the characters' beginnings and their motivations results in a very savory read. You'll laugh, cry, have your own values challenged, and care very deeply about the characters. You'll finish the book looking forward to the next course--and &quot;The Divine Secrets&quot; won't disappoint you either. Bon Appetit!"},{"Title":"Little Altars Everywhere","review":"What more can be said of the Ya-Ya's? Read it first (before Little Altars), then pick up The Persian Pickle Club by Sandra Dallas.

I love the way that each character narrates a chapter in the first half during the 1960s and then in the second half during the 1990s. This approach perfectly captures what it is like to view the world as a child, and then look back on things as an adult and realize that they were not always as they seemed. I think that the writing is marvelous and that the antics of the characters are humorous, sad, inspiring, and abhorrent all at once. I did not like the sequel (Divine Secrets...) as well. If you are a woman or have childhood issues with your parents that you are dealing with, I think you will relate to this wonderful narrative.

The brothers Grimm have nothing on the magnificent Miss Beckwith, who tells this Cinderella story in a most believable way.If you are not familiar with Miss Beckwith's tales of the life in the Hebrides, I would highly recommend tracking down THE HILLS IS LONELY, THE SEA FOR BREAKFAST and THE LOUD HALO.

More than a mere supplement to Liddell and Scott, this work has as primary object the interpretation of the theological and ecclesiastical vocabulary of the Greek Christian authors from Clement of Rome to Theodore of Studium. These limits are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. They have been drawn with the object of confining the Lexicon, as far as possible, to the formative period of the history of Christian thought and institutions, beginning in the sub-apostolic age (but excluding any works of that period which are contained in the canon of the New Testament) and embracing the whole era of the Creeds, the Councils down to the Second Council of Nicaea, and the great doctrinal disputes down to the Iconoclastic Controversy.All words illustrating the development of Christian thought and institutions have been treated as fully as possible, with extensive citations of the more important relevant passages.A secondary object of the Lexicon is to give information about all words whether of any theological importance or not, which aroused by these writers but not included in Liddell Scott-Jones. A very large number of such words are listed here, distinguished in each case by an asterisk.The relation of this work to Liddell Scott- Jones demands special attention. No word, which is well attested in the latter and has no particular interest for the reader of the Fathers, is included in this book. The absence of a word must on no account be understood as an indication that the patristic authors do not use it. In order, too, to make more space available for articles of major interest, the common meanings of any word, already noted by Liddell Scott-Jones, are not repeated here unless they are of significance for patristic study. Thus a common word to which Liddell Scott-Jones devote a long article may appear in this Lexicon with only one, and that an unusual, meaning. The user of this work is, in fact, assumed to have Liddell and Scott by its side. So, we strongly recommend that both dictionaries should be bought in order to succeed in the study of Patristic."},{"Title":"A Patristic Greek Lexicon","review":"I've been told that Lampe is THE lexicon to have if you're doing work with Christian Church Fathers. It doesn't necessarily have every word you'd need, but if used with the unabridged Lidell &amp; Scott, you should be able to translate most patristic writings. If you have ability in Latin, the old Stephanus lexicon (about 10 times the size of Lampe) is helpful. I wouldn't suggest buying that one though, unless you happen to BE a library."},{"Title":"A Patristic Greek Lexicon","review":"As long as you are working with the more widely read fathers, this lexicon is very useful (when used with Liddell-Scott). When, however, you want to read certain passages from Epiphanius or Clement of Alexandria or certain other authors, Lampe is very incomplete, often listing only the verbal form of a word you found as a noun or the feminine form or no form at all for the particular word for which you are looking. The definitions it lists are incomplete, often you will have to infer a definition from the semantic domain indicated by the lexicon and the context of the passage. Further, the English is archaic and thus difficult to understand. Really, in most cases, Liddell-Scott is sufficient with occasional trips to the library to look in Lampe (though, I dare say you will not always find help there) and online access to the Perseus Project or, even better, the TLG."},{"Title":"A Patristic Greek Lexicon","review":"I got this from amazon brand new when the price was down to 228 shipped.

Constance Reid, who also wrote a biography of Hilbert's student Courant, initially ran into some resistance from Hilbert's associates when she started work on this book. Max Born was not keen on the idea of a woman, who was neither German nor a mathematician, writing a study of Hilbert's life. Born was enthusiastic about the final product, however, and it has become a classic.Hilbert took over from Poincare the title of the most famous mathematician in the world. His mathematical achievements are numerous and varied; Reid does a good job of providing an overview of the impact Hilbert had on many different fields, and of his style; his strengths and weaknesses. There is a good deal of coverage of the famous twenty-three Hilbert problems, presented to the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900, including a large section of the talk Hilbert gave.Reid paints a vivid picture of the mathematical circle at Gottingen, a luminous collection of talents. Minkowski and Hilbert were close friends; Klein was the director of the institute there; Emmy Noether was there; Hurwitz; Zermelo; Landau; the list is long and impressive. It's all the more sad to read about the way the Institute was destroyed by the Nazis in the name of racial purity. Almost without exception the leading mathematicians emigrated, one by one, to America. Hilbert, who had retired in 1930 (retirement at age 68 was mandatory) was forced to watch as the work of decades was dismantled. The last years, of age, fading memory and the privations of war, are mercifully given less than a dozen pages.Hilbert's life leads from the great days of the mid-nineteenth century to the Nazis and the atomic bomb.

The book is a source of information on the roots of some developments of science which are, nowadays, fundamental to courses in areas of mathematics, physics and engineering (such as calculus of variations, integral equations, foundations of mathematics and mathematical physics). As informative and well written as &quot;Courant&quot;, by the same author."},{"Title":"Hilbert","review":"Very well written. Gives a great feel for who Hilbert was as a person. It also does a good job of placing his achievments amoung the other mathematians of his time. I have attempted reading a few biography's of other mathematicians that focus on the math and not the person. They are almost unreadable. This book does not make this mistake. I have just bought &quot;Foundations of Geometry&quot; because of this book. I highly recommend it. PS - 4 stars is as high a rating as I give. I like having room to move for the truely fantastic."},{"Title":"Hilbert","review":"i almost cried when i got up to the death of minkowski, hilbert's closest friend and a great mathematician in his own right. such is the completely engaging power of constance reid's biography of hilbert. reid did an amazing job integrating the details of professor hilbert's life with the german zeitgeist, all the while providing some exposition of the mathematics for a general audience.as a student and teacher of mathematics, i went into this book expecting to learn more about one of my heroes, the legendary david hilbert, perhaps best known to most for the famous twenty-three hilbert problems. hilbert did research in an impressive number of areas within mathematics, as well as branched out to physics and the philosophy of mathematics. hilbert's breadth and depth is what gave him the right to influence the course of twentieth century mathematics through the hilbert problems. suffice it to say, hilbert is very important in the mathematical community and i was more than a bit wide-eyed even before reading page one of reid's biography. after turning the last page, i feel like i understand more of the man actually standing on the well-deserved pedestal. my respect for hilbert has only grown knowing of his human flaws and what he has accomplished in spite of them.it should be made explicit that this book is not just for math nerds. any intelligent reader with any interest in mathematics should be able to enjoy and benefit from reading reid's biography. perhaps you've heard of hilbert or the hilbert problems from some newspaper article somewhere and you wondered how mathematicians really lived. if so, that one spark of interest will be rewarded by reid's thorough biography.of particular interest to me was the other side of the professorial life: teaching. research is the most important part of a mathematician's life, but i'm glad that reid even goes into details on hilbert's teaching style. apparently, hilbert didn't sufficiently prepare for lectures and would often get confused while teaching, needing the help of his assistants to get out of trouble. these mishaps were because of hilbert's strong desire to offer the students the most important points of the lessons, and the details would sometimes suffer because of this emphasis. hilbert would also repeat things as much as five times on purpose in order to get students to remember because he didn't have confidence in their abilities. half of his lecture time would also be spent reviewing the material from the previous lecture, again in order to really ingrain the material in the students' minds. i found these pedagogical details quite fascinating.outside of hilbert's life, reid does a fantastic job transporting the reader to germany. the germans have a rich history and complex culture, but many folks can only think of the \\"n\\" word when it comes to germany. it's a pet peeve of mine that a large number of people cannot distinguish between \\"nazi\\" and \\"german.\\" at g&ouml;ttingen university, mathematicians of all backgrounds, and even from different countries, were able to come together and work on mathematics under the leadership of david hilbert. g&ouml;ttingen was the epicenter of mathematical thought and it was gutted and spiritually destroyed by the nazis in their misguided quest for racial purity. hilbert himself was anti-nazi and it must've torn his heart apart watching the math department suffer such a great downfall because of nazi policies. this human story of political madness turning its sword on the purist of realms should hopefully dispel some negative german stereotypes. it is hoped that the reader will appreciate the tragedy of german identity a little more afterward.those looking for a similar style of biography meshed with some explanations of higher mathematics for a non-specialized audience should also check out benjamin yandell's \\"the honors class: hilbert's problems and their solvers.\\" yandell covers the hilbert problems in more depth than they are in reid's book. finally, reid also wrote \\"courant,\\" a biography of one of hilbert's students. \\"courant\\" is regarded as the sequel to \\"hilbert\\" and should be read to complete the story. all three of these books are excellent and will immeasurably enrich the curious reader."},{"Title":"Hilbert","review":"David Hilbert was arguably one of the greatest mathematiciansever!.

In this book (chapter VI: Changes) I learn from Reid the simple yet revealing explanation of 'Ideals' being born out of conflict of 'Algebraic Number Field' with the 'Fundamental Law of Arithmetics', and Kummer's Ideal Number, Kronecker and Dedekind's complicated 'Ideal Primes', and finaly David Hilbert's great contribution in the 'Ideal Primes' theory."},{"Title":"Hilbert","review":"David Hilbert lived from 1862 to 1943.

With gentleness and a compassionate heart, she navigates the reader through a study / discussion that freely utilizes Scripture verses to highlight the overall theme of grace. White relies heavily on the \\"Enneagram\\" model pioneered by Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson to illustrate the idea that there is a \\"real\\" person within each one of us, and that this is the true person God intends us to be. The basic fear of your particular personality type, as well as unmet needs from childhood, etc., the book says, often get in the way of your being your \\"true\\" self.A seminary graduate who also holds a master's degree in social work, White shares a lot of her own personal experiences to lend credence and weight to the concepts she focuses on. Her foundation for this book is Biblical (for instance, she uses as a central point the illustration of the \\"wilderness\\" experience of the children of Israel to parallel our own life trials), and her intention very much seems to be to lead the reader on a path toward freedom in Christ, through the usage of the practical tools and concepts she offers."},{"Title":"Who Can Ride the Dragon?: An Exploration of the Cultural Roots of Traditional Chinese Medicine","review":"The book is extremely courteous in guiding the reader through the basic structure of that enormously complicated thing called Chinese culture. The first part will be particularly helpful to those who do not know the Chinese language in the way it shapes and articulate thought for those who think in Chinese. The entire cosmology upon which medical theories and perceptions have been formulated is laid out as a reflection of the mirror (language) that bears the warpature to best suit the Chinese language. The first part ably shows how the fact that Chinese does not have temporal tenses in its grammar affects the shaping of premises with regard to the body and medicine in Chinese worldview. Food and Chinese cooking are also introduced as important vehicles that have carried Chinese medicine through its path of evolution. The latter part of the book deals with more theoretical concepts, including philosophy, and how they gave rise to and founded certain clinical practices. The book is an organic introduction to a science that is founded and corrected on the lived experience of thousands of cases observed over two thousand years."},{"Title":"Who Can Ride the Dragon?: An Exploration of the Cultural Roots of Traditional Chinese Medicine","review":"If you're like me, you are inherently attracted to Chinese medicine and suspect that it runs a lot deeper than many books (or current tv coverage, etc) let on. They don't seem to have the time to get into the real meat and science of the MEANING behind traditional Chinese medicine. ...Based upon the recommendation of a friend, I read this book and suddenly it all clicked. I feel like I have a MUCH bigger basis for true understanding, and that I can go forward in terms of both further reading AND application in my own practice. I not only &quot;get&quot; this stuff, but I have a newfound respect for where it comes from. I suspect that to be successful in the practice of Chinese medicine, one should really grasp and honor the meaning in it -- which all too many acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine practitioners seem to ignore.

For me, it created a lot of connections and filled in many holes in my learning. As a student of TCM, general statements are often made about how a particular theory is related to an aspect of religion or culture, but you really don't fully grasp what is meant by those statements.

Interspersed with charming antidotes, the puts Chinese medicine in the context of its natural whole. It is not separate from any aspect of the culture, on its most fundamental level it is the culture. By looking at Chinese medicine through a linguistic perspective one can see the root of the thought process that created this beautiful method of reharmonizing one with their environment. The art of the medicine grew from a succinct philosophy of duality and this book pin points many accessible examples of its origination. I especially like the last chapter which includes is a list of 83 key terms in Chinese medicine as well as superb explanations and historic quotes.

The most amazing thing I found was midway through the book when the midwife herself miscarries a child and her reaction to this loss of a child she never even expected to have was touching.As a nurse myself that loved labor and delivery the most as a student, I found the stories realistic, especially the comparison to a hospital birth intertwined with a home birth story from the day before. I felt almost every pang she did for the hospitalized mother as that was mostly my story of giving birth, while what I really wanted was what she had with her home deliveries.Her love of her Amish families, since as a midwife she ministered to more than just the mother and baby, was touching and we got a significant look into the life of the Amish. I found this BCE copy at a sale and was so glad I stuffed it into my bag as this one kept me up way past my bedtime reading as it was so interesting.

There was also some good insight into the hospital birth system.However, I was left a bit disappointed because I didn't feel the book was well-written in general. The story was often jerky and disjointed. To offer one example, when Penny went to Scotland for her nurse midwifery training, I wasn't quite sure what was going on. Wasn't she American? Why did she go all the way to Scotland? What, what? Some events just felt... random and not properly introduced.There were also quite a few lulls in the story; about 3/4 of the way through, I got bored and started skimming. I was expecting more birth stories, but there weren't too many.I would recommend checking this out from the library.

Penny Armstrong, a Certified Nurse-Midwife during the 1980s, takes readers into lives of the Amish in the Pennsylvania Dutch country of Lancaster. First trained in a hospital in Glasgow in the 1960s, Armstrong explains how her perspective of the birthing process radically changed over the course of her career. Armstrong describes her personal transition from student nurse midwife to a Certified Nurse-Midwife opening her own home birth practice during a time when home births and midwives were politically controversial. Short vignettes illuminate the ways of the Amish, including their beliefs, their education, and their birthing experiences. Through Armstrong's mournful experiences, celebrations, and everyday life in the Amish community, the reader becomes entangled in the Amish culture. From high school students to mothers-to-be, this book is a great read for those captivated by the Amish and a midwife's personal journey."},{"Title":"A Midwife's Story","review":"This beautifully written book takes us behind the scenes for an insider's look at day to day Amish life. Midwife Penny Armstrong's moving vignettes let us see the real Amish way of life. This isn't the usual, often inaccurate, overview of Amish life that's sold to tourists. It's also not a scholarly work. This book is written in a James Herriotesque style that enables us to really know and appreciate the Amish.The book starts off with Penny's training at a Glasgow hospital that cared more for procedure than it did for its patients. Then we're off to Philadelphia to a more patient friendly hospital where Penny got her American certification. Finally, we reach Amish country. The minute Penny sees the picturesque landscape and feels the tranquillity of the slow paced life she knows this is the place for her.The Amish take to Penny because she respects and admires them. She doesn't just deliver their babies, she becomes their friend. She laughs with them and cries with them. She prays with them and plays with them. She celebrates with them and mourns with them. She's invited to their homes for canning frolics. Her husband, Richard, helps them fill their silos by driving a team of mules. They become part of the community.The reader is treated to an intimate look at the Amish. We're literally in their bedrooms! We see the affectionate bond between husbands &amp; wives. We see their staunch faith exhibited by a young wife, 8 months pregnant, who loses her husband in an accident. We see the community rally around a young couple that needs assistance. We also see the love parents have for a sick, helpless child. I can't say more. I don't want to spoil things.This book is sensitive, entertaining and informative. It is a must read for anyone fascinated by the Amish."},{"Title":"A Midwife's Story","review":"Imagine studying midwifery in Scotland, then going among the Amish of Pennsylvania to practice your trade. That's what Armstrong did and her stories about her adventures are riveting. She writes with charm and sensitivity of the joys and pains of birthing, living, dying among the quiet and unassuming ways of a community of simple, God-fearing folk who come to return and appreciate her love and care.As she strives to be accepted by local doctors and the local hospital she struggles with her own doubts about institutional births as opposed to home ones.A moving, lovely and loving book that respects and cherishes a people and a way of life, A MIDWIFE'S STORY will make you laugh and cry. Best of all, you can find a new understanding and respect for America's Pennsylvania Dutch Amish if you look for it. I do hope you don't miss this one."},{"Title":"A Midwife's Story","review":"More than any other written account a midewife's story brings the world of a modern midwife to life with all the conflicting feelings, time demands and conflicts. The treatment of the Amish is tasteful and those trashing her for being non-critial have a personal bone to pick that has nothing to do with this book.As a personal friend of a midwife who serves the Amish as an English and is accepted as was the author, I can affirm they see both the good and the bad in that society just as it exists in every society.Midwives have had to learn to listen and not judge empowering all women to make their own choices. All of us should do this and it applies even when we don't always agree with the choices they make. It is too bad that those seemingly most likely to deny women the freedom to follow their own heart's desires, are those whose aim of freedom and empowerment is noble but whose concept of freedom ends when the women choose an old fashioned life that doesn't measure up to feminist ideals. The author thankfully is a modern woman, independant and yet untroubled in granting others freedom to be who and what they are.Penny's book is outstanding. If you can read through the end without tears you are tougher than most, definately tougher than me."},{"Title":"A Midwife's Story","review":"As a future certified nurse midwife, I read this book to inspire me in my studies.

It pictures how truly wonderful, natural and peaceful childbirth can be when faith and love are present and fear is absent. If only all women had such a midwife and trusted their own bodies!"},{"Title":"A Midwife's Story","review":"This book contains the recollections of a certified-nurse midwife who attended homebirths in the 1980s among the Amish in Lancaster County. The book is aptly names a \\"midwife's story,\\" because it focuses on her experiences. Penny shares about how she became a midwife, about her initial training (in a very medicalized setting), about how she came to practice among the Amish and her views of birth changed, about her relationship with her boyfriend and then husband. There are a handful of birth stories shared that run the gamut of possibilites, but they are from Penny's perspective, sharing her experiences and insights. And there is a lot of information about the Amish, as their way of life was initially very foreign to Penny until she learned more about them and learned to better interact with their community.This book does not do much to try to convince the reader of the safety of homebirth or the need for less intervention. There is one side-by-side comparison of two different birth experiences. She mentions that her episotomy rate is very low compared to others, and we learn that she has one death for her first thousand births attended (a normal mortality rate). But no argument is made, not many statistics are cited. This book is not going to convince anyone with facts and arguments. It may appeal emotionally to someone questioning how birth should occur because it presents a very different picture of the way things can be (one woman in the book started having homebirths when \\"I realized what I was missing.). It's more written, however, for those who are already proponents of homebirth.A brief caution that early on when working in an hospital with many troubled patients there are a couple profanities, but none are present in the rest of the book. And, for those who might wonder, this book has no pictures of any kind, of births or otherwise.The tone of the book is very conversational, very casual. It is also rather episodic, a series of snapshots, or defining moments along Penny's path as a midwife. I think the book would have benefited from a bit more organization, and in my mind, this is one of the book's biggest weaknesses. That and the wish to have come across more birth stories with more detail and less on the midwife's thoughts and life story are what made me \\"like\\" this book (4-star) rather than \\"love\\" it. Still, it's a good book for those interested in homebirth, midwifery, and, to a lesser extent, in the Amish."},{"Title":"A Midwife's Story","review":"I'm an older guy, and I don't remember why I first read this story about 15 years ago, but I have read it every few years since, and I can never get through it without tears towards the end.

I was at my wife's side when our two sons were born, perhaps that is why her story always touches me so.

In the form of a story, without dogma or angry politics, this book opens the door to a way of life that is simple, natural, and harmonious. The emphasis is on birth. While I am not Amish and do not strive to be, I do belief birth is wonderful, natural, empowering, peaceful, and unique every time.

She started out with a very traditional nursing education in the hospital setting. From there, she moved into a rural area where she delivered babies for the Amish. She does a wonderful job portaying the Amish and their belief system. As a matter of fact I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the Amish. I would have wished for more detailed midwifery descriptions as in \\"The Baby Catcher\\". But she made up for that with her observations of how the medical community views (and sometimes even disrespects) laboring women and their choices. I found that very insightful and disturbing at the same time. Overall a great midwifery book!"},{"Title":"A Midwife's Story","review":"This book is a must read for birthing field professionals!

She gets personal which is what a Midwife's life is about- unveiling your innerness."},{"Title":"A Midwife's Story","review":"I felt the author was a little too uncritical of the Amish. Although she herself is not a member of the Amish faith, she seemed to have no questions about whether any of their customs might not be the best (ending their children's education at the eight grade for example, to insure the children will not question the Amish way of life). Instead, everything is perfect. And in fact, if mothers would just act like childbirth is no big deal, like the Amish do (doing housework while in labor--what virtue!!!) they would be much better off.

The author acknowledges the people that have have had an impact on his programming philosophy such as Galyn \\"Doc\\" Hammond, Mark Blinoff, Richard Kale, Bill Gavin, etc. He explains the importance of consistency in music and news programming. Listeners have certain expectations from the radio stations they listen to regularly. If those radio stations don't fulfill the expectations of the listeners, the stations could possibly lose some of their audience as a result. Eric Norberg says that the most effective Program Directors have to be able to get into the listener's head and perceive the station the way the listeners do. This mandates the ability to see and understand the points of view of others. He tells about the importance of honest ethical advertising. It is important for a station to maintain its credibility with the listeners by not broadcasting a dishonest ad. Analyzing and understanding the limitations of ratings data is important to programmers.

Furthermore, since it was difficult to find out how to say their names, it made it difficult to remember them!However, a few of the stories were fun to read, and other were humorous.

There are so many myths, each with an individual main idea, that it would be impossible to describe all of them, so I won't.

In our Western culture, the term 'mythology' is most often equated with these tales, and this book, first written before World War II, has helped to reinforce that equation with the current generations of readers.Those looking for the mythological stories of other cultures will be disappointed -- with the exception of a brief section on Norse mythology at the end (about five percent of the entire volume), it covers nothing outside the Greek and Roman pantheons. Of course, part of the difficulty of approaching mythology of other cultures is that, in many instances, it is not mythology to them; or, in the case of mythology, one needs a firmer grounding in the culture and religious aspects of that culture before the mythology becomes accessible.Hamilton (raised, as I was astonished to discover, in Indiana, where I currently reside) studied at Bryn Mawr, and had a distinguished teacher career in addition to writing this useful text. Hamilton's writing is not complicated and very easy to follow -- this has made this text one used in high school and undergraduate courses in Greek and Roman mythology more frequently perhaps than any other text produced in this century.Hamilton begins the text with an essay giving an overview of what mythology is, and what the purpose of it was.'Through it,' she wrote, 'we can retrace the path from civilised man who lives so far from nature, to man who lived in close companionship with nature; and the real interest of the myths is that they lead us back to a time when the world was young and people had a connection with the earth, with trees and seas and flowers and hills, unlike anything we ourselves can feel.'She proceeds with a brief history of the development of Greek mythology, the origins of the stories lost in the mists of time. She tells of the influences of Greek thought on subsequent developments in thought and religion: 'Saint Paul said the invisible must be understood by the visible. That was not a Hebrew idea, it was Greek.' Unlike most religious constructs, the Greek mythological world tried to make sense of the greater life of the universe in terms that were very human indeed, with a minimum of mystery. 'The terrifying irrational has no place in classical mythology.'This is not to say, of course, that there were not terrible stories and fantastic creatures -- indeed, the mythological stories are full of them -- Gorgons and hydras and chimaeras dire. But these are mostly metaphorical (and were understood as such), and primarily used for a hero to be made (this same idea has pervaded to the most recent Mission Impossible movie).Hamilton proceeds after this essay to describe the members of the pantheon, the major and minor gods and goddesses, the ideas of creation, the heroes (human, semi-divine and divine), stories of love and devotion, justice and injustice, and, of course, of warfare, victory, defeat, and courage. Those heroes before the Trojan War, perhaps the Greek-mythological-equivalent of a world war, had battles and dire circumstances to fight and overcome. The Trojan War figured largely in the mythological frameworks of Greece and Rome -- all the gods and goddess were involved in this conflict, it seemed, as were many of the heroes of Greek mythology.Hamilton, writing in a fairly conservative period of time, and in a fairly conservative culture, sanitised the mythological stories to a large extent. The Greeks were a very human and often rather bawdy bunch; the Romans were even moreso. Much of the sexuality in the mythological stories is omitted, save to demonstrate the less-desirable aspects. Quite often, undergraduates who study mythology are astonished to discover, if they had used Hamilton's text in an earlier high school setting, that there is a lot more sex and violence in the 'real' stories than they had been previously exposed to.Of course, one of the primary aspects of the mythological tales was not to explain the cosmos or to build complex theological constructs (reason did these, often with help from the myths, but not using the myths as the basis), but rather the illustration of moral truths -- those of honesty, virtue, and courage as primarily valued in Greek and Roman society. Evil befalls those who do not lead a moral life; rewards come to those who do. Of course, there is a bit of whimsy in the cosmos -- bad things happen to good people, etc., even in ancient Greece. The fluctuating personalities of the gods (and the number of them) ultimately gives a satisfying explanation (if not a satisfying reason) why such things might occur.Hamilton's book is a good one to use in teaching, but it must not be considered the final authority on any of the topics it addresses. Nonetheless, it has earned its place in the pantheon of influential books, and will most likely continue to be so for some time to come."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Mythology is classicist Edith Hamilton's book on Greek, Roman and Norse mythology, illustrated by Steele Savage (no kidding). The bulk of the work is devoted to the Greek, and the Norse is mentioned only in passing. Myths are arranged thematically, not chronologically (except for the initial creation), which is disruptive to the flow of the work.Hamilton does several things well. First, she gives history on the authors from whom these stories have descended, and differentiates between their styles. Second, she gives good insight into the character of the people of the time as well as into the character of the mythological figures. She obviously knows the material and cares about it.Mythology reads like a history book. Many stories get wrapped up too quickly, and quite a few are told too simplistically. Many details are left out. The writing is juvenile at times, and paragraph flow is occasionally an issue. This is almost a Cliff's Notes on mythology. Ultimately, Hamilton makes most of these myths boring. Others, with too many details cut out, the reader will find hard to get into.Mythology has some good things to offer, but on the whole, this is an inferior way to enjoy the myths. This book may be useful to some as a quick-reference guide, but that's about it.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"A very meaningful and enjoyable book. I had to read this book twice to increase my memory on all the gods, heroes, gods, monsters and mortals related to one another and stories that intertwine with one another. This really opens you up to the later play writers and the birth of the ideas that later came about in the rational thinking of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. I couldn't help partiality to the story or character is of Thesus and the city of Athens, the birth of equal justice and government of the people; democracy, which is far removed from the so-called pseudo forms of today.What is really beneficial about this book is that Hamilton takes the well known writers from the different centuries, those who repeat, elaborate, embellish and abridge the same and relational stories and then puts each story down in its full summarized form. In this she takes her information from the famous Roman writers Ovid and Virgil, from the Greek poet, Homer, from the poor farmer in favor of justice and questioner of nature, Hesiod, the lyric poet, Pindar, the tragic poets, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus, the comic poet Aristophanes, the Alexandrian poets; Apollonius of Rhodes and others, the pastoral poets Theocritus, Bion and Moschus, the Latin poet, Apuleius and the Greek poets, Lucian, Apollodorus and Pausanias. Some of these poets took their stories seriously, while others were not, such as Ovid, who was excellent at details, appreciative and thorough, yet he considered much to be nonsense, his work simply art form.It was in the fifth century where much of the Greek mythology was being replaced by rational thinking as in Euripides story of Creusa where he says to his audience, \\"Look at your Apollo, the sun-bright Lord of the Lyre, the pure God of Truth. This is what he did. he brutally forced a helpless young girl and then abandoned her.\\" the end of Greek mythology was at hand where such plays drew full houses in Athens. The same can be said for the Judeo God Yahweh who suffered and starved his own peoples that dared disobey and slayed his enemies with no compassion, taking the virgin women, livestock and valuables as spoil.Some of the books stories do lack details. For instance, in the story of Odysseus, who revenges with murder of the gallant men that abused his estates assets in their desire to marry his widow. Here Hamilton does not mention the murdering punishment of hanging applied to the abusive maidens that were in his household that can be found in the Odyssey. Also, in Hamilton's book, as in the move TROY, she describes the death of Patroclos as a surprise, his armour removed at death revealing his true identity. Yet the Iliad does not support this. On page 200 it states that only at first did the Trojans believe this, then soon realizing though Patroclos own words and actions that it was him and not Achilles fighting. For instance, Apollo disguised as Hector's young uncle, Asios, speaks to Hector saying, \\"Hurry, make for Patroclos, and you may get him, Apollo may give you victory!\\" So much for fine details, this is an excellent book.The last portion of the book has a short amount on Norse mythology, which is very beneficial in comparing to the previous Greek and Roman thought and you can see the influence on Wagner and others. The Norse courage in a doomed existence of heroic bravery is very different from the Greek, highly comtemplative in analysis."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I was looking for a book that detailed all of the stories of Greek Mythology. This book attempts to but gets lost with too much jumping around from one story to another and between Greek and Roman Mythology. I felt that this book was difficult to follow and didn't really keep you interested enough to try."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Regardless of challenges to accuracy, consistency, etc., this book is a classic and provides helpful background for high school. It is an easy and interesting read that also sets the stage for further exploration. It also has an interesting psychological take, claiming that the Greeks created deities with very human attitudes, ambitions, self-contradictions, and faults. A nifty handbook, Mythology is also a great resource for when your little brother wants ideas for what to name his comic book characters."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This book is hot, it kicks, it rocks, it rules. Can't say it enough; this is phenomenal storytelling, this is pure unsullied love for classic myth, this is beautiful. You cannot find a more complete source than this. All the stories are there, all the details, every little insignificant character. You want animated tale-spinning, you have it here. All the passion and the morals and the humour and the fire and the history and the charm and the beauty and the mystery...collected into this single volume. It's a crime not to read it."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Edith Hamilton's \\"Mythology\\" is the most concise and readable compendium of its subject that I have ever happened upon (it's part of my required summer reading for AP English). While it's not a thriller, and the first few sections take some real endurance to get through, the reader is rewarded in the end. I recognize that the book is not meant to be exciting reading - it's a scholarly work - but some of the sections whose myths are only a page long are irritating to read. It was hard to stay focused when the characters changed so frequently. However, I sincerely enjoyed the myths of the great heroes, the Trojan War, the Aeneid, and the Orestia (which have a great deal more substance than the rest). \\"Mythology\\" has also piqued my interest in other classical works, which I hope to pursue on my own or in college - to date I have only read \\"Oedipus Rex\\" and \\"Antigone\\" by Sophocles. \\"Mythology\\" is probably the reader's best investment of time and effort with the greatest return in knowledge."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Nice overview for someone new to Greek mythology. It covers the major figures and stories, but for anyone who has studied mythology, it is overly simplistic. The stories have been \\"sanitized,\\" possibly for a younger audience. For example, Aphrodite is said to have sprung from the foam, but Hamilton chooses to omit the Uranus story explaining why she came out of the foam in the first place. Those with a serious interest in Greek mythology should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; tell the &quot;Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; of classical mythology and this volume, first written in 1942, is now a timeless classic itself. This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of the key stories of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list for my money. I fully admit that I am biased because I read this during my formative years and her language and rhythms are engrained in my brain, just like the illustrations by Savage."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"My English teacher insists that the youth of America is losing culture. So, it is her tradition to assign this fairly large book for reading, so that we are all somewhat versed in the basics of Greek mythology and can recognize the various allusions to it in literature.What I thought would be a torturous experience turned out to be a rather enjoyable one. I found most of the stories to be well-told and extremely interesting. Edith Hamilton makes sure to leave no detail untold in her accounts of the various lives and actions of the ancient Greek gods and goddesses.It is over a year later, and I still use this book as a reference for any sort of literary allusion or reference to Greek mythology. So for those considering this book for pure reference purposes, the book contains a massive index to help you find just about any and every character in Greek mythology.While I agree with some reviewers that the end section on Norse mythology is out of place, it wasn't necessarily poorly written as some claim.Overall, an excellent purchase for anyone who reads literature, or is just interested in the ancient Greek myths."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I purchased this book for a school assignment, and went into reading it thinking that it would be boring.

Anyone who loves mythology should own this book."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Overall, \\"Mythology\\" is a decent introduction to Greco-Roman mythology, and when I read it in the third grade or so I loved it and it gave me a good base of knowledge. However, this year I had to study it in English class and just about memorize it, and my opinions about it have changed. This book is meant to be read as a textbook, looking things up when one feels it neccesary. That is how I originally read it. By no means should this dry, utilitarian tome be read cover-to-cover. Hamilton's writing style is concise and she gets her point across, but one cannot read more than one story at a time without nearly falling asleep. Reading Hamilton is a far cry from reading Homer or Sophocles. The most positive aspect of the book is its sheer comprehensiveness- Hamilton covers the gods and demigods thoroughly, as well as a large number of mythical tales. If you manage to force yourself through the whole of this book, you will gather from it quite a lot of information.The title might lead you to believe that this book is a comprehensive look at mythology in general, but don't be fooled. In Hamilton's eyes, no culture or mythology is worth a second thought except that of the Greeks and Romans. She accuses all pre-greek religions of glorifying pain and sacrafice, which is not true at all. She says of the religions of the ancient world, \\"Mankind's chief hope of escaping the wrath of whatever divinities were then abroad lay in some magical rite, senseless but powerful, or in some offering made at the cost of pain and grief.\\" She belittles the lore of Egypt and Mesopotamia, calling the Egyptian goddess with the head of a cat \\"a rigid figure...suggesting inflexible, inhuman cruelty.\\" It was the goddess of music! She describes the Greeks themselves, in pre-hellenistic times, as living \\"a savage life, ugly and brutal.\\" She says of Greek mythology, \\"what the myths show is how high they [the greeks] had risen above the ancient filth...\\". Disgusting. How dare she call the mythology of the Egyptians and the Assyrians \\"filth\\"? She does mention Norse mythology in her book, but gives so tiny a glimpse of it that she ought not to have included it at all. She doesn't bother to go into any detail at all about the Norse gods, and ignores almost the entire Volsung saga, telling only the stories of Signy and Sigurd. She tells us nothing of Freja's disturbing obtainment of Brisingamen, the dwarf-wrought necklace, or of the ring of Andvari that brought such misfortune upon its wearers. She does cover the Creation and Ragnarok, though not in much detail.This book should have been entitled \\"Greco-Roman Mythology\\" or \\"The Mythology of the Greeks and Romans\\"."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"A must read if you enjoy Greek mythology.

Very happy with the purchase."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I would say that this contains all the mythology that is important to know for the lay person. These are the gods that pop up all over the place in a lot of literature. The section on Norse mythology is somewhat lacking. By now most literate people would consider this one a classic."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Edith Hamilton observes the difficulty of writing Shakespeare's \\"King Lear\\" on the level of \\"Cinderella,\\" as well as reversing that same endeavor. Her goal was to leave distinctions intact among ancient authors such as Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, Ovid and others; so that the classic myths retain immortality without seeking to flavor the recounting by her own style or attempt to entertain the less initiated reader.In this book are the gods of myth, the Titans, the Olympians, gods of water, underworld, and the earth; with heroes, gods of flora and fauna, lovers, gods of adventure, tales such as the Trojan War, families of the gods, gods of royalty and others less fortunate, as well as including Norse mythology. Interspersed are illustrations, with Greek and Roman emphasis, which add to the author's effort to familiarize any reader with the way men and women felt, believed, and lived according to what influence the ancient stories gave to conduct, architecture, ambitions, and how those stories fueled the competitive spirit.Mythology of this time period affected how ancient civilizations interacted with nature and each other, based upon the trend away from how past beliefs held little distinction between myth and reality. Ignorance became less common than education, instead of the other way around. Ancient Greeks and Romans of this time period enjoyed the imagination of the mythology prevalent in this new era of thought, allowing themselves to revel in the possibilities for personification and animation that began to occur anywhere, anytime, about anything. In this freedom, what today we consider strange, to those being introduced to Roman and Greek mythology as is found in this book, their world was full of beauty and awe. Reason took the place of terror, mystery, and magic; and although at times life still had brutality and savagery, the ancient people heard and read the traditions passed down as mythology shared conquest and intellect, artistic ability, and political order. No longer was this exclusively the privilege of royalty, priests, and wizards or sorceresses.The literature of these ancient poets and story tellers helped to position mankind's importance in the universe, as astronomy, science, medicine, and interaction took place on frontiers previously left to the gods.Unlike Egyptian gods with features of animals, Roman and Greek gods took human form entirely and except for size and power were easily identifiable as beings similar to our own in appearance and form instead of resemblance to cats, birds, or mixtures of varieties of animal form in combination. Fantasy shifted into rational thought even for gods and goddesses, which gave levity to reverence; and deities were thought of as companions so fear would yield to adoration with the arena of respect; bringing harmony and balance in how those Greeks and Romans worshipped.The incomprehensiveness of unknown omnipotence was softened and fantastic or irrational fear began to ease into a sense of understanding. Mythology as shared in this book told of youth, beauty, and delight as mankind let go of superstition, magic, and dread. Priests and necromancers began being replaced by heroes and less immortal men and women; which in turn began to fade away the former attitudes of the need for human sacrifice to appease the gods.Religion would never be the same. Justice and philosophy shifted in ways that would change mankind's existence and pave the way for how much finally changed when Jesus Christ ushered in the modern concepts we hold today that would change life on this planet in ways the Greeks and Romans only began to imagine possible."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This book is an expansive introduction to the most important Greek myths. For the reader needing a re-fresher or hoping to familiarize himself/herself with somehow still culturally relevant ancient Greek mythology, this book is prefect.

The only downside of this book is that it doesnt keep your intrest that well. After the introduction, most parts are exciting, but there are still a few dull parts.This book goes through many sections of greek mythology and a bit of norse mythology at the end.

While the plotlines are well told, I found that the stories see to go a bit cold when retold under Ms. Hamilton's hand.

However, this book will see you though a mythology course exceedingly well, even though it is not a book I recommend for a leisurely read."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This is not what I remembered as the mythology: the rich and fascinating stories I had read when I was a child.This book is a very dry, summary of the mythology.

Many of the tales are so abbreviated that they tend to read more like reference pieces than actual stories. As a high school English teacher, I found that my students found Hamilton's book challenging. They often did not understand the myth due to the lack of detail (the abbreviation) or due to the diction she chose in order to express the myth. Hamilton's Mythology is an excellent source and I will continue to use it, but if you're looking for a relatively easy read of Greek myths in story form, I would recommend Bernard Evslin's Heroes, Gods and Monsters of the Greek Myths. My students had no problem with this novel and I found it an extremely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Perhaps spirit is the wrong word. It is obvious by the late Miss Hamilton's writing that she harbors quite an affinity for the Grco-Roman/Norse myths and cultures. However knowledgeable and talented she is at non-fiction and discussion, the actual tellings of the myths emerge as dull and tedious. If the prospective reader is looking for a thorough and well-crafted reference guide with brief recounts of the myths with little poetry or other flairs for the dramatic, this book is a fine choice. On the other hand, if one wants a reference guide that is entertaining as well, they will be more satisfied with &quot;Bulfinch's Mythology&quot; as long as it has an index and glossary. If the reader desires not reference but pure entertainment value, and does not wish to read translated Homer, Virgil, Ovid, etc., I suggest &quot;Gods, Heroes, and Men of Ancient Greece,&quot; by W.H.D. Rouse. The book is written as a storyteller would deliver the myths."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I've done quite a bit of reading about greek (and roman) mythology and I still enjoyed this book. They way the myths are writen is so good that I could almost feel myself back in ancient Greece, observing the scenes. I also enjoyed the quotes from the original source where the myth was told (e.g. The Odyssey, The Illiad, etc). Overall this is a good basic classical mythology book. Even people who already know these myths should read this book if only for the delightful manner in which they are told. For someone who cannot match a roman god to his greek conterpart this might require flipping back to the first chapter. If you pay attention the first time you read it you shouldn't have any trouble with this.Near the end of the book there are a couple norse myths. That's it. If your looking for a book that has myths from more than just Greece/Rome you'll be disappointed. However if you looked at the table of contents and noticed the lack of other cultural myths (and still wanted to read the book) you should be extremely satisfied. I know i was..."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"As a long-time student of mythology, I was generally disappointed with this book. It hardly appreciates the richness of Greek mythology; Hamilton rather plods through the stories in Greek mythology (the book ought to be called &quot;Greek and Roman Mythology,&quot; as it is mostly stories from ancient Greek culture, and its imitators, the Romans), except for that last chapter on Norse mythology. The only useful parts are the introductory chapters, which provide a nice overview of the themes of Greco-Roman mythology, how it came about, brief bios of major writers, etc, and the genealogical tables at the back of the book. For a better introduction to mythology, and a book that encompasses more than Greco-Roman mythology, read Michael Macrone's &quot;Brush Up Your Mythology.&quot;"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Edith Hamilton's very popular 'Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes' is a very basic, very popular and very good text for the introduction of Greek and Roman mythology. This book by Hamilton, simply entitled 'Mythology' is an expansion of the material in the shorter book. Largely, however, it is a repetition of the same material.In our Western culture, the term 'mythology' is most often equated with these tales, and Hamilton, first writing before World War II, has helped to reinforce that equation with the current generations of readers.Those looking for the mythological stories of other cultures will be disappointed -- with the exception of a brief section on Norse mythology at the end (about five percent of the entire volume), it covers nothing outside the Greek and Roman pantheons. Of course, part of the difficulty of approaching mythology of other cultures is that, in many instances, it is not mythology to them; or, in the case of mythology, one needs a firmer grounding in the culture and religious aspects of that culture before the mythology becomes accessible.Hamilton (raised, as I was astonished to discover, in Indiana, where I currently reside) studied at Bryn Mawr, and had a distinguished teacher career in addition to writing this useful text. Hamilton's writing is not complicated and very easy to follow -- this has made her texts selected often for high school and undergraduate courses in Greek and Roman mythology, more frequently perhaps than any other text produced in this century.Hamilton begins the text with an essay giving an overview of what mythology is, and what the purpose of it was.'Through it,' she wrote, 'we can retrace the path from civilised man who lives so far from nature, to man who lived in close companionship with nature; and the real interest of the myths is that they lead us back to a time when the world was young and people had a connection with the earth, with trees and seas and flowers and hills, unlike anything we ourselves can feel.'She proceeds with a brief history of the development of Greek mythology, the origins of the stories lost in the mists of time. She tells of the influences of Greek thought on subsequent developments in thought and religion: 'Saint Paul said the invisible must be understood by the visible. That was not a Hebrew idea, it was Greek.' Unlike most religious constructs, the Greek mythological world tried to make sense of the greater life of the universe in terms that were very human indeed, with a minimum of mystery. 'The terrifying irrational has no place in classical mythology.'This is not to say, of course, that there were not terrible stories and fantastic creatures -- indeed, the mythological stories are full of them -- Gorgons and hydras and chimaeras dire. But these are mostly metaphorical (and were understood as such), and primarily used for a hero to be made (this same idea has pervaded to the most recent Mission Impossible movie).Hamilton proceeds after this essay to describe the members of the pantheon, the major and minor gods and goddesses, the ideas of creation, the heroes (human, semi-divine and divine), stories of love and devotion, justice and injustice, and, of course, of warfare, victory, defeat, and courage. Those heroes before the Trojan War, perhaps the Greek-mythological-equivalent of a world war, had battles and dire circumstances to fight and overcome. The Trojan War figured largely in the mythological frameworks of Greece and Rome -- all the gods and goddess were involved in this conflict, it seemed, as were many of the heroes of Greek mythology.Hamilton, writing in a fairly conservative period of time, and in a fairly conservative culture, sanitised the mythological stories to a large extent. The Greeks were a very human and often rather bawdy bunch; the Romans were even moreso. Much of the sexuality in the mythological stories is omitted, save to demonstrate the less-desirable aspects. Quite often, undergraduates who study mythology are astonished to discover, if they had used Hamilton's text in an earlier high school setting, that there is a lot more sex and violence in the 'real' stories than they had been previously exposed to.Of course, one of the primary aspects of the mythological tales was not to explain the cosmos or to build complex theological constructs (reason did these, often with help from the myths, but not using the myths as the basis), but rather the illustration of moral truths -- those of honesty, virtue, and courage as primarily valued in Greek and Roman society. Evil befalls those who do not lead a moral life; rewards come to those who do. Of course, there is a bit of whimsy in the cosmos -- bad things happen to good people, etc., even in ancient Greece. The fluctuating personalities of the gods (and the number of them) ultimately gives a satisfying explanation (if not a satisfying reason) why such things might occur."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This extremely handy reference book is ideal for browsing, or for using as a tool to assist in your academic readings. Hamilton goes through all of the great Greek mythological figures and tales, and explains them, using an unusual, but very entertaining, mixture of prose and excerpts. The book is masterful because a complete layman can start reading it, and yet get a flavor for the actual original texts. At the same time, someone who's reading a more involved text can turn to the appropriate section in the book to get a clear grasp of any particular story quickly, and to figure out who an individual is. My 1953 edition has some very nice illustrations by Steele Savage that capture the flavor of ancient greek carvings, but with a simplicity and flair that can be found in the best comic books. There's no wonder that this book has survived for so long in a field that has as many authors as students; for it's purpose, it is simply too good to be improved upon."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"\\"Mythology\\" covers all the major and most minor Greek, Norse and Roman gods, goddesses, stories and locales. Edith Hamilton makes no pretenses that this is all there is to say on mythology, but she gives a reader a fine start.Hamilton puts them into sensible structures so beginners can learn in a context which are easy to understand. She provides major section titles helping readers get straight to the required story, like \\"Stories of Love and Adventure\\" You'll find \\"Cupid and Psyche\\" as a chapter.Chapters are named mostly by story like, \\"The Trojan War.\\"She quotes from the sources, so the reader knows how it is she got her information.Character-driven in format, readers can look up a name, find the subtitle with that name, and read why that character matters. She writes narratively, sounding a little like \\"Cliff's Notes.\\" This is a good thing, because the poetry from which these myths are drawn can be overwhelming.Nicely organized is the geneological table section. It looks like a family tree, in a English royalty kind of way.As a writer, I use it for a quick reference guide. I usually only need a few nuggets of information, and she gives me plenty. I first acquired it high school, using it to get out of those tough jams when I did not understand books like \\"The Odyssey,\\" by Homer.More than mere reference, \\"Mythology\\" is good reading for no other purpose than serendipitous curiosity.I fully recommend it.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; tell the &quot;Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; of classical mythology and this volume, first written in 1942, is now a timeless classic itself. This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.I looked over other possibilities as a basic textbook for my Classical Greek &amp; Roman Mythology course (I know, it sounds redundant and repetitive to me too), but I selected this one as my basic text. If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere.

The bulk of the work is devoted to the Greek, and the Norse is mentioned only in passing. Myths are arranged thematically, not chronologically (except for the initial creation), which is disruptive to the flow of the work.Hamilton does several things well. First, she gives history on the authors from whom these stories have descended, and differentiates between their styles. Second, she gives good insight into the character of the people of the time as well as into the character of the mythological figures. She obviously knows the material and cares about it.Mythology reads like a history book. Many stories get wrapped up too quickly, and quite a few are told too simplistically. Many details are left out. The writing is juvenile at times, and paragraph flow is occasionally an issue. This is almost a Cliff's Notes on mythology. Ultimately, Hamilton makes most of these myths boring. Others, with too many details cut out, the reader will find hard to get into.Mythology has some good things to offer, but on the whole, this is an inferior way to enjoy the myths. This book may be useful to some as a quick-reference guide, but that's about it.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Hamilton's Mythology is frequently one of the first books on mythology that any young person encounters; in my case, I encountered it as a sophomore in high school in 1966. More than forty years later, I still find it fresh, informative, and entertaining.Edith Hamilton assembles her accounts from many different sources, sometimes choosing one, sometimes combining several, and always giving her reasons for her choices. The introductions listing the sources therefore serve as suggested reading for the student who wants more detail. Her prose is lively and, at times, wryly humorous.This isn't a book of intense, detailed scholarship, but it is an excellent introduction to the myths of the ancient Greeks and Romans and also a book to which the serious scholar of mythology can return time and time again for pleasure and perhaps even a fact or two that had escaped notice previously."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Ms. Hamilton is a world-renowned classicist who was born in Dresden, Germany. She put this book together hoping the reader would be able to distinguish between the different writers of Greek Mythology while gaining knowledge of these classic myths.Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes is organized into seven parts beginning with an introduction to Greek Mythology and to the Greek and Roman writers. This follows with The Gods, the Creation and the Earliest Heroes--Stories of Love and Adventure--The Great Heroes Before the Trojan War--The Heroes of the Trojan War--The Great Families of Mythology--The Less Important Myths and the Mythology of the Norsemen. Before each story, Ms. Hamilton adds an explanation of why she chose that particular version by that writer.What I like most about this book is that it is organized so that it is easy to read and understand. This is a great introduction to the Greek Myths and written in a style that makes it entertaining and not a chore to read. The only downside might be that this may not be the right book for those who want a more in-depth study of Greek Mythology, but for me it was an excellent introduction. I am giving it a high score because I feel it accomplishes what it was meant to do--introduce the Greek Myths to people who may not be familiar with them. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I came to love this book as a child, and I continue to enjoy it and benefit from it as a twentysomething adult. Understanding the root Greek and Roman stories can lead to a much fuller and richer understanding of Western culture, including literature, movies, art - even comic books and cartoons.This a great collection of stories (with wonderful illustrations) for students and others interested in getting a sense of various myths and stories - large one like the search for the Golden Fleece, the Trojan War, the wanderings of Ulysses, the labors of Hercules, and smaller ones like King Midas, Orpheus, etc. This book recounts the stories, but it doesn't seek to interpret them. You'll have to dig deeper for that, and Hamilton helps you on your way by providing her sources.If you enjoy this book, you may want to read the originals, such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Argonautika; the works of the Greek playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; and other works like Ovid's Metamorphoses and some the Norse and northern European epics and sagas - Beowulf, the Prose Edda, etc.This isn't a definitive reference or mythological encyclopedia; it's a starting place for a really wonderful trip. I encourage you to give it a try - and to give it as a gift to young people in your life."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Marvelous! This is, quite simply, the best book on ancient mythology available today. It has everything you could ask for; It's readable, erudite scholars tome this is not; it's comprehensive, covering every major myth you'll find allusions too in modern literature; it's not analytical, it presents the stories as they should be, beautiful in their simplicity, not awash in modern symbolism; and, most important of all, the book sparks an passion for mythology. After reading this book, instead of feeling like you know all there is to know about the ancients religion, you'll want to actually read Hamilton's original sources. It actually makes you want to read Hesiod, Homer, Herodotus, Euridpides, Sophocles, Virgil, and all the others in the great classical cannon. Truly, I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Ms. Hamilton's book, rightly considered a classic in its own right, is a quick, minimal no-nonsense retelling of Greek and Roman myths. I was surprised to see a small section at the end on Norse mythology; I thought it was entirely too brief to do the subject justice.Ms. Hamilton's greatest contribution in this work is her grouping of the myths in more-or-less logical sections -- for example, &quot;The Gods, the Creation and the Earliest Heroes,&quot; &quot;Stories of Love and Adventure,&quot; &quot;The Great Heroes of the Trojan War,&quot; and so on. She attempts to provide a framework for the myths to enable the reader to understand them in the context they were understood during their own time, and she does this very well.Another benefit Ms. Hamilton attempts to provide her readers is a clipping service of sorts, pulling her stories from a multitude of sources. While I found the constant switching between Greek and Roman names annoying, Ms. Hamilton remained true to her methodology of identifying the gods, goddesses and heroes based on the majority author from which she drew for a particular tale. I could have done without her editorializing on the readability of the authors from whom she drew, but that is a minor quibble.This book is most useful for someone for whom many years has passed since he or she has read their Greek and Roman mythology. It might also serve as an adequate primer for someone about to undertake a first reading of the subject as well. By itself, however, it loses much of the romance and excitement the fully developed stories themselves impart in the hands of a skilled storyteller. I was fortunate in that, even though I read most of my mythology before the age of ten, I had a wonderful resource at my disposal -- a 1930 edition of the Grolier Society's The Book of Knowledge, a twenty volume encyclopedia that undertook to impart a broad range of knowledge to its readers in an accessible and enjoyable manner. Having not read mythology since that time, Hamilton's brief retelling of the tales brought back many of them and the context she provided even enhanced my appreciation for some and cleared up misconceptions about others.One complaint, admittedly minute in importance: I found three typographical errors in the edition I read (Warner Books, 1999). While these in no way detracted from the work, it is nonetheless surprising to find such errors in a work that's been in print for sixty years."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"There simply is no better source of the classical mythos. Ms. Hamilton writes like no other, and infuses her subject with passion and love, and makes the immoratals live as passionately and as vividly as they did in the days of Homer and the other Greek greats. Sometimes criticized as juvenile and simplistic, Ms. Hamilton's work has withstood the &quot;whips and arrows&quot; of time and endures as the work on the myths and legends of antiquity, and as the scholarly approach to the subject. To read Ms. Hamilton's work is to go back thousands of years, and see the world as a place of wonder, a place where man created his gods in his own image. This is a book destined to become a family favorite! One merely hopes that since her death, Ms. Hamilton enjoys the ambrosia of Olympus, whose realms she brought so vividly to life. Buy the hardcover, for once read to the family, it's sure to become a favorite!"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I first read this book as a child and it was the first book I ever wore out. It relates all the key Graeco-Roman myths, with Norse myths treated perfunctorily at the end. Hamilton learned Greek and Latin as a little girl and wrote her books late in life; they read like the works of someone who spent a lifetime reading the classics for personal pleasure. Readers using this book as an introductory guide should be aware of Hamilton's prejudices: she prefers the Greeks to the Romans, and writers who believed in the stories to those who did not. As a result, you might be wrongly discouraged from classical authors such as Ovid (whom Hamilton seems to actively despise), even though Ovid's worldview is strikingly similar to our modern one and his writing vivid and enjoyable. But if you approach this book as an opinionated presentation by a genuine enthusiast, as opposed to an effort at scholarly objectivity, you will not likely regret being caught up in the passion the author brought to this material."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I recommend this book to everyone that has the slightest interest in Greek and Roman mythology. It is extremely informative and tells about the stories and legends of ancient times in great detail and in a way that is incredibly easy to follow along with. I personally like the story of Cupid and Psyche the best over all but every story in the book was captivating and informative. I could hardly put down the book and carried it everywhere I went. I would suggest buying the hard cover copy because I found that since the book was so good, it was opened and closed a lot and the front cover became frayed very quickly."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I am a student of English, and a favorite subject of mine is Classical Mythology. I find myself going back to this book time and again for most of my research needs on the subject. I was first introduced to mythology through this book. The clear descriptions sparked an intrest. I have read the book several times, and at every reading it is new and fresh. If you are a student doing research or a person who just wants to find out about Mythology, this book is for you."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This has been my favourite book since high school. No one else captures the spirit of the Greek Myths with the accuracy and passion of Ms. Hamilton. If you have never read &quot;Mythology&quot;, you've never read mythology at all. Treat yourself to the Ultimate Classic!"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I had to do this big mythology project for english class and I didn't understand at all this book helped alot!"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"When I first started reading this extraordinary book, I couldn't put it down! It's especially great because not only does it tell myths of the Greek Gods and Goddess', Hamilton provides many adventures of Mythical heroe's and the major offspring's of Zeuss. I reccommend reading MYTHOLOGY if you ever have to do a report on Greece - or just for the enjoyment!!!"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"The author accumulated the legends from authors such as Ovid and Hesiod, and then organized them into her own words. I really enjoyed it since the text was readable and I wasn't subjected to huge amounts of quotations from the original authors. I think I got more out of this book than if I had read the original works. Summarized very nicely."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"As a very quick and superficial introduction, this book may have some benefit, in the same way that the Cliff Notes can be useful, but if you want to get the true flavor of the myths and of the Greek universe, you best go elsewhere. Edith Hamilton reached so widely, while being so hemmed in by the strictures of her day, that she paints the stories only in the broadest of brush strokes, and bowdlerizes them in the process, much as might be expected of a proper British lady scholar writing in the days of top hats and steam locomotives.We may well be doing a disservice to our students by exposing them to this work, bland and devoid of the passion, immediacy and rawness that still resonate from the surviving Greek and Roman texts. If we want to imbue the present generation with love of knowledge, I would recommend instead Robert Fagles' wonderful translations of Homer and Sophocles, Nick Rudall's translation of Euripides' &quot;Trojan Women&quot;, or Calimach's vivid rendition of the male love myths in &quot;Lovers' Legends&quot;. But not Dame Edith."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Everytime someone asks me for a book on greek mythology (which used to be a lot, since I worked in a bookstore), I pointed them directly to this book. This is a must-have for anyone remotely interested in Ancient Greece, although this book is enjoyable even if you aren't.Hamilton hits on all the basics of Greek mythology, including theogony, heroic epics, and (my favorite) the love stories. Most books concerning Greek mythology only deal with certain things, or have less-than desirable synopses. Not to mention it's compiled in a small, cheap paperback (history books aren't cheap anymore, they're almost all published in hardcover and trade paperback).One of my favorite things about this book- if I'm bored, i can just flip to one of my favorite stories. ALthough the book is in a type of chronological order, most of the stories can be read without reading the previous ones (although I highly recommend it, since they're all really good stories).So if you've ever been interested in the historical version of The Trojan War (you aren't going to get it from the movies), if Pygmalion really fell in love with a statue, or all about Zeus' philandering and his wife's clever trickery to catch him in the act, buy this book :)"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"After reading this novel for my Enlgish class, I would like to share my thoughts. For people that are looking for a book to catch them up on Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, in a quick period of time, this is your book. It gets to the point and just re-tells what the previous writers have. But if you want to take your time and read mythology with passion and time, choose another book. Hamilton just tells it as it is, although if some stories are vivd, it would probably be thanks to Ovid."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Mythology has been one of my areas of interest since college, in 1956. I read this book then. It makes you want to read more on Mythology. After all isn't that what a book is supposed to do.

Was not worth reading."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This book is GREAT, and most excellent in its covering of the Greek and Roman myths, but I found that the information on the Norse myths to be sadly lacking. Overall, the book is good to own, but if you're looking for Norse mythology, buy something else."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I have only ever read Agamemnon by Aeschylus so I am not an expert in Greek mythology, but as a first-time buyer and reader of collections of Greek mythology, I'd say this book re-tells the stories very well. All the stories don't flow like a novel would and it is more like a short story with the mindful notations (e.g., prior to retelling the Hercules story, Hamilton says that she chose to retell Apollodorus's tale of Hercules over Ovid's because of it provided more detail).Hamilton provides more than just the Greek myths and adds a bit of a sociological analysis through the lens of mythology. It wasn't what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Missed this book from home. Read it in my childhood and jusy haf to read it again. Recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Hamilton's Mythology continues to make an excellent, approachable tool for teaching basic Greek/Roman mythology to students of any age.

I would hang back and wait until the library opened and enter as a normal patron :) This book kept me entertained for many many days. As I sat back in the bean chair for hours in the kids section (back then you didn't have to worry about strangers taking kids) I would read about the adventures of Jason and the Argonauts or the mischievous Gods and at the end of the day when it was time to go home I couldn't wait to come back the next day and read some more. Mrs. Hamilton was a great writer, easy to follow and suspenseful. The book is laid out so that you could read it cover to cover or just the sections you are curious about. This was my first introduction to Mythology and by far my favorite Mythology book. After many years I found it or maybe it found me again at a book sale and this time I took it home with me and now it has a permanent spot in my small book collection. I would recommend this book for any children or adults interested in expanding their imagination."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Edith Hamilton's timeless classic lives on well into the new milennium. This timeless work is the introduction to mythology for many, and it is a fine account. While not as in depth as some would like, I thin this is more accessible to the modern reader as opposed to the earlier Bulfinch's (which I also love).All who are uninitiated to the world of the Greek and Roman gods will find this book indispensible when the topic turns to Greek mythology. Hamilton also does a fine job of pointing out the sources for her retellings, so the enthralled reader can then go to the originals in translation from various authors.This book is a great primer on mythology. I think it is probably one of the oldest text-books in-print continuously since 1942 for good reason."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This book is a fine reference for myth lovers.

It is my long held opinion, that this makes a good text book for home schoolers. And it was the textbook when I took a mythology class in 1972-73.I bought this older volume for sentiment, after my own old book mildewed from a storm problem. I thought I was getting the *white* cover, shown on this page... but it arrived with the dark cover... something only a collector would mind.

Greek mythology is one of my favorite types of books to read, except for horror books, however. Anyway, what Edith Hamilton does with this book is simply amazing. She has such an uncanny style that separates her from other various writers. She explains the Gods and their purposes in life like she knew them, as if they were real people. I sense that she had a true \\"knack\\" for Greek mythology.Mythology, especially ancient Greek, is at the utmost, my favorite types of adventure-like books. To me, I consider Greek myths adventurous. When I learn something new, about something that I've already read about, I can somehow picture the different deities fighting in battles and sorts. Edith Hamilton makes this come to mind when you read her books.

I only read it for school, but normally I enjoy reading books or Greek/Roman History. The error in this book was that too much information was covered in so too few of pages. I know that may seem strange as the book is 350 pages, but the author tried to cover ever aspect of Greek and Roman Mythology and Literature. His writing style became to plain and ended up reading like a teenage girl was describing it. It came out like:Zeus sleep with Lady 1. Lady 1 had Son 1. Hera killed Lady 1. Son 1 love Lady 2. Lady two had 3 girls and 1 son. Zeus slept with one of the girls... and so on.Yes that is a simplification of how the book read, but I think it gets my point a cross. This book worked a a great refresher for information I already knew. In that fact it did succeed.

The Norse myths comprise the book's final &quot;Part Seven&quot;, which runs only from page 443, to the end at page 462. These myths of the Northern European Peoples appear after &quot;Part Six&quot;, which bears the rubric &quot;The Less Important Myths&quot;.Only indirectly, and briefly does the author mention such German myths as The Nibelungenleid and Parzival, and then she merely dismisses them thus: &quot;Sigurd is the most famous of Norse heroes; his story is largely that of the hero of the Nibelungenleid, Siegfried... I have not gone into it, however.&quot;There are no Celtic myths. The legend of Arthur's round table at Camelot is omitted, and so are the tales of Roland and the Paladins of Charlemagne. The Holy Grail is nowhere to be found, and there is not a single word about Uncle Remus.All that having been said, one must wonder if the title &quot;Mythology&quot; isn't overstating, just a bit. It certainly leads to disappointment if a reader makes his decision based on the title alone. Perhaps &quot;Classical Mythology&quot; would better suit the text.All of the above doesn't make this a bad book. Actually, the author has turned in a workman-like performance, and all the Greek and Roman foundation tales of Western Civilization are included.I have found the dust jacket blurbs, on my 1942-copyright, used edition, to be interesting reading... this book is a good place to get acquainted with classical mythology."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"The author takes a nicely readable and informative look at the classical mythology of Ancient Greece. Readers come away with a strong understanding of the subject, everything from Hercules to Ovid, Cupid to the Gods, plus their loves, quarrels, etc. Readers also gain a strong knowledge of the heroic legends and fervent religious beliefs of the world's first semi-democracy (only male citizens voted). My favorite sections included the loves of the Gods, and the writings of Homer, though some say she was a bit brief with the latter. We studied this book as high school freshman, and while not converted into a fan (I prefer Greek philosophers, particularly Socrates), I did come away much better informed. Fervent aficionados of Greek mythology should enjoy this volume as well as books offering deeper analysis; other readers should be satisfied to start and stop here."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"What I found pleasantly surprising about this book is that it is easily understood, yet a very viable source of ancient Greek mythology.

Reading such stories has fueled an interest in reading quality fantasy stories. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you shoud have this as a complementary book."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I first read this book in sixth grade, and instantly fell in love with it. I loved the concept of mythology and loved how the book was written. I didn't find the boring aspects everyone else seemed to find. I devoured the book whole, and now, years later, I bought it. I was curious to see if the magic would hit me twice.It did, in a sense. I vaguely remembered the stories, so the aspect of surprise and shock in some of the stories was ruined for me. Granted, when I first read it I was very young, but there were still some things that were more enjoyable to read the first time. Since then, I've moved onto other classic mythology books, and have found them to be very enjoyable too.It is true, yes, that Edith Hamilton writes well, but overall the book is dry. It is true that this is a mere introduction and does not present us with every tale in the history of various mythologies (the Norse mythology section is pitifully short - I'd turn elsewhere for that). Overall, though, it's an enjoyable introduction, an easy read (if you can deal with the dryness), and an overall good book. It's convenient on the shelf and can serve you for many years to come.A pretty good buy, but more serious readers should head towards more serious books, even if they'll be more difficult to read."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Edith Hamilton's very popular 'Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes' is a very basic, very popular and very good text for the introduction of Greek and Roman mythology. This book by Hamilton, simply entitled 'Mythology' is an expansion of the material in the shorter book. Largely, however, it is a repetition of the same material.In our Western culture, the term 'mythology' is most often equated with these tales, and Hamilton, first writing before World War II, has helped to reinforce that equation with the current generations of readers.Those looking for the mythological stories of other cultures will be disappointed -- with the exception of a brief section on Norse mythology at the end (about five percent of the entire volume), it covers nothing outside the Greek and Roman pantheons. Of course, part of the difficulty of approaching mythology of other cultures is that, in many instances, it is not mythology to them; or, in the case of mythology, one needs a firmer grounding in the culture and religious aspects of that culture before the mythology becomes accessible.Hamilton (raised, as I was astonished to discover, in Indiana, where I currently reside) studied at Bryn Mawr, and had a distinguished teacher career in addition to writing this useful text. Hamilton's writing is not complicated and very easy to follow -- this has made her texts selected often for high school and undergraduate courses in Greek and Roman mythology, more frequently perhaps than any other text produced in this century.Hamilton begins the text with an essay giving an overview of what mythology is, and what the purpose of it was.'Through it,' she wrote, 'we can retrace the path from civilised man who lives so far from nature, to man who lived in close companionship with nature; and the real interest of the myths is that they lead us back to a time when the world was young and people had a connection with the earth, with trees and seas and flowers and hills, unlike anything we ourselves can feel.'She proceeds with a brief history of the development of Greek mythology, the origins of the stories lost in the mists of time. She tells of the influences of Greek thought on subsequent developments in thought and religion: 'Saint Paul said the invisible must be understood by the visible. That was not a Hebrew idea, it was Greek.' Unlike most religious constructs, the Greek mythological world tried to make sense of the greater life of the universe in terms that were very human indeed, with a minimum of mystery. 'The terrifying irrational has no place in classical mythology.'This is not to say, of course, that there were not terrible stories and fantastic creatures -- indeed, the mythological stories are full of them -- Gorgons and hydras and chimaeras dire. But these are mostly metaphorical (and were understood as such), and primarily used for a hero to be made (this same idea has pervaded to the most recent Mission Impossible movie).Hamilton proceeds after this essay to describe the members of the pantheon, the major and minor gods and goddesses, the ideas of creation, the heroes (human, semi-divine and divine), stories of love and devotion, justice and injustice, and, of course, of warfare, victory, defeat, and courage. Those heroes before the Trojan War, perhaps the Greek-mythological-equivalent of a world war, had battles and dire circumstances to fight and overcome. The Trojan War figured largely in the mythological frameworks of Greece and Rome -- all the gods and goddess were involved in this conflict, it seemed, as were many of the heroes of Greek mythology.Hamilton, writing in a fairly conservative period of time, and in a fairly conservative culture, sanitised the mythological stories to a large extent. The Greeks were a very human and often rather bawdy bunch; the Romans were even moreso. Much of the sexuality in the mythological stories is omitted, save to demonstrate the less-desirable aspects. Quite often, undergraduates who study mythology are astonished to discover, if they had used Hamilton's text in an earlier high school setting, that there is a lot more sex and violence in the 'real' stories than they had been previously exposed to.Of course, one of the primary aspects of the mythological tales was not to explain the cosmos or to build complex theological constructs (reason did these, often with help from the myths, but not using the myths as the basis), but rather the illustration of moral truths -- those of honesty, virtue, and courage as primarily valued in Greek and Roman society. Evil befalls those who do not lead a moral life; rewards come to those who do. Of course, there is a bit of whimsy in the cosmos -- bad things happen to good people, etc., even in ancient Greece. The fluctuating personalities of the gods (and the number of them) ultimately gives a satisfying explanation (if not a satisfying reason) why such things might occur."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Although it's difficult to give an accurate review of such a large book with so many different stories, overall Edith Hamilton's Mythology deserves five stars. For a discussion on the myths within this book, please skip down to the capitalized section.The effort put into this book is tremendous. It is quite obvious by her writing the Ms. Hamilton has dedicated plenty of time to this work. Although not all works which have been worked on for so long are necessarily successul, this one is.The book mainly covers Greek and Roman mythology, with a small section of Norse mythology at the end. As there are at least two different names for each god and goddess due to the difference between the Greek and Roman myths, the stories can get a bit confusing. Yet Ms. Hamilton does her best to aid us in understanding. The work begins with an introduction to mythology section which describes certain gods and goddesses, as well as the history of mythology. As stated, these parts may be confusing since there are usually a Roman and Greek name for each important figure.THE STORIES THEMSELVES. The myths themselves are told excellently by Hamilton. She offers views from many different sources, often choosing the best source for each story (or each particular part of a story). As myths differ from writer to writer, you may find that the version of one myth is different from the version Hamilton tells. This is expected. However, Ms. Hamilton does an excellent job telling the myths as best she can, especially considering the amount of myths she tells in the book.The only complaint I have of this book is the fact that some myths that I consider important only receive a few pages in the book, while less important myths (in my opinion) have several pages dedicated to them. Another example of this is the presence of such myths that I thought were important in the 'less important myths' section.Overall, this is a good overview of mythology and is definitely recommended. If you are planning a trip to Greece anytime, I suggest picking this up as it will help explain the significance of many places within Greece that you may end up visiting."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"In my opinion, mythology is a very interesting subject that helps us better understand past cultures' lifestyles and many of the stories are extremely enjoyable. Edith Hamilton's Mythology is a great overview of the Greek classics and it describes how the Greeks were the first mass culture to deify in their own image, have gods that acted very human, and could directly interact with their subjects.The book is set-up very well with sections on the Olympian gods, lesser gods, classic tales of heroes and villains, and much more. Hamilton is a great writer and she really makes you &quot;relive&quot; many of the stories. I also appreciated how Hamilton gave adequate background on historians such as Homer, Ovid, Virgil, etc.Many of the stories contained here most people have heard of, but not in the way that Hamilton tells them. Hercules, Theseus, the Trojan War, even the Calydonian Boar Hunt, are retold in a maserful and enjoyable manner. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the great classics that have remained a part of our culture for many many centuries. My only gripe with the book is that it does not contain much on other mythologies such as the Egyptian, Sumerian, and Norse (Roman myth is heavily related to Greek and is discussed), but there are plenty of works on those."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"While it is certainly true that Edith Hamilton is a standby in the field of Classics, her telling of myths must be taken with a grain of salt. A product of her time and education, she has a tendancy to try and force a quasi-Christian mythos on Greek legends ie a Savior figure being slain and resurrected. Although this is a good introduction, particularly for younger folk, it should be viewed as a springboard and no more. It is easy to read, and relatively well laid out, but anyone with a serious interest in Greek mythology and mindset should look elsewhere for a truer understanding and appreciation, one that does not force or contrive Christian parallels."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I had to use this book as a textbook for my high school mythology class. To her credit, Edith Hamilton was one of the first to provide so diverse and inclusive a collection of Greek and Roman myths in one volume, and it is an excellent resource for finding so many stories, even the obscure ones. As a storyteller, however, Hamilton is lacking. Although she opens each chapter with a note on the literary sources for the tale, she tells them in a matter-of-fact, scientific manner, not allowing the story to unfold and flow in an enjoyable way. She does have her moments; for example, her telling of Cupid and Psyche is quite excellent. In general, however, her method is boring and frustrating, as she does not put many of the stories in a chronological, or even sensible, order. To be honest, I think my best experience with Classical mythology was my first, which was reading picture book collections in fourth grade. The stories are always great, provided you can get through the storyteller."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Hmm. Wasn't really thrilled with this book. I found it to be a bit dry and boring.

Consequently, something is lost in translation..."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"ISBN 0316341142 - Mythology is a bit like Pokemon to me - I can't remember all those names and I certainly can't remember who's got what powers. I had hope that this book would help me start to remember at least some of it, but it seems to have made things a little worse.Author Edith Hamilton retells various Greek and Romans myths, in her own words. Most gods are referred to by both names which, at least for me, only adds to the confusion. On top of that, Hamilton's writing style doesn't appeal to me. I had to read and re-read sentences, not because they were complex and confusing but because my mind would actually wander in the middle of sentences - not a good indicator.Clearly, mythology is a matter of taste, but if you're anything like me - a bit ignorant on the topic and trying to correct that - this book is a good reference, something to open and rely on for info, but not a good read.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Very good book on a basic guide to ancient mythology, but I was disappointed to find out how basic it was. I like how it seemed the author was mixing Greek, Roman, Nordic, and other ancient mythologies together... However, this book seems to stick to Greek and Roman and barely touch on Nordic, and the other mythologies might as well have been deleted they tell so little. Certainly not a bible for mythology at all!Overall I learned a little, and it was interesting, none-the-less. I don't feel cheated, but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This is a long standing work on mythology. The emphasis is on Greek and Roman tales, with a too brief discussion of Norse mythology. That some of the other reviewers mention it in the same breath as Bulfinch is testimony to the volume's value.The work features a nice introductory essay to \\"set up\\" the discussion of Greek and Roman myths. There is also a rather unsatisfying brief introduction to the underdeveloped section on Norse mythology.The first part features \\"The Gods, the Creation, and the Earliest Heroes.\\" Here, Hamilton examines the array of gods, the stories of creation, and early heroes (such as Prometheus, Europa, and Polyphemus [hero??]). Part Two explores \\"Stories of Love and Adventure.\\" In this segment, Hamilton considers Cupid and Psyche, and a series of tales of love (e.g., Pyramus and Thisbe, Orpheus and Eurydice, and so on). Also, the story of the Golden Fleece is retold.Part Three summarizes \\"The Great Heroes before the Trojan War,\\" including renderings of Perseus, Theseus, and the great Hercules. Part Four, as one might have anticipated, looks at \\"The Heroes of the Trojan War.\\" Hamilton spends time on a number of figures and stories, such as Paris, the fall of Troy, Odysseus' post-Troy adventures, and the travails of Aeneas.Part Five considers \\"Great Families of Mythology,\\" such as the Houses of Atreus (think Agamemnon and Iphigenia), Thebes (Cadmus, Oedipus, Antigone), and Athens. Hamilton then moves to Part Six, where she summarizes the stories of \\"The Less Important Myths,\\" including Midas, Glaucus and Scylla, inter alia.Part Seven, as already noted, is a too brief coverage of \\"The Mythology of the Norsemen.\\"And, finally, a wonderfully helpful genealogy at the end (e.g., Ancestors of Perseus and Hercules, the House of Troy, and so on).This is well written and shows considerable erudition. There are some problems in coverage as noted, but, in the end, this is still a welcome volume."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Edith Hamilton's &quot;Mythology&quot; tell the &quot;Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes&quot; of classical mythology and this volume, first written in 1942, is now a timeless classic itself. This was the first book of mythology that I ever read and it is still the best. When Hamilton retells the love story of Cupid and Psyche or the tragedy of Agamemnon and his children, she does so with a full sense of what it meant when first told by Apuleius or Aeschylus. These are not children's tales, but the heroic legends and religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks. Furthermore, the illustrations by Steele Savage have the elegance of wood block prints, which, for all I know, is exactly what they are. I appreciate Hamilton's choice to avoid relying on Ovid, for while the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is the most comprehensive ancient text dealing with the classical myths, Ovid is an unbeliever. For Hamilton the writings of Homer, Hesiod and Pindar are more abbreviated in terms of providing details for the myths, but at least they take the tales seriously.Another strength of the book is how she organizes the myths in her seven parts: (1) Covers the complete pantheon of deities, including the lesser gods of Olympus and Earth and the later Roman additions, as well as the earliest heroes. (2) Retells the various tales of love, between mortals and the gods or each other, along with the Quest for the Golden Fleece and other early heroic adventures. (3) Focuses specifically on the greatest heroes, Perseus, Theseus and Hercules, with Atalanta thrown in the mix in a curious but understandable editorial decision by Hamilton. (4) Puts together Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid into a giant epic stretching from the Judgment of Paris to the founding of Roman, with the Odyssey and the tragedies of Euripides. (5) Tells about the great mythological families, namely the House of Atreus (Agamemnon), the Royal House of Thebes (Oedipus and Antigone), and the Royal House of Athens. (6) Covers all of the lesser myths, most notably Midas. (7) Goes off in a new direction, providing a very brief introduction to Norse mythology that seems woefully inadequate given the comprehensive compilation of classical mythology that precedes it.If you want analysis of these myths, then you certainly want to look elsewhere. But if you want a solid retelling of the key stories of classical mythology, then Edith Hamilton's volume is still at the top of the list for my money. I fully admit that I am biased because I read this during my formative years and her language and rhythms are engrained in my brain, just like the illustrations by Savage."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I've done quite a bit of reading about greek (and roman) mythology and I still enjoyed this book. They way the myths are writen is so good that I could almost feel myself back in ancient Greece, observing the scenes. I also enjoyed the quotes from the original source where the myth was told (e.g. The Odyssey, The Illiad, etc). Overall this is a good basic classical mythology book. Even people who already know these myths should read this book if only for the delightful manner in which they are told. For someone who cannot match a roman god to his greek conterpart this might require flipping back to the first chapter. If you pay attention the first time you read it you shouldn't have any trouble with this.Near the end of the book there are a couple norse myths. That's it. If your looking for a book that has myths from more than just Greece/Rome you'll be disappointed. However if you looked at the table of contents and noticed the lack of other cultural myths (and still wanted to read the book) you should be extremely satisfied.

No one told myths as well as the Greeks and Romans did and no one told Greek and Roman myths as well as Edith Hamilton did. If you don't buy into these stories, they still serve well as good literature. The book has all the main myths. In here you will find the story of the creation of the world and mankind, you will find details on each god and goddess and a list of the twelve Olympians. The stories included are famous such as the the Trojan War, the Odyssey, the Quest of the Golden Fleece (for fans of Ray Harryhausen's \\"Jason and the Argonauts)and other tales to delight the mind.

She does a good job of tying the mythology surrounding events into the events.This is a beginners book and not a full account of most of the stories. She does site the sources for each of the stories so you could further your own research if you were so inclined.A leisurely read, recommended for youths or anyone looking to fill in the gaps and connect the dots in their knowledge of Greek myths."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I believe, deep in my heart, that everyone who has attended high school in the past twenty to thirty years or so (in the United States, at least) owned a ratty, most likely used copy of this work at one time or another. This book has been on the required reading list of so many schools that nearly everyone has seen it, owned it, and opened it at least twice.This is one only two such books I still have, 15 years out of high school: this and Strunk and White. This is a good book to have lying around the house, not because you need it every day, but because it is a great reference for things like settling family bets and cheating on the brown questions in Trivial Pursuit. Dig it out of the boxes in your basement sometime, under the term paper from freshman comp, and have a look over it.

I loved the stories and still do. So, of course I had to buy a copy for my kids to (hopefully) pick up and read, and sure enough, my youngest now keeps it on her nightstand, and constantly has her nose in it. When the book arrived, it was like seeing an old friend I hadn't seen in years (even though I've now moved on to Robert Graves \\"The Greek Myths\\" as my \\"go-to\\" version for Greek mythology).Edith Hamilton's version was completed some 50 years ago, but it still holds up as a great introduction for high school and junior high students to these timeless stories. Her prose is clear and direct, and she provides great summaries of some of the lesser known tales, in a way that will keep the interest of any younger reader. This book was NEVER intended to rival Bulfinch's mythology, a book that to this day I refuse to buy because I find it tedious, turgid, stultifying, and sterile. I would rather have my teeth drilled than read Bulfinch's mythology. I would rather be thrown into a cage filled with a hundred starving, rabid weasels than read Bulfinch's mythology. I would rather be tied up and forced to ride the \\"It's a Small World\\" ride at Disney World 100 times in a row and have that insipid little ditty implanted into my brain for a week than read Bulfinch's mythology. Did I mention that I don't like Bulfinch's mythology?And why do I dislike Bulfinch so much? Because after reading Edith Hamilton's take on the Greek myths on my own time, purely for pleasure, as a young teenager, I had Bulfinch foisted upon me by my high school, which, for those of you who care, included a curriculum that featured some grounding in the ancient Greek and Roman cultures. So I have had the chance to sample both, first-hand. And if my goal was to turn-off a young reader from learning about our classical heritage, I couldn't think of a better way to do it than to force Bulfinch upon them. It is written at an inappropriately high level for that age. Thankfully I had a chance to read these stories in a more friendly format, thanks to Miss Hamilton, so I wasn't permanently discouraged from ever hearing them. No, I think a book written at the high school level, like Edith Hamilton's, that doesn't dumb the stories down to the point of insulting the reader, but doesn't lose them with dense prose either, is just the ticket for someone in high school, or someone just being introduced to these stories.I still don't like Bulfinch (obviously) - I'll take the Robert Graves version as an adult, thank you very much.In short, Edith Hamilton's Mythology is highly recommended for your kids, or for you if you're delving into these marvelous stories for the first time. Oh yeah - it has really cool pen-and-ink illustrations throughout it as well. These are stories that have stood the test of time for 2000 years. What's not to like?"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Most inveterate readers, even those that consider themselves reasonably erudite, are all too often woefully lacking in Mythology 101. They may know that there may have been a labyrinth in which lurks a monster, but which monster, and where, and who killed it, is not on the tip of their tongue. In MYTHOLOGY, Edith Hamilton weaves together a tapestry of classical legend and mythos that attempts to makes sense out of man's earliest gropings in coming to terms with a universe that was at once totally unlike man himself and yet could be understood only imperfectly by analogies to himself.This book covers only Greek and Roman classical mythology. True, there is a brief concluding chapter on Norse gods, but essentially Hamilton presents only those timeless tales that form the basis of Western civilization. Hamilton posits a world that must have seemed fierce and forbidden to those Greeks and Romans who undoubtedly saw themselves as the highest paragons of sophisticates that the world had ever known. We in the twentieth century have the knowledge of the microverse and the macroverse to tell us the difference between what we do know and what we can know. Two milennia ago, the Greeks and the Romans had the equivalent in their classical mythologies. It must have seemed finely ground truth that the forces in the world on high could not have differed markedly from the world on low. When they looked skyward at a high mountain peak and heard a deep rumbling and saw bright flashes of fire, it could have meant only the presence of Zeus to the Greeks or Jupiter to the Romans. It is no further surprise that they carefully constructed a pantheon of gods who resembled themselves in human foibles and virtues even if their powers were beyond comprehension. Hamilton's book is a catalog of these traits with which the ancients would have found themselves comfortably familiar.Hamilton writes of these myths in seven parts, ranging from the greatest of gods to the lowest of gods to ordinary mortals who by their actions, were anything but ordinary. She begins each part with an informal but usefully chatty introduction that places that part into its proper historical/mythical/social context. She indicates the source of that myth, and where possible the work itself. Then Hamilton goes into a detailed summary of that myth in a way that reminds the reader of the later fairy tale, with which it is surely related. Her intention is not to present brand new material to the uninitiated, but to allow the reader to retread ground that might have slipped from memory. To such a reader, the list of names of gods, goddesses, and extraordinary mortals would not seem like a disconnected catalog of heavenly names from the Pantheonic Yellow pages, but more like a delightful stroll down memory lane that serves to remind the reader that we today may not be as wordly and knowledgable as the ancients surely considered themselves to be, but each of us, perhaps all of us, continually strive to explain the inexplicable in terms of the already familiar. Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY does this as well as any other book of its type."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I came to Hamilton's book with no background whatsoever in Greek (or any) Mythology. Being somewhat ashamed of this fact, I consulted the reviews here (at amazon) and my local library to find Hamilton's Mythology.I really did love reading this book. As breathtaking as it is, with so many names and alternate names to keep track of, I still thoroughly enjoyed the read. I wasn't submerged in the subject beyond my comfort level as a novice, but still found the content at hand extremely enlightening for the sake of analyzing western culture. Of course, there are myriad references to mythological stories and events even in modern literature and scholarship, so the overview I received from Hamilton helped me to understand some of those references that I recalled from my earlier readings in other subjects. I was appreciative of the fact that her book was as accessible as it was. Though others may have viewed her language as \\"dumbed-down\\", I thought her lack of condescension was very welcome, especially for my level of comprehension of the subject.Hamilton's book has opened the doors, so to speak.

The teacher formed a Latin Club which was part of the Ohio Junior Classical League, and all Latin students were invited to attend the annual Ohio JCL Convention in Columbus, OH, each year. Several contests were always provided, and one year I was on our quiz bowl team. The subject that year was Roman mythology. The Romans, of course, basically borrowed their myths from the Greeks, giving them Latin instead of Greek names. My teacher either gave me a copy of Edith Hamilton's Mythology or suggested that I purchase one for myself in preparation for the quiz bowl contest.The Greek-Roman myths draw from several widely different sources, including legends passed on by word of mouth from one generation to the next and literary dramas written by ancient playwrights. Edith Hamilton, a world-renowned classicist who was born in Germany, grew up in Ft. Wayne, IN, and graduated from Bryn Mawr, sought to provide some continuity to the stories. This book tells about the origins of the gods, the Graeco-Roman creation account, the earliest heroes, and many of the familiar stories like Cupid and Psyche, the Golden Fleece, Hercules, the Trojan War, the adventures of Odysseus and Aeneas, Midas, and other brief myths. There is also a short section at the end on Norse mythology. In addition, Hamilton authored two seminal works on ancient cultures, The Greek Way in 1930, and The Roman Way in 1932.As I have said before, homeschoolers are divided over studying the ancient Greek and Roman myths. Some feel that doing so somehow gives honor to pagan deities. Others believe that one can study the myths solely from a historical standpoint without giving any credence to their gods and, in fact, by so doing can find a clear distinction between idols and the one true God. My own view tends toward the latter. Even before I took Latin, I had always been interested in ancient mythology and read quite a few books or encyclopedia articles on the subject. Yet, I did not become a pagan. However, be forewarned. The Greek and Roman myths do contain a lot of immorality, as the ancients were well-equipped in making their gods in their own fallible image. With that understanding, those who wish to learn more about the Greek and Roman gods and heroes will find an excellent source of reading and study in Edith Hamilton's Mythology."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I was looking for a hardcover of Edith Hamilton's Mythology, specifically one that is printed on acid-free paper and truly bound, rather than glued.

Although the book covers Greek/Roman myths thoroughly, the Norse myths are touched upon only briefly, which is why I have given the book four stars rather than five. Nonetheless, the quality of the book is excellent, and it is useful as a volume to be read for entertainment, and as a classroom primer (I myself have taught a Mythology class using it as the primary textbook). Hamilton's retellings are engaging, and her scholasticism is evident throughout--a small example is her use of the less popular Roman names for the primary gods (Jupiter, Juno, Mars, etc.) when they are found in myths of Roman origin. Hamilton also includes information at the beginning of most chapters about the source of the myth and its author, which is very helpful. She synthesizes the longer myths, such as the Trojan War (found in the Iliad) and the quest for the golden fleece in such a way as to highlight their major events and give the reader a flavor of their content. Overall, I have not encountered a better survey of classical mythology in one volume. Incidentally, if the reader desires more information on the Norse Myths, I recommend Kevin Crossley-Holland's Norse Myths, which is also an excellent volume."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"\\"Mythology\\" covers all the major and most minor Greek, Norse and Roman gods, goddesses, stories and locales.

Upon looking at the list of other titles by Edith Hamilton (like \\"The Greek Way\\" and \\"The Roman Way\\"), I felt that this would be more of the history of mythology. This book is a blend of these two ideas.The book is not organized to be a quick reference. It tells the main stories and characters as well as gives a brief section on the minor figures. For each section, the author explains where she is getting the material (for instance, from Homer or from Ovid) with a little editorial comment. Then, she relates the myth. She is giving you the story, but it does not read like a story. It reads like a college instructor giving you the highlights of the story with the occasional comment.Although the bulk of the myths covered are either Greek or Roman, Hamilton does include some Norse mythology. Given the difference in worldview difference, I would like to have seen more contrasting of the differences.I found this book to be a great review of the Greek and Roman myths. I found that the differences between the Greek and Roman interpretations of the same basic myth to be very interesting. It is not a substitute for reading the myths themselves, and for this, Hamilton does mention the authors and, sometimes, the play or poem. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I have been trying to find a good book to tell the great stories of ancient mythology and this did it.

It provides a summarized version of nearly every significant Greek or Roman myth. Everything from Odysseus' journey to mere descriptions of all minor characters in this vast subject. However, its only good for beginners.Having a brief background in mythology prior to this book, I found it fun and disappointing. It was a good 400-page read, but the writing lacks. Hamilton's interest to keep things short makes the myth sometimes hard to understand and blazingly fast. While the latter isn't bad, if you're interested in reading the details for yourself, this isn't the right book.With the mediocre writing of Hamilton's (she uses &quot;stuff&quot; to describe elements in mythology, but that's just one problem), Mythology provides a decent overview of everything people need to know for the Greek and Roman theology.Another bothersome feature this book had was its chapter on Norse Mythology. It seemed that Edith Hamilton got bored of writing this book and jabbed the Norse Mythology section in to appropriately title the book. It lacks in any depth. Additionally, her narratives show that her enthusiasm for writing this book was nil.Once again, if you're a beginner and interested in mythology, buy the book. If not, you're better of with Bulfinch's Mythology or individual tales (Homer's Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid)."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This book offers an excellent introduction to Greek mythology, which I found accessible and engaging. Hamilton surveys a wide breadth of the most important and classic stories from both Greek and Roman Mythology. I find myself referring back to the book from time to time, to understand a passing reference to mythology.In her introduction, Hamilton demonstrates her grasp of the essential characteristics of Greek Mythology. She notes that the Greeks told stories that romanticized human life, rather than showing a grim or haunted Universe, as other early civilizations chose.She also astutely captures how humanized their stories were: &quot;In Greece alone in the ancient world people were preoccupied with the visible; they were finding the satisfaction of their desires in what was actually in the world around them. The sculptor watched the athletes contending in the games and he felt that nothing he could imagine would be as beautiful as those strong young bodies. So he made his statue of Apollo. [...] They had no wish to create some fantasy shaped in their own minds. All the art and all the thought of Greece centered in human beings.&quot;Indeed! And the fruits of their labor are timeless stories that enrapture us."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I originally read Edith Hamilton's book for a high school literature class. I've loved reading Greco-Roman mythology since childhood. The lives of the major Greco-Roman Gods and Goddesses were better than soap operas to me.When I began reading Edith Hamilton's book back in high school, I thought I'd enjoy reading this text. Although she conducts an excellent scholarly study of GrecoRoman myths, I didn't care for Edith Hamilton's writing style which starved much of the life, warmth, and beauty out of the original tales. She makes the myths sound like more like a comparative literary study than actual stories. It was a huge disappointment: Hamilton's style made GrecoRoman mythology feel like slow torture.I still own my original high school copy of Hamilton's Book. Even though I've finished college and am nearing the completion of grad school, my feelings regarding Edith Hamilton's book haven't changed one iota. Even after re-reading the text several times, it still reads as the same bland, boring, pretentious piece of drivel I read as a freshman in high school. I still, however, use her book as a supplemental reference text.This past week, I decided to pick up and read the alternative to Hamilton's work -- Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable when I began my private study of mythology after reading Joseph Campbell's \\"Pathways to Bliss\\" and \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces.\\" So far, I love Bulfinch's work and am enjoying it immensely. Bulfinch manages to infuse GrecoRoman myths with life and he manages to make the characters come alive with his storytelling. Bulfinch even include references to Greco Roman mythology in poetic citations. In addition, he even includes pronunciations of Greek/Roman names. Like Hamilton, he also includes alternative versions of myths in his text, but does it with a slight sense of humor. Bulfinch's book is a huge -- much bigger than Hamilton -- but, it's engrossing, interesting, and lively -- I've barely been able to put it down since starting it.Bulfinch's work has made me want to search for other alternative books as well to continue reading about GrecoRoman mythology.If you're looking for a short introductory comparative study of GrecoRoman mythology, then Edith Hamilton's work is for you. But, there are better studies out there in my opinion -- and I urge you to look for alternatives. If you want a text that's not dry, boring, and pendantic then it's hard to beat Bulfinch's Mythology's \\"The Age of Fable.\\""},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"I'm not going to review the contents of the book.

Because this book is a masterpiece and it belongs sitting on the top shelf of everyone's library. The amount of time and work Edith Hamilton must have spent collecting these stories from various sources and putting them together is incomprehensible. She then widdles them down to some of the finest and most comprehensible overviews of Greek mythology ever written. I'm glad that I chose to revisit this book once again."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"MYTHOLOGY is the text I was given when I first started teaching my mythology class for juniors and seniors. Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Not only does Edith Hamilton blandly summarize every story, but she leaves out many of the details that students are eager to absorb. Although I have great respect for the text since it was one of the first to bring Greek myth into an easily-accessible form, it is dated and a poor text for a high-school mythology class. Some teachers argue that the elevated language and confusing sentence structure is good practice for serious students, and it is in other contexts. But I am of the opinion that mythology should be fresh and exciting--as it was to the original myth-makers. As Thomas Bulfinch had said, \\"Thus we hope to teach mythology not as a study, but as a relaxation from study.\\" When a text makes its subject nearly impossible to appreciate, it's not worth it."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This Is One I First Read In High School And Have Returned To Often.Dame Edith's Reference Book Is The Definative Encyclopedia Of Mythology.This Is A Book That Can Be Read By Lovers Of Adventure At Any Age.Arranged In Interesting And Fun Chapters Starting With The Beginning Of The World Where Mother Earth And Father Heaven Give Birth To The Titans,To The Birth Of THEIR Children And How They Took Over The World When The Twelve Major Gods And Goddesses Overpowered Them,To The Forming Of Man And The Gift Of Woman To Him.From There It Branches To The Everyday Heros And The Children Of The Gods-Jason And The Argonauts,Hercules,Perseus And His Battle With Medusa,And Many More.All Of These Wonderous Stories Are Here To Enjoy Over And Over And Over Again.And You Can Find And Love Them In This Volume.It Even Includes Their Roman Counterparts And An Introduction To Egyptian Mythology As Well.You Won't Be Bored,And You Will Never Be Tired Of Them.What The Magic Of Reading Is Made Of."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"Hamilton's writings on Classical mythology are very easy to read, and give the general reader an intoductory view of the different myths.

Hamilton's a relaxed but formal author who wants to tell you as much as she can about the gods. The stories range from heroes, revenge, love, adventure, and there are even summaries of the Iliad, Odyssey, and Aeneid mixed in.For those of you reading mythology for the first time, you may not like Hamilton's style. She's as specific as anyone possibly could in less than 500 pages. But if you love mythology as much as I do and absorb all the stories you can find, you'll love her opinions on the authors and the stories. I felt like I was sitting in a chair with her reading it all too me, answering almost all of my questions without me saying a word with a charming air to each tale. I was in awe through out my journey through the good, the bad, and the gore of the Greeks, with some Norse thrown in at the end."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This book gives a great overview to all the major stories that are prevalent in Greek and Latin mythology. She does a good job of explaining where she took her source information from and why at the beginning of each chapter, which is good because there are many stories that were told by more than one major Greek poet, and then modified when the Romans took over. Included in the book are descriptions of the major and minor gods and goddesses, and information about them is compiled from the major stories in a condensed format, so that you can get the full picture of how each was depicted in the section. It also describes the great heroes (Perseus, Hercules) and their many adventures, and takes a whole chapter to condense the Iliad in a format that is much easier to read. It does the same for the Odyssey. It then describes the tragedies, most chiefly those of Oedipus, and at the end there is a little section on Norse myths, which have been made popular by Wagner's operas. At the end of the book are family trees, which really help to display how the gods and heroes and major characters are interrelated. All in all a very informative book that is easy to read. Highly recommended for every mythology buff.Other books to consider:The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley, American Indian Myths and Legends by Richard Erdoes, and Chinese Ghost and Love Stories by Pu Singling"},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This is the best single book I've ever seen on classical mythology. An interesting feature is that instead of treating mythology as a monolithic collection of stories, she thinks that the personality and intent of each ancient writer was important: she contrasts the early writers to whom the myths were sacred to later ones like Ovid who considered them entertainment. When commenting on the Hercules cycle, she starts with a discussion of the intellectual hero vs the strong-man hero. Her section on Norse mythology has been criticized as too brief, but she did get the essential difference: the somber Odin foreseeing his tragic downfall is a complete contrast to the capricious Greek gods who never have to fear death or even pain, and represent a crucial difference between Greek and Viking culture. A myth was almost always told for a reason, whether to entertain or to embody the culture that created it."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This book is designed more for the beginner in Mythology.

The book will also validate the contention that if God did not exist, man would have invented him. The Greek gods are portrayed with human foibles: jealousy, anger, trickery. No god was all-powerful. Zeus, for instance, is depicted as being fallible in many ways. Hera was constantly getting the best of him.When Hamilton turns to the Greek heroes, we once again see how these characters were fashioned according to prevailing value system. Theseus shuns the kingdom of Athens for that of commander-in-chief. He wants to people to be free. We see him in action when the Athenians invade Thebes to force them to bury the five remaining champions who had died trying to elevate Polyneices to Oedipus's vacated thrown. When the King of Argos asks for his help, he calls an assembly to decide. When they conquer the city, he will not let his soldiers sack the city, insisting that the army came only to bury the dead. He then prepares the bodies for burial with his own hands.Two of the most interesting of the gods are Dionysus and Demeter, the two gods most concerned with humanity. Hamilton uses them to show how winter came about. Demeter's daughter Persephone was kidnapped by Hades, God of the Underworld. When Demeter brought blight to the world, Zeus negotiated a deal whereby for a third of the year Persephone would live in the underworld. In Dionysus's case winter is that time of the year when the God of the Vine was pruned, only the bare stalk remaining. In the springtime, he would revive. He was the assurance that death does not end all. His worshippers believed that his death and resurrection showed that the soul lives on forever after the body dies.In the last two chapters, Hamilton turns to Norse mythology. The most fascinating thing about them is that they were so fatalistic. The Gods knew that in the end evil would win out and they would be destroyed. The most important thing to the Norse was that they show courage in the face of death."},{"Title":"MYTHOLOGY","review":"This mythology books is one of the most comprehensive and cmplete books I have ever read.
