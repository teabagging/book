After his On the Beach and A Town Like Alice, the rest of his works are almost totally ignored by both the critics and the public, which is a pity as almost all of his works are finely written and have something worthwhile to say.Pastoral was written during WWII, and from a purely British viewpoint, unlike so many of the war books that were written long after the conflict by so many Americans. As such there is a totally different atmosphere to this book, a quietness, an acceptance of the conditions and requirements of the war as just something that is there, part of the daily routine. And it is within this atmosphere that Neville constructs a fine love story between the very experienced bomber pilot Peter Marshal (at age 22!) and a W.A.A.F signals officer, Gervase Robertson.As perhaps is typical for war-time love stories, the war itself provides the conflict, the friction between the lovers, as Peter is duty-bound to continue flying bombing missions, and Gervase believes her own duties are important to the course of the war, and should not be given up merely to get married. Her decline of Peter's offer of marriage sends Peter into a mental tail-spin, seriously impacting his efficiency as a flyer. How this conflict is resolved and the events that happen because of this conflict form the main portion of this book. Before reaching that point, however, we are treated to a view of English morality and customs of the day, a code that says one mustn't go off alone with a member of the opposite sex, that married woman are expected to keep house, not have jobs, where the woman must defer to the man. A view that might seem dreadfully stifling and old-fashioned to a reader of today's world, but it shown in such a non-obtrusive way that the reader can accept it without question. Until, that is, the reader finishes the book, and realizes that Neville has been quietly showing (and mildly satirizing) both the good and bad qualities of such a code. This is typical of Nevil's writing - his points are made far more by showing, rather than telling, always a mark of a fine writer. Also noteworthy is the attitude towards the war that is displayed by all the characters here - that death is an everyday happening, but it won't happen to me, it only happens to someone else. An attitude that seems to belong to every young person.Nevil's prose style tends towards the descriptive, especially of the countryside and everyday actions. His dialogue in this book is loaded with English slang, very typical of actual speech patterns of the day, but this does at times make it somewhat hard for the poor modern American reader to decode what is being said. And some of Nevil's expertise as an avionics engineer shows in his descriptions of the aircraft and the functioning of various parts of these machines, at times obviously assuming that reader knows more about aircraft than is normally the case. These, however, are very minor negatives, almost totally subsumed by the engagement of the reader in the story of these two very well realized characters.One decided negative that has nothing to do with Nevil's writing ability is the production quality of the hardbound reprint edition. The typeface used is very close to an old typewriter font, with thin serifs and a fairly small point size, and the printing press seemed to have severe difficulty with maintaining an even ink flow - at places the print fades to near illegibility. This all makes for a very rough impact on your eyes. A pity that this fine work has such a botched job of production.Regardless of the quality of the printing, however, this book deserves a look, if nothing else just to see how a romance really should be written, as opposed to the material that passes for 'romance' on the book racks of today."},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"I have 3 favorite novels which I reread every couple of years. Like old friends, I know that I can always turn to them and be sure of several hours of deep pleasure. This is one of those novels. PASTORAL was written during World War 2 and concerns two young people who are serving in the military, but as the title indicates, this is not your typical war novel. Peter Marshall is a veteran pilot of an RAF Wellington bomber, even though he is still a very young man. The flying scenes are excellent, filled with suspenseful atmosphere and excitement. But when he is not in the air, he is the kind of person who takes delight in the simple pleasures of life, rambling over the countryside and fishing with his crew. And after he meets a lovely WAAF officer, Gervase Robertson, who has just joined the signals staff at his airbase, it doesn't take him long to fall in love for the first time. The love story of these two rather innocent and ordinary young people is as real as you'll find in literature, perfectly tracing the progress of their attraction and growing feeling for each other, all intensified by the immense conflict in which they play their small part. True to that time, this does not mean that they are in bed by the second date--no, these are typical, decent youngsters who accept the idea that that sort of thing must wait until marriage. Gervase does not want to give up her part in the war effort to get married, and the tension begins to affect Peter's flying and his relationship with his crew. As one of the senior officers complains exasperatedly, &quot;The great adventure on this station isn't bombing Germany. They don't think anything of that. Falling in love is the big business here.&quot; Eventually we see that maybe falling in love is the big business after all, as the young people come to exemplify all that is best, all that is worth fighting to preserve. Nevil Shute wrote several excellent novels, but I believe that this is his best. It is a shame that it is so hard to find, but used copies are available--and well worth the hunt."},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"This is, in my opinion, Nevil Shute's best book, surpassing even such justifiably popular titles as &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;A Town like Alice&quot;. With restraint and a simple, moving style Nevil Shute brings out the best in human spirit by telling this story of young people rising to the dangers and challenges of war and prevailing through dedication, comradeship and love. Why is a book like this out of print when bookstore shelves are full of stories about addicts, perverts and criminals? We desperately need more people like Nevil Shte's characters to serve as role models."},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"What is most remarkable about Pastoral is the way it manages to blend love and tragedy in an almost seamless manner. What would have been a rather conventional love story is transformed into something very different by the ever-present risk of death. RAF pilot Peter Marshall and WAAF signals officer Gervase Robinson go through an awkward and sometimes amusing courtship seemingly unconcerned about the fact that each one of his bomber missions over Germany could very easily be his last - indeed, some of the characters we meet during the story are lost over Germany. That they are able to function in a reasonably normal manner in the most terrifyingly abnormal of circusmstances is a tribute to the strength of the human spirit. In a way, this foreshadows Nevil Shute's much later book On the Beach, in which people are able to function day-to-day despite knowing that the world is soon coming to an end. A lesser writer than Shute probably would have made Pastoral heavy-handed and preachy, but there is almost none of that. All in all, a superb book, a truly timeless story despite its setting.As an aside, the last few paragraphs of the story make me wonder whether it is based on true events."},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"'Pastoral' brings a personal touch to the concerns of my father's generation during one of most difficult and eventful periods of the 20th century; when our parents went to war, lost spouses, found spouses, shared a tragic and memorable time of their and others' lives.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it highly for those who enjoy character development, subtle humor, and good, realistic drama."},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"... and bringing it to the flight station marks the unusual beginning of an exquisite and delicate love story between RAF pilot Peter Marshall and flight officer Gervase Robertson.The story takes place in the midst of world war II terror and describes, in spellbinding detail, the flight missions over Germany, the dangers of cross fire and courage, during times when others have fear.Peter's cockiness (not always at the right times), competence (in dodging enemy fire and bringing his crew home), and courage (in face of danger) win the reader's heart and make him a hero at his home station, even though he comes very close to losing is all: his aircraft, his crew and Gervase.A marvelous story, despite its unusual start: catching a fish!Perhaps this is Nevil Shute's best; his detail about the cold technicalities of cockpit war activity, set against the depths of an unforgettable love story makes \\"Pastoral\\" stand out above anything to be imagined. He just never ceases to surprise his readers!"},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"Set against the backdrop of a British bomber station during the Second WW, this story charts the life of a pilot, his girlfriend and the crew of his Wellington bomber, 'M for Mother'. The crew have safely flown over 50 missions together but then things start going dangerously wrong. Is it simply the enforced absence from their favourite pastime, fishing, or is there a deeper reason? As the story reaches its gripping climax the human face of conflict is starkly portrayed. You WILL be moved by this story !"},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"This is a lovely novel set on an RAF station during the war. Peter Marshall is a pilot who has made over 50 missions, making him one of the \\"old men\\" of the station at the age of 22. He meets a girl, who is a WAAF officer working on radio communications with the bombers during their missions. Her job is similar to that held by the WAAF character in Herman Wouk's great novelThe Winds of War. In this case, the story is about two people and the stresses placed upon them in war. Shute has written other novels on the same theme, such asMost Secret, which concerns naval officers and commandoes. In this story, the title comes from their lives when not on missions. The young men in Marshall's crew find fishing in nearby streams to be a diversion and the early part of the story is about the fish they catch. Soon, he becomes quite fond of Gervaise, the young woman, but she still is highly motivated to do her duty in the war and gently tries to rebuff his affection. He is hurt by this and his relations with his crew suffers. Finally, on a mission, his distraction leads to a serious mistake in navigation and they are very nearly lost.With considerable luck, and his flying skill, they manage a crash landing at another station. While their plane is repaired, Peter and Gervaise come to an understanding. She realizes that her rebuff has hurt him deeply. The wing commander and squadron commander realize that their senior pilot, one they depend upon to steady the young newcomers, is distracted by his failed romance. Even the battleaxe WAAF senior officer, called the \\"Queen WAAF\\" by the others, becomes interested in the affair. There is a tender scene with an old lady whose home has a fish pond, stocked with trout by her brigadier son for his return.The story has, as another reviewer noted, a sort of melancholy but peaceful tone that must have been common in England as she fought for her life. Shute was too old for combat service at the time and worked in military matters as a reserve officer. The novel Most Secret is supposed to be based on much of this. He was an aircraft pioneer and engineer plus he was a sailor, owning his own yacht before the war. I have read about a dozen of his novels and have yet to find one I disliked. This is one of his best, fit to be placed with A Town Like Alice, Most Secret, The Far Country, No Highway and Trustee From the Toolroom. On the Beach came out when I was in college and scared me so badly that I still cannot read it again. It is excellent and the horrific future it predicted has faded from reality so this generation should enjoy it.I definitely recommend this book. He has three phases of his writing; pre-war, wartime, which this novel is an example of, and post-war. The last phase is mostly about Australia although Trustee is set in England, Hawaii, Tahiti and America. I have read all his post-war novels and they are all excellent. The war-time books I am working my way through and have read this one and Most Secret. They are also excellent. I would recommend those books (Those I named) as the place to start if you are unfamiliar with his work. They all tend to be about technical subjects like flying and to have romance. They are also sentimental and usually have happy endings although On the Beach is the great exception. There is a reason why his writing is still popular nearly 50 years after his death. His character development is far superior to 95% of modern writers of popular fiction.I should add that I found a very nice used copy that must be an early edition with leather binding. It is even bound with a small ribbon as a place mark."},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"This is one of the most moving and enjoyable books I've ever read.

And Pastoral was another terrific book! Although I was a so-called post-war baby, born after WWII in 1951, I never made the connection between my birth and the war years. Pastoral gave me insight into the years just prior to my birth. I enjoyed the flying that was woven into this story. Pastoral takes one to the brink of disaster and then ... well, read the book!"},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"I discovered Shute during college, and like another reviewer, On The Beach was both gripping and terrifying. I should read it again, but am reading all the others first.I listened to the audible.com recording with Frank Muller as the reader. He makes a truly wonderful story even better! As with Trustee from the Toolroom, this book has some parts which will leave you totally sucked in, and unable to stop. I found myself pacing frantically as I listened during the two incredible flights over Germany.Peter, a slightly rebelious RAF pilot is willing to go out on a limb, whether it is to ask the cleaner to fetch his morning tea or in taking risks to bring back his plane and all aboard safely.Gervase is a young woman who feels that she wants more out of life than just finishing school and settling down to domestic bliss. She is thoughtful and conflicted toward Peter. The growing attraction between the two, set against and in the midst of WWII makes this a book to read and reread.I am not scientifically inclined, but I find Shute's descriptions of flight and planes or boats fascinating. I love his attention to detail, and his understated way of telling a story. His characters are flawed, but for the most part, decent and struggling people. Shute lived at a time when much less was expected in the way of wealth, possessions or immediate gratification. There is no graphic sex (none, actually) and no plethora of obscenities. Yet, without these, he wrote novel after novel which were absolute gems. This ranks almost as high in my estimation as Trustee from the Toolroom. If you like listening to a well done book, check out Muller's superb performance. He even sings--on key, too."},{"Title":"Pastoral","review":"A wonderful book from WW2 era about romance in war time. Shute's story of two lovers and the effect of their romance on a plane crew and their station's commanding officers is Shute at his very best, which is unbeatable.

He was swept overboard a ferry and was rescued by a ship called The Ghost and for months dealt with the hardships of a violently abusive captain and untrusting seal hunters. But he also learned the way of sea life and how to stand on his own two feet for once. I found this book a pretty good read because of the story line and how this one character survived being on the ship with such a raw and violent captain. The only thing that I found hard to comprehend was the advanced vocabulary when the main character would describe something or someone, just because I didn&#8217;t know many of the words and it made me lose my spot in some parts.

I didn't know at first it was written over seventy five years ago. To my surprise it was a great read. The words flowed and the descriptions of things was far better than writers of today. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I will give my personal opinions and insights I gained from this book. You can read detailed plot summaries elsewhere.The most exciting aspect of London's writing here is his narration of Humphrey Van Weyden's thoughts, his psychological reactions to Captain \\"Wolf\\" Larson and the conditions he finds himself in aboard the Ghost. Larson is first introduced as an ubermensch-like caricature, a feared tyrant with superhuman strength. In the early parts of the book Larson is idolized for his ideals of toughness and self-reliance which are in stark contrast to Humphrey's pampered upbringing. He is feared and admired for his great strength, even while he is simultaneously hated for his extreme cruelty and pettiness. As the book progresses, Larson's complexity is slowly revealed through his interaction with Humphrey. It turns out that Larson, despite his brutality, is a brilliant self-educated man. Humphrey is the only person with enough education to have an intellectual dialog with the Larson, but Larson's newfound favoritism for Humphrey creates tension between Humphrey and the other crew members.Later on the more vulnerable side of Larson emerges. He is afflicted with severe headaches and bouts of depression. At the same time the social Darwinist microcosm he created on board the Ghost begins to backfire on him. Needless violent conflicts, uprisings, and acts of mutiny are common. The only thing that unites the crew is their shared fear and hatred for Larson.Later Humphrey finds companionship with an educated writer, Maud, who happens aboard the ship. They fall in love and together decide to escape to an island. Humphrey's relationship with Maud and their struggle to survive causes Humphrey to re-evaluate his stance on individualism somewhat. It's shown that love and empathy can also be a source of strength that enhances the will to survive.Towards the end of the book the Ghost washes up on the island. Larson's crew has abandoned him and he is seen going mad. He is afflicted with a brain tumor and dies in front of Humphrey. Though not explicitly stated, I got the impression that the brain tumor could be an explanation for Larson's sociopath tendencies. Larson's lack of empathy is a weakness, not strength as originally assumed.Anyways, these are my insights. I can't give 5 stars because though there are a few places where the story gets slightly bogged down. The portion of the book about Humphrey's love affair with Maud on the island could have been better. Also, some might not have patience for all the nautical detail. It's easy to skim past the slow parts though."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London I only discovered over the past five years, which by all relative standards is very strange, since I studied creative writing in college, and was an avid reader of the classics as a youth. I despised the classics as a youth, :), but now appreciate most of them during my formative years of understanding literature and the novel.'Call of the Wild' certainly ingnited my senses to the prose power of London, and it was by an odd encounter and chance that a distant friend handed it to me in passing, that I discovered the magic talent of London and his epic sea story of 'The Sea Wolf.'Arguably, \\"Wolf Larsen\\" is one of the greatest characters in literature. He is vibrant, total, fitting for the role in which he is written; belivable, enigmatic and actually quite charming in that raw sense of hostility.However even though Wolf slowly descends into the abyss of madness, he has the mental capacity to be childlike and endearing. In this passage in particular...{\\"Wolf Larsen underwent another bad attack of headache which lasted two days. He must have suffered severely, for he called me in, and obeyed my commands like a sick child...at my suggestion, however, he gave up smoking and drinking; though why such a magnificent animal as he should have headaches at all puzzles me.\\"}...we see an almost patent adolescence in Wolf, and London paints the potrait of the ironclad rascle, as human, with emotions and tenderness that even in the rank hollowness of declamation and ruthlessness, we can see a yearning for sympathy.That is magical.This is one to give to grandkids, your own kids, or to share with others. It holds a special place in my heart this book, and on my shelf next to \\"Master and Commander.\\"Thank you."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Although the time frame of this book is set in the 1700's, the language used makes the book so masterful. It should not be read by people with a low reading skill, as it can be hard to understand in some parts, which is what makes it such a interesting book. After reading a page or two so much can be analyzed. For instance, in the end of the book it can be similar to the movie Cast Away. The same scene takes place and two of the main characters are fighting for their lives. The novel is full of adventure and action takes place constantly. It may be epic fighting scenes or terrific storms, but know matter what this novel will keep you reading on edge."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This very powerful story about a brutal sea captain and the effect that his depravity and evil have on anyone that he is in contact with is a true adventure story as well. Jack London knew how to tell a story, and this book is a page-turner. Not only that, it has some of the best descriptions of sailing one of the old \\"tall ships\\" I've ever read. There is a chapter in the book that is a superb description of sailing one of these ships in a bad storm. Mr. London's descriptions of this and other catastrophic events at sea is so realistic that the reader sees it all as he or she reads it. London's political ideology does show through in spots. London was a firm believer in Socialism, and he does put forth these ideas at times in the book. His villain - Wolf Larsen, is the most evil man you'll ever encounter between the covers of a novel. The development of Humphrey from an ineffectual, bookish type of man, to a man that can subsist on his own wits and by the actual use of his own hands is the common thread that runs through the book. Even though he is in close proximity to the evil Larsen, Humphrey does not let Larsen's depravity change his own morals and his own essential goodness."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This book differs somewhat from London's other novels. One thing that is great for a younger reader is that the book is written through the main character's perspective, which makes understanding him easier for the reader. The events that occur in the first 100 pages come fast one after the other leaving the reader wondering what could possibly come next, and then to me as well as some other reviewers the novel begins to slow down especially with the entrance of the female. Overall the story is great and the characters are easy to understand, and London's writing style makes it simple to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I thought there was wonderful character development. London made me feel as if I actually knew the people as well as he did. He used fantastic visual imagery and if I closed my eyes I could see the action take place. He used many sailing terms I was unfamiliar with and to more thoroughly enjoy the book I would suggest any reader brush up on sailing vocabulary and parts of a sailing vessel."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Humphrey van Weyden is a gentleman. He has never had to work for his living, or do a single task for himself. All that changes when the ferry-steamer Martinez, running across the mouth of the San Francisco Bay, is wrecked after a collision with another boat in the fog. Van Weyden is tossed into the sea, and eventually picked up by another boat. But this is no ordinary boat. It is the Ghost, a seal-hunting schooner captained by Wolf Larsen, who is far from being an ordinary man. He snickers at Van Weyden's offers of money in exchange for taking him to shore, and instead conscripts the unfortunate man to replace a recently-deceased member of the Ghost's crew. Van Weyden's trials encompass far more than merely learning how to work on a ship. He must also find his place in the strange web of heirarchy among the men. More precarious yet is his relationship with the captain.We soon find out that Wolf Larsen is a monster of a man, possessing superhuman strength and a complete lack of deference to any idea of morals. He is certainly one of the most fascinating characters I've come across in my reading. You fear him, you hate him, and yet there is still something to admire about him. He commands respect. He can kill a man with the strength of his hands alone, but he is also something of a self-educated philosopher. He has clearly studied Darwin, and continually likens life to a ferment of yeast, in which the natural way of things is for the stronger to consume the weaker. And yet, despite Larsen's superhuman image, London manages to keep him plausible for the reader by giving him his own Achilles's heel, which becomes more and more apparent as the story progresses. \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" is worth reading for a character study of this man alone. Unfortunately, however, the second half of the book shifts its focus, losing sight of the Van Weyden-Larsen relationship and simultaneously losing much of the driving force behind the story.Almost as soon as Maud Brewster entered the story, I began to lose interest. Shipwrecked and adrift in a small boat, she is picked up by the Ghost much as Van Weyden was. She, too, is refused passage to land. And inevitably, a romance develops between Brewster and Van Weyden. The story makes an abrupt change in course from one of survival and complex relationships between the ship's men, to that of a love story. But what a silly and unconvincing love story it is! London just doesn't write women well, nor does he make the relationship between Van Weyden and Brewster in any way believable. Maud is a flat character, and just doesn't seem real. She is also full of ridiculous contradictions. She is alternately described as a frail lily and a cavewoman. She bestows the name of Lucifer on Wolf Larsen, but turns all to pity and mush the moment he is struck by one of his headaches. The story would have been much better with romance left out and the focus kept on Van Weyden's personal struggle with Larsen.The strength of this book definitely lies in its first half. London's writing is strong and vivid, and he does a superb job of capturing the nuances of each relationship between crew members. I only wish he had stuck to that. Every writer has his niche, and London's is not in the romance genre. The second part of the book is contrived, predictable, and does little to hold one's interest. The ending is dissatisfying. It is, however, worth finishing in order to discover what end comes to the aforementioned Wolf Larsen. This is the only element of the latter part of the book that really intrigued me. So read \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" for its adventure component, found in the first half, and read it for the wonderfully crafted character of Captain Larsen. But don't expect too much out of the latter half and its conclusion."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is not a book that one easily forgets. True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm.Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him.There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world, his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London had in fact sailed on ships like the Ghost. This is one reason that the portraits of the sailors are so accurate. Also, it's why the storm episode rings so true. The book is worth reading for those reasons alone. London's own struggles with philosophy and ideas seem to be voiced by Wolf Larsen."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"&quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; by Jack London is about a young man who is forced to work on a sealing schooner after he is rescued from a ferry accident. The title comes from the captain of the schooner whose name is Wolf Larson. Larson is a cruel and brutal man who, while on his ship, lives by his own rules. His morals are very shallow and he places little, if any, value on others' lives. The story continues in portraying the life of Humphrey, the young man, and how he copes with the brutality of sea life and how he adapts to their way of life. Later on in the story a new angle comes in when the sealing schooner picks up a lost boat and brings abourd a female. The men don't often encounter females seeing that their work is hard and they are out on their hunting trips most of the year. So this brought a whole new perspective and the men didn't know how to act. Larson, on the other hand, didn't change much. Humphrey got to know the woman and became attracted to her for she was much like him interest wise. So one night, when everyone was asleep, Humphrey and the woman, Maud Brewster, secretly got into one of the hunting boats and escaped the ship in the fog. After they were on the tiny boat for a long time they began to doubt themselves and their survival. But then they spotted an island and landed there. They made their own shelter and killed seals, like the hunters did, for food. Then one morning they awoke to find the dreaded Ghost docked at their beach. They were terrified, but soon learned that the ship's crew had abandoned ship and only Larson was left. Larson had been inflicted with a horrible disease and he went blind and his body slowly began to deteriorate. After he died Humphrey and Maud repaired the Ghost and sailed back to the mainland. I personally liked this story very much because it was interesting and it kept my attention. It made me want to keep reading the story to find out what obstacle that Humphrey had to overcome next. It had a great plot and I'd recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Great Jack London work. A nice departure from the Yukon. Very well written characters and progression through the tale."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"- nothing in the mind that did not pass through one of the five senses. This is the typical attitude of the 19th century scientific materialist. Wolf Larsen, the cruel captain of the ship on which the innocent gentleman, Humphrey van Weyden, is brought by a whim of destiny, is an amazingly strong and savage example of this attitude. An attitude that is still incredibly vivid in the 21st century. People who can't believe in or perceive anything that is non-substantial, out of reach of their sensual capabilities, find their strongest and most concentrated example in Wolf Larsen. From this viewpoint the world is nothing but a more or less differentiated chaos of 'the strong eats the weak' underpinned with some so-called fortifying philosophy and a (maybe misunderstood) Darwin.A bit disappointed i was that the author offered no guideline how to change the attitude of this kind of people, how not only to defend oneself against this dismal philosophy but maybe open a small crevice to the other-world for all the Wolf Larsen's out there. Probably everyone has to find out by oneself, everyone has to go through such a confrontation with this mental (and sometimes physical) crudeness and, if he doesn't perish in such an encounter, he might arise from it more strongly as Humphrey van Weyden, the sissyish gentleman-hero in this story, does.At any rate Jack London once again shows his talent to desribe the chemistry between people who seem to share nothing at all, the transformations of souls in a merciless environment, depicting souls which don't believe even in the existence of souls.chapter 3, p.24: A laugh went up at my appearance - ...a laugh that was as rough and harsh and frank as the sea itself that arose out of coarse feelings and blunted sensibilities from natures that knew neither courtesy not gentleness. / ...The eyes [of Wolf Larsen] ...They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises... eyes that could brood with the hopeless somberness of leaden skies, that could snap and crackle points of fire like those which sparkle from a whirling sword, that could grow chill as an arctic landscape, and yet again, that could warm and soften and be all adance with lovelights, intense and masculine...chapter 5, p.44: \\"...By the way, do you believe in the immortal soul ?\\" - His lids lifted lazily as he asked the question, and it seemed that the deeps were opening to me and that I was gazing into his soul. But it was an illusion. Far as it might have seemed, no man has ever seen very far into Wolf Larsen's soul, or seen it at all; of this I am convinced. It was a very lonely soul, I was to learn, that never unmasked, though at rare moments it played at doing so.chapter 7, p.62: [Wolf Larsen:] \\"...Of course life is valueless, except to itself. And i can tell you that my life is pretty valuable just now - to myself. ...what is this condition in which i find myself ? This joy of living ? This exultation of life ? This inspiration, I may well call it ? It is what comes when there is nothing wrong with one's digestion, when his stomach is in trim and his appetite has an edge, and all goes well. It is the bribe for living, the champagne of the blood, the effervescence of the ferment, that makes some men think holy thoughts and other men to see God...\\"chapter 8, p.63f: ...I am convinced that he [Wolf Larsen] is the perfect type of the primitive man born a thousand years or generations too late and an anchronism in this culminating century of civilization. He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced type. ...There is no congeniality between him and the rest of the men aboard ship. His tremendous virility and mental strength wall him apart. They are more like children to him ...Or else he probes them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist, groping about in their mental processes and examining their souls as though to see of what soul-stuff is made.chapter 10, p.79: ...Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding. The white-skinned, fairhaired savages who created that terrible pantheon were of the same fiber as he. The frivolity of the laughter-loving Latins is no part of him. When he laughs it is from a humor that is nothing else than ferocious. But he laughs rarely; he is too often sad. / p.81: ..He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.chapter 16, p.121: [Wolf Larsen:]\\"... He is living more royally than any man for'ard, though he does not know it. For he has what they have not - purpose, something to do and be done, an all-absorbing end to strive to attain, the desire to kill me, the hope that he may kill me. Really, Hump, he is living deep and high. I doubt that he has ever lived so swiftly and keenly before, and I honestly envy him sometimes when I see him raging at the summit of passion and sensibility\\""},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London relates a probing analysis of the captain of the sealing ship Ghost, Wolf Larsen, through the eyes of shipmate Humphrey Van Weyden. Van Weyden had been plucked from the freezing waters of San Francisco bay by Larsen after the ferry boat he was a passenger on, capsized after a collision in the fog. Larsen, ever the opportunist, forces Van Weyden to work on the ship. Van Weyden a book critic and \\"gentleman\\" has never done a days work in his life.Through the insights of Van Weyden we see the cruel, combative, physically imposing and yet highly intelligent Larsen act as if a god over his domain, the Ghost. He holds the fate of his crew in his hands and murders those who he deems unfit. Under the tutelage of Larsen, Van Weyden becomes a capable sailor. After 5 more castaways are rescued at sea including a woman, Maud Brewster, Van Weyden and the woman make their escape by stealing a sealing boat. Van Weyden and Brewster are to fall in love and are stranded on a deserted island. Through a quirk of fate they are again confronted by Larsen, who is marooned and shipwrecked on the same island. There they observe his ultimate and deserved demise.The book was tied up into too neat a little package for my taste. London spends an awful lot of time, and boringly so, on his philosophies of life. I was hoping for another Moby Dick and was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"A Review by BrianThis book is about The Ghost, a ship, whose captain&#65533;s name is Wolf Larson and another man named Humphrey Van Wyden. They are the captain and first mate of the Ghost. They were traveling to San Francisco from somewhere in Europe. On the way lots of things happen to them. Maud, a lady on the ship with Wolf and Humphrey, was a cook and was always kept warm by two thick blankets at night.I didn&#65533;t like the action because there isn&#65533;t a lot of it in this book. If there was more action it would be a lot better of book. Without a lot of action books aren&#65533;t as good as they could be.Something I really liked about this book was the dialogue. It was like old English. It made the book seem more of a medieval type of book. Another thing I really liked was that I was real easy for me to read.

This book has a lot of description, character and plot. Don't look for intriguing plot or simplistic description. This book has quite a bit of underlying theme. It deals with work ethic, individualism, ideals, and materialism. Jack London, as a American writer, puts many thematic characteristics of American literaure into this book.

The story started off very exciting but then slowed down to a near crawl for most of the middle. There never was really any climax what so ever; I was looking for it the entire book but never found it. The plot was very predictable. I knew exactly what would happen the entire time which really ruined it for me. The ending was very cheesy and predictable. The protagonist is basically a wuss, and his extremely feminine viewpoint and talking style quickly became irritating. The book is LITTERED with nautical and sailing terms and half the time I didn't know what the narrator was talking about. The book isn't the best read I've experienced. I'll probably be staying away from Jack London from now on."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Other reviewers have given plenty of descriptions, so I won't bother. Suffice it to say it was a good story about a man finding himself under harsh conditions."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The book that I read was The Sea Wolf by Jack London. The story is about sailors that are out trying to carry cargo to a nearby port and then a lot of different things begin to happen. The book kind of starts out slow and then begins to pick up and gets better by the middle of the book. There are a lot of places in the book that it is going strong and then it cuts out and ends up getting weaker. Even though there are some weak spots if you keep with it, it will be worth the long wait. It is also a good book because it deals with real life crises that would really happen aboard a boat in the 1950's.The book would be great for someone who loves adventure books. This book takes place on the open water the whole story. It involves hunters, cooks,The strengths in this book are that there are a lot of details. Some of the detail that Jack London puts into the story gives you pictures in your head and you also kind of feel like you are leaving your seat and are actually in the story. Also that there is a great deal of understanding and you never feel that you are lost in the book you always know where you are. The detail is very specific sometimes you can feel like you are touching the exact same that that some of the other characters.Then some of the weaknesses that were in the story were that some of the words that he chose had really nothing to do with what he was explaining or trying to say. Even when it would be a really strong statement that he is making it would be strong then all of a sudden it would be weak and you would kind of forget what he is talking about. Also if you felt like you were in the story then you would leave your imagination and go back to reading it because it would be so boring.In conclusion the book should be for people who like adventures and suspense. The book overall was very good has a lot of detail and would have been even better if their were not so many weak spots. People would enjoy this book no mater what age group you are. Over all you should at least try it out and then make a decision"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"i think that this book isn't what i thought it would be. being a 13 year old, i had to read this book for school. i bought this book thinking that it was great after reading the back of the book and the reviews here at amazon.com. when i read the book, my classmates and i talked about how boring the book was and that it had no climaxing plot or any interesting points. then again this is just a point of vie of a some teenagers. to me, i wouldn't suggest this book to any teenager i know."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I have to read this book for summer vacation.

The captain of The Ghost is Wolf Larsen a brutal and vicious seaman who cares for life as little as wealth and holds nothing dear including his crew, a vicious gang of outlaws and renegades. The only thing he even lays claim to is his ship. Although he is so heartless and evil he and Van Weyden seem to get a connection, mainly of Van Weyden's fear of Larsen.

The book is superbly written, but for a book to be included in a list such as the Easton Press collection of &quot;The 100 greatest books ever written&quot;, it should be able to hold its own not only for style, but also for the tale itself, the &quot;myth&quot; behind it. The Sea Wolf does a fantastic job of building such a myth for about two-thirds of the novel. Then Ms Brewster appears, and suddenly the plot peters out. What begins as a gripping, sobering account of life at sea under a ruthless captain and a brutal crew, ends as a bland, unconvincing account of childish romance and &quot;survival&quot;. If London had only combined this book's literary richness with the heart-rending plot of The Call of the Wild or White Fang, he would be truly immortal."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"For those modern readers who find the second half of the book unsatisfactory, I ask you to ponder the following: Was Jack London inspired by the real-life characters of Sir John Franklin and Lady Jane (Griffin) Franklin and the events of the 1840's relating to the doomed expedition of the Canadian Northwest Passage? Were Wolf Larsen's headaches, psychological state, numbness, tingling and weakness symptoms of lead poisoning from the solder that sealed the Ghost's tinned food supply? Was Jack London trying to show Victorians how to survive in life-and-death situations instead of making the same mistakes as Franklin's well-read, materialistic crew who refused to give up their silver plates and crystal decanters after they were shipwrecked? Was London trying to show that even physical weakness, inexperience and lack of skill can all be overcome by cool-headed decision making, and an ability to adapt to novel and challenging situations?Wikipedia was used as a source contributing to the ideas expressed in this review."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The plot centers around a young aristocratic man Humphrey Van Weyden, who is shipwrecked and picked up by a passing boat heading to Japan to hunt seal. The boat is led by Captain Wolf Larsen, a cynical man free of any moral beliefs. The atrocities committed on this boat, the Ghost, shape Van Weyden into a new man, tougher and more in tune with reality. He is no longer \`Sissy' Van Weyden, he is a true man.The prevailing theme in this novel is the concept of life. Is it valuable, something to be guarded at all costs? Or is it valuable only to the one it belongs to? \\"'Do you know the only value life has is what life puts upon itself?'\\" Larsen asks. Van Weyden and Wolf Larsen have many conversations about morals and the point (or pointlessness) of life. Wolf Larsen is free of any of the bonds and conceptions of society. He realizes that life is fleeting, any achievement you make in the long run matters not. He uses the analogy of yeast to describe his views on life. \\"\`I believe that life is a mess...It is like a yeast, a ferment, a thing that moves and may move for a minute, an hour, a year, or a hundred years, but that in the end will cease to move. The big eat the little that they may continue to move, the strong eat the weak that they may retain their strength. The lucky eat the most and move the strongest, that is all.'\\". Van Weyden, on the other hand, has a hard time loosing his hold on the moral codes of society, and fights vainly for the concept of right and wrong. When asked what the value of life was, Van Weyden is speechless: \\"Value of life? How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment? The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic. That it was intrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned. But when he challenged the truism I was speechless.\\" In the end, Wolf Larsen is eaten up by his own self, and in this way, Van Weyden's concept of life comes out on top.This story was told in the first person, from Van Weyden's point of view. London makes the story and characters very believable. His first-hand knowledge of sailing, the wealthy, and the working man provide an authentic feel. He draws you into the story with the right amount of detail and dialog. London describes Wolf Larsen's eyes as being \\"...that baffling protean gray which is never twice the same; which runs through many shades and colorings like intershot silk in sunshine; which is gray, dark and light, and greenish gray, and sometimes of the clear azure of the deep sea. They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises...\\". The end of the book also had a very nice twist to it, when the most powerful man in the novel is reduced to depending on others to take of him."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"London's great sea adventure depicts an epic struggle between brute force and pampered entitlement. Its narrator, Humphrey Van Weyden, is a professional critic and the \\"Dean of American Letters the Second\\" (a sly reference to William Dean Howells). When the ferry across the Golden Gate span capsizes, Van Weyden is rescued from the ocean, and then kidnapped as an unwilling deckhand, by a schooner en route to the seal-hunting islands of Japan. The captain of the schooner, Wolf Larsen, is a despotic beast who scorns civility and whose idea of law is to serve his own power as dictator--his self-proclaimed \\"piggishness.\\"Like all of London's fiction, this novel is an allegory, and \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" is as much a philosophical treatise as it is a sea adventure. Against Humphrey's aristocratic pretensions and effete scholarship, London pits Wolf's vulgar blend of social Darwinism and primeval strength. \\"You would like to go back to the land,\\" Wolf argues, \\"which is a special place for your kind of piggishness. It is a whim of mine to keep you aboard this ship, where my piggishness flourishes.\\"There is much of this type of banter and didacticism (in a literary form abused to perfection later in the century by the likes of Ayn Rand and Robert Heinlein). Throughout these often one-sided debates, Wolf overwhelms the arguments of his captive opponent--and this in spite of the fact that London meant to portray the captain-tyrant as an example of the dangers of \\"the superman philosophy\\" as posited by Nietzsche. The tension that results as Wolf even gets the better of his author makes the captain the more interesting of the pair--and one of the most memorable characters invented for fiction.A shift occurs midway through the story, however, when the crew of the schooner rescues another castaway, the poet Maud Brewster, who is likewise held captive. It's easy to see why many readers and critics feel that the introduction of this \\"romantic interest\\" detracts from the tale; as a love story, it fails miserably (never more so than when they are shipwrecked again, on a desert island).On an allegorical level, however, it's a subversive and somewhat brilliant intervention. If Wolf exemplifies brute strength and Humphrey typifies unearned decadence, then Maud bowls over both worldviews as the representative of art and civilization: \\"Books and brains, and bravery,\\" as Wolf leeringly acknowledges in spite of himself; \\"a bluestocking fit to be the wife of a pirate chief.\\" Humphrey hardens under the labor of his duties, Wolf softens under the influence of his newly captured muse, and neither extreme suffices in the face of moderation. From this point, it doesn't take much to figure out who will win this three-way battle of wills."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"So imagine taking the real world brutality that London's wolves or dogs face in his Youkon novels. Now add that survival of the fittest and the most banal might make right themes from nature and apply them to a seafaring novel. That combination makes this novel.The main protagonist is the victim of a ferry shipwreck near San Fransico and is swept out to sea where he is picked up by Captain Wolf Larson's sealing vessel. Larson refuses to returm him or to let him board another nearby vessel heading into San Fransico and so he is forced to serve on the vessel. He is in every way the antithesis of the sealers: weak, educated, literary, and not accostomed to manual labor. Half the story is the growth of the protagonist into more of a \\"man\\" through his experiences.The genius of this novel however is in the character Wolf Larson, the ship's captain. He is stronger, meaner, and smarter than any other man he has met. By his own might he rules the ship. He is also well read and self educated, and his literary knowledge bonds the two main characters together. Larson takes the essence of nature, where the strongest rule and dominate, and applies it to man. Man is a part of nature and therefor not subject to any higher laws. Larson intimidates, beats up, murders, and takes any other measures of strength necessary to rule his vessel. In the end, even when he is dying and needs the protagonist to have any hope of escape, he still tries to commit murder to his would-be saviours. Why? Just to prove he still can. Its a brilliant study of humanity and a dichotomy of beliefs in the very nature of humanity versus nature.A must read for any fan of London, American literature, or just a very good read (like me)."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf by Jack London tells the story of Humphrey Van Weyden, a literary critic, who is lost overboard and picked up by a seal hunting ship. Instead of returning the shivering man to 'civilization' Wolf Larson, the captain of the ship, forces Van Weyden to work aboard the ship cleaning pots and pans. Although this book has a lot of action and moves fairly quickly, the best parts were the dialouges between the self-educated captain and Humphrey. The captain, as Jack London puts it, is not moral or immoral but is just unmoral, or doesn't have set morals. He doesn't believe in a soul and believes in fulfilling desires. He says that if a man does good it is simply because his desire to do good outweighs the desire to do bad. Van Weyden does believe in the soul and the two man continually philosophize. Overall one of the themes is about the working class being subject to the 'higher' society. My only complaint is that the captain's personality seems to change from the first half of the book to the second half. Also, I happened to appreciate the captain's viewpoint when he was supposed to be the antagonist and wicked man. I don't think that was the author's intention so I hold that against him. All ina all, the themes are so much more interesting and the first half of the book is written better than the second half."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I was pleasently surprised with how quick I received the book and the price I paid.I will be loking for additinal Jack London books in the near futureLarry"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"More readable and entertaining than Moby Dick, The Sea Wolf is the ultimate sea-faring fiction.When his ferry collides with another ship in the fog and sinks, bookish dandy Humphrey Van Weyden finds himself alone and adrift off the coast of San Francisco. He is saved from drowning by a passing sailing vessel, the Ghost, captained by Wolf Larsen, on its way to the seal hunting grounds in the far Pacific. To his dismay, &quot;Hump's&quot; request to be put ashore are ignored. Instead he is held captive, put to hard labor, and made to suffer greatly under the brutal leadership of the fearsome Wolf.Wolf Larson is one of literature's most unique characters, and the mystery of what motivates him and what atrocities he'll commit next compel the reader on. He is not the stereotypical pirate ogre, but rather a well-read, deep-thinking intellectual whose best thoughts justify--in his mind--his callous behavior. He is a firm believer in natural selection and survival of the fittest. On the Ghost, he is at the top of the food chain.As the months pass, Hump is changed by the sea and physical exertion, earning 1st mate status. After plenty of excitement and drama, the plot twists when Maud Brewster, a beautiful young writer, is rescued from a lifeboat adrift a following a storm. Hump is smitten, but so is Wolf.

Not being familiar with this novel before, having only readTHE CALL OF THE WILDandWHITE FANGpreviously, I didn't really know what to expect with this one. An adventure story was what I was looking for, but I got much more than that. Rather than providing the simple pleasure of following one of London's wonderfully imagined characters through a life-threatening and horizon-expanding adventure, this book provided an intensely thought inspiring look into the human psyche that I won't soon forgot.Published at a time when 'social Darwinism' was just beginning to be thoughtfully and rationally spelled out as far as how it affects and guides our lives and those around us, THE SEA WOLF uses its characters to explore the ramifications of that school of thought. Humphrey van Weydon is the protagonist of this book and presents a less-than-appealing hero in his weakness, dependency, and fear. The antagonist, Wolf Larson, is the unyielding, strong, rational, and brutal sea captain whose brutality simply cannot have a place in a civilized world. As these two drastically different characters clash over everything from human rights to self appreciation to the existence of an afterlife, the reader is treated to a wonderful exposition of what it means to live and what our social positions/obligations should be. Most likely, you'll find yourself sometimes agreeing with both characters' viewpoints from time to time, making this book fun to read for more than just an adventure tale.While it is undeniable that Wolf Larson represents much of what is abhorrent and violent about primal man, most readers will find themselves very attracted to him throughout this book. Something about the self-reliant, individualist, materialist, survival-of-the-fittest attitude and way of life is pleasing to the 'self-made' man. While we cringe at the thought of needless cruelty to others, much of the Wolf's philosophical rantings ring true. Whether London wished to show that the unsympathetic pure materialist has no place in modern civilization or that bringing good ideas (like Individualism) to their extremes can be disastrously evil, he succeeded in creating one of the most intriguing and memorable characters I've ever come across.On the other extreme is the narrator of the story, Humphrey. Here we have a weakling intellectual that has 'stood on his father's legs' his whole life and apparently couldn't look out for himself if his life depended on it. To both his surprise and the reader's, it turns out that when it really comes down to it, he can. Brutally encouraged by Wolf to 'man-up', 'Hump' finds a strength (and eventually a self respect) that he never knew he had. Here we have the civilized and progressive literary critic (ouch!) being cast into an extremely uncivilized environment and learning that what he understood about the human condition doesn't exactly hold true. More familiar, and thus less intriguing, his character eventually comes to represent the triumph of civilization and moral superiority over dog-eat-dog barbarism.Anyway, in my mind, this work actually surpasses THE CALL OF THE WILD and WHITE FANG as far as intellectual stimulation, and I am surprised that it is not more popular. Very highly recommended for all readers!!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I first read THE SEA WOLF at age 12, 40 years ago, and thought it was terrific, for all the reasons mentioned in other reviews: the exciting sea story, the juxtaposition of the values of western civilization with those of the refined thug Wolf Larson, the growth of Hump Van Weyden into a strong and self-reliant man who can hold his own with both Larson and brute nature.When I reread it recently, I still found the basic situation on the Ghost compelling and primal. However, my reservations became stronger and stronger from the time Maud Brewster appeared until the end of the book. Jack London, the great recorder of basic conflicts between man and man, and man and nature, writes VERY unconvincingly about the relationships between men and women. Maud seems a completely artificial character constructed more as a literary symbol of refinement and whimsicality than as a human being.Some of it is ludicrous. In their escape from the Ghost, for instance, Maud and Van Weyden spend several weeks in an open boat, fighting for survival and never once performing an excretory function. They're too delicate for that. When they finally make it to a North Pacific desert island, Hump builds Maud a stone hut as shelter then, exhausted and facing the possibility of dying of exposure, sleeps outside himself. In sum, Jack London, one of the all-time greatest naturalistic writers, perpetrates a great deal of Victorian self-censorship.The symbolic scheme plays out when Larson shows up too, wrecked on the very same island somewhere in the wide, wide, wide reaches of the world's largest ocean, so Maud and Hump can witness his physical disintegration at first hand.I'm a great fan of London's shorter works, the stories of both the far north and the south seas. He is a terrific storyteller, and it's borne out in the first half or two-thirds of THE SEA WOLF. But the concluding portion of this book is a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London was one of the greatest authors America has ever known. It's ironic that because of his dog-centric books that he is often written off as a children's author. I once made the mistake of taking a collection of his short stories on a vacation. Great stories, but among the most depressing, violent, cruel concepts ever put to paper. A poor fit with frozen drinks and palm trees.The Sea Wolf is one of my favorite books largely on the basis of the villian, Wolf Larsen. He stands unique among villians in that he is huge, powerful, intelligent, ambitious, aggressive, with no muzzle of a conscience. He is omnipotent. Absolute power corupting absolutely. He is not a dumb brute that our intellectual hero outwits or outworks. Were it not for the peripheral factors of his even more destructive brother, or his failing health, he would have remained the master of his domain. I would expect that this Alpha male nature of Larsen that led London to name him Wolf.One of the biggest casting crimes ever committed by Hollywood was the casting of E.G. Robinson as Wolf and then remaking it with Bronson many years later (apparently based on having watched the original movie without really understanding the book)."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Parts of the book reminded me of Conrad and others, Milton. London creates an ugly force and sets it on a fishing boat as Captain. This Captain a sailing, fishing, toruring and ing, while defying the odds to live on and torment even after his targets thought they were in safe harbor. The captain is too smart for his own good and his men are very stupid for his own good. Within this sea of &quot;evility&quot; stumbles a neutral force that evolves as &quot;good&quot; as it fights the &quot;evil&quot; captain using brains rather than braun. He saves a damsel in distress along the way filling the romance narative (which seems a tad clumsy in parts). Well developed characters facing their nightmares on a ship with a Tin Angel at the helm. No, this isn't just another sea adventure like &quot;ThePerfect Storm&quot; with more deveolped ships than characters. Read this when you have time to ponder human nature, the battle of good and bad on seas that can be placid and flat as glass or whipped up by a whirlwind into 30 foot swells."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The book is a classic study of two characters - the Luciferian captain Wolf Larson, and the gentleman-turned-neophyte-sailor Humphrey Van Weyden. As Hump learns to survive the brutal conditions aboard Larson's ship, the Ghost, he grows from a soft academic type to a strong and resourceful survivor. Larson, the captain, is presented as a monster with no regard for human life. Larson is intrigued with Hump and engages him in philosophical discussions, but absorbs none of Hump's basic goodness. As Hump develops into a man, Larson degenerates into a blinded, diseased, pitiful creature. Hump overcomes his adverse conditions and even finds love, while Larson self-destructs. The adventure aboard the vessel is described in vivid detail, and the author clearly knows sailing. A wonderful story!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Despite being nearly one hundred years old, \\"The Sea Wolf\\" reads like a modern adventure thriller, only with more formal English vocabulary and sentence structure.The book opens breathlessly, like you are flipping TV channels and happened upon a spectacular action set piece, with Humphrey Van Weyden involved in a sea accident/capsize, and \\"rescued\\" by a passing sealing schooner, helmed by the title character, Wolf Larsen.Immediately, the reader is placed within the sealing vessel itself, and as Van Weyden is clueless about the sea, so are we. His experience is our tutorial. We learn the harrowing lifestyle of the sealing industry circa 1900 (the author having personal experience, reportedly).The claustophobic details of the ship contrast the vastness of the sea. The more cerebral \\"Hump\\" (as he's called) is alone amongst the id-like crew. Furthering my Psych 101 analogy, Larsen appears to espouse the benefit of the primal, yet does so with an eloquence that betrays any sort of simple association. The fact that he is well-read and speaks thoughtfully (if heartlessly) suggests the reason he is the \\"leader\\" of said crew, and a successful seaman, may lie in the understanding and control of instinct, impulse, nature.Anyways, that is probably a lot of folderol. What you have is a struggling protagonist, an evil slavedriving captain, plenty of duplicitous henchmen, and halfway through, a pretty maiden.There are a half-dozen or so amazing seagoing escapades (and I didn't understand one lick of all that \\"jib\\", \\"topmast\\", \\"poopdeck\\" stuff...nor did it matter...) and finally an extended Crusoe-like sequence on an island to tidy things up.Seriously, this deserves every accolade thrust upon it. It has been named \\"one of the 100 greatest books\\", and a \\"literary classic\\", and a \\"masterpiece of American literature\\"...whatever.It's simply a great read. You'll kick yourself for waiting so long to have read it.I did."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"THE SEA WOLF is a fast-moving tale of adventure on the high seas and should entertain anyone who enjoys non-stop action. Of course, the novel offers something more, too, for it paints a very unusual portrait of Wolf Larsen, captain of the seal hunting schooner Ghost. At first blush, one may be tempted to categorize Larsen as the \\"bad guy,\\" the antagonist in the story, and Humphrey van Weyden as the protagonist hero, but let's not be too hasty in our characterizations.Larsen, for all of his cruelty, is the absolute realist in this book. His philosophy is that of utter pragmatism. He is the one who can bring the ship through the worst of storms. He is the one whose physical strength is that which is customarily associated in a reader's mind with a heroic figure. If he has a flaw, perhaps it is his absolutism, for there is no room in his mind for the relativism of what we call ethics and morality, yet his logic in rejecting such concepts is unarguable when seen from a perfectly objective viewpoint. And let us not forget that it is he who causes van Weyden to grow into a survivor.As for Humphrey van Weyden, while it is he around whom the entire story revolves, he is not a traditional hero figure by any means. When we first meet him, he is very nearly as absolute as is Larsen but in the opposite direction, for he knows nothing whatever about the world and its realities, and has, as Larsen puts it, \\"stood on his father's legs\\" rather than his own. He is immersed in the world of bookish philosophy, has no need to work for a living, has other people to handle his financial affairs, and writes literary criticisms. He is as unrealistic as Larsen is pragmatic.Both of the main characters, then, represent extremes. Van Weyden, however, does learn to adapt, to grow, to become more decisive, and to survive. Larsen does not and is eventually destroyed by the universe that he has always viewed as amoral and uncaring (thus proving himself entirely correct in his assessment of it). The universe, of course, works through some mysterious malady of Larsen's that is foreshadowed and hinted at throughout the story by his debilitating headaches. But is it not ironic that Larsen's malevolent absolutism is the catalyst for van Weyden's maturation? In brief, I cannot brand Larsen with a label of pure antagonist or anti-hero, for his rationality is frequently refreshing and he does engender a positive outcome in van Weyden. Similarly, I cannot view van Weyden as a pure hero because. for too much of the story, he is thoroughly unrealistic in his views and expectations. Both characters are complex in their respective ways.Modern readers may well be put off by London's portrayal of women, who are perceived as weak and in need of protection, although Maud Brewster does prove to be stronger and more resolute than the reader initially suspects. Perhaps more off-putting is van Weyden's paralysis--his total inability to act against Larsen when he repeatedly has the opportunity--because his sense of morality precludes such actions. The reader fairly wishes to scream at the man as he misses successive opportunities to remove Larsen as a threat to himself as well as to Maud. This, of course, is part of van Weyden's own moral absolutism and is totally in character for him even while it frustrates the reader.London's characters, while complex, are not as symbolic of broader concepts as are those of Joseph Conrad, a fine author of sea-based tales. I find London to be a somewhat shallower author and to place more emphasis on superficial action to develop his stories than does Conrad. Neither man is equal to Melville as an allegorist, yet both are superior to someone like Patrick O'Brian (adopted name of Richard Russ, English author of the Aubrey-Maturin series of seafaring novels who drowns the reader in nautical jargon and sometimes little else). If one likes fast action with an enticing leavening of unusual character development in an always-interesting and far-from-normal setting, he could do far worse than reading Jack London's works, and THE SEA WOLF is a gripping book with which to pass some hours of fascinating reading."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Absolutely loved this book!Humphrey Van Weyden is a 35 year old bookish man who has never had to stand on his own two feet. He almost drowns when the boat he is on collides with another in the San Francisco Bay, but is soon rescued by the Ghost and its captain, Wolf Larsen. Wolf is a Darwinian philosopher of sorts who has taken survival of the fittest to the extreme with his raw, wolf-like savageness. And this savageness, OH YES THIS SAVAGENESS, makes The Sea Wolf one hell of a read!Wolf exclaims \\"life was a ferment, a yeasty something which devoured life that it might live, and the living was merely successful piggishness. Why if there is anything in supply and demand, life is the cheapest thing in the world. There is only so much water, so much earth, so much air; but the life that is demanding to be born is limitless. Nature is a spendthrift. Look at the fish and their millions of eggs. For that matter, look at you and me. In our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives. Could we but find time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the unborn life that is in us, we could become the fathers of nations and populate continents. Life? Bah! It has no value. Of cheap things it is the cheapest. Everywhere it goes begging. Nature spills it out with a lavish hand. Where there is room for one life, she sows a thousand lives, and its life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life is left.\\"Make no mistake that Wolf stays true to this philosophy.Meanwhile, Hump learns to stand on his own two feet in two significant ways - one seemingly unintentional. He unexpectedly becomes an intellectual playmate of Wolf's, which sort of buys him time from Wolf's brutality. Also, he overcomes extreme physical obstacles while on the Ghost and while trying to escape.During my elation while reading this book I became curious as to why it hadn't made it to the Novel 100 list by Daniel S. Burt or other similar lists. I was thinking 5 STARS! 5 STARs! The dialogue was wonderful and plentiful (in a good way). Wolf's character was amazing in a brutal and sordid way. I think most of us can relate to the fantasy of our primitive selves. Why not one of THE classics?Well it seems that some of the works referred to in The Sea Wolf are anachronistic and the story itself is considered \\"patchy\\". Patchy as in melodramatic (But this was funny and interestingggg....), philosophic debate (INTERESTING!), travelogue (Soooo?), and love story (Yeah...the love story was a bit cheesy. A famous female author just happens to be the one who washes up for the bookish Hump????)So, 4 stars because of the out of place references and all too convenient terms of the love story, but still, a thrilling read!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"What Jack London sought to depict in many of his short stories and novels was the realistic, unforgiving brutality associated with man and nature, and, in this regard, The Sea Wolf does not disappoint. The first conflict comes when Humphrey Van Weyden is rescued by a boat after an accident, but little does the protagonist know what he is truly in for, as he will experience a figurative Hell for a good deal of time on board the Ghost. Juxtaposed by Wolf Larson, a character inspired by Milton's Lucifer in Paradise Lost, Van Weyden, a simple \\"bookish\\" literary man of thirty-five, must transform in order to sustain a barbaric and eye-opening ride.Perhaps what separates Wolf Larson from your prototypical villain is that there are moments where Van Weyden can see the philosophical, profound, well-read side of the captain. While the two are as far apart as any two characters can be in their beliefs, backgrounds, or physical appearance, they seem to be on a parallel plane when it comes to their talks about Man's existence, despite the fact that they \\"agree to disagree\\" on these various subjects.The book's most prevalent theme is survival--physically and psychologically. Van Weyden transforms himself somewhat in order to exist, yet he is not consumed by the savagery he witnesses aboard the Ghost. While he has a hard time acting on instincts, there is one point where there is a revolt from Larson in his conscience, which separates any notion that he will give in: \\"Wolf Larson it was, always Wolf Larson, enslaver and tormentor of men, a male Circe and these his swine, suffering brutes that groveled before him and revolted only in drunkenness and secrecy. And was I, too, one of his swine? ...No!...I would work my will through it all, in spite of Wolf Larson...All would be well.\\" Yet, ironically, much of what Van Weyden learns from what he witnesses from Larson and the other men is critical in his survival later on.Another impressive element is London's command of description and detail. He has a way of illustrating a moment of peril, or foreshadowing, or profiling a character. One example is Van Weyden's commentary while looking out to see, while thinking about the Ghost's fate: \\"I, too, leaned upon the rail and gazed longingly into the sea, with the certainty that sooner or later I should be sinking down, down, through the cool green depths of its oblivion.\\" The protagonist seems to know that something is amiss with the Ghost, and, like Melville's Pequod in Moby Dick, there is an ominous feeling on doom on board.One criticism is the later part of the novel, where it gets a little too romanticized and lovey-dovey with Maud and Humphrey. It just seemed a little too forced. Some of the parts seemed to lag a little also towards the end, and the descriptions got a little too detailed about how to prepare a vessel for voyage off of Endeavor Island.Still, over all, it was an impressive read. If you're looking for a book about courage and survival, then this is a great book to check out!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Are there really superman who are outside the bounds of society? Are there those who supersede the expectations and requirements of living within a community? Do some men and women rise above the herd and rule with impunity, out of their own inherent power?Wolf Larsen fancies himself one of these men. The captain of the seal hunting vessel &quot;The Ghost&quot; believes he is above all the norms of socitey. He is one who is not handicapped by social graces or education. He is one who does not buy into the hope of religion or eternal life. Is he an existentialist... a materialist... a nihilist? Maybe he is all of these...?Wolf Larsen uses people and possessions in a way that suits him best. He gains his advantage by doing whatever he feels will advance his postion in the moment. Wolf Larsen is a self educated and self possesed person, wrapped up in himself and the power he seems to wield.Humphrey Van Weydon is swept up into the surging storm of all that Wolf Larsen is. Van Weydon is a pampered socialite who has spent his life in the comfy confines of wealth and academia. He is well read and has a good understanding of philosophy. But doesn't really have a great handle of the practical aspects of life. Where the rubber meets the road, in philosophical ideals, he is lacking.One day, as he is riding as a passenger on a steamer across San Fransisco bay, his life is changed in a heartbeat.The steamer collides with another ship and Humphrey is swept overboard. His next moment of conciousness is on the deck of the seal hunting ship, &quot;The Ghost&quot;. This ship is captained by the infamous superman Wolf Larsen. From this point on two very different... but similar worlds collide.Van Weydon and Larsen spend many days discussing life and how we are supposed to live it. More and more through discussion and observation Van Weydon, the refined socialite, discovers he is just like Larsen, the grizzled violent sea captain. It is interesting to watch Van Weydon's desensitization to violence and the law of &quot;might makes right&quot;. When Van Weydon begins his voyage he fancies himself above all the fighting and violence of the sailors. But as he progresses in this trip he realizes he is one of them. Humphrey finds he cannot help but be swept up into the violence, and see that it is just as much a part of the world he came from as it is aboard the ship.I enjoyed the book, but it does drag a little in places. The ending leaves a little to be desired. But if you like action and philosophical musings you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is a real classic.

It's a slightly wordy book but strangely it's an easy read, and after the first chapter you won't be able to put it down-trust me. The descriptive language of this novel just engrosses you in Jack London's sea worthy story. I was so involved in this book I got sea sick several times-you'll love this book. P.S. I told you so. The best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf, by Jack London, is a classic story of a gentleman from San Francisco who is rescued by a ruthless captain of a seal hunting schooner, the Ghost, bound for Japan. Humphrey Van Weyden comes aboard the Ghost not ever completing an honest day of work. He had no legs of his own, always relying on some other person than himself. Wolf Larsen, the rugged captain, was a cold-hearted old man whose life was completely based on fishing. Work, to him, was the only way to survive. Although well educated, he had no common decency and beat his crew.Through the entire story, Wolf Larsen teaches Mr. Van Weyden about truly living and not having someone live for you. By the end of the novel, Mr. Van Weyden had learned to live his life to the fullest. He realized how fortunate he had been. Wolf Larsen was dreaded by his entire crew and did not have a single companion. He was a lonely man who didn't know how to communicate, and therefore resorted to violence. At the end of the story, he finds himself alone and extremely depressed. This is a novel of love, loss and growth which I would suggest reading. After reading this novel you realize the importance of living life to the fullest."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"An excallent novel filled with great adventure.

Come to think of it, it's the only book I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Not London's most famous story, and with reason, the Sea Wolf combines adventure narrative and commentary on life similar to some of London's other stories. Wolf Larson is a man with an indominatble will who would become a despot if given the chance. However, since the oppurtunity never arose, he must be content to rule over only his ship. While the people under his rule may be few, his power over them is complete. He is harsh, an atheist who views the human race as fermenting yeast. He is one of the strongest characters I have met in literature, and more dynamic than the others anyway. [I mean, Moby Dick's Ahab is strong-willed and rules his crew, but his character is one dimensional]. However, some of the key points in the story are difficult to believe, making the novel more surreal than London's other novels. So, while interesting and worth reading, I think Call of the Wild and White Fang are better written. I read this book when I was in eighth grade."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"As a psychological adventure novel, The Sea Wolf is the story of a writer, Humphrey Van Weyden shipwrecked in the ocean and rescued by the monstrous, brutal captain Wolf Larsen. Van Wedyen is soft, bookish character, and is astonished by the ugly strength and egoism of Larsen. Larsen forces Van Weyden to accompany the ship in its voyage across the ocean to hunt seals, and along the way he learns the toughness of nautical life, measured by the novel's repeated metaphors of callouses and scars on what were his soft, gentleman's hands, and what Larsen calls \\"standing on his own legs.\\"There is a weak romantic element tacked onto the story, when the crew rescues a from another shipwreck the poet Maud Brewster, a delicate aesthete and again a foil against Larsen's brutality. Brewster and Van Weyden fall in love in the course of their adventures but the book represses this until a last page kiss. Truly feeble.But the central failing is that this novel would have been better with a more interesting or believable antagonist. Although reviewers gush about the intensity of the character portrayal of Wolf Larsen -- really, he is not that interesting. Overly talky and one-dimensional despite that, Larsen spouts philosophical cliches (as does Van Weyden) as if he's in a late-night drunken argument in a freshman dorm room. Predictable, and his routine of menacing and bullying doesn't really shock as much as the author thinks it does.The novel's greatest strength is in the telling of the nautical adventure itself, the sailing of the schooner is wonderfully detailed and the descriptions of the techniques of seal-hunting quite interesting."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I have seen the John Wayne version of this book. There is really no comparison. John Wayne is simply not Wolf Larson. I do like the movie, however. I am surprised I never read this book before. In fact the only reason I downloaded the free Kindle version is because I just completed the audio version (from Lit2Go on iTunes) on my iPod. It made me want to read the words. Jack London makes it possible to feel the sea, fear and admire the characters, feel happy and sad at the end. This book is well worth the read. There may be more Jack London in my reading future."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Having just finished Jack London's marvelous sea adventure The Sea Wolf I had to write to tell what a great book it is. The novel is a great adventure similar to all of the others of its kind (Moby Dick, Kidnapped, Treasure Island)but has a dark, sparkling gleam all of its own. I found this book to be a fascinating excursion into darkness. Even though it did evoke a lot of the feelings those books brought I found that it reminded me a lot of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as well as Kipling's Captains Courageous. The character of Wolf Larsen has to go down as one of the greatest literary villains ever. Just when you thought he might be redeemable he goes one step further with his wickedness and even laughs about it! The book was full of Jack London's typical adventure prose and I often felt as if I were on the Ghost (Larsen's ship) and I could feel the cold of the ocean and wind as well as the pains the crew suffered aboard it. The book kept me at a nervous concern for the main protagonists. I knew everything would be fine but at times...Jack London's prose often surprised me as I read The Sea Wolf. Of course most of it was just like his other work (The Call of the Wild for instance or To Build A Fire) but there were occasionally brief extracts which made me feel that the story was written by someone more modern. I have to admit that Wolf Larsen's continuing drive into darkness made me think a lot of Conrad's evil madman and while Heart of Darkness may have won out on the actually darkness of the soul, The Sea Wolf wins for greatest brutality and cruelty. This is a novel you will enjoy if you like adventure on the high seas. Jack London will transport you onto the Ghost and you will feel the drama (and trauma) brought about by one of the vilest creations in all of literature. Do yourself a favor and read The Sea Wolf. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I've read The Sea Wolf a few times in my life. Each time I do, I enjoy it more and more. It's a really well written story.

These characters are people we know, or would like to know, or have already known. Plot and structure advance the story and strengthen the on going themes and subplot. I will not divulge more here except to say that even John Wayne who played Wolf Larsen in the film version looks small next to the actual character.

I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I didn't know what to expect with the Sea Wolf. I'd never heard of the story. I started reading and found it entertaining, and, as I continued, I found it to be fascinating. I loved the philisophical debates between Wolf Larsen and \\"Hump\\". It was interesting that the captain was so brutal yet so intelligent. The very cogent arguments that he makes for his violent, non-caring life style really causes the thoughtful reader to sit and think about one's own beliefs. Bravo!At the end, a satisfying story of survival, gallantry, almost a \\"coming-of-age\\" story for our hero, even though he is certainly an adult."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"OUTSTANDING!!!! Couldn't put it down. Having spent five years in our modern Navy even I had some difficulty with the nautical terms from so long ago but was able to get passed that because of the extraordinary writing. The narration angle was awesome, the characters very exciting, the event and scenery projected into my mind as I went from page to page was riveting. With all that, the most amazing thing about this book is that Mr. London could write an entire book about life at sea with a deranged captain and dinghy crew, actually draw you into that small vessel as if you were living, working, eating and sailing with those men, and yet not a single profane word. A superb classic for readers of any age, my only regret is I didn't read it years ago."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Actually it's a very great book, but I take off a star for the gratuitous \\"love story\\" that instantly ruins the story as soon as the woman shows up in the middle of the ocean. Of course, before word processing, there was a lot less editing. I thoroughly enjoy some of Jack London's other love stories (Burning Daylight comes to mind) but the Sea Wolf love story was embarrassingly corny. The rest of the book, however, is superb, if don't mind a few lapses in logic."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"London's novels are very philosophical. They are adventure stories with timeless moral themes. Some of the dialogue is a bit dated but I found this refreshing after reading \\"The Girl With the ....\\" Trilogy recently.

A book that has a brilliant description of socialism in it."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is a kind of character study of extremes. The viewpoint of the story is the nice guy's, Humphrey, a literary critic who is propelled into a strange new world dominated by an extremely unnice guy, Wolf Larsen, captain of the sailing ship Ghost near the end of the sailing days. Via a shipwreck, 'Hump' becomes the cabin boy on the Ghost.The Wolf is an archtype of pure amoral power, but 'tainted' with the intellect to observe and describe his own situation. From that perspective Wolf finds it amusing to command and torment the crew of his vessel, and to play intellectual games with the &quot;Hump&quot;. Wolf uses and kills his crew members quickly enough, and promotes the cabin boy to mate after a failed mutiny. In the end the good guys prevail...Actually, there's lots of interesting detail in the story, and London is skilled enough at his writing craft, but I felt that overall it sort of fails. As a morality play, the favorable outcome is basically an accident. Actually, the most interesting character is only mentioned in passing--Wolf Larsen's brother, Death Larsen, captain of the steamship that attacks the Ghost. He's only vaguely portrayed as much nastier than Wolf, but apparently more successful, but we never get to meet him. Made me feel London was something of a tease, to make such efforts to portray an evil character while only hinting of one that was even more evil.(This review is actually of an older paperback edition from 1965.)"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Having lived at sea for months at a time, I could relate to this book.

This is one of those books I remember reading back in high school and actually enjoying, so I thought I would pick it up again. It is every bit as good as I remembered. And so much more nuanced that I remember. There is a reason why this book is a classic. The main character, Wolf Larsen, is a fierce and fearsome character who holds so tightly to a Darwinian viewpoint on life. The strong survive only as long as they stay strong and it is their right to manipulate and observe what happens to the weak. And he holds unwaveringly to that viewpoint. That viewpoint leads him to deny anything after this life, almost anything useful in this life, and almost certainly anything useful in another person's life. Humphrey Van Weyden, his unwilling companion, holds the opposite viewpoint, that life, even the life of others no matter how weak they are, is worthwhile. No one should be manipulated. And, just like Larsen, he holds to this view so strongly that even when Larsen is in his power near the end of the novel he will not harm him.The two characters do not at all grow fond of each other, and that is as it should be for two characters of such differing viewpoints on life would not likely be friends. But they do fascinate each other. The debates they have with each other throughout the book are fascinating and absolutely spot-on. These are exactly what people with these various viewpoints would say, and what makes it even more interesting is that these two viewpoints are the two most often expressed in our American culture today. To see these two go at it is to see the two sides of American thinking war with each other. And both sides have valid points that cannot really be argued. Which are you going to side with? It becomes even more fascinating with the introduction of a woman into the story that both characters are attracted to. We all know that the woman is going to end up with the nice guy at the end, but just her presence leads the two men into a whole new line of arguments that is great to follow.Up to this point, Jack London's story is perfect. But then, in the last 20% of the book Van Weyden makes his escape and from then on the book is comparatively boring. Oh, but that first 80% of the book makes it all worth it. This commentary on culture is still relevant today over a century after it was written. It still seems fresh. It still seems to fit in perfect to the way we live our lives. Absolutely recommended!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London is pretty famous for his adventure stories \\"White Fang\\" and \\"Call of the Wild,\\" but \\"The Sea Wolf\\" is less-well-known.

Interesting story, quality writing, and deep character development. For me, this is one of those books [another is Old Man And the Sea, perhaps The Great Gatsby] I will read again and again over the decades. There are precious few books I would re-read, but re-reading this one and others is like listening to an old friend re-tell a story of his or her while we share a particularly pleasing libation and pick at some warmed cashews. Tangentially, as I read this, I could see Gregory Peck in the role of Wolf Larsen."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf contains familiar themes of other Jack London books. Man (or animal) from a comfortable background thrown into in a life and death struggle with the forces of nature due to a bad twist of fate.Also the Wolf Larsen characters philosophizing in this book led many to believe that the book Might is Right (which Anton Lavey later plaigarized and renamed The Satanic Bible) was ghostwritten by Jack London. I dont believe London wrote Might is Right because after doing the math he would have had to have been a teenager when he wrote it however I do think its possible that he read it and the rants in it may have influenced him and his creation of Wolf Larsen. I saw a documentary on Lavey where he talked about what a profound influence the Wolf Larsen character in the Sea Wolf was on his own personal outlook.Overall this is one of my favorite books. Anybody that appreciates Jack Londons other work should read this."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I have read white fang, call of the wild and a few other of jack london's short stories and have enjoyed them all.

It is a very harsh book, horrible actions occur and heartbreaking happen in the story.

I found the first few pages rather cheesy, but very soon London's character of Wolf Larsen, a brutal and all-powerful sea captain, changed all that. I found him one of the most disturbing and forceful characters in all of literature--a sort of Hitleresque beast, yet created almost thirty years before anyone ever heard of Hitler.Contrasted with Wolf Larsen is the main character, appropriately named Humphrey, a wimp extraordinaire--who falls prey to the power and control of Larsen, and slowly learns to find himself and his strength in Larsen's midst. However, for maybe the first thirty or forty pages of their interaction, the book seemed a bit over-philosophical, almost teenage in its grand discussion of \\"life\\" and \\"morality\\" and \\"humanity\\" and \\"death.\\" But then, somehow, Jack London gripped me anyway, and his created world of ultra-violence and distorted masculinity, where physical strength and personal force are everything, became all-too-real, all-too-believable, and all-too-powerful. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Jack London!Unfortunately, though, the book peters out in the last few chapters. I don't want to give away the ending, but suffice to say that I felt London just couldn't sustain the story. Yes, intellectually the ending works, but emotionally it doesn't. It turned wooden--and false. I found myself bored at the end, and I hoped that London would somehow redeem it. Alas, he didn't.But in spite of the cheesy ending the book is still unique--and a worthwhile read. I have trouble imagining anyone writing such a book today."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is a really good book. Jack London was one of the greatest writers in history. The story if you don't know is about a refined man who is on a ship and it goes down only for him to be \\"rescued\\" by another one. I put rescue in quotes because the ship he gets on (the Ghost) is ruled over by the legendary Sea Wolf Wolf Larsen. Larsen does not believe in any sort of moral code and also thinks that might makes right. As such, he commands his ship with a system of fear and intimidation and refuses to take Humphrey(the rescued man) back ashore. Instead, Hump, as he is referred to by the other sailors, is forced to stay aboard and goes from being a meek rich-boy whose never worked to a hardened man of the seas. The story is basically a brutal and savage one with London showing all of the ways Larsen can punish his crew and how Hump responds. Larsen is no mere man. He is extremely intelligent and well-read and that's why he keeps Hump on. The other men are not intellectual in the slightest but brutes. The only way Larsen is able to keep control is because he is also strong, nearly inhumanly so. In fact, in one scene, the mean attempt to throw him overboard after knocking him out. He climbs back on the ship and then goes down into the sleeping quarters where he is heavily outnumbered. There the men enact their plan to take over the ship. He fights off like a dozen men and survives, torturing his crew afterwords. Along the way, they meet up with his brother Death Larsen, but he isn't ever more than a faceless phantom. It is here that the book loses steam. They take on a woman who is a writer. Hump naturally develops feelings for her. They escape eventually to an island and, without giving away the ending, have a few problems there also. All in all, this is a really good, kept from true greatness perhaps by the inclusion of the woman at the end and the island. Except for that it's practically perfect. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I wish I had read this book in high school. I didn't get to it until much later in life. London knows his subject and in this case it's the conflict of man versus man, philosophy versus philosophy wrapped in a case of a diabolical captain against a gentleman. The discourses between these two never bog down and the action on the sea and land alike are edge of the seat brilliant. Take one side or the other, but you will be left searching your soul after reading this intense classic by a master of the writing craft."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I was quite surprised by Jack London's novel, The Sea Wolf. In fact, I rather enjoyed reading this book about a man at sea, Humphrey Van Weyden, aboard the ship, The Ghost, appropriately titled and a good metaphor. Aboard the ship, Van Weyden narrates his life at sea and the battles aboard the ship amongst the other sailors and the Captain Wolf Larsen who is also known as the Sea Wolf. The arrival of Maud Brewster adds romance to lonely Humphrey's sailing career. They have quite a story to tell as they leave the ship for Endeavor Island where they learn to survive in the Alaskan landscape in the early 1900s with barely the clothes on their back and their limited knowledge. It's like survivor without television cameras and there is only two people, a man and a woman on a desert island. Remember that question about who you would like to be stuck with on a desert island? Well, this book must have inspired such a philosophical question or wish. Maud and Humphrey get their wish to be alone but it's a struggle against nature. Jack London's writing style comes across with such flair that I believe he is the one of the most under-rated of American writers. Granted, we read his books in middle or high school but the older reader would gradually benefit and understand the depth of the narrator's voice with this book. Jack London should be regarded as one of America's foremost authors even with his focus on nature that his books are still selling and classic story-telling."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Loaded with imagery. The wickedness of Captain Wolf Larsen and the affection between Humphrey Van Weyden and Maud Brewster seems exaggerated but the author is using these things for higher purposes.Also, it's hard to believe that there could be another Wolf Larsen-type character in existence (the other being Wolf's brother, Death Larsen, captain of the ship Macedonia) but Jack London wants us to realize that animalism and death exist, are related, and ever present. Only love (the kind Hump and Maud develop) and work offer respite from this gloomy reality.London adds emphasis through his choice of name for the ship -- The Ghost (the boat piloted by Wolf Larsen, signifying how body and animalism dominate the soul during earthly life). Traveling through the soul (or \\"ghost\\"/spirit) is the best way to combat life's travails that spring up like sudden storms upon the sea.\\"The Sea Wolf\\" succeeds in a way that most great works of literature do -- a popular story that can be enjoyed by the masses but also containing deep parables for elevated hearts and minds. London's story falls into the great convoy of ocean adventures that include the biblical book of Jonah (check out the Vilna Gaon's superb commentary on Jonah -- Aderes Eliyahu) and Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" that teach timeless lessons.Wolf Larsen proves the truth of F.A. Hayek's theory that the strict rationalist tends to become a barbarian. I found my pro-life convictions challenged by Wolf's superficially appealing utilitarian explanation of why people guard their lives. It's true but not the whole story. I dove deeper into pro-life principles to refute Larsen's materialism uber alles. To wit, why would life (human adults) fight to preserve other life (unborn children) that, in most cases, it doesn't even know. Wouldn't adult life be afraid of what incoming life could potentially take away? The answer there is yes and that helps sustain the pro-abortion impulse. But the fact that there are adults willing, at cost to themselves, to seek protection for lives of coming generations that they have no acquaintance with suggests to the reasonable mind that the soul exists and is at work in such rescuers.This phenomenon doesn't exist in the animal world (animals only fight for their own kind). It shows that the soul makes humans qualitatively different from the rest of existence."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Humphrey Van Weyden, a pampered son of wealth, has lived a comfortable life of bookishness and learning in 1890's San Francisco. But everything changes when an accident on a ferry-trip across the bay leaves him floating helpless in a foggy sea. He is picked up by a schooner heading out to hunt seals, captained by the vicious Wolf Larsen. He is immediately pressed into service as cabin-boy aboard the Ghost, and learns a different kind of life than he has been raised to know. Wolf Larsen is not only brutal and overbearing to everyone he encounters, but he is also highly intelligent, having taught himself reading and mathematics. \\"Hump,\\" as Humphrey is called by the Captain, gains some measure of favor with the Captain as he is able to discuss philosophy and such things of which the rest of the crew is wholly ignorant.The characters and plot are intensely compelling, especially throughout the first half of the book where the drama is intense as he struggles to survive aboard the Ghost. His observations of the other crew members are interesting, as he discovers how different their lives are from his, and he feels pity for the things they lacked and which he took for granted. Also, the character of Captain Larsen is incredible; completely horrible yet you feel a sort of sympathy even for him.My biggest complaint with the story is at about its midpoint where a woman character enters the story. The struggle for life suddenly takes on a different meaning for Humphrey, as he now has someone other than himself to worry about, but this changes the whole mood of the story. The struggle is no longer filled with the painful drama, but practically turns into a romance, and a fairly sappy one, at that. It's also here that the book slows down with quite a few long passages about the mechanics and technical details of ships and sailing. But overall a very interesting tale of struggle - it's just unfortunate that the ending wasn't as strong."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.A complete masterpiece.You can't help but love the Wolf and his way of life. I think this explores the human soul and if truth were told I think many more people would behave this way if they were not burdened with consequences Whether they would admit it or not. This book would've even been much better if it could be written now.I would love to see the character's view points on women, sex, etc."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I find that this book is the best one London ever wrote. It questions many aspects of our lives. In addition to this he depict his characters so well, that you feel you know them. I have read all of Londons books and no one as well-written and alive as The Sea Wolf. He is truly a magician with words. This is art!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is very possibly the best book I have ever read. London describes his wonderful world at sea in a way that makes one feel as though he/she is actually there, and has known the characters since childhood. I strongly recommend, to all, this book. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is one of my favorite books. London combines high-seas adventure with life's lessons as I believe no one else has done before or since. We all have a little &quot;Hump&quot; (good) and &quot;Wolf&quot; (evil) in all of us, and the struggles between these two seem to reflect those we all face inside ourselves. Hoist yer topsails, mate, and get ready for an adventure!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Normally when I read a book for class I only go as far as appreciating the quality of the book's prose or complexities, but I never thought of them as fun reads.

This is one of them.It's the tale of a rather bookish \\"gentleman\\" who is virtually press-ganged to work on a sailing ship. Through vicious hardship he is faced with the choice of survival (and in the process compromising his morality) or almost certain death. The main villain, if you will, is the Captain of the ship, who's physical strength and presence is overwhelming.Some of the language is a little archaic, but the Kindle dictionary didn't let me down.It's well worth the read. Get past the first ten pages, and you may find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"It has been many years since I've read any Jack London and it was good to get back in the adventure story groove. He does paint a good visual in one's mind of the settings even with the 19th century language. The story moves along pretty well although some of the flowery romantic speech seem to drag for me. The conclusion was sufficiently satisfying and it is suitable reading for young readers."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"When I first dipped into THE SEA WOLF, I was struck by its similarity to CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Humphrey van Weydon's ferry-steamer, The Martinez, is rammed by another ship in San Francisco Bay in a heavy fog. Van Weydon is rescued by Wolf Larsen, captain of the seal-hunter, The Ghost. Larsen refuses to take Van Weydon ashore, laughing at his offer of money. Once again, I am reminded of another famous book, MOBY DICK, and Larsen is Captain Ahab. Ruthless and single-minded, Larsen decides to make Van Weydon his cabin boy on this four month trip to provide seal pelts for fashionable American women. Van Weydon resists until Larsen catches hold of his arm and squeezes. A man of letters who freely admits never working a day in his life, Van Weydon does everything he's told from that point on, including aiding and abetting the Captain as he mistreats his crew.Early on we learn some of Larsen's motivation when he and Van Weydon have a literary discussion. We discover that Larsen is a literary bully. He's never spent a day in school, but he reads Shakespeare, Robert Browning and John Milton. London's theme becomes clear and Larsen and van Weydon argue about immortality, van Weydon declaring that man has a soul; Larsen retorting with a Scrooge-like \\"Bah!\\" And suddenly we have the first gleanings of an existentialist novel. If there were no God, how should man behave? Larsen, seeing evil everywhere he looks, decides he will do whatever is best for him personally.The conflict is not precisely good versus evil. Van Weydon is a weakling, a pampered rich man, a coward. There is also much to admire about Wolf Larsen. He outduels seven men during a mutiny. He's constantly reading, constantly trying to understand. When Van Weydon's story arc begins to ascend--he learns seamanship, rebuilds the ship when its masts are destroyed--we can't help but give Larsen a bit of credit. Larsen never took no for an answer, no task was too difficult.Another interesting element in the book is London's fledgling steps toward women's liberation. Van Weydon falls in love with another castaway, Maud Brewster, and together they overcome storms, isolation on a small seal rookery, and sabotage.I guess I knew London was a better writer than the man who wrote CALL OF THE WILD (His short story \\"To Build a Fire\\" is one of my favorites), but I wasn't expecting a philosophical discourse wrapped around a sea adventure."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Great book! I had never read Jack London before but after visiting his burnt down estate in Northern California I became interested in his writing. This book is excellent, entertaining and fast paced. The kindle edition seems not to be missing any pages. Great Free Download."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Caution: The Sea Wolf is full of examples of man's inhumanity to man. If you are easily upset by callous disregard of the health and safety of others, you will not enjoy this book. Further, the book describes many of the worst abuses of the ways that seals were hunted for their fur.On the surface, The Sea Wolf is a story about seal hunting expeditions to the Bering Sea. Beneath the surface, this book is an allegory about the nature of a human's life.The Sea Wolf is one of those novels that explores philosophy as its primary purpose. The idea is to take abstract philosophical ideas, and make the philosophies come to life by putting them into interesting circumstances. So while there's an adventure tale on the surface of The Sea Wolf, that story is there merely to provide examples of the philosophical points. So don't be surprised if the adventure falters from time to time in favor of developing the philosophical examples. In the Sea Wolf, action is included primarily for character development rather than the reader's visceral entertainment.In this book, Jack London was obviously fascinated by the new theories of Social Darwinism that grew out of Darwin's Origin of Species, indicating that the most capable people survived and prospered while the least capable fell by the wayside. Another influence was Nietzsche's concept of the amoral superman. A third influence was Milton's poem, Paradise Lost, and the role that Lucifer played in that story. To explore these points, Mr. London developed Captain Wolf Larsen, owner of the seal hunting schooner, Ghost. Captain Larsen is as amoral and strong in body and mind as you can imagine. Think of him as 100 percent traditional masculinity.For a counterpoint, Mr. London looked to the traditional concepts of the Christian gentleman. Such a man is concerned with matters of the soul, helping others, ideas, and pursuing perfection. Taken to its extreme, such a man becomes almost like a woman. To develop this contrast, Mr. London uses the character of Humphrey van Weydon (known as \\"sissy\\" van Weydon to his friends while growing up) who is a literary critic.The story evolves through putting Humphrey van Weydon into Larsen's world. The book's key theme is that a true man combines the virtues of a Christian gentleman with the masculine strength and independence of his sex's superior qualities over many women (like a successful jousting knight), but this true man can only be completed by the company and spiritual connection to a good woman (much like the medieval knight had to have his lady as a source of platonic love). As you can imagine, this theme will not inspire those looking for a nonstop, heart-pounding adventure tale.The power of the story comes in the book's first half, when you will not know what to expect next from Wolf Larsen. If you are like me, you will feel a little involuntary discomfort every time Larsen comes near van Weydon . . . or anyone else, for that matter. The book's second half will be less appealing to most male readers, but will be the more appealing part for many female readers.Many readers will find the coincidences that bring the characters together when they do to be more than a stretch, and draw away from the story. I suggest that you look upon these circumstances as being intended to portray the hand of Providence, in Mr. London's way of thinking.The book's strength is the way that the van Weydon character develops. You will come to appreciate his trials and the ways he handles them. If you find that you don't like that character after 75 pages, I suggest that you read no further unless you are otherwise enjoying the book.May all your endeavors be worthy of your highest ideals and potential!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London's stated intention in writing this book was to place a man and a woman, both intellectual, well-to-do, yet socially soft (physically and psychologically). into the very challenging world of a seal hunting boat and watch them strive for survival. In this context, he has created one of the most fascinating characters of all literature, Wolf Larson, the inhuman captain of the &quot;Ghost.&quot; Larson takes great delight in the suffering he brings to Humphrey Van Weyden and Maud Brewster, but they steadily grow to meet the challenge. This book can be read and enjoyed on two levels: As a rousing sea adventure, or as a discourse on society and sociology. Jack London is my favorite author -- I am in the process of collecting first editions of all fifty of his books -- and yet I find Sea Wolf ranks head and shoulders above all his other works. It could explain why this story has been turned into a film seven times, more than any of his his other stories, including The Call of the Wild. Two of cinema's great Wolf Larsons have been Edward G. Robinson and Charles Bronson."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"It's a real shame that Jack London coupled one of his most fascinating and full-blooded characters with a stinker of a love story which carries no conviction.Maud Brewster, like many of London's female characters (from Skeet, Curly and Mercedes in The Call of the Wild to Beth, Alice and Collie in White Fang), is underdeveloped, a mite hysterical, and completely dependent on the male characters. Without much in terms of psychological complexity, Maud provides a poor, poor reason for Humphrey Van Weyden to rebel against Wolf Larsen.The first half of this book and its final few chapters are superb because London's male characters and their struggles are vividly portrayed. The knife-whetting contest between Mugridge and Hump; the homoerotic segment where Hump tends to a naked and wounded Larsen; Johnson and Leach's struggle against Larsen's iron fist -- London obviously loves these characters and gives them the light of day. Maud is another story.In any event, the first half of this book is the top-notch tale of a Miltonic hero's slow slide from power, and the ending a moving fulfillment of this character's destiny (life, in the end, *is* yeast...but a savagely active and beautiful yeast, at that). Another one of London's terrible worlds unfolding its brutal majesty before us -- and, of course, another book inexplicably relegated to the children's section of many a book store."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Humphrey Van Weydon is an affluent gentleman living in San Francisco during the early 1900's. Because of his inherited father's wealth, he hasn't had to work a day in his life, has gotten a first class education, and spends most of his time reading and discussing the latest novels. One foggy day as he travels across the bay to visit a friend there is a collision, and he is cast into the sea. After being rescued, he discovers that he is aboard a seal-hunting ship bound for Japan with a cold-hearted captain. This captain, known as the Sea Wolf, has no respect for Humphrey's money and decides to keep him aboard to be used for work in the galley. The Sea Wolf also has no respect for life, viewing it as fermenting yeast with the most brutal aspects of natural selection in play. He is a self-educated man and talks with Humphrey about life, philosophy, literature, et cetera. London describes their situation as \\"relations...between king and jester.\\" A gripping tale set on the high seas, this book will keep your eyes locked on Humphrey's changing life, and the Sea Wolf's deadly ways.I recommend this book because many things are taken for granted in today's rich American society, not least of which being the ability to stand on your own two legs. Most of the modern population depends on others for survival, and this dependence has made us weak. When Humphrey Van Weydon begins to stand on his own he goes through a considerable change, as most people do when faced with a crisis. This change can make or break someone, but like the old adage goes, \\"whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\\" While this story is filled with suspense and amazement, the intriguing philosophical concepts arouse your mind and keep the gears turning. The Sea Wolf is an excellent novel, a classic in every sense of the word, and one that teaches much about the human struggle for survival and self-improvement."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Many consider The Sea-Wolf by Jack London to be among the best sea stories ever written. I found it a moving and epic tale. Not only did it achieve great popular and literary success, but it also was effectively realized in several cinematic versions (most recently as a TV mini-series). The story ranks in the great tradition of one of London's literary influences, Herman Melville, while I saw similarities to another story of a life changed by sea voyage, captured by Rudyard Kipling in Captains Courageous.Drawing upon his experiences seal hunting in the North Pacific, London created a story with a lot of realism. He put himself and his contradictory nature into the two opposing characters, the captain Wolf Larsen, a ruthless and rugged individualist, the superman, and Humphrey van Weyden, a weak, but highly cultivated and virtuous gentleman. It is in the clash of these two forces that London gives vent to his innermost struggles: idealism versus materialism, conscience versus instinct, desire versus soul."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is not a book that one easily forgets. True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm.Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him.There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Seawolf is a great story, definitely written in the early 1900s style, similar to Jules Verne, etc. In a way, it makes you want to be out on the open sea!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf contains familiar themes of other Jack London books. Man (or animal) from a comfortable background thrown into in a life and death struggle with the forces of nature due to a bad twist of fate.Also the Wolf Larsen characters philosophizing in this book led many to believe that the book Might is Right (which Anton Lavey later plaigarized and renamed The Satanic Bible) was ghostwritten by Jack London. I dont believe London wrote Might is Right because after doing the math he would have had to have been a teenager when he wrote it however I do think its possible that he read it and the rants in it may have influenced him and his creation of Wolf Larsen. I saw a documentary on Lavey where he talked about what a profound influence the Wolf Larsen character in the Sea Wolf was on his own personal outlook.Overall this is one of my favorite books. Anybody that appreciates Jack Londons other work should read this."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"_This is not a book that one easily forgets. True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm._Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him._There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave._Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf by Jack London. This book is about Humphrey Van Weydon who is a gentleman that lives in San Francisco. He is a wealthy man through inheritance of his father. He is traveling across the bay to visit a friend when a collision occurs and he is sent overboard. Wolf Larsen and his crew rescue him and decide to keep him onboard for the seal-hunting ship bound for Japan. During these times Humphrey Van Weydon learns how to stand up on his own, because he has never had a real job before. I like the book because of the vivid descriptions and it keeps you interested because of the story being out at sea."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"London details Jack Larson in such a way he allows the reader to really get to know this 'wolf'. London has a gift for development of characters like no other author I have read.Great story!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Dick Hill does a brilliant cockney English, a satisfactory Van Weyden and the narration is acceptable. As for who Wolf Larsen is, Hill doesn't have a clue. His reading of Larsen is flat, stuck in a monotone. From Larsen's first word to the last, with one exception that left me wanting, Hill is expressing Larsen's moments of anger, elation, sadness, passion, force, pessimism, reflection, (rare) mirth, depression, and in general every word of normal conversation- in variations of barking, snapping, shouting, bullying, threatening and spitting.In depicting Larsen as nothing but a brute, Hill is depriving him of his extraordinary intellect, his magnetism, his social skills, the intelligence guiding his power and his beauty.The five stars are for London's masterpiece since they apply to rating the book and not the CD. This recording is worthless to me."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf, by Jack London is a very interesting and unique book. The story starts with a gentleman, a Mr. Humphrey Van Weyden taking a nice cruise on San Francisco Bay. All of but a moment, a simple twist of fate changes his life forever. The large ferry-boat he was on, the Martinez was suddenly struck by a steamboat in the dense and sometimes deadly San Francisco fog. As he was floating through the water he is picked up by the schooner Ghost whose captain is known infamously for his cruelty, Wolf Larsen. Soon he is thrust into a world of hard labor and death waiting around the corner always.The book is a coming of age story, although it is unique because the one coming of age is already 35 years old. His whole life Humphrey Van Weyden never had to work for anything. He was a scholar; his job was a literature critic because his father had made all of his money for him. Once employed on the Ghost he must learn to fend for himself or be killed. But he finds that his incredibly muscled brute of a captain with no regard for human life or suffering actually has an incredible intellect. They end up discussing the philosophy of life multiple times. Soon, a pretty scholaress from the east of which Humphrey enjoyed reading very much appears on the Ghost setting a gap between Humphrey and Wolf Larsen. From then on the story takes an interesting turn and keeps you on the edge of the railing if not your seat.If you like swashbuckling adventure, great philosophical arguments and outlooks on life unique to the brain of Jack London, even a love story here and there, then I would recommend this book against all others. I have never read anything like it at all."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is a gripping, thrilling and stunning peice of work. Van Weyden and Larsen come to grips with eachother and with themselves in this book. The confrontation scenes between the two are amazingly written and the stark realism of the boat, it's crew and the violence that is almost an everyday occurence combine to make this a book that can not be put down.The introduction of the female slows the book considerably but in my honest opinion, the ending is fine. Larsen's final fate is surprising and heart rending. The repeated phrase &quot;Bosh&quot; leads to one of the books best moments. While I wish London hadn't included the female, the book is well worth the read. At least before the female comes in, the book is darkly violent and challenging. The social implications of the debates between Van Weyden and Larsen are extremely sobering. All in all, this book is one of the best I have ever read. Brilliant is the best word I can come up with."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"If you enjoyed &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; or &quot;White Fang&quot;, then you'll probably like this book as well. The plot is basically the same...a weak creature is torn from it's sheltered life and forced to endure hardship. (Whatever doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.) A must read for fans of Jack London and adventure on the high seas!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is the first recreational book I have read in years and I couldn't put it down. There is so much in this book about life and the meaning of life, if there is any, that it will definitely force you to think about what it all means to you.This book rocks! The romance part was critical for Hump so just ignore the other comments! 8-)"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The book was boring and did not hold my interest"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"\\"The Sea Wolf\\" is probably the most homoerotic novel written by an allegedly straight auhtor. I stress the word ALLEGEDLY. Jack London was a notorious womanizer. He was married twice and cheated on both wives. Yet his female characters are very bland and deprived of any kind of sexual appeal. Yes, London had mated with many women. But he did not understand women. He suffered from the infamous Madonna-Whore complex. There were those \\"disposable\\" women in bars and seaports, whose names he never bothered to remember. And then there were women like his second wife Charmian Kitteridge, whom he deified. Charmian served as the prototype for his Maud Brewster. Jack London uses very reserved, proper diction to describe the physical attributes of Maud Brewster. She comes across as a well-preserved old maid, a cold Dresden doll. London concentrates on her pale face, frail figure and soft hair. There is no mention of her hips or breasts. You don't see any skin below the neck. And then you go back and reread the passage in which Vay Weyden takes care of Larsen after the mutiny incident. The intense erotic language that the author uses while describing naked male body leaves no room for doubt - men were of more interest to him than women."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The book is stupid.Don't read it.The plot basically involves a character named Hump (suggestive of London's sexual frustration?) who is verbose and stupid. Eventually he meets a girl and becomes monosyballic and even more stupid.The book is rife with technical detail about sailing, both boring and factually wrong. The author has the people doing things that one would not do (for example, in a heavy storm, the people tighten the sheets, resulting in a firm sail, which would in real life result in the boat capsizing ~ what they should have done is released one of the sails or rigged it half-mast). The boat is tedious for all of its verbosity and technical detail, which, ironically enough, adds nothing to the story and is factually wrong.London is an idiot. If I was not sure of it before reading this book, I am now. Fortunately, he realizes he is an idiot, and so roughly two thirds of this book consists of quotations from more successful, better writers.London repeatedly has the main character talk about how he loves the body of the capitan, and how he wants a relationship...seriously throwing the masculinity of the protaganist into question.Overall, this book offended me. It was so poorly written that my eyes hurt. I feel like my IQ dropped 40 points as a direct result of reading this drivel. Don't let it happen to you."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is probably one of the best examples of character devolopment that I have ever read. London paints a pictures of Humphrey, Wolf Larson, and the rest so that the act as real people. It is also topped off with a great story of adventure and romance. However, the most important point of the book is the good versus evil, or the one who believes in God versus the one who does not. The reader struggles with the same questions placed on Humphrey until the good finally triumphs in the end."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This book is a classic, and with good reason. Wolf Larsen is perhaps the best-developed character I have ever encountered in a novel. The story never lets up, and you will not be able to put the book down. Overall, it's a very exciting tale of the sea. Toward the end, however, the story becomes more of a romance. I didn't like this change of pace right at the end of such an exciting novel, and that's why I only give it 4 stars. But read it anyway, because it really is great!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I can't say anything bad at all about this fine novel which exhibits great storytelling and wonderful characters. &quot;Hump,&quot; also known as Humphrey Van Weyden, a wealthy and sophisticated gentlemen, is forced to endure the hard life of a sailor after being thrown from his own ship. A rich man must earn his keep to survive the treachorous nature of captain Wolf Larson. This is a classic story for all the sea-lovers inside us."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"No account of life at sea lacks the brutality &amp; harshness of it; Sea Wolf, although published in 1904, is an incredibly modern account! Too often, first-person narratives are self-absorbed &amp; self-conscious: narrator Van Wyden is that sort of person, but the narrative is not! The twin characters of Wolf Larson &amp; Van Wyden seem to be a composite of Jack London himself!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I was rummaging around in some boxes at our other farm and came across this book. It was one of the greatest finds of my life. The edition I read was from the sixties and still cost less than a dollar. I read the book in a week. Wolf Larson is Londons finest achievement. He is a man that believes there is no good in man. Just an insatiable hunger for more. This book really made me think &quot;Hey Jack London isn't that far off the mark. Man is mostly out for himself.&quot; I don't think I could have survived under his iron rule like Van Weyden did. I would suggest this book to anyone that can read."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I couldn't put it down. I do believe it is one of London's best. I was engrossed in the spell of Wolf Larsen, as was Humphrey Van Weyden. I constantly felt I was reading a lesson in how life can turn in an instant. The end got pretty slow but all in all it was excellent."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This book constitutes Jack London's bout with Nietzsche and his barbarous hero, who stands above the masses and reigns \`beyond good and evil'.His \`hell-ship' is a model representation of the hell-world where men seek ferociously one another's lives.Major parts of this story are still highly relevant.The masterThe storyteller is fascinated by the sea wolf, his \`total lack of viciousness, or wickedness, or sinfulness ... a man who had no conscience, a man so purely primitive, (who) came into the world before the development of the moral nature. He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.' For him, might is right and weakness wrong.The master's vision on the world and mankind\`Why should I be parsimonious with (human) life which is cheap and without value? There are more sailors than there are ships for them. On the land, you house your poor people in the slums of cities and loose famine and pestilence upon them, and that there still remains more poor people dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat (which is life destroyed). Have you ever seen the London dockers fighting like wild beasts for a chance to work?'The challengeThe master's \`materialism' is challenged \`by the indomitability and moral grandeur of the soul' (conscience): \`Where was the grandeur of life that it should permit such wanton destruction of human souls?'The master's \`unmorality' (\`the culmination of all savagery') comes out of the dark through the eyes of a prefect anti-Nietzschean hero: a woman. At first, she is also fascinated by the barbarous force. But this fascination turns into terror. His \`unmorality' veils only destruction and auto-destruction.Evaluation and relevancyThe reign of the Nietzschean hero is forcefully and masterfully evocated, with now and then some outbursts of sensationalism (e.g. the shark incident). But, from the moment a girl makes her apparition, the quality of the novel sinks rapidly to the level of a \`better' three-penny love story. Superlatives are not enough; they have to be repeated: \`the finest product of the finest civilization'.The mentality of the barbarous hero continues to flourish in our \`civilized' world, where the powerful few show benign neglect for individual lives and kill wantonly via their long arms (army, intelligence services) all those who threaten their omnipotence and interests.Jack London wrote an integer, realistic, but not a perfect (sometimes too sentimental) masterpiece.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"A young attorney finds the life he has always known dissappears as the coast of California disappears in the fog.

Wolf bellows &quot;Can you impose your rights on me?!&quot; &quot;No&quot;, whimpers Hump. &quot;Then you have no rights&quot; snarls Larson.Can Humphery Van Weyden survive?"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I read this book in my second year of college. Jack London had been my favorite author in my youth mostly because I like animals so much, and thus enjoyed his more creature focused books and shorts. The Sea Wolf introduces us to Wolf Larsen, possibly one of the five greatest characters I have encountered in all of my reading. I can't say that London paints Wolf Larsen as a realistic man because he is superhuman. He is a God, a Ghost, a Guru, an absolute master of his universe.Then the female comes in.The book simply goes to pot. What was building as a tense study of refinement versus the laws of survival simply disappears. The book goes out horribly.The book builds a vast resevoir of intensity and drama, but the dam never bursts. The water just flows back into the ocean. The incredible power of the first two-thirds of the book is forgotten.So in summary, read this book for the character of Wolf Larsen, and for the narrator, who London does a more than admirable job with. Then forget about the ending, and imagine for yourself what should have happened."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure if I would or not, since it was written a century ago, but, I did. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys sea adventure stories."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"This was one of the few books I found on Amazon regarding the subject of resisting a system. I find it a tough read, because of the author (Gandhi himself) has a writing style I find unexciting. The book started with a very methodical explanation of what Satyagraha is, and inserts transcripts of hearings before British officials (yawn!). A book I wish I hadn't bought, but your style may be different and you may enjoy it."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"I loved this book from cover to cover. It's an amazing story of one man's non-violent battle against the food-arazzi. Okay, truth be told, I skimmed through the first half but the part where Gandhi went on the hunger strike was a total inspiration to me and my Pro Ana group. Gandhi lived his life just like we do...but he did it first! He knew about the evils of food long before it was popular to say so. He starved so that we may starve too. If you ask me Gandhi was like the American Jesus. I think he wore sandals too!! And that's what make him a REAL American hero!!!P.S. If you get too hungry you can eat this book. LOL. Kidding. Don't eat ANYTHING! EVER!"},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"I learned a great deal from Mahatma Gandhiji (1869-1948) by reading NON-VIOLENT RESISTANCE. This book is a collection of articles written at the hand of Gandhiji for the magazines &quot;Young India&quot; and &quot;Harijan&quot;. In addition, there are some interviews. The term Satyagraha was authored by Gandhiji to describe the process of non-violent resistance. Satyagraha has as its goal reform. It requires a great deal of discipline on the part of the participants. It also requires an opponent that is capable of reform. I have been applying what I have learned from this book in an attempt to reform myself. If you are interested in the life of Mahatma Gandhiji, or in the process of non-violent resistance, this book will be interesting to you."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"I liked this book because it makes Gandhi's ideas concrete and specific. He talks about how to handle specific situations, and explains his thinking - for example, his view of picketing. Specific examples of how to handle specific situations give you more insight into what non-violent resistence and non-cooperation really mean as applied to real life situations. After reading this book, you have a much better sense of how to apply Gandhi's ideas, versus just an overview of his ideas as abstraction."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"So very few books could boast truly world-changing ideas like this one. The effects of Ghandi's teachings have of course spread far beyond the struggles in South Africa and India to the civil rights movement in the US and more. Non-violence has never been weighed and found wanting, it has been weighed, found difficult and ignored. But, in the end, the way that looks easier, the way of violence, is the truly hard path to follow. What seems the longest road is not necessarily the most difficult to travel. We all need to review Ghandi from time to time and regain that other path away from self-destruction."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"I have studied Gandhi's philosophy a great deal both personally and in an academic setting, and this is on of the best introductory texts on Satyagraha I have found.If you want a solid conceptual understanding of probably Gandhi's most important concept, this will serve you well. If you want a very brief intro, then you may find this a little long and sections boring. But, I think that covering Gandhi's thought deserves this much space to flesh out his seemingly crazy ideas.As others have noted, this is a compilation work. Almost everything you find by Gandhi will be in this format. The fact is the bulk of Gandhi's writing is in letters, short articles, etc.I also saw that some were complaining that there were too many Sanskrit/ Gujarat words. Their inclusion actually makes this compilation stronger. There are some concepts that just don't translate easily, and this book is very judicious in including the minimum of foreign words (and their explanation!) the reader will need to actually comprehend the breadth of Gandhi's concepts. Other incidental 'foreign' words are dealt with well enough-they won't get in the way from understanding.My undergrad thesis was on Gandhi's philosophy in political though, and I had to read a good deal of his writing and books about his writing. I still found myself referring back to this book for easily accesible material on the concept of Satyagraha."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"Now with everything that is happening ; the Arab Spring, the Wall Street Occupation, the World Revolution in general, I find reading Gandhi's Satyagraha extremely crucial for the peoples to make sure that everything goes for the betterment of humanity.What is really amazing about this book, and I consider it a political one, is that it's mainly dedicated for spirituality! This makes perfect sense. If you are not pure in the soul you cannot really adopt the method of non-violent resistance effectively.The Satyagraha is very simple in theory, Gandhi is right in saying that you can teach it to a 6 year-old child! But it's extremely tough to put it into practice.Yesterday I was bullied by some twitter follower because I said I liked the book. I don't think I was successful in remaining all calm and peaceful when responding to him! lol :-)I promise to try harder next time.One more thing; the book is kinda repetitive.. just saying!"},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"While I agree with previous reviewers that the writing quality on this book is not the best, I have to admit the insight is amazing. Gandhi's ideals are an inspiration in my life and I am anxious to keep reading his work."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"I helped a high school student write a research paper about how Gandhi's method of nonviolent resistance freed India from the british. The teacher loved it and had her present it to the whole class. She got an A on the paper and in the class. Great background for the Jewel in the Crown PBS series."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be about the complete teaching of Satyagraha, so I was surprized and disappointed to read on page 37 that: &#34;We include discourses on only four of the vows her, viz. those of Truth, Non'violence, Chastity and Non-possession. The remaining seven..........the reader is referred for Gandhiji's discourses on them to his booklet &#34;From Yeravda Mandir&#34; (published by the Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad).I had not finished reading the book, but the more I read, the more dissatisfied I am becoming. There are several reasons for this: 1-The way the book is written. It uses many Indian words that you have to keep referring to the definitions on p. vii to figure out what Gandhi is talking about. Why not just update the book and plug in plain english words for these Indian words and phrases? 2-As the book is a historical recounting of Gandhi's progressive learning process of Satyagraha, he makes many references to events which the reader, almost a century later, has no idea what he is talking about.All in all, if you are looking for a clear and concise book about the teaching of non-violent resistence, this is not a book I would recommend. The teaching of non-violent resistence could be condensed and simplified in a way that, this book fails to do."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"This, along with the works of Emma Goldman, Albert Parsons and similar syndicalists as well as modern day Subcommandante Marcos (Our word is our Weapon) are the combined answer to the revolution against the ruling class and for the heart of the human spirit that WE ALL NEED TO READ."},{"Title":"Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)","review":"Though not a perfect spokesperson for the human race - he asserts that Buddhists cannot be non-violent satyagrahis because they don't believe in God (!) - there is one line in the openning page that sums up his entire stance for me: we are not competent to punish each other e.g. we are not all-knowing Gods.

Beautiful artist drawings of the planes in flight,frontal,plan and elevation drawings,National Markings from different periods,large multi-page fold-outs for comparing similar planes from same era,charts of statistics on speed,production,large double- page drawings of cut-aways detailing and identifying all major parts,242 B&W; photographs of actual planes,and write-ups on each plane which are loaded with information.The only thing that one could say that was not covered is scenes of any of these planes in action.Although many of them never saw any wartime action,that was their prime purpose and reason for funding for development;many certainly did with amazing performances.But that would take a whole other book!I am not into the depth of aircraft as some of the other reviewers,but have been keenly interested in military aircraft ever since a kid during WWII.I lived about 30 miles from a military airbase and watched thousands of planes flying overhead.One day,while watching a formation of Hawker Hurricanes at a distance;I saw two of them accidently collide.I can still see the two planes tumbling and spinning to the ground;while only one parachute appeared. Over the years ,I've watched numerous Air Shows and it was great to see all these planes appear in this book.Of course,of all the planes I've seen;they are but a miniscule amount of those that were designed,built and flown.This book will become a very important addition to my library since I read a lot of military history;and am continually reaing about some plane I wish I had more information or pictures of. This book will solve that need.It will be fun to see if a plane is mentioned somewhere,but not covered in this book.But;I don't think that will happen very often.And time marches on...relentlessly!I was pleased that the F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter was chosen for the cover.What an amazing aircraft and as favorite of many.What a day when it appeared at the CNE Airshow in Toronto in 1993.\\"If we needed the door kicked in,the stealth(fighter) was the one to do it.\\"..Gen.Lloyd Newton,original F-117A pilotIt was as sad as any Obituary ,when an article appeared in the Totonto Star on November 2,2006 ; with a picture of this plane telling us that itis being retired from active duty,after only 25 years.A few interesting points about it;\\"It flew over Bosnia,Panama,Iraq- the only plane to attack downtown Bagdad-and Afghanistan and \\"reshaped how the air force looked at strategic warfare.\\"\\"It was referred to as a fighter,though its main roles were bombing and reconnaissance.It wasn't particularly fast,not quite able to break the sound barrier.But no one ever managed to shoot it down.\\"\\"First flight was on June 18,1981;after only 31 months in development.Only 55 were built,the last in 1990.

In part, this suggests his relative achievement in the two genres. In part, our ignorance stems from the general fate of poetry as it has been almost totally displaced by the novel over the last 200 years. In the case of Clarel, the situation is even more trying: 500 pages (one of the longest poems in any language) of iambic tetrameter are not calculated for popular sale. Indeed, Melville had a growing tendency to push the average reader away especially as his works sold in inverse proportion to his growing skill. Still, this is an epic that informs us about Melville's relation with God and America's relations with religion and the old world. So if you care deeply about him or the ideas which haunt our country, you should read this best edition of the poem."},{"Title":"Clarel: A poem and pilgrimage in the Holy Land (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"Since no one else has written about Clarel, I thought I'd be nice to Melville and congratulate him on his epic poem. Although the poetry itself isn't always brilliant, I felt that the general tone of melancholic spirituality was powerful. Essentially, to me, Clarel was about a young man questioning his world, and searching for meaning in a seemingly meaningless existence. The book parallels Melville's own travels in Jeruseleum, and with this work, we get a glimpse into Melville's interpretation of spirituality. Highly recommended, considering that it is overshadowed by that other Melville work (Moby Dick, of course!)."},{"Title":"Clarel: A poem and pilgrimage in the Holy Land (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"This is a welcome affordable version of the Northwestern U./Newberry edition of Herman Melville's one epic poem. The poem is a useful window on the views of mid-19th century American Protestants who were neither orthodox nor liberal. Science (including Darwin)(and materialism (or \\"Mammon\\")) vs. Faith and the continuing presence in Palestine of Jews, Moslems, Catholics and Greek Orthodox, and tourists (sometimes viewed almost as another sect) are among the subjects of attention for Melville's Euro-American group of pilgrims.Negatives: 1) the story-line itself is less than gripping and is largely a device to enable the characters to conduct a series of debates.2) this edition, if my copy is any indication, is poorly bound: five segments of about 20 pages each fell out of the binding. (Despite this fallout, the spine of the book remained uncreased.) Only the first three segments of the book (about 150 of the 530 or so pages) remained intact."},{"Title":"The Merchant's Partner","review":"One, wintry morning, local midwife and \\"witch\\" Agatha Kyteler is found dead in a hedge at the edge of a field, her throat cut so viciously that her head is nearly severed. There seem to be no clues at all, until soon afterwards a youth - who recently boasted at how he felt the woman deserved death - flees the village of Wefford, seeming to confirm his guilt. All around are convinced that he is the culprit, but Sir Baldwin Furnshill, Keeper of the King's Peace, is not so sure...there are several niggling doubts, several things which the youth's guilt would leave unexplained. And Baldwin seems to be proved right when the runaway is captured once more, and soon after it is revealed that in fact has an alibi...Which means that Simon Puttock, bailiff of the area, is going to have to reassess his ideas and begin again...As far as historical mysteries go, this one is much more satisfying than his first, THE LAST TEMPLAR, which left a bit to be desired. THE MERCHANT'S PARTNER is a much better book, full of intrigue, red-herrings, subtle historical detail (be it correct or not, I don't much mind), good characters and an adequate plot.I don't think anyone will claim that it's full of action and excitement, but despite that this book is a page-turner because Jecks' writing really, really flows, leading us from one scene to the next with smooth ease. While in his first book the only characters who seemed real or developed were the two leads, this time around the development of his subsidiary characters is far more satisfactory, and the plot is a lot more interesting as well. Red herrings are laid expertly, taking the reader, and the investigators, completely down the wrong path, until the end when we finally see the light in what is an excellent solution to the mystery. If you're a fan of the historical mystery sub-genre, I would recommend you try Jecks...certainly, the rest of the series shows much promise indeed."},{"Title":"The Merchant's Partner","review":"I usually do not do reviews with Amazon but after reading the previous one of this book I simply had to.I am a frequent reader of medieval mysteries and have read most of the &quot;classics&quot;. With Michael Jecks series I found a new delightful author for myself.Even if historical backround may not be researched thouroughly enough (I do not know enough to judge this) I liked the book immensely.For me it was one of those books I simply cannot lay down. The mystery itself is surprising (even if the final solution is a bit aprupt and simple) and kept me guessing the whole book through. Furthermore I like the main characters - while defining the two major actors (bailiff and knight) in the first novel, other characters achieve more depths in this second story (e. g. the seargeant) - and their development from the previous book.I for sure am looking forward to read the next novels (which I just ordered) and hope that the quality of the books continues to be good."},{"Title":"The Merchant's Partner","review":"Merchant's Partner is a business like medieval mystery. It has all the right indgridients and has an interesting plot as well as a likeable lead character but somehow it never really rises above adequate.An old woman is found murdered and the local pretty boy is suspected of being the killer. Our hero, a former Templar knight (imagine a 12th century Catholic Jedi) must find the killer and prevent more murders. Along the way he's bedazzled by a sexy widow who may know more about the murder than she should.It's a solid begining but the story is marred by a horribly slow pace, and by historical blunders. The wolf scene was beautifully written but it rejects both history and animal behavior. The author also occasionally makes the mistake of making people from the past think and talk like folks do today.There are things to like about this book but there wasn't enough to make me want to stick with the series."},{"Title":"The Merchant's Partner","review":"An interesting time in history. Likeable characters, interesting plot.

His stories take place during medieval times, which I've always had an interest in. He seems to have done meticulous research, and does a good job keeping elements period specific. Of course, as with many series of books with the same characters, there is an element of redundancy. One must be able to begin each new book with new eyes, and enjoy the individual story being told. Jecks has a talent for throwing curves and keeping one in suspense. Characters are in-depth and it is not evident who the culprit is until the end of the story. I have already purchased 21 of his 28 books, and always look forward to picking up the next one."},{"Title":"The Merchant's Partner","review":"This is one of the best books in one of the best mystery series around!

The difference is that his characters range from peasants to merchants, villiens to nobility and include a fair range of clergy.

A master is at work here.I've read 5 so far and can't wait for my next shipment!"},{"Title":"The Merchant's Partner","review":"The two main positives, to me, are the characters and their relationships with each other and those around them, and the sense of place created by the author.

All in all, however, I may try his other books."},{"Title":"The Merchant's Partner","review":"Mr. Jecks, in his own Amazon commentary, mentions doing research. I suggest he do some more. His understanding of medieval England and the realities of life therein would shock even the most dimwitted SCA'er.Where to begin? The errors are so egregious that I'll start by saying that flat stomachs were NOT a feminine beauty ideal at the time, yet Jecks makes much of this and suggests that this flat stomach is part of a female character's sexual allure. Wrong; thank you for playing.Wolves were rare in England by the time in which this novel is set; I suggest the author take a look at, say, _Man and the Natural World_ by Keith Thomas which states on p. 273 &quot;Already at the beginning of the early modern period, England was distinctive among European countries because she had no wolves...the wolf seems to have survived on the North Yorkshire Moors and other high parts of England until the 15th c.&quot;In writing about pre-industrial societies one should know at least a little about horses. I found myself startled that the writer did not know a trot from a canter (gaits with very different mechanics and speeds) and threw in &quot;horsey&quot; words like &quot;pastern&quot; where they simply didn't go. The most spectacular example of this occurs near the end of the story, where a runaway horse slips on some ice and breaks its leg, which, the author solemnly informs us, is hanging from the forelock. The forelock is part of the mane; it is that tuft that grows between the ears and usually lies along the forehead. Horses can hurt themselves in all sorts of amazing ways but I've never heard of one quite like this. :)These may sound like pedantic quibbles, but they add up, and for the discerning reader such egregious errors are like repeatedly finding worms in one's salad.I think the author has some potential but he will have to do some more research, I'm afraid."},{"Title":"The Merchant's Partner","review":"I am writing this review after reading this book for the second time.

This book is no better than the usual motivational books so many of which are available on the market.Although the author says that this book stems from her own experiences in life but in reality one finds that she has only fleetingly mentioned about her own experience which led to this book being written. The chapters in the book are catchy but there is very little real substance inside.

It accounts for the time of Napoleon's return from Egypt to the day of his coronation as Emperor of France one year after the victory at la Bataille des Trois Empereurs.I can only really repeat what I have said in other reviews - that this series is essential reading for anyone interested in the interior view of Napoleonic events as seen through the eyes of Napoleon himself. Because it is such an incisive interior view, the reader who is not already knowledgeable about the major events must read some kind of historical anthology along with these books to make any real sense of them. I promise, however, that this targeted syntopical reading will pay big dividends in providing a low cost/high benefit perspective on the age.For the truly ambitious, I also recommend getting a copy of a book that surveys the Marshals of France and another that canvases the love interests of Napoleon. With all that, a great deal of pleasure and comprehension can be achieved from the reading.For those already sophisticated in Napoleonic history, the books offer a unique perspective that is missing almost everywhere else. The books can be read along with viewing the DVDs of the four-part A&E; adaptation. Personally, the books are much better. However, the movie does deliver voices and characters to the written story.You cannot go wrong reading these books. They are well crafted and interesting. I am done reading all of them and, sad to say, looking for something as good and as insightful.For some reason everyone is more interested in the end of Napoleon these days than in the glories and struggles that went before. I guess maybe because the 200th anniversary period is running its course and all the knowing authors want to be positioned for the culmination of the all-European celebration of the age now ongoing.Well, we still have seven years till the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, so there is plenty of time to catch up for the glory now in store.So get cracking. Read my other Gallo reviews, and if you like, review my lists that apply to the great age of France, when Western Civilization passed from the Enlightenment to Romanticism, and when the political makeup of Europe passed from the hands of royalty to the complexities of democracy.This book is essential to the whole story because it is a microcosm of the age. From the heat of the Pyramids, Napoleon rises from a common soldier to the Emperor of Kings. It is a kind of Horatio Alger story that almost cannot be believed."},{"Title":"The effectiveness of motor carrier safety audits","review":"If you are interested in a general survey of European history during this period, which is ironically what this book purports to be, I'd suggest starting somewhere else. This book is complementary to an already working knowledge of these years in Europe but as the initial exposure to it will frustrate anyone. Roberts describes some events in insightful detail but then makes passing reference to others I consider major ones without explanation, as if assuming the reader already knows about them. He does this with annoying regularity. If you are looking to fill in the cracks of your knowledge on this subject, this may be the book for you. Otherwise find a genuine survey on the subject and build some depth first."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Shallow , reveals the authors immaturity (a 20 something) but a fast read and it gave me what I wanted : a sense of what it is like to be a woman in a combat bragade in Iraq .

I can guarantee you that I will, but not before popping at least two Benadryl and making sure I have at least a day to recover. Why? Because what I heard on the NPR interview with Ms. Gross made me realize that even though I left Iraq in 1991 (Desert Storm was \\"my\\" war), that absolutely NOTHING had changed. Ms. Williams told \\"my\\" stories. I, like Ms. Williams, served in an intelligence unit exactly like hers. My experiences were uncannily similar. Make that terrifyingly similar. And that's why I'll need the Benadryl--to keep the storm in my head down below Category 4.To sum up: Ms. Williams is telling the truth. And so was I.Update: I bought the book today, and am about half way through it. I didn't care much for Ms. Williams' pre-military experiences precisely because I didn't care. All I needed to know is that she joined for many of the same reasons I did--boredom, a need for change, the challenge, finding herself in a dead-end situation.As she told of her experiences from Basic Training on, though, it was as if I was telling my own story with only the names changed. I too, was a 98G. I went through the same language school, only for Russian. I was on the same kind of team (different equipment, different decade) as she was. I had the SAME kind of idiots as team leaders.What was different for me in Gulf War 1.0? It was a shorter deployment. I didn't get constipated from MRE's, because I became allergic to several of the components in them. I think that's about it.And halfway through the book, it's going to take a freakin' CASE of Benadryl to get through the night at this point...08/21/2006I never have been able to work up the nerve to read the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone.

But the material within, the events of that Williams underwent during the course of this book does clearly show that there are many systematic problems with the US Army, at least insofar as it's policies in Iraq are concerned.To be sure, this is probably not news to the television-watching public. Nonetheless it's one thing to make idle generalisations about the US Army's role in Iraq, but quite another to look at the experience of a soldier not really different to any other, save perhaps for a desire to write a book, and see that in fact many of the stories of complacency, stupidity and waste have basis in reality, without demonising the hard-working troops who are striving to make the country safe for the people there, yet hamstrung in doing so by Washington's policies.Read it to understand common attitudes and experiences for female soldiers in Iraq, and remember it's one woman's story, not an analysis of the war itself, and not a novel."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"This book got tons of mixed reviews, as anyone can see and usually I carefully study all of the reviews written by sane, literate people and then decide whether or not I'll buy a product. This time I studied them and then decided to buy the book anyway, because it seems to me that half the negative reviews are textbook examples of sour grapes. People who used to know her who are upset for a variety of trifling reasons.The book is entertaining. The upset naysayers can disagree all up and down the block, but the book was easy to read and flowed rather well, I thought! It read as well as a Dan Brown novel, at least. I mean, this isn't going to go down in the annuls of classic literature or anything, but it's a proper and readable book. That's to cover all the people reviewing this who grossly exaggerated Williams' (supposedly) poor literacy sense and suggested that the book is barely even in English or suitable only for the perusal of toddlers. This just isn't true.Yes, the book is scant on details. Part of this is due to security, but I think part of it is just due to her champing at the bit to get to the complaining. I would have liked for her to dwelt a little on the smaller matter like BCT and AIT. Everyone I know who has been in the military has good boot camp stories. Amusing tales of the many foibles of that person in basic who just can't seem to get it together or stories about that time that the D.S. really lost it. You know, something. It's not like she was protecting anyone from embarrassment' she has no problem going out of her way to try to embarrass people later in the book. I really think that her decision to skip all of that was a bad one, even though I understand that it was boring to her, civilians reading an Army memoir want boot camp stories. It's just a fact.I also didn't particularly care for the way that she kept insisting on mentioning how she purposely suffered (her Morton's neuroma ailment) because she didn't want to abandon her team. This is honorable, but when it's brought up several times it starts to look like begging for attention. I don't doubt that she was in pain, but the point was made the first time.I have to mention that I did find it somewhat strange that a woman of her age and as highly educated and intelligent as she likes to make known that she is bases so much of her life on music and other juvenilities. She bases almost all of her perceptions of people and her friendships on what kind of music and books you like. I went through that phase too...when I was fifteen. Williams never fails to make it known that she has nothing but scorn for the eighteen year olds in the Army who have never had a house, been married or had a real job and yet her main method for measuring a person's worth is one that a lot of eighteen year-olds are starting to grow out of.Williams does do a lot of complaining about how mis-treated she thinks she was by everyone in the Army, but I can't say I blame her for these feelings. Haven't we all felt that way? Haven't we all been sick or tired and thought, \\"Lousy %#&!@*, didn't even bring me any food and here I am sick!\\" I think we've all been there.I think that she tried to be honest with this book. I think she really tried to tell us how she was feeling and unfortunately it just so happened that most of the time she felt betrayed, put upon and taken advantage of. SSG Moss, Lauren Collins, James Reid, Sgt Quinn, the COLT team - these people have not, to my knowledge, written books of their own, so there's no real way of knowing how much of Williams' story is truth and how much of it is colored by her perception and prejudices.One thing I do find interesting is that the book features very little evidence of any positive relationships with anyone, even though obviously she had some. The photos in her book are proof enough of this. Next to each photo there is credit given to the taker and there are a number of intimate, friendly portraits, most of which were taken by the same few people (Justin Edgecombs, Craig Sanchez and Sean Baker mostly) and yet as far as I can recall none of these people are mentioned at all in the book, despite the fact that she must have spent quite a bit of time with them and been on friendly terms with them. To me, that says that the primary purpose of this book was to take jabs at people she was still angry at; to try to get a little revenge by airing some dirty laundry and that she just didn't have time to talk about anything having to do with the positive interactions and relationships she might have had. This book is especially on poor SSG Moss. Whoever that poor woman is, she got a serious beating.Bottom line, the book is actually a good read, but it might not be a very good portrayal of average life in the Army; I don't know because I wasn't there. I say read it, but like everything else, take what she says with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I read this book today and couldn't put it down. Kayla Williams did a great job of taking you back to her experiences on base during basic training or in Iraq during her tour of duty. The writing style is clean and the tone does not romanticize her experiences.I found it interesting that she was able to comment on the varying levels of sexism that was exhibited by her fellow soldiers. And, it was particularly telling that the Infantry treated her best and ultimately bestowed a much deserved award on her part for her support role. She offered a quasi-feminist analysis, if you will, without really doing so. Perhaps the co-author did this? Either way, I appreciated those moments in the book.She also complicates the whole enlisting process. She didn't want to go to war. She wanted to do more things with her life and she humanized her situation and the situation of other enlistees without glorifying American Patriotism or military might or revenge justice.Her relationship with Tariq really influenced the way she viewed people in Iraq and this made her more compassionate. Overall, I think that this was an honest book and think that most readers would get something out of it.The audience for this book is a lay one, but this book would also be useful in the social sciences or humanities classroom. I think this book would be great used with _One of the Guys_ in the university classroom."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I couldn't put this down. She goes in to what it's like to be a woman in the army. And what it's like to serve in Iraq. And the insane environment of trying to be both peacekeepers and combat soldiers at once.The most amazing thing is how she looks at herself and is critical of how she handles issues. Which gives tremendous credence to the criticism she levels at others.While no book can truly explain what it is like to be in combat, this book comes awfully close. And it makes you appreciate how incredible a lot of our soldiers are - like Sgt. Williams.Update:I have seen people complain about what subjects she concentrates on in the book (sex being a biggie). I think her concentration matches what they she was thinking about over there and that makes it an accurate book. Another vote in it's favor."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Kayla Williams is what she is, and makes no bones about it. She describes her ambivilent feelings on joining the Army and never tries to be anyone's hero. She pulls no punches with the Army nor with herself, exposing herself as flawed as anyone else.This is a very honest and gritty memoir of one person's participation in a war that is from her own unique perspective."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"While assuredly not my usual topic of interest, I definitely found this book to be an interesting read. Williams gives her readers enough about her early years for us to understand that she is from a loving but disintegrating family life, has a strong sense of right that is often smothered by insecurities, and an odd relationship with the truths of her Army career. I got the impression from the writing that Williams found many aspects bothersome and many things painful, but like a bruise on her arm, she had to keep poking at them to see where exactly they hurt and how much.The top two editorial reviews posted on Amazon are reasonably accurate, though I disagree slightly with each one. I didn't find most of the sexual harassment commentary very surprising at all, nor was I surprised to find out about the severe double standards she faced for \\"dissing\\" a guy stateside or read about her lack of a formal report of the one specific physical encounter she suffered. I was more surprised by her perception and descriptions of the lack of competency in her immediate superior officers. And yes, here's where my double standard shows - I would have expected that the female officers would have been especially competent rather than stunningly incompetent, simply from having to survive in that male-dominated environment. Shows what I know/knew about it.When I got to the section describing William's participation in the abuse of prisoners, I shut my eyes, and the book. I almost didn't pick the book back up to finish, because I did not want to read about - to actively acknowledge - that my country's Army did that. I finally did pick the book back up. I wanted to know how she faced it herself, and if she talked about the morality of her choice. Um, no, what was I thinking? She briefly touched on her discomfort and coulda-shouldas (just like in the harassment section), told her readers that she walked away from the situation, and moved on with the story.It is interesting to read and experience as she responds to the day-to-day requirements of the Army. She has a running commentary of questions and doubts about the orders and order of things in the Army. She also stops to tell us about the few moments of grace and hope (the rifle returned to the monastery) and camaraderie (hiking in the mountains) she has while she is in Iraq. But let me tell you, this book is not deep. It is not insightful. It is not pretty or hopeful or generous. It is a single-focus, single-depth narration of one woman's experience in the Army with a sprinkling of background and wash of surface motivations and explanations. In short, it's a choppy, ego-centric, short-tempered and frustrated narration of an unreal time in William's life.Read it anyway. It's not a great work of literature, but it's a different perspective from the mainstream on many difficult topics."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"This war memoir reveals a smug, self-absorbed author. Kayla Williams castigates the military and her fellow soldiers to make herself look superior, an immature approach that detracts from the book's success. Readers are reminded repeatedly of her college education, which leads one to question why she enlisted and chose not to be commissioned as an officer. The female officers and enlistees I know do not talk or act like Williams, and she's done a disservice to them and our men with this diatribe."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I found this book hard to read because of my dislike for the author. At the start of the story, we learn that she quits her civilian job because of problems with a female supervisor, which is a running theme throughout the whole book. Every female higher up (hell every female in the book) she dislikes because they are insanely incompetent. As a soldier, I understand crappy leadership, but women in our Army don't become SSG or higher by acting retarded and unmotivated. I feel like a good female soldier would highlight their female leaders skills and motivation, instead of making outrageous statements about them. This author seriously doesn't know how to look up to and respect other females without being jealous and hateful."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I picked this Kindle title to get a female perspective of the modern war effort and because of its original low price in e-book form. Although it was not exactly what I hoped or expected, and the author did seem a bit self-absorbed, I didn't find it as bad as some of the reviewers here suggest.Sure, sexism exists everywhere. It sucks that it exists within the military realm, but I hope her experience with the jerks she ran into among the ranks are the exception and not the norm. My biggest issue was with how well she proclaimed to do her job, especially in comparison to a female superior officer. Who is she trying to convince here, the reader or herself? As the old saying goes, me thinks thou doth protest too much!"},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Excellent book about our women soldiers of today that are now facing combat. Book arrived in very good condition and quickly. The language can be abusive to those not use to reading books with abusive language in them. Very open and good reading. Recommend seller."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Civilians reading this account of being a female soldier will never get it completely, so read their reviews with that in mind. This is why Williams, like others, has a difficult time adjusting upon reentering \\"civil\\" society. Williams is rude, crude, and sometimes lewd, but by the end of the book, you definitely get the feeling she has grown up some. She takes potshots at some of her superior NCOs, but such incompetence rings true. Other female soliers will definitely relate to many things in the book, male soldiers will get a view from the other side, and civilians can learn a lot about the Army culture."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Kayla Williams is an intelligent, interesting person with a lot to say about the war in Iraq and what it's like to be a soldier in today's American Army. Most of the publicity surrounding this book has focused on her experiences as one of the 15% of soldiers in Iraq who are women, and while that's reason enough to read it, the book is much more than that. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be a soldier in Iraq, or a woman stationed on a hilltop on the Syrian border, or a vegetarian enlisted in the Army, or an Arab linguist in the Middle East, you should read this book.It would not surprise me to see much of this book used as a primary source in business management and organizational studies texts. She writes a lot about the leadership faults of people in positions of authority in the Army, and about her frustrations with incompetent management. At one point she concludes that the Army is like a form of Communism. A lot of her complaints about mistakes her leaders make are not really specific to the Army however and any manager in any organization can learn from this book. For example, she often complains that she doesn't receive enough encouragement and reassurance that she is doing a good job. She's fairly typical of a lot of bright \\"individual contributors\\" who are smart enough to recognize faults in their leaders but do not yet have enough supervisory experience to learn how hard it is to be a leader.Ultimately she is very positive about her experience in the Army and although it is clearly not her intent, I think a lot of teenage boys reading this book could get the impression that a tour of duty in Iraq might be kind of fun. For this reason I would not want my 17-year-old son to read this book, because I don't want him to enlist.My only real complaint with the book is that she doesn't go into more detail on the many topics she covers. I would love to know, for example, how exactly one goes about doing \\"signal intelligence\\": what frequencies they monitor, how successful are they at intercepting and understanding radio traffic in Arabic, and how it is that half of her team in Iraq are trained in Korean and not Arabic (what is it that they can do exactly?). I would like to know more about what books she read while stationed on the Syrian border. She says that \\"everyone\\" understood that the war was not justified and yet I have to think not \\"everyone\\" thought this at the start of the invasion. I would like to know more about how people serving in Iraq would come to this conclusion."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Ms Williams paints a picture of herself getting the short end of the stick all the way through her time as a soldier, in fact most of her life. She focusses a lot of energy on how she \\"should\\" have been treated rather than pulling out broader lessons from her experiences for others to appreciate.She is harboring A LOT of anger about several things regarding her experiences in the Army everything from irresponsible leadership and sexual harrassment to a lack of available showers and vegetarian meals.She also shows lack of understanding of anything she is involved in from a broader perspective. For example, while in a transport convoy she expresses extreme anger over the fact that some \\"civilian\\" types encountered in Iraq talking on cellular phones could be dangerous and might need to be scared off or shot at. She compares this action to shooting at United States citizens talking on cellular phones. That is an unfair comparison and someone in her position should understand why.With so much whining about everyone else she comes in contact with, I can't help but wonder what the other side of her story is. It's too bad Ms Williams could not take this to the next intellectual & literary level."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Kayla Williams' Love My Rifle More Than You: Young And Female In The U.S. Army isn't your usual military account: it's an autobiographical account of author Williams' five years of service, including a year of deployment to Iraq during and after its invasion, and it recounts how Williams and her peers operate as specialists in military intelligence.

While I have respect for her tenacity and adherence to a code of honor and quality, I wondered what she really learned from her experience in Iraq.As with Crawford's book, I felt the author's youth and lack of having filtered her experiences through a personal philosophy or larger political vision. I also thought she was out for a bit of revenge (probably, well targeted) against those who made bad decisions that put lives at risk. (I'm not against revenge, per se; without it, most world literature would never have come into being, i.e., Dante's Inferno.)It's no longer shocking that soldiers become desensitized to their \\"enemy\\" but it does disturb me that soldiers so readily accept their government's idea of who the enemy \\"is.\\" Where's the anger at being duped by this administration, at risking her life to support Halliburton's market-share, at being used to traumatize other human beings who may or may not be guilty of any crime?The Iraqi people remain \\"faceless\\" in Williams' book; Crawford did a better job of getting up close to some of them. On the other hand, I appreciated Kayla Williams' revelations about being a woman in the new Army. I wonder if women in the Israeli Army, who have served for so much longer, are treated similarly as our young women soldiers?Thanks to Williams for writing her book; I'm glad I read it, even though it left me wanting more depth.

It's nothing more than a really long article in the Opinion section of a newspaper. I wouldn't waste my money on this book. It doesn't show how it REALLY is being a female and in the Army. She just glorifies herself in every situation she can. Besides, even though she was in a combat zone, she never saw any action. I can only pray that no females look up to Ms. Williams--that is disgusting. If you want to know what it's really like for females go to a training base and ask female Drill Sergeants. Those are the women I look up to and always will. They are strong, professional, intelligent...everything Kayla Williams is not.

If you are looking for a well written and lucid account of a woman's unique experiences in combat, keep looking (Actually, try She Went to War: The Rhonda Cornum Story.) If you are looking for some insight into how women's changing roles in society are manifesting themselves, hold your nose and give this a read. The very first hurdle you will have to overcome in getting through this book is the fractured \\"mall-chick\\" prose. Williams claims to be pretty sharp academically and perhaps she is but her grammar is horrific. The next hurdle is the style. This might be a gender thing but I find the \\"here's what happened, here's what I said and here's how I felt about it\\" structure of storytelling to be a root-canal sans novocaine.Taken together, I think those two defects make an excellent starting point in discussing why this book is worth a tree or two. I have no problem believing Williams is a well-educated and intelligent person. She has chosen to write in this dumbed-down voice not to be \\"accessible\\" but to provide plausible denial lest she be held responsible for what she has to say. Williams segues maddeningly between an intelligent young woman commenting on her place in world events and a vapid party-girl looking for her next thrill. And there is one of the big differences between men and women. Men are taught early on to decide who they are going to be: to thine own self be true. Women take pride in being able to \\"chameleon\\" their way through life and share tips with each other to refine their techniques.I was in the service and I continue to be fascinated with the culture of the military. Williams' account testifies that most aspects of military life haven't changed much since my day. But the account of Williams making her (female) sergeant cry and getting chewed out by her (also female) lieutenant for not being more sensitive to the sergeant's feelings gives the exact kind of insight to the modern army I was looking for.For most of human history, the military was the bastion of \\"maleness.\\" Strength, stoicism and principle were the walls meant to defend civilization in times of danger. There is a reason that two formations of young armed men marching toward each other across an open field and slaughtering each other inspires epic poetry while modern accounts of military activity often include the word \\"surreal.\\" Society is meant to protect women and children at the expense of men's lives. It will not be a simple thing for us as a people to learn entirely new roles for ourselves.

But then, if this were the story of just another GI, it wouldn't be half as interesting.Her stories of what it is like to be bright, pretty and female in an ocean of men. As with any GI, she treats the problem with a mixture of understanding and profanity. She doesn't explicitly state it, but she also learned an awful lot about men while in Iraq. At one location she was one of four women along with 500 men. As soon as you walk down the chow line, everyone is staring at you, at every part of you, with looks that clearly show what they are thinking.All in all, a great description of the life of a female in the Army. She has a great insight and can clearly express her thoughts and feelings."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Honestly, I thought this book was honest more than anything else. You guys can call her what you want, but it was her experience that she wrote about and I'm glad to have read the book! Definitely worth the time.Too much of the criticism for this book and Williams herself, come from men who are intimidated by strong women, so don't pay attention to it!"},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"This book revived memories of my time in the military, and gave me a better understanding of the challenges of being female in war, and the mental gymnastics of becoming a women in a man's environment. Some harsh language and graphic imagery; however, it was a journey of emotional and mental ups and downs that helps humanize the personal struggles of war,and let's the reader know how our military is made of all kinds of people who put their lives on hold for us each and every day,and let us take our safe and secure lives for granted."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"This book was a good buy!

Army. The writing style was simple. The story was easy to remember. Memoir"},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I checked out this book because a girl I know is leaving for the Army and I thought this would be good insight into a woman's experience in the service (I know everyone is different but maybe a little heads up of sorts). It was okay... and to be honest a book shouldn't be just okay. Other readers are right about the distance between the author and the content, the narcissism, the lack of detail about certain missions (but I guess that gets screened out since it is the military), and her ego.I thought Army basic training was about breaking people down and remaking them into a better, stronger, more capable person but I'm not sure how well they did with Williams. She complains about weight loss but doesn't bother to abandon the vegetarian diet and instead makes a big deal about it... it's her decision to be a vegetarian, not a religious thing. I choose to eat chocolate everyday; I don't think the Army would give a damn since it's not medically or religiously necessary.She confuses me with her relationships because she likes and dislikes people off and on again yet she complains about being lonely. The whole slut/bltch thing pops up at various times during the book but I think you have to wonder if her trying to be one of the guys and then completely distancing herself has anything to do about it. The fact that she really only has heart to hearts with people who share similar tastes in literature and music and maintains shallow connections with everybody else gives her an elitist air.It's an okay story that briefly touches on certain things and sometimes too much into others. I was hoping for something a little more detailed rather than a recounting of stories years gone which was how it felt."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"This book is a chronological account of the author's deployment in Iraq. The book discusses in considerable detail all of the highs and lows of the author's tour of duty including taboo topics such as violations of the Geneva Conventions. If you are interested only in the facts of what happened then this book has plenty to offer.However the book falls short because it fails to create a relationship between the reader and the characters. Although the author describes some horrific events, it is difficult to feel any genuine emotional engagement because for the most part the characters are very two dimensional.The author alludes to this at the end when she says \\"There are so many things that are still really tough for me to discuss\\". It seems as if she wrote the book prepared to pour out all the facts whilst being unwilling to truly open up her heart to the reader. Being unable to even imagine some of the horrors that the author faced I shall not criticise her for this I will simply say that it detracts from the story that she is trying to tell."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I actually sought out writing a review on this book -- something I rarely do.I picked this book up one day and barely was able to put it down. It is gripping and honest, and it helped me to get a better idea about the war and our soldiers' experience and that of civilians as well. My husband is reading it now and appreciates it as much as I did.Do yourself a favor and read it. I learned about it from [...], where I bought an autographed copy, by the way."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Being a female in the military I approached Kayla Williams book with some hesitation. But she surprised me by not writing a book that whined and complained about how females are treated, rather she gave a blunt and very accurate account of being female, being in the Army and being in the intel field. While I share each of these aspects with her, I too find that she gave me some insight into what it will be like for me to deploy forward. Her book was an easy read, the story flowed and to be honest, I read the book in probably two days...I couldn't put it down at times. I applaud her for penning the opinions that most of us females in the military keep to ourselves. I give her kudos for telling her experiences and for keeping it realistic. If you are looking for a personal account and the honest truth then I suggest you pick this book up."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I was hoping that this book would provide some insight on females in today's military. It does provide some perspective and a few eye-opening anecdotes, but nothing exceptionally deep. Additionally, the writing style is colloquial, which, although providing a more 'down to earth' feel, does get a little grating at times. A quick read and worth it for one person's account of the military."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Usually I rely on reviews to read or steer clear of books. Based on the reviews here I decided not to order the book. One day I was at the used book store and found a single copy of it and threw it along with the rest of the military books I was researching to determine whether or not I wanted to join the military - along with Joker One, Band of Sisters, and Lonely Soldier. I had previously read Generation Kill and One Bullet Away. I am glad I purchased the book. Some reviewers think the writing is subpar but it's better than Band of Sisters and nearly on par with Joker One. This book is NOT as sharply written as One Bullet Away but it's got heart and very much worth reading. It's not Shakespeare but the writing is clear and Williams gets her point and most of her feelings across. Some reviewers think Williams is whining about her job - it's odd that the grumblings in Joker One or Generation Kill is not considered whiney if men do it but suddenly is for Williams. Williams still does her job but her complaints are similar to her male writing counterparts who gripe (with good reason) about the inept people who command her, the misery of the job situation, no armor for her humvee and the questioning of the war. The book chronicles her life prior (getting a college degree) thru Iraq to the training to speak Arabic, to coming home. Her story is amazing enough to be made into a tv movie and this book is a quick read because it feels like a diary of a woman who wants her audience understand what she's been thru and is quick to acknowledge she isn't perfect but that she wanted to do something for her country."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I received this book for Xmas from two separate family members because I am getting ready to go on my first deployment.I was able to read the book very quickly because the style of writing is uncomplicated and blunt. I imagine it goes along with the character of the author. I have a lot in common with Ms. Williams, and I can believe her experiences and the situations she found herself in. I also know that I have never had many of the same experiences because I chose to follow another military path. Being an older and educated woman when I joined the military I quickly chose to become an officer, and therefore have taken my know-it-all attitude and applied it to making life better for my Soldiers. If Ms. Williams felt that she could do so much of a better job than everyone else around her, then she should have stepped up to the challenge rather than criticizing those who were trying to do the right thing. It did help me understand what some of my own female enlisted Soldiers might be going through. Ms. Williams' book does cast a negative shadow on what women are trying to achieve in today's military; however, I cannot fault Ms. Williams for writing her personal experience.More women should take the time to write their experiences for the rest of the world to understand. If the world heard from more women there would be a broader selection of experiences to gleam ones opinions from. I applaud Ms. Williams for taking the time to share her story. Being a woman in the military can be a very trying ordeal, but as the majority of us feel - it is who we are and nothing else can satisfy our own desire for the adventure and challenge of being a part of something so much bigger than ourselves."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Williams opens her memoir by declaring that all Army females are either a bitch (they won't sleep with you) or a slut (they'll sleep with everyone but you). She stayed a bitch during her tour in the Army, but that didn't stop her from being the subject of some nasty rumors.Williams is a bit older than your typical enlistee, she's college-educated, and she's dated a Muslim man, so she provides a unique perspective on the Army and her deployment to Muslim Iraq. She's stationed for some time with 18-year-old infantry grunts, and while she has a much different (and understanding) attitude toward the locals, she understands how someone defending a position and getting attacked can do nothing but hate every Iraqi man, woman, and child as a potential insurgent.Again and again, Williams questions the plan as a whole. Stop points and roadblocks are erected with no Arabic signage, Muslim women are afraid of strange men, and the last military in the country (Saddam's) consisted of ruthless killers, so how are local Iraqi villages supposed to understand what is going on at roadblocks? Then again, there have been plenty of female suicide bombers, so what are the soldiers supposed to expect? Williams has to use underground circuits to get her vegetarian kosher/halal meals, even though most soldiers hate them and abandon them with the trash, because she can't officially get religious meals due to a \\"personal dietary\\" (vegetarian) preference. In one heartbreaking scene, Williams interprets during the search of a Catholic monastery. Her superiors are hot-headed, interrupting service, destroying property, and ignoring the priest who reaches out to them as a brother. Later, she gets someone to do a good turn for the monastery, which leaves the reader with some hope.Williams also deals repeatedly with female leaders who put their soldiers at risk, don't understand the mission, don't grasp the political situation, and are incompetent when it comes to dealing with her group's equipment. Williams disagrees with the military system of promoting people due to time in grade unless something really bad happens. She comes across too many people promoted to leadership roles who don't have the skills to back their position up, but they happened to have served long enough to move up. In her closing comments, she discusses how the Army gives you no incentive to excel at your job--the bare minimum is just fine, and it will get you promoted just fine.Williams provides an unparalleled view of life on the ground floor of the war in Iraq. She never provides any solid answers, choosing instead to reveal how confused and frustrated she was, yet how rewarding some parts of the experience were. Another reviewer commented that the memoir might be a little early, when her anger over certain situations was still too fresh. I rather like the fact that she is honest about her love/hate relationship with the Army and the mission in Iraq, and she transports the reader to the point of view of a foot solider. I would have liked to learn a little more about what her tasks were doing signal intelligence for 12-hour shifts (on occasion), but perhaps she got legal advice not to reveal those secrets of the US Army."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Some of the negative reviewers have noted that Williams's book is diaristic and confessional, and focuses on the day-to-day details of the author's time in Iraq. I agree with that assessment, but I liked those aspects of the book. I can see how the book wouldn't be very interesting to a reader who was also a woman soldier deployed in Iraq, because both the broad outline of the story and many of the details would be nothing new--she's definitely a bit of an Everywoman figure in the narrative. However, I enjoy books that give me a glimpse into the daily lives of people whose lives are very different from my own, and for me, this book fit the bill. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes slice-of-life memoirs."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"As a fellow Arabic linguist deployed during the war, I was very interested to read this book. I actually read the entire book in one sitting. That is not, however, because Williams had anything interesting or enlightening to say about her experiences. It was purely out of amazement that such a whiny, petty story found a publisher. For someone who claims to be so intelligent, with a degree in literature, Williams need serious work on her writing skills. The book read like a catty, 16-year old's diary.Beyond that, I found her self-importance grating on me with every word. She writes as if she should be heralded MERELY FOR DOING HER JOB! And while I agree, the military has its fair share of problems, including plenty of imcompetent supervisors, I find it disgusting that she saw fit to name in the book, everyone who crossed paths with her and ended up on her bad side. I'm sure they have more than a few words to say about her performance as well. After 2 hours of reading how horrible everyone was at their jobs, I found her supposedly heartfelt thanks to fellow servicemebers at the end shallow, cheap, and meaningless.And as for her claims of sexual harrassment, I have to wonder how much is based in truth, and how much is more drama queen whining. In all honesty, if you have to wake up a year later and remind yourself that you are not a slut, that says to me that you have done some things to make you feel that way about yourself.It saddens me to think that civilians will read this book and think it is an accurate description of women's life in the military. Maybe it represents some women. In general, those are the women that I am happy get the hell out after their minimum obligation is served.Read this book if you want the perfect account of a self-important female soldier who overestimates her own intelligence."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Kayla Williams' voice was not what I expected at all. I was browsing through the new release section at the local bookstore when I came across this book. Like an idiot, I read only the back cover with all its clever little blurbs. Not bothering to read any of the inside pages, I went ahead and bought it, since 'Jarhead' was not in stock. Big mistake.I had hoped for more insight, more of a philosophical approach to her time in Iraq, and most importantly, of 'being a woman in today's Army.' The book has neither. Williams takes a conversational approach in her writing, one that reads more like an e-mail or letter to a friend than anything worthy of a book.Her experiences are mundane. Fair enough. But instead of trying to inject some deep emotional meaning or even lighthearted moments, she delivers everything with the same sort of distant, observer-only perspective. As if she were not a participant at all.This book is also very whiny. She whines about the sand, the lack of running water and the heat. Williams is forever telling us about her hardship in trying to find suitable MREs to eat, as she is a vegetarian. I think she mentions this fact more than anything. I don't have food. I have food now. The villagers are bringing me food. Yay.Her 'challenges' with dealing with men are simple. She's a doormat. She admits she ends up with men who don't treat her right at the beginning of the book. This trickles down into her work relationships with male soldiers. Instead of standing her ground, or trying to act professional, she instead tries to become buddies with them, playing their games and hanging out with them. Someone asks her to 'Cook me some eggs, B****.' And she says she obliges and then makes sure everyone knows he really is a good guy, he just has some emotional baggage.This is probably the first book I've read in years that I wish I had never bothered to pick up."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I read this book with great interest because both Williams and I were deployed witht he 101st and I thought it would be interesting to see the war from another 101st soldier's perspective. What I got was angry, wondering really, what war did Williams go to. I spent my year the only female in an all male unit and did not once get groped, leered at, or attacked. I went out everyday with the guys and was expected to pull my weight. The only part of William's book I found myself connecting with was the last chapter about coming home. That chapter was spot on. Otherwise William's story is not a accurate description of what it is like to be female in the military but should be subtitled The Story of One Young Female Soldier in the Army."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"As a fellow Arabic linguist and female Iraq war vet, I was disappointed to see such a shallow portrayal of the struggles of women in combat. Ms. Williams, although making some pithy comments on Army leadership, does not show much integrity in her own behavior. When female soldiers flirt, take advantage of their gender, and participate in or refuse to object to the crude behavior of their comrades, they reinforce those habits. Having trained with Ms. Williams a few years back, I had hoped for a fresh perspective on the war, as well as some maturity gained by her experiences. It is far too easy to poke fun and criticize, but how about taking responsibility, speaking up, or becoming an honorable leader? This memoir shows a lot of raw emotion and promise, but it is not backed up by any moral or emotional depth."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"One must be fair in reviewing this book. It is dissappointing to see some of the attacks on the author, based upon how the reviewers feel about the content. I have served in the Navy, and now on active duty with the Army in Afghanistan. Having worked with females for most of my 20 years of service, I can understand how and why she has portrayed her story in the manner she did. I am a MI soldier, who deployed to the same locations in Iraq at the same time as the author, and most of my soldiers were female. It is her story, sure some content paints an unattractive picture of people, situations, and the Army. But, I have seen examples of everything she described, so please do not kill the messenger. The book was an easy and quick read, and I found it entertaining and accurate, as long as one keeps in mind the story is told from her perspective. I would reccommend this book to anyone who has served in the military or is interested in what the day to day life can be like while serving."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"As a woman Army Nurse Corps captain deployed in Iraq, with 17 years prior active duty enlisted service, I was dismayed to read Ms Williams account of her experiences, which seem more self-absorbed and immature than a representation of the brave, professional female soldiers and Marines that I have encountered here. I'm sure sexual advances and offenses occur here in Iraq, as they do all over the world in any organization, but I also know that if a woman in the military presents herself professionally and performs her job well, her male counterparts treat her with respect and not as cheaply as Ms Williams' book implies. When I read the book, I was hoping for a woman soldier's tale of being a true soldier and how her tour in Iraq helped facilitate that, as it has for many of us. I am proud to be a soldier and I actually do love my M16, much more than this book, which attempts to revive stereotypes I'd hoped we'd overcome."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Strange book but not boring.

I think she had a lot of guts to write this books, and if she misses the military, she has the college education and the combat experience to apply for OCS, and she ought to go for it----, and quit downgrading herself and her female peers-----she would make a worthy addition to our female Military."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"As a young female soldier in the same Army, I was delighted when my doctor told me that she'd heard Williams on NPR and had immediately thought about me. I jumped online to buy the book and devoured it in one night. The similarities to our stories were numerous; we were both in Northern Iraq with the 101st and living among the same 25,000 soldiers. While SGT Williams was an enlisted soldier, she had the ability to put my feelings and thoughts into words. The popularity scale that soars on deployment made me laugh out loud. It didn't matter if you were 25, blonde, and outgoing or 30, brunette, and strict; all women were treated alike. By the end of my deployment, I was disgusted by the crudeness of the male gender too. I noticed other female soldiers/vets responded with digust at her account. What world were they living in? Perhaps it was the following rotations that had things a little easier or private quarters or outlets for their energy... I know that I saw combat, lost soldiers, cried for my home and daughters, and in the end, I still felt the same way as SGT Williams. While she has decided to leave the military partly due to the poor treatment the military has shown towards her fiancee, I am still in and will be for many years to come. Overall, I thought it was a great book to read. After I finished it, I sent it along to my sister-in-law who is in Iraq right now as a military intelligence specialist. I'm pretty sure she is going to enjoy the humor and read just as much as I have.1LT Krystal LoverinArmymustang.com"},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Up to Page 80, so far,, so good, really, yes likewise the attractions in the book were not soo much that shes a woman, but that she is an Arabic language interpreter...Ive been in the Middle-East briefly this year (Israel) have always been interested in it, I admit I supported both the Iraq invasion and am a staunch supporter of the war on terror,if not their conduct, nonetheless the fact that she's scathing in her criticism of the war including 'the lies that sent us there\\" interests me to hear, as she's earned the right to an opinion, as a soldier and interpreter, not as a spoiled college brat living in a dorm at NYU.Yes, she swears,they say most soldiers do and she is also from a rough background broken home, punk rock scene, and yes, apparently she feels that a lot of the soldiers want to **** her...maybe they do, in spite of the female military reviewers here seeming to have a problem with that, it may be true for Kayla for two reasons: 1.that she exudes a fair amount of sexuality, the girl is not averse to a bonk in principal one gets the sense, and 2.although not Miss America shes not bad looking with big boobs as she admits.Not bad looking for a female soldier, and she makes the point strongly early on that in an heavily male environment like the army, \\"a 5 becomes an 8, and maybe becomes big-headed\\" ..in other worlds, even a plain ordinary girl will be treated like a model.Very fair point, jesus,Ive seen the same thing as that in car dealerships, female workers such as detailers who are very ordinary level lookers, who would not get a second look in any city nightclub, suddenly have every blue-collar male and even some of the white collar ones fawning and pandering over them...not because theyre great, just because theyre all that is in reach and which guy with dirt under his fingernails will be favoured and win that modest prize.Shes criticised for banging on about he education level, it's been mentioned, I havent yet reached a point where its incessant , but I feel that this seems to me to be .....errm, .cultural in America.Every American I see posting on message boards works the fact that they have one, nay, two , college degrees into the conversation,and often (probably whether they possess them or not) ..this very much seems to define and validate you in America, if you havent been to \\"college\\" (I wish they'd get the idea of calling it university) then you are dirt under everyones feet and , critically, you dont have a right to have your opinion on anything taken seriously...your opinion is automatically outranked by a counter opinion from a BA..they think that you are an extra from \\"My Name Is Earl\\"...I actually regularly find myself laughing at the obviously very average intellect people there(actually often quite stupid) who obviously feel they are validated and elevated to the intelligentsia by a 2-bit arts humanities degree...Americans seem to have never met anyone who can put two words together in one breath or point to Thailand , Morocco, Australia or Pakistan on a map- who seems read to some extent- who has NOT been to college.So if she insists on reminding you of this, perhaps this is cultural, shes very American and shes saying, \\"you may not agree with this or me or think this is crazy, but it cant be, it must be valid, because I have been to college\\".Perhaps this is a product of a country with a particular reputation for many of the worlds best (and most exclusive) universities and a lot of the Wests worst government schools.ok...see, then you know it must be correct, whether you too have been to college, but especially if you have a rope holding your pants up and a pet gopher like the people who havent...this attitude may be found anywhere, but in America, it seems to be law.So that is my take on why Kayla the M4-loving Arabic-speaking vegan Yank clobbers you with her academic resume,to an annoying extent, if she does.I agree thats its maybe surprising that it hasnt rated a telemovie, at least."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"This is a great companion to John Crawford's book,\\"The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell.\\" Like that book, it's the story of a single soldier's tour of duty in a war that's taking a great deal of American lives while the folks at home are not asked for even the slightest sacrifice. Anyone wishing to hold an opinion on this war must first try to understand the effect it is having on those we send, dangerously underequipped and at times, emotionally and educationally underprepared, for the circumstances they are about to face. An added bonus to Williams books is her account of being female in the Army. (I can't imagine that Army recruiters will be thrilled to read what she has to say about Army life for women. If they and their fellow officers are smart though, they will take note of many of the events she describes and take some action.) I won't try to summarize the book, but as I wrote about Crawford's work, anyone with any stake in what is happening in Iraq now should read this book- i.e., anyone old enough to vote. Bravo to Willams for sharing her experiences with the public in a timely manner."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Truly this book could have been summed up by one word (like others have mentioned), \\"WHINY.\\" Never mind my money, I want my time from reading this book back."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Not very well written but interesting, none the less.

Disappointing in how little detail she gives as to what she actually worked at most of the time but, nonetheless a different perspective on the war and on the Army. I also agree with some of the other reviews' criticisms. I would recommend borrowing this book from the library, it's not a keeper."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Author and former enlisted Army linguist Kayla Williams explains that women soldiers in war zones are called \\"Queen for a Year,\\" because with the ratio of women to men less than 1 to 6, women are thought to get preferential treatment from the men. This perception is as false in the army as it is anywhere else women are still a minority. Still, Williams does all right under the circumstances. Not a queen, but maybe a princess.Williams joined the army in 2000, when Bill Clinton was still president and becoming an Arabic linguist did not seem like a risky career move. She could not have predicted that she would end up in Kuwait just before the invasion of Iraq in March, 2003. She spent the next year all over Iraq, and it was no picnic. But it could have been so much worse. She did not kill anyone and was never shot at. She saw an Iraqi man die and knew a fellow soldier who committed suicide. She experienced sexual harassment, was groped once, and was able to extricate herself from a situation in which a fellow soldier was threatening her. When it came to situations beyond her control, she was relatively fortunate.On the other hand, she seemed to make a lot of trouble for herself and for others. Before she shipped out, an army doctor told her that her painful foot needed surgery. She elected to put it off and go to Iraq instead. Usually the army doesn't leave that kind of decision up to the soldier. If it's serious, they operate. Later, her pain became debilitating and she ended up having surgery in Iraq. I'm sure her unit appreciated having to look after her for three weeks in the field while she was bedridden during recovery.She lost twenty-five pounds the first few months in Iraq because she insisted on sticking to her vegetarian diet (which did not preclude her from eating lobster if a fellow soldier would be kind enough to crack it for her first) and therefore couldn't eat much of the food in the MREs. I'm sure her unit appreciated her light-headedness and general crankiness from being unnecessarily hungry all the time.She seemed to have a hard time getting along with people in general, and with authority figures in particular, even before she joined the army. Naturally, this caused some tension.In spite of her tendency to repeat rumors (an occupational hazard in the military), much of Williams's tale rings true. The army didn't have enough Arabic linguists, so they sent Korean linguists to Iraq to make up the difference. Many of the NCOs and officers were incompetent, leading to near-fatal mistakes. She tells of participating in the violent interrogation and humilation of an Iraqi prisoner. She witnessed the change in attitude of the Iraqis and of her comrades - early on, Iraqis and Americans trusted each other, then it became too dangerous for anyone to take a chance.In one especially revealing encounter, Williams recalls Jimmy the Iceman, an Iraqi entrepreneur who provided the Americans with ice, sodas, and souvenir trinkets. He asked Williams how much money American soldiers make, and she explained that although it sounds like a lot, it really isn't, what with monthly house and car payments, insurance, phone and electricity bills, etc. Jimmy politely heard her out, even as both of them realized that the money the soldiers spend on soda and trinkets is a fortune to the average Iraqi. When Williams finished explaining that junior enlisted personnel are poor enough to qualify for food stamps, Jimmy gave her a can of soda and refused to let her pay for it.Williams came home after a year in Iraq, with only a few months left in her enlistment. She knows however, that she can't count on leaving the army when her time comes, because they can extend her enlistment involuntarily, and even call her back up if she does get out. As America did in the year 2000, Williams made a choice that will continue to haunt her longer than she ever expected."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I am a female in the military.

I was a Marine in the 90's and my career didn't go far due to an injury. This books was written like a diary of a mad and angry woman. I am sure war can make you become angry and if you are already angry, it makes it worse. She is highly driven and somehow thinks that quality should get her awarded some sort of automatic respect. She needs to get past her sexual assault as a teenager in order to get on with a more positive future. Having been there before I know, it can make you angry and any little comment can be take then wrong way.She seems to be searching for a family and will never be able to accept it and enjoys chaos."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"This book really needs some good editing as at times we are left wanting more as ideas are left hanging. Still Williams does provide some excellent insights into what life was like in Iraq. It's very candid and she doesn't always come across as a likeable character. If you are interested in first hand accounts of women's service in the Army this book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I have been in the Army for just over a decade. I have been deployed to Iraq and I'm sure I'll deploy at at least a couple more times before I retire. Personally, I found this book completely infuriating! Williams made money by fueling stereotypes that put woman back into the stone age. Contrary to what she would have you believe, not all male soldiers are trying to get into the pants of any willing female. Not that it never happens, but I would not consider it the norm. The majority of soldiers...men and women... are hardworking, self sacrificing individuals. The men I deployed with were very protective of the females, almost the the point of being annoying.This book went back and forth between Williams bragging about how eduacated and wonderful she thinks she is, and making a mockery of women in the Armed Forces.Please don't waste your time getting this book! If you do...please remember not to believe everything you read."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"My friend, who just began his tour of duty in the war zone, says this book, more than any of the others he has read, helped prepare him for what life as a soldier in Iraq would really be like."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Awful. As a female vet of Operation: Iraqi Freedom, I'm saddened to hear a voice like Williams' being heralded as the one to reify the collective military women's experience of Iraq. Snotty and snobbish, her prose is dull and stilted, and the experiences she describes are pretty ordinary, even outside a combat zone. If you believe you've a war story worth publishing, it seems like you should have a little \\"trigger time\\" to back it up. Williams' has none; all of her stories regard being a white blonde, having boobs, how dirty dust can make you, and throwing rocks at one another to pass time. She never lost a friend to gunfire, was never injured, and saw only one violent episode: a man who'd stumbled into a clearly marked minefield. This is a combat memoir? Hardly. These are the crude complaints of a person with a bone to pick with the Army and America for being ordinary while she thinks she's too special for either."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I was given \\"Love My Rifle More than You\\" by my wife the Christmas after I did my tour in Iraq. I read a few chapters and was not impressed, so put it on the shelf waiting to toss it in the trash to make room for other books.I am now working as an occupational therapist in the VA system after 24 years in military service both in the Army and Air Force. I decided to pick up the book after letting it collect dust for several years and read it through for some easy reading. While it is definately Kayla's nerrative of HER experience, it could be the story of others in military service who are young, somewhat undisciplined, and looking for someone to nurture and spend time building them up. Her big problems often seem to relate to her occasions of drinking, which I can remember other young service members having problems with. She is obviously not one of the best young enlisted,but she is not the worst either. There is a lot of whining in the book, wondering why she didn't get a silver star and instead just recieved a Commendation Medal, but it gives you insight in to her personality and what may also be going through the heads of some of the young troops out there who come from poor family upbringing or have to work for less then stellar leaders.The book did give me a bit more insight into the stresses faced by our vets these days related to the daily hum drum of deployment. Treating my fellow vets every day, each one has his or her own story to tell, or experience that marked the rest of his or her life. Thanks for sharing your life story. Kayla, Thanks for your current advocacy (watched the videos on U tube) and that it seems like you are pulling your life together these days. My best to you and your family. I hope the VA takes good care of you both. We try with what we have and I am proud to still be serving our heroes through the VA."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Kayla Williams joined the peacetime U.S. Army Reserves in 2000 to become a translator. This was all shortly before 9-11. She was still finishing her Arabic language training program when the two towers were struck, and so she was sent with the invasion force into Iraq in 2003. She was in Iraq for a year, working as an Arabic translator in the Military Intelligence section of the fabled 101st Airborne Division.There is very little combat action in this book, even though Kayla went on numerous combat missions with infantry units. Instead, the book is filled with a series of vignettes and sharp observations about the complex dynamics of male-female interactions in the enlisted class in the Army, as well as the usual descriptions of incompetence in the Army. It's a funny and pungent look at the current U.S. Army.A couple of things need to be said here. First, the enlisted soldiers clearly seem to live by different social norms than the officers in the Army and Kayla Williams's book makes clear that enlisted women have far fewer protections against sexual harassment than officers. However, Williams also makes what should be an obvious point, which is that for many enlisted women, being desired and surrounded by large numbers of men was seen as an opportunity to get sexually involved with the most desirable men. These two points seem to be the source of several of the negative reviews of this book, by officers who fail to see the different level of protection in the Army for enlisted women, and by women who object to other women taking advantage of a situation of being completely surrounded by men.Many of the negative reviews of this book also seem to arise from the reviewers' personal dislike for Kayla Williams. I found Kayla's effusive and outspoken personality to be rather typical for a lot of well educated, modern, career women. Smart, sassy, and not afraid to out-curse the lesser men around them. There are obviously large parts of the United States and the U.S. Army that still do not accept these sorts of women on an equal footing. A man who did everything that Kayla Williams did would surely get a pass on any perceived character flaws and merely be judged on whether he was competent or not. And Kayla Williams was clearly very competent at her job as a translator.It is good to contrast Kayla Williams with the equally profane and Army-bashing Colby Buzzell, author of \\"My War\\". Buzzell gets hardly any criticism about his many personal flaws in the Amazon.com reviews of his book (except from me).I would point out that unlike Colby Buzzell, after getting out of Iraq, Kayla Williams did not retreat into a life of booze, dope, and self-pity about having PTSD (she did get a mild case of PTSD-like symptoms).Instead, after returning home, she went on to help take care of a severely wounded soldier, a man who became her husband. She got a masters degree, and she has continued to crusade for veteran's issues, and developed a public speaking career. There are several videos of her on CNN and local news shows talking about veteran's health care, including one where she meets Senator Mark Warner of Virgina. You can follow her career on Twitter now as kwilliams101.And so it appalls me that so many of her critics think of her as shallow and narcissistic merely because she is smart, talented, and dares to talk back to idiots. Most of all, in this book, she speaks the truth about what is really going on between the men and women of the Army. It is a dynamic that we in the civilian world have long suspected to be the case, given all the numbers of pregnant female soldiers sent home from war fronts.Kayla Williams is somebody who deeply cares, and who really tries to do the right thing, and who grew tremendously as a result of her Army experience, becoming all the better for the experience. Her critics are simply wrong about her."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I read the reviews by a few active duty females and most were pretty bad. Some said the Sgt Williams made military women look bad. I am here to say that they are wrong. I am an active duty male and I can say that this is one of the most fair military stories that I have ever read. Good book, not what I expected."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"First I have to admit that I've read this book as a (non-American) civilian, who hasn't served in the armed forces. I can more or less agree with the other reviewers who found this book a bit shallow, negligent or immature.Still, I can say that I truly enjoyed this book. I particularly liked its humor and its language. How it described the men and women serving in the Army, their environment, their interactions with each other, and also with the locals. I wasn't looking for something which exhaustively describes the Iraqi conflict from any perspective. I wasn't looking for a \\"masterpiece\\" of contemporary literature either. Instead, I was looking for a book which reflects the first-hand experience of a woman who has been in the U.S. Army, served in Iraq, and shared her memories. And as such, this book was definitely an interesting one for me.Kayla Williams's book is somewhere between an essay, a diary and a memoir. If you can accept her rather subjective viewpoint, somewhat negligent attitude and careless style, and focus on the people and events in the story, then this book can be an interesting read, from which you can learn a couple of things, and get an insight into her life and mission in the Iraqi war."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I thought this was an interesting book. This turned out to be a memoir, and I thought there would be more thought in this. I was interesting reading about a women's experience.This is in essence, a child of a dysfunctional family with bad male role model, choosing to join the military for various personal reasons.I thought her behavior reflected her troubled upbringing and the failed marriage. She appears capable but petulant. She wants respect for her capabilities and be one of the guys, and yet be a woman. I think she just came off as being what she resolved to be, B---h.In my time in the military, I noticed similar behavior as she did amongst the women, particularly on deployment. Generally, the women can do the work, but the close quarters and lack of privacy generally made them a disruptive influence to good order.Mostly she experienced the war from the rear echelon, with interesting experiences as an interpreter.I think the sub title cover it all... Young and female in the US Army.As a memoir, it was her experience, the language is somewhat raw, welcome to the military."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"The book is about being a young female in the US Army and her deployment to Iraq for a year with the 101st Airborne. Kayla Williams was an Arabic linguist. Twenty-nine years ago, I came off active duty as a US Army officer. Ms. Williams's book made me reflect back to all the women soldiers I worked with, lead, and knew.This is a good military memoir. While grit and rough language are on almost every page, what shines through is an intelligent young woman serving her country and putting up with all a woman experiences in the military. It appears little has change since back in my day. We learn of her role as an Arabic linguist. She tells us how she feels her skills could have been used better with direct contact with the population as oppose to routine intelligence gathering.Particularly interesting are her experiences with leadership while in Iraq as well as her questioning the war in Iraq's day to day conduct without looking at the logic and underlying rationale.Her tale of the birth control glasses is funny, but true. Put those black framed Drew Carey or Woody Allen glasses on any man or woman and instantly they are effective book control. Why? They make people unattractive thus scaring off members of the opposite sex. It is worth reading. I would love for Ms. Williams to write another book. She can tell a story.Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler"},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Bought it, read it in one sitting! I laughed and I cried! Totally amazing. It truly makes me understand what being female in the Armed Forces is all about! It is hard, but it showes everything warts and all. I understand why even tough it is hard why females serve! Too all our Vets past and present, I have utmost respect for you. I thank you!"},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I found Kayla William's account of her life in the US Army to be very readable and at the same time honest and confronting. I served for a short time in the military and can relate to some of her experiences and angst about military bureaucracy.Its primarily a memoir biography of the life of a support soldier - her work is mainly Signal Intelligence. So if you are after combat tactics please look elsewhere. But what I found fascinating was that it gave an insight of the life of an female soldier, not an officer. Some readers were unhappy over the harsh language and her complaints over deployment. But she tells it like it is. The majority of soldiers are not boy scouts or girl guides and will frequently swear and curse at the often abominable situation they are in. Anyone who has to stay in the field for 3 months where you can't shower, drink decent coffee, or eat anything other than combat rations and have arrogant obnoxious leaders in charge, and you're going to be one unhappy cookie. So what if she complains? You think all troops are going to be curling in their beds singing the National Anthem to sleep?Surprisingly I found her story to also have a great deal of humor and wit. And that may explain how many troops pull through the ordeal of deployment. They can take a joke, laugh, and make light of a terrible situation.So in short, I highly recommend it - the minute I picked it up and read a few pages I was hooked. Williams is also a very good writer and writes very well."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I can't help but compare \\"Love My Rifle...\\" to \\"Generation Kill\\" in how well it portrays and gives voice to the modern soldiers (or sailors or airmen) populating America's Armed Forces. The book effectively paints the, at times, brutally contradictory existence women inhabit in the military and additional stresses that men take for granted being in the majority. The author takes pains to try to be nuanced in her praise and damning to avoid making too wide a judgement on either sex, so don't worry about pure bashing in this book. Gender/Sex is not the pure focus of the book, as it takes you from William's personal journey into the armed forces, the lead up to War, the Invasion itself, the beginnings of the occupation, as well as dealing with the toll of all this upon her return home.I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Kayla William was not just any American soldier. During the second Gulf War, as an Arabic-speaking linguist in a Military Intelligence Unit attached to frontline troops, she experienced first-hand combat. In the War in Iraq she took enemy fire and made the tough calls of when to shoot and when not to shoot. In her memoir, Love My Rifle More Than You she gives an utterly fresh view of what it means to be a woman solider in today's Army as she recounts her five years of military service.Love My Rifle More Than You is filled with revelations. In describing how it feels to be one of the Army's 15% female soldiers, she puts sex and testosterone-charged male conduct \\"up front and personal\\". Unflinchingly she describes the occasions when she was coarsely asked to have rough sex in the back of a Humvee and when her breasts were groped and fondled while on she was on duty with a combat team.But she also writes that it was not \\"all that bad\\" being a woman surrounded by men. She was acutely aware that her sex attracted favorable attention and gave her power - power that she was not above using to make her life easier, such as having her male counterparts dig her foxhole. She provides a candid assessment of her part in belittling the sexual prowess of Muslin male prisoners during hostile interrogations. She speaks frankly about her sister soldiers who are sexually rakish and the difficultly their conduct causes all woman soldiers. She offers unvarnished contempt for those women soldiers who resort to tears and claims of PMS to excuse their glaring ineptness.Bounded by such a thicket of sexual dynamics, it is a wonder that Williams is not bitter, about her Army tour: but, she is not. She draws immense satisfaction from the many times she was respected for her intelligence and competence by her fellow soldiers and officers. She, also, has a deep and abiding appreciation for her Army friends who saw her through the good and bad times.On the other hand, Williams has many gripes about the Army. Her complaints about stupid decisions, lousy leaders, bad food and overwhelming periods of tedium and boredom are common to all soldiers who are concerned with their own survival and safety. As a self-described liberal, she does not support our War in Iraq and gives her reasons. These, however, are plainly biased and devoid of any serious consideration of events that led to U.S. involvement. However, her views on the U.S. involvement notwithstanding, it is her gender-specific disclosures that make this insightful memoir a good read."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I skipped a lot of pages because I was bored. I found her lack of empathy for her fellow soldiers sad. I enjoyed Meichelbock's female perspective book much more. It was honest, endearing, and a whole lot more fun to read."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I recently read Love My Rifle More Than You for my American Women in War Literature class, and we had the privilege of having the author, Kayla Williams, come and speak to our class last week. She answered questions from the class and even did two public readings from the book. She wasn't afraid in the least to voice her opinions even in a mostly conservative environment, and even those who didn't agree with her views admired her for her honesty. That openness and honesty comes through clearly in her book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys truthful, gritty, and engaging storytelling."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Kayla Williams and Michael E Staub put together a raw and intense book. Kayla was an Arabic Linguist with the Army's 311th Military Intelligence Battalion attached to the 101st Airborne Division. She deployed February 2003 for the initial push into Iraq and remained there until February 2004.I know that the men and women swear a lot, however I was somewhat upset by the amount of foul language throughout her book. Putting the language aside most of the content of the book seemed to be more about the sexual harassment that went on while Kayla was in-country. I wondered why she didn't expect it being among so many men. It's one thing to talk about harassment and the problems that go with it; it's another to be crude while doing it. There were times when I thought that she should have expected some of the harassment but then there were other times when I began to feel her pain.As I got deeper into the book the author did begin to bring out more about her wartime experiences. So while at first I was not impressed with the book it did improve as it went along.She wrote this book so she could tell people what it was really like being a woman in the military and how she was treated. She pointed out the various tasks she did including supporting the infantry in almost every way, kicking down doors, carrying and using weapons, crowd control, negotiating with the locals and more.Kayla explained what \\"Queen for a Year\\" was and how she felt just walking through the chow hall. She was alone with the guys for weeks and may have been the most forward-deployed female soldier. She went on to describe the verbal and physical harassment from the guys she worked so closely with.Kayla said that sexual comments, gestures and content were everywhere. She said that it wasn't just the men who went without showering; the women had to also. She wrote about the soldiers in her company and how they did or didn't get along up and down her chain of command. Many people were under stress but that didn't seem to be brought out in this book.She wrote about an incident involving an explosion. They found three locals bleeding. One guy was much worse off. She tried to reassure him in Arabic while holding his legs and covered in drying blood.Kayla talked about the shifts and hours the soldiers worked. Her team worked even longer hours because they not only pulled their normal duties but also guard duty. The soldiers had some free time--sometimes too much. They met the locals in the various communities and made friends with some. But then the soldiers were told to treat the locals differently.According to Kayla she wasn't just on one hilltop during her year in-country but throughout Baghdad, Mosul, Tal Afar, Forward Operating Base Q-West and a few other places. She also stated that although Military Intelligence is largely female--she was mostly off alone working with the Infantry. This told me more of what it was like in this combat zone.Kayla has since returned stateside but still feels weird not carrying her weapon all the time. When driving she swerves to avoid trash in the road thinking it could be an IED. She has trouble sleeping. Her first Fourth of July home was horrible. She feels frustrated and wants these feelings to go away. She is already exhibiting signs of PTSD and I hope she is getting help.I wanted to read about daily life in Iraq for a young enlisted female soldier and while some of that was included, this book was mostly about being harassed by all the guys. This was the first book I've read by an enlisted woman who went to Iraq so I was hoping it would be better and though she managed to explain some things others were left to wonder about.I disliked the language throughout the book and how Kayla made it sound like most of her NCOs and officers were screw-ups. BUT the book did have its good points. It showed how sexist attitudes have not changed over the years. It showed how far women have come in their fields of expertise. It showed how strong the women are today and that they can be on the forward lines. And it also showed how screwed up this war has been.Would I recommend this book? Yes! I think its worth reading by everyone. It can be used to show how attitudes still need to change within the military. However I think her story could have been written just as well without the foul language used throughout it and it still could have been better."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I first heard about this book on a public radio interview with the author. In her book you will find out about so many down-to-earth, daily grind sorts of things which happen to people in the Armed Forces and at war. These are the details you never hear of from newspapers or TV news. Her own personal story is the arc of the book. This is good in itself, but the additional information you get: the feel of trying to serve your country and survive the experience, the sorts of things soldiers must deal with in Iraq is so informative for civilians who have not had this unique experience. According to the interview, the author had to struggle with the military to get the book published and still had to leave some things out. There's enough left to interest anyone. My husband is a civilian who has worked with soldiers for 30 years. He confirms the authenticity of this book. After reading it, I feel that I have learned some useful things about living my life. Well Done!"},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Page 168: \\"The alcohol makes the night hazy.\\"That sentence reveals everything about what kind of soldier the author was, the kind that puts her (or his) desire for improper forms of gratification (distraction from hardship, fraternization-as-camaraderie, petty complaining, it can be anything) above the needs of everyone else around, or the requirements of the mission.While I applaud this book as a rare insight into the tactical MI world (not many civilians know what a Prophet system is) I can't recommend the author as any kind of asset to the army.I suppose she did her job adequately (like most of them do) but constantly taking care of the problems that follow that kind of Specialist (E-4) around takes up too much of other people's time."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Ms. Williams had some amazing experiences, and my suspicion is that the stories she relates would have been much more interesting if told by someone else with a little (okay, lot) more insight and writing ability. She comes across as a very negative person, who expects more of others that she expects of herself. She is particularly harsh on women superiors, but spends a lot of time complaining about sexism and stereotypes directed at her, without any awareness that her attitudes toward other women mirror the sexism and stereotypes she dislikes when aimed at her. She relates many events without any ability to explain her reasons. She marries, she divorces, she discovers a boyfriend is married, and there is never any sense of a normal human reaction. Similarly, she excuses terrible behavior from men, including sexual harassment of herself and prisoners, pretty blithely. Despite being in a war zone and being someone in Iraq who actually spoke Arabic, her insights into the war, the occupation, and Iraqi's reactions to the U.S. presence are never more than superficial.Added to Ms. Williams flat-affect writing style (I wondered if she had an autism spectrum disorder at times), the writing style itself was also flat and unengaging. I really wanted to like the book, but at the end could not. If you want a boring and distancing war story, this is one for you."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I enjoyed this book more for my parallel experience of being a female soldier and linguist than for any real literary merit. Williams has a very jaded, negative view of the Army. For someone who was supposedly \\"so educated\\", her constant foul language was off-putting. Was she unable to find better words to express herself? What annoyed me most was the narcissistic tone of the whole book. The Army is about \\"us\\" and \\"we\\", the squad/platoon/company/etc, not \\"I\\" and \\"me\\", the individual.Having seen the comment that someone wished they could have read what she did during those 12-hour shifts, I must add that she had to submit the manuscript for classification review (for security purposes) before being allowed to send it to the publisher."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I got really interested in reading this book after hearing a couple interviews with the author on NPR. The perspective is unique and if you haven't read many first account soldier reports on the conditions in Iraq, this is worth reading. But it's uniqueness, that of being from a woman soldier, is not as compelling a story as it sounded in the interviews. Not sorry I took the time to read it, but didn't live up to my expectations in total."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I read the reviews and could not imagine why so many readers found this book to be so offensive and worthy of \\"minus stars\\". That intrigued me, so I made the mistake of paying my own hard earned money to buy a copy. What a mistake! This book is a disgrace to all women who have served in the military. What was she thinking? Kayla Williams is nothing more than a whinning, angry, self-serving, hypersexual tease who harbors a grand sense of entitlement. She is a disgrace to the Army, and as a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Navy, I am so grateful she is not in the Navy. Had she been my subordinate, or even my peer, I would have wanted to smack her, tell her to grow up, or would do anything to try and help her grow beyond her \\"grand sence of entitlement\\" immaturity. Even though I am a psych. nurse, I doubt that I would have been successful had I been there with her. Her anger and hostility toward any and every women soldier other than herself is evident -- they are all incompetent! No wonder that Kayla found herself to be alone. How sad. It was her own doing.Kayla was only one of many women who entered Iraq at the onset of the war -- she is little more than a blip on the radar. For those readers who want to read a much more mature and accurate account of what it was like for women on the frontline, I recommend you read Ruff's War: A Navy Nurse On the Frontline in Iraq. Unlike Kayla's \\"bizarre\\" and sex-laden version of the war this book provides the real truth."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I was very dissappointed with this book. When I picked it up, I was in my post-deployment depression stage myself, looking for some answers and a book about how a woman coped with things was just what I thought would help.Kayla's book was not full of answers at all- it was just a big bitch session. She whined and complained about everything especially women in the military throughout the whole book but SHE gives women in the military a bad name and has the audacity to publish a book about it! She has an authority problem and shows no respect for her leadership in the book. As a soldier myself, I found her book, and the things she complained about an insult to all of the Army values.Her writing style is like a poorly kept journal that makes it hard to decipher between facts and opinions- and also follow the order of events. She can't make up her mind if she is speaking to a military or civilian audience because half the time she explains military lingo and acronymns but many times she leaves out important explanations.The positive thing; I was impressed with some of the things she wasn't afraid to hide. There are things about the military life that people don't say, and she put it straight forth in her book. I could relate to a lot of these truths."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"If you want to understand what it is like for a woman to be serving in Iraq, I would reccommend this. I served in an all male unit overseas recently, but had female friends from other units. What she says parallels what I heard from my friends and what I experienced with women overseas. Bitch or slut. That is all there are. Pass this along to any one who is thinking about joining, and make sure they have a tough skin. The military can be very good in building a lot of positive traits, but there are some drawbacks. It isn't always easy for a woman in the service."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I'm pretty ambivalent about this book. I was an Arabic linguist in the Army as well and attended language school just a couple years before Kayla Williams. I spent eight months in the Kuwaiti desert on the Iraqi border years before we invaded in 2003, so I know exactly what a deployment feels like when you are one of twenty women stationed in an austere environment with a thousand men. During the war, I worked in Iraq and Afghanistan as a civilian, still grossly outnumbered.Good points: Williams is extremely honest about her perceptions and experiences in the Army and in Iraq, regardless of who she may anger or insult. She brings to light many of the things that people who have not experienced war might never understand--the extraordinary camraderie of you and \\"your boys,\\" the guys on your team; the harsh reality of civilian life when you get home and suddenly lose the support system of your team, with whom you have lived, worked, slept, eaten and breathed for the past year; how normal American life is overwhelming and incredibly excessive after an existence pared down to absolute necessity and constant wariness.Many other reviewers have written that they don't see the constant and monumnetal sexual aspect of Williams' portrayal. There is a very fine line that has to be walked by a female soldier working for and/or with a unit populated solely by male soldiers. The boys aren't used to working with the girls, and the girls expect the boys to act as they would if everyone was out on Saturday night. It just doesn't happen that way. The sexual overtones are definitely there, one just has to be able to know when to tell the dirty joke to be \\"one of the boys,\\" and when to stand up and say, \\"that went too far.\\" It's hard, but it's possible.Williams' tale is often insightful and it seems that she learned quite a bit about herself both during her deployment and in writing this book. It isn't a definitive work on females in Iraq, but it's an honest look at one woman's experience.Bad points: I didn't like the writing style at all. I have a potty mouth on level with the best of them, but when I read a book that cost me $25 I expect it to be written at a higher level, especially when the author posseses a degree in literature and wrote with the help of a ghost-writer. This book reads like diary entries, with short, simple sentences that add nothing to the \\"punch\\" of the story. The style of writing like she speaks ultimately detracts from the book rather than adding any more insight to Williams' life.Definitely read the book, if only to gain yet another perspective on Operation Iraqi Freedom. But also keep in mind that Williams is only one woman with one point of view."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I wish sincerely that it were possible to rate this \\"book\\" with negative stars. This treatment of what it's like to be in the Army, male or female, is one of the most simplistic, banal pieces of \\"work\\" I've ever come across. Further, it's disheartening to see that Kayla Williams hasn't changed a bit. I knew her at DLI when we were both in the Arabic program years ago. She's every bit as self-righteous, self-important, and self-aggrandizing as I remember. It's not at all surprising to read that she had problems with authority, as she clearly demonstrated her disdain for her superiors throughout her \\"book;\\" just like she used to. Anyone who didn't come to the table implicitly agreeing with anything she might happen to say was relegated in her mind to the category of those who are insignificant, irrelevant and worthy of scorn. One would think that going to Iraq, being involved in a war, or simply belonging to an institution as exasperating as the Army can be would give one perspective or humble one in the process. Yet she remains remarkably unchanged; a princess.It is a testament to the intellectual depth of this book that it took me a whopping 53 minutes to read the entire thing standing in Border's. My latte hadn't even cooled off yet. The main points of the \\"book\\" seem to be the most basic sort of cliches about human nature and yet are passed off as little nuggets of Gandalf-like wisdom. 'Women are hit on in a mostly male environment'... Great Scott!!! What a startling revelation! 'War tends to bring out strange behavior in people sometimes' Oh, great Oracle...tell me more. Let me suckle at the fount-like teat of your wisdom! Give me a break, people. Give this \\"book\\" the rating it deserves. Show some respect for yourselves. Just because a \\"publisher\\" saw fit to foist this vomitous collection of memories on us doesn't mean that we have to smile and nod like a bunch of sheeple.Come to think of it, this book really belongs with its peers \\"See Spot Run\\" and \\"The Adventures of Captain Underpants\\" in the kid's section. It certainly doesn't belong in the Military History section next to actual books by Kagan, Lukacs, Doughty, Gruber, Clausewitz, Liddel-Hart and others. In fact, I'd rather light myself on fire, claw out my eyes, or peel off my skin than be forced to consider this \\"book\\" anything other than a punishment reminiscent of that in \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"It's insulting that this hardcover, glossy train wreck is being passed off as a serious work. What's more is that it represents my generation. Further, it is ridiculous when one considers that 'Ms. Williams' probably actually made some money for this thing. It makes me want to become a tree-hugging hippy to prevent her from harming our noble guardians of the forest any further. Don't buy this book. If you feel compelled to read it, do so in a book store and make sure you have some sort of vigorous activity planned afterward to get it out of your system. Just make sure that whatever activity you plan doesn't require eyesight, since you'll likely be struck blind as a result of the sheer lack of stimulation this \\"book\\" offers. I only recently recovered."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"When a friend told me about this book I immediately went to the PX and purchased it. However, I was quickly disappointed. I was expecting a Woman's views on the Military and being deployed and the lives that we live. Instead, I was aware that I was reading someone's auto-biography.Being an enlisted Woman for the past five years, in the same Division as the author and having been deployed to a Combat Zone 3 times I could relate to some of the situations mentioned. There were too many occasions though, where I could label Kayla as one of those Women who give other females in the Military a bad name. The Military is very stereotypical of Women and are very quick to judge them within the first 5 minutes of meeting them. Whether it be their leader or their subordinate.Alot of Women in the Military have strived and worked VERY hard to get where they are WITHOUT being considered as a 'bitch' or a 'slut'. I am one of them. I feel as if Kayla were to spend more time in the Army that she would gather different views on different things about it. I know plenty of people in the Military that can do this WITHOUT a college education, so that has absolutely NOTHING to do with it.None of these things may have been what she was trying to convey to readers. But had she or the editor been more careful in choosing which way to express her story, maybe these things would not have been perceived from readers. She had a purpose for writing the book, I just think that there wasn't any certain point to it."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I to have read all the reviews for this book on this site and I agree with alot of things being said about the author. As I read the book, I noticed several simularities between myself and THE AUTHOR. We both were stationed in Kentucky, she at Fort Campbell and me in Fort Knox, we both attended basic at Fort Jackson, she graduated in September 2000 and I graduated in November 2000, she was 23 when she joined and I was 24, we're both in the Inactive reserves until 2008, my last name is Williams, the same as hers and my first name begins with the letter K and has 5 characters in it again, the same as her first name.Enough with the simularities, I doubt anyone cares about that anyway. It is hard to understrand why she chose to write the story in the manner she did considering she supposedly has a degree in Literature. The story is choppy and is not detailed where it should be. I do not think she deserves praise for her portrayal, but for her service. Yet, at the same time, I fail to understand why some are so angry with the author for what she has written. She is telling her story from her perspective. She is not whinning. If you serve in today's Army and do not see the imcompatance, the favortism, the sexual harrassment and the total lack of reguard for the safety of the very soldiers they are supposedly looking out for, then all I can say is that you must be in a differant Army!! They do not take care of soldiers, merely use them up as much as possible and pay them as little as they can get away with. It is sad to serve this nation, put life and limb in danger, be away from your spouse and kids, yet make so little money that you still qualify for food stamps.People who blindly love the Army simply hate the people who have strength enough to point out what is deficient in today's Army."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I enjoyed Williams's book about her time in Iraq. From the reviews here, it's obvious that some people don't take to her personality as well as others. However, I fall into the latter category, because Williams never seemed arrogant to me, but rather funny & brutally honest about the failings of her superiors, the difficulties of being a woman in the war, & the mistakes that were made by the military (e.g. not educating troops about culture, not having enough interpreters, etc.).C'mon now, who didn't want to smack her superior who blatantly had no interest in learning about her job, but had a deep one in brushing her hair & advertising her want for infidelity?"},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"Somewhere out there is a female veteran who will be able to put into words the story of women in the modern military. This is not that book.Kayla can write. She's interesting, funny, and completely un-representative of any female I ever met in the Army. It's not that she doesn't have a story to tell, it's just that she's so far outside the mainstream that, as a reader, I never felt she got her book to the next level of literary accomplishment.I'm not going to go through a bunch of gripes about this or that element of her story. I think in some ways she simply wrote her book too soon, when bad memories are still too much in the forefront, and she doesn't have the perspective to tell a more lasting narrative.One complaint I have is she says early in the book that she's 'not Jessica Lynch.' She may not have meant it negatively, but it came across that way. Really, Jessica Lynch's background (not her being a POW...her actual life) is more representative of women in the Army than Kayla's is, or at least seems to be.I read this book because I wanted to see how a young female war veteran could capture her experience. She related HER experience, but I read nothing in her story that will make it a lasting addition to the 'canon' or war literature. Nothing against her personally, I'm sure she did the best she could, but I just expected more."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"After reading all the reviews on this book (and I did read all of them), I had to read the book. After reading the book, I have concluded that I agree with almost all the reviewers - on both sides of the fence.I think this is a book worth reading, as long as you realize that it is only one woman's perspective (and, in some cases, only her opinion) and, that is not necessarily representative of the military or military personal in general. And, of course, providing you have an interest in the subject matter.I would advise getting the book from the library rather than spending money for it."},{"Title":"Love My Rifle More than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army","review":"I got this book for Christmas and was looking forward to reading it, as I just returned from Iraq, my third deployment as an intel officer. Unfortunately, I put this book down in disgust after just a few chapters. As a female in a male-dominated community, I understand what it's like to experience the 3-point rule for deployment (a girl who's a \\"6\\" in the States becomes a \\"9\\" in Iraq), something I warn ALL of the females in my command about prior to deployment so they can at least attempt to mentally prepare themselves to maintain professionalism in a war zone. Unfortunately, it seems that Ms. Williams could not.Deployment is not purely about sex, sexual frustration, and cussing as, disappointingly, she seems to imply in her book. While all of us tend to adopt the proliferation of four-letter words after being surrounded by them for so long, it's not the type of language that is befitting of presenting someone in a halfway intelligent light. Throwing \\"f***ing\\" into dialogue while recounting stories is one thing (and I completely understand it, as I have to make an effort to try to drop it from my vocabulary after returning from deployments). However, to pepper the actual TEXT with cuss words every third sentence makes Ms. Williams look uneducated and crass.I looked forward to reading this book in hopes that Ms. Williams would portray something similar to my own experiences in Iraq. While a small modicum of her experiences mirrored mine, the vast majority focused on things so trivial and base that I couldn't even finish the book. The rumor-mill inherent in EVERY deployment (no matter what theater) is something most females try to avoid being a subject of (usually unsuccessfully) and MOST of us prefer to shove that aspect of deployment as far into the corner as we can, not revel in it as Ms. Williams appears to. There are so many wonderful aspects of being in the military and of being a FEMALE in the military and they do NOT include trying to use your womanly wiles to get out of work or engaging in promiscuity and unprofessionalism just because \\"you can\\" based on supply and demand.If you are looking for a true representation of women currently serving in Iraq who take their jobs (and their professionalism) seriously, do not waste your money on this book. It will just be a disappointment. If, instead, you are looking for foxhole banter, then by all means, go ahead and buy it."},{"Title":"Landlording: It's a piece of cake","review":"Encyclopedia of Real Estate Investing: Acquisition and Finance; Partnerships and Equity Sharing (I & II)Encyclopedia of Computer Business OpportunitiesMillionaire Real Estate Mentor: Investing in Real Estate: A Comprehensive and Detailed Guide to Financial Freedom for EveryoneThis book is timeless and still holds truths and tips that can be used today.

He never gained fame although he conducted five major expeditions through the West and traced the Red River to its source. His task on the various expeditions was to describe the country and its resources for future travelers and settlers. Marcy's advice led to the establishment of five important forts stretching from eastern Oklahoma to western Texas. Marcy later headed a perilous march in 1857-1858, of 680 miles, through snow covered mountains to New Mexico to get supplies for Fort Bridger.Marcy was very familiar with the West and this knowledge was evident when he wrote three interesting and valuable books on his travels and experiences including &quot;The Prairie Traveler,&quot; in 1859. This book is one of the better emigrant guides unlike a similarly entitled book by Joseph Ware. Marcy favored the Southern route to the west coast and his expertise is evident when listing distances, camping spots, trails, water, and grass.Marcy is less able in describing the route from Utah to the west coast having to rely, in certain instances, on phonetic spelling: Cahoon for Cajon Pass; Coco Mongo for Cucamonga Ranch; San Yenness for San Ynez River. Marcy probably used another explorer's descriptions. It is known he used information provided by Black Beaver on many occasions when they scouted together. Black Beaver was a Delaware, renowned as a scout, a trusted friend, and may have helped Marcy supplement his knowledge of the West and the Plains Indians.The book is interesting, informative, and unexpectedly funny. Marcy cites medical authorities when warning against: The dangers of noxious airs rising from the ground; The use of Cedron, a Panamanian nut, as an infallible antidote for any snake bite including the bite of the deadly coral snake. Marcy mentions the doctoring used by a frontier mother when her child was bitten repeatedly by a rattler. She poured a huge glass of liquor down the child's throat, making the child very drunk but also curing her. Marcy suggests the use of Arsenic as a tonic for tired blood, that it should be mixed with Ammonia in a full dose and swallowed frequently.Marcy had good knowledge, for his day and time, of the Plains Indians yet personally disparages them as inveterate beggars while praising them as perfect horsemen. He didn't think they fought fairly and thought it proper they were chastised through force of arms. Marcy quotes a friend (speaking about Indians) - &quot;Tain't no use to talk honor with them, they hain't got no such thing in um. They won't show (a) fair fight. Ef you treat um decently, they think you ar afeard. Trash them well at first, then the balance will sorter take to you and behave themselves.&quot; Marcy's anti-Indian attitudes, imparted in his emigrants' books, contributed to their fear and mistrust of Native Americans.Marcy's book was helpful to neophyte travelers on the Southern Overland Trail and to a lesser extent on the Northern route. There is good advice ranging from simple, but easily overlooked tasks, to unexpected situations such as Northers - ice storms sweeping south over the plains. This book is formatted according to 19th century procedure, each chapter listing is supplemented with descriptive information. Marcy eases a reader's search for information by headlining individuals pages throughout the book with headings such as &quot;stampedes,&quot; &quot;sanitary considerations,&quot; and so forth. The illustrations are excellent and prove helpful when wondering about portable camp furniture.Marcy became a Major in August 1859, a Colonel Inspector General in August 1861, served in the Civil War. and ended the conflict a brevet Major General of Volunteers. He retired as a Brigadier General in January 1881. He is best remembered for his books such as The Prairie Traveler, which imparts a flavor of frontier days and is quite entertaining as it deals with the day to day concerns of emigrant travel."},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler","review":"This book covers the logistics of traversing the wild west. Issues from first aid to how hard to ride your animals are discussed. The value of this book is that it gives an insite into what it must have been like to pack a family up and move them to California or any point west of the Mississippi. I would say it is a must read for anyone interested in the pioneer experiance as it provides a background to further studies."},{"Title":"The best stories of Wilbur Daniel Steele","review":"Wilbur Daniel Steele won the O. Henry Award for short fiction more times than any other author in the history of the award. One has only to read a few of the selections in this book to understand why. This collection includes some familiar stories (\\"The Man Who Saw Through Heaven\\" and \\"Blue Murder\\") and many which I'd never seen before (\\"Isles of Spice and Lilies\\").Steele had an uncanny knack for wringing suppressed fears, desires and hopes out of one's soul with his stories. For example, in \\"Bubbles\\" (which is narrated by a seven year-old), the reader vicariously experiences the repressed pain and coping mechanisms of a child who has lost a parent. In \\"How Beautiful with Shoes\\", an innocent young lady is kidnapped and is left disoriented by her simultaneous attraction to and fear of her abductor. \\"Blue Murder\\" is an interesting twist on the Cain and Abel story from the Bible.In nearly all of Steele's stories, the final paragraph contains a wrenching twist. This is nowhere seen as much as in Steele's masterpiece, \\"The Man Who Saw Through Heaven\\", the story of a fundamentalist minister's desperate attempts to make sense of the universe when his deep-seated faith -- the foundation of his existence -- is shaken. I could study this story for the remainder of my life without ever getting to the bottom of it. The beauty and the messages contained in the final paragraph of that story are astounding."},{"Title":"Sphinx on the American Land: The Nineteenth-Century South in Comparative Perspective (Walter Lynwood Fleming Lectures in Southern History)","review":"Welcome to another instalment of the Walter Lynwood Fleming Lectures. This year's lectures are by Peter Kolchin, best known for his comparison of American slavery and Russian serfdom. While not as illuminating as previous lecturers Eric Foner (Nothing but Freedom) or Drew Gilpin Faust (The Creation of Confederate Nationalism), Kolchin has provided a fascinating introduction into the historiography of the American South. His very readable lectures are extensively documented, giving the reader an introduction into the latest historiography of the region. Kolchin's first lecture deals with comparisons between the North and the South. How much did the regions differ and how much did they have in common? Despite the many debates American historians have had over the last century the answer to this is actually rather simple. They differed enough to fight a civil war, but had enough in common not to try to fight a second. Kolchin correctly argues that slavery marked an essential difference between the two regions. He is very acute in how slavery created a distinct and ultimately weaker Southern economy. Although southern growth rates in the decades before the civil war was higher than that of the North, the growth rate in every Southern subregion was slower than in every Northern subregion. The reason for the higher growth rate was that more Southerners moved to the richest Southern region. Likewise, in urbanization, industrialization, mechanization and education the South was falling further behind the North.Kolchin's second lecture looks at the Many Souths within the South. What is a typical southern region? For certain purposes, tiny Delaware or the Mississippi Delta can serve as a useful example. Kolchin also looks at comparisons within time, over gender, and over age. He discusses the question of popular support for the Confederacy. Given that few of the third of the population that were slaves supported secession, Kolchin points out that only in Texas did secession have the support of a majority of the population. By contrast the much maligned Reconstruction governments were able to win, for a time, majority support. Kolchin goes on to discuss the differences between and within freedpeople, ex-slaveholders and Northerners. He also points out how white Southern Republicans consisted of ex-Whig slaveholders leaders and ex-Democrat yeoman unionist voters. Finally Kolchin's third lecture looks at \\"other souths.\\" He notes the Elkins debate over whether slaves were treated better in Latin America than in the American South. He looks at the construction of Confederate Nationalism in context. In a way the essence of Southern nationalism, like that of American nationalism, and soviet nationalism, was loyalty to an idea, as opposed to language or religion. Jews and immigrant Catholics could be welcomed to the South, as long as they supported the ideology of slavery. Kolchin goes on to suggest that even if the South had been victorious, it would not have lasted as long as, say, the Soviet Union, given that slavery was its ideological core. Kolchin then goes on to discuss the similarities and differences between American slave emancipation and Russian emancipation of the serfs. He points out that one reason freedpeople in both situations were not successful was that emancipation coincided with a generation long agricultural depression. He also discusses the differences between the two situations. One of these especially stands out. Whatever Russian nobles thought of Russian peasants, they never denied that they were the vast majority of the country. By contrast, African-Americans are often unconsciously viewed as non-Southerners."},{"Title":"The Professionalization of Young Hockey Players","review":"I think this book is a valuable read for anyone who is studying not only hockey culture, but violence in sports.

In our market-driven health care system it is essential to involve the consumers much more in the whole process of decision making and accountability for performance. Purchasers in particular are eager to engage consumers, in the hope they will support purchasers putting pressure on health plans, physicians, and hospitals for higher quality.In this book, Dr. David Nash, a highly respected expert, conveys useful information on how to truly connect with the consumer.

Paul does a good job of distinguishing what true spirituallity is and where religion falls short. I have only a few frustrations with this book.1. he doesn't give as many concrete examples/analogies as I would've liked. (There are some, but usually it's just theories. So I would find myself most of the time trying to figure examples in my own life where these teachings could apply....perhaps, that was his intentions...lol, I don't know)2. The section on magnetic fields and earth's gravity was a little weird...I don't quite see the corollation. If anyone does, please could you tell me what you pulled from that section?3. This is probably because I grew up as a charismatic christian.

They're not mine. What do you expect?

The emphasis is on inner reflection through following Christ's teachings and so to attain that peace which lets the self eventually submerge into the divine for fulfillment and sharing with others.I found the first half up to two thirds of the book engaging, both in terms of how the author elaborates on Christ's teachings without unduly putting his own interpretation forth and also as to style and and presentation. After that, Paul Ferrini begins to depart noticeably from the core beliefs of Christianity and lets Christ slowly morph in a rather folksy way into some sort of a New Age guru (eg. page 159).That is not to say that the final chapters have no further worthy points to consider, they do, but in my view they are less a reflection of the Christ Mind than the author's own reflections on Christian and Judaic beliefs in a New Age interpretation."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"Love Without Conditions is by far the most important book I have read this life time.

It touches the light of the soul and it is just so right. I wonder if this book e.g. has also been translated into German. If not I'd love to do this, for I am convinced as many people as possible should be able to share mutual love.This could be my share. I'd love to hear from you... Love to all of you...

I still pick it up and read a few pages randomly before I go to sleep."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"This book is touted as \\"reflections of the Christ mind.\\" (Very heavy stuff.) It actually reads like a modern Bible, at times using archaic language and seeming to be a series of messages sent to the author telepathically, from the mind of some sort of Christ consciousness--I'm not too clear on that. The author seems to believe himself to be a kind of modern-day Prophet spreading the message of compassion and unconditional love for all humanity. (And who am I to deny this?)While I find this difficult to believe, that he is telepathically in tune with the mind of Christ, I still enjoyed the book very much. Whoever actually \\"said\\" these words, they are moral, common sense truth. The overall message is one of love, tolerance and compassion. It is really quite a beautiful book to read for Christians and Non-Christians alike.I recommend it highly, especially for those in need of renewed faith in the \\"Word.\\""},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"Self-compassion cannot be overrated. If we can't forgive ourselves, how can we forgive others?

I can see rereading it for many years to come. Most amazing is how easily the voice of Jesus flows through the book. Yes, it's His voice that comes through the author, who denies that it's channeled.

Challenging all who encounter this book to let go of the ego that promotes superiority and division, you will discover the power of self as a being grounded in love."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"I have this book with me often when I go out, even if I don't open it, and I have this book often by my bed. The glance of the man on the book (forget the name Jesus) is the pervading silence throughout the book that bubbles up everywhere like a frangrant garden.Some of the staple books I have as my \\"companion\\" are Gandhi's The Way to God, and also Gandhi's Essnential Writings edited by John Dear, the Dalai Lama's \\"How to Practice- the Way to a Meaningful Life\\", Adyashanti's the Impact of Awakening, Khalil Gibran's Beloved and Devotional Songs of Mirabai. Anything by Rumi or Hafiz, bring them on.You haven't met Jesus. You are always meeting him. There wasn't a time when you and Him were apart. I'm not Christian, as you can tell from the kinds of books that daily nourish my soul. He is you, closer to anything you can ever name. I have had \\"traumas\\", \\"disasters\\" in the ways of love and relationships, and many tears were shed over these pages that were \\"casually opened\\" for emergency consultations, let's say. It's like Medicine Cards, Bach Rescue Remedy, only more profound.For one sentence out of the page you open up may be the cup of medicine drink so bitter and yet so sweet and vibrant in its afterglow. And it seems as though it was meant only for you at that particular time. That perhaps there is nothing except you and Jesus everywhere and always. If I find myself avoiding this book in the car or in my house...that probably means I'm onto something \\"weird\\", \\"no good\\",\\"out of habit\\", who knows!!I recommend this book as a gift to anyone who perhaps wants to see Jesus in a totally different light.. in places it sounds more perenial stuff, vedantic at times. Some would think it's just sane, no-nonsense psychology, which the American Buddhist psychologists are gleaming from Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, etc. The historical Jesus takes a backseat, redemption and sin go out the door. There is no story. Jesus goes, \\"Forget 'bout it!\\" in New York Little Italy accent. Well not really.So take a flight."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"There are many books out there, you can look on Amazon and on bookstore shelves and you see hundreds of self help titles that claim to work wonders and change your life. The Secret was one book that caused a stir because it gave people the belief that you can think your way into anything you want, while that may be true on some levels it is not the answer. Life is a journey, filled with it's ups and downs...lessons we must learn, experiences me must face and go though. What makes a good life is not that you recieve all that you desire but that you reach a place within yourself that cannot be shaken by circumstances that happen around you. Love Without Conditions really can help you with finding that inner light and strength. I was sold as soon as I read the first page through the amazon reader...it just struck a chord.If your looking for a book thats special...then dont go past this one!!!"},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"This book should be in the top ten reads of a lifetime for everyone. It's timeless message makes crystal clear what Jesus Christ was trying to convey; only to have become convoluted over time and translation in the scriptures. Paul Ferrini brings the readers' attention to the most important aspects of life and demonstrates that each person has the ability to delve into a life of spirit, tapping into the Christ consciousness, and experiencing life as it was meant to be lived. Buy one for yourself, and one for a friend."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"This is my new Bible. I purchased a second copy for a friend...a must read for anyone interested in spirituality."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"We all know Jesus's commandment: Love your neighbors as you love yourself. But while we are all taught this, we are often not taught WHY we should love our neighbor as ourself, or HOW to love our neighbors as ourself. Most of us don't even love ourselves. Collectively, we don't do a good job of loving others unconditionally, because we aren't taught to love ourselves unconditionally.The things that get in the way, are guilt/blame, fear, projection, unforgiveness, and judgment. We use these against ourselves as much as we do others. When we learn that our self worth is not based on how others respond to us, because we are inherently valuable just the way we are, then we learn to value ourselves. When we love ourselves unconditionally, this in turn naturally leads to compassion for others and the ability to remove our \\"conditions\\" that prevent us from loving them.This book teaches that we choose our experiences in our life by how we choose to act or react, moment by moment. There is a profound cause and effect between our thoughts/beliefs and our moods and relationships. How you interpret your experience is important. Thoughts DO create experience. When you don't understand someone's behavior, do you choose the worst possible explanation? Or do you allow yourself to remain open to other possible explanations or points of view? Our interpretations are often false. There is a wonderful prayer in the book which addresses this:\\"Father, I am willing to change my mind about this situation. Please help me see this not through the eyes of fear, but as you see it. Help me see this with equal love for myself and others.\\"This book states that healing is your only purpose here. The shift from judgment to acceptance is the essence of healing. \\"Love Without Conditions\\" will cause you to undeniably see yourself and where you need to do the work. It will then guide you to do the work while supporting you. As you work on yourself from within, you will naturally begin to feel understanding and compassion for your neighbors in their struggle to do the same. We are all in this together. We are all one.I have read probably 50+ books on spirituality, and this book is one I cannot do without. It is in my personal top 3, along with the second book in this series, \\"Silence of the Heart,\\" and \\"Seat of the Soul\\" by Gary Zukov. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"As someone who has always had problems with organized Christianity, I approached this book with skepticism. But once I started reading, I found that it cuts straight to the core issues of human existence in a powerful and moving way. The book's key premise is that unconditional love of self and others is the key to ending human suffering. Rather than being presented in a way which is unrealistic or utopian, the cocept is spelled out with great psychological insight and incorporates many ideas I have found in Buddhism and Taoism. The book describes a concrete path for understanding the fear and guilt which keep us from treating ourselves and others with the respect and love we deserve; it teaches us how to really take seriously Jesus' instruction to &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding the causes of human suffering and what can be done to leave them behind"},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"This is one of the most profound books that I've ever had the pleasure to read. The words of Christ are simple, but challenging yourself to live and put them into practice takes time, patience, love of Self, and forgiveness. Jesus peels back the layers of complexity of many religious teachings to demonstrate that the key to happiness and love is to first love your Self.The words of this book will change the way you see others, the world, and more importantly, yourself. Jesus also provides tools on how to cope with man's everyday fears. Acknowledge them and let them go. Don't try to resist them. Don't try to overcome them. Just be with them. I've put this powerful tool into my own life, and I'm amazed at how I'm now able to acknowledge and be with my own fears. This reduces stress, worry, fear, and helps you to learn to love and communicate with your Self. Isn't it amazing how easily we try to give love to our parents, relatives, husbands, wives, etc., but we never truly attempt to give that love to ourselves? As Jesus says, you must love yourself before you can truly love another. It's all within us.I've read all four books in this series and I find them to be invaluable. You can read them many times and always come away with something that you missed or overlooked.These books are very short, but they contain such wisdom and love, that it is as if Jesus has distilled the teachings of the Bible and the other holy books down into these small, simple books.If you're looking to love yourself, to know that we are never alone, that love and forgiveness are all that is necessary for us to love ourselves and others, then these books will help you.Forget what you think you know and believe with regard to classic religion. If it is fear-based and control-based and asks you to judge, criticize, and condemn others, then \\"these are NOT my teachings,\\" says Christ.This books also helps you to learn to think for yourself as much as love yourself."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"I'm a spiritual-book junkie, yet, there have been only 3 or 4 books over the years that have affected me as did this book. There is something about the way Ferrini writes that puts me in an almost meditative state. I want to stop after each paragraph and contemplate what I just read. Each paragraph presents a profound thought which seems to go right to the core issue of why we humans continue to suffer, why we can't seem to find &quot;the answer&quot; to living openly and simply together on the planet, why we sometimes find it hard to live with ourselves. It all seems so very simple -- not necessarily easy, but simple. His words seem to bypass my analytical brain and go directly into my heart, creating within me a deep understanding of the concepts presented and a heart-felt desire to live these principles."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"This is the most beautiful book I have ever read about Jesus.

I turn to Love Without Conditions whenever I am in a crisis and need comforting. It is very centering. I give to everyone I know in crisis. I am on-line today to order it for a friend who has lost her father a few days ago.Love Without Conditions is clearly a book for every religion, not just christianity. Paul Ferrini states this at the beginning of the book. I see it as a spirtual book for everyone. It is extremely well written, and so clear, that the book's message of loving yourself and your brother is crystal clear.Love Without Conditions is so deep and profound I can only read 5 or 6 pages at at time, but that is enough to feel grounded. Yet I also feel transcendent, spiritually connected.

Never have I found a work so complete in it's understanding of the Christ message than this one. It is written in easy to understand language as Christ would have used were he living in this time frame. It contains thoughts so simple and profound that consideration of them literally changes your life.

Jesus never claimed divinity it was only when Saint Paul and some other followers decided to promote him as such. It was a sophomoric effort to dumb down the religion (Judaism) to attract the most followers. By resorting to hocus-pocus, Christianity became Christ-inanity. I recommend this book for all people interested in the universal spiritual principles which Jesus espoused."},{"Title":"Love Without Conditions (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"Although there is good advice on forgiveness, the writing style is waaaaaaaaayyyyyy to preachy for me.

It would make a good movie. It is an insightful and compassionate view of events wondrous, sad, funny, wry,and uniquely \\"ethnic\\" in the lives of a Christian Arabic family over nearly a century, told as fiction but picturing many of the author's relatives whom she knew or heard about as a child. We follow them as they move from \\"the old country\\" (Syria and Lebanon) in the late nineteenth century to Los Angeles and the twentieth century, indeed to our own decade.Hasna, inspired by the author's grandmother, is the main character in the beginning and concluding stories and appears also in some of the others. We see her first as an infant, then in young and middle life, and in old age. In her native country, when as a baby Hasna falls ill of a raging fever, she loses all her hair, and her mother \\"hid the black curls in a clean muslin cloth in the bottom of a dresser by the window.\\" Hasna remains bald until she is a young woman, and when the hair grows in, it is blonde--in a culture where everyone else has dark hair.My favorite views of Hasna are as a young woman, her blonde tresses in the wind as she whirls over the Arabian countryside on her golden stallion, a gift from brothers who have prospered in America. And when Hasna herself goes to the new world, she takes the horse with her on the ship, \\"scooping the horse manure and tossing it into the ocean with abandon.\\"Later we see Hasna providing a hiding place to her granddaughter's war-protesting young lover. The police search the house but do not find Rosemary and Dominic snugly hidden and having sex in the potato cellar, its door concealed under Hasna's kitchen linoleum.Frances Noble has a gift for sketching with a quick pen these memorable personalities, with their individualities and foibles, and letting us know not just what the characters do but what is in their minds and how they think and feel. I won't spoil the stories by telling too much, but I can't resist mentioning a couple more of my favorites.There is Jimmy, paralyzed from the waist down, confined to a hospital bed in the home of his sister and brother-in-law, who sets up a successful bookie business among fellow-Syrians, answering the telephone with a code word, Arabic \\"burakee,\\" meaning \\"blessings.\\" There is Genevieve who works as a \\"heeler\\" in a shoe factory and keeps secret her marriage to Sal (because Sal is Italian). You will have to read the book to find out how she eventually breaks the news to her family.Certain traits mark many of the family members--vigor, equanimity, and an ever-ready joy in the sensuous: the scents and textures of Arabic food, usually prepared lavishly by a situe. The beauties of nature. Sex, whether one is young or old. After Albert is saddened by his family's disapproval over his having taught his wife to read, Esene comes to his shop, where he is working late, and brings dinner for both of them. \\"Give me a drink,\\" she said, as she unwrapped the food. \\"You always like the taste of bourbon in my mouth.\\"Frances Noble provides a subtle view of an ample humanity, telling her stories with style and tautness in a small book of only 182 pages. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Situe Stories (Arab American Writing)","review":"Frances Khirallah Noble has written a fine collection of short fiction that hungrily demands to be enjoyed with food. Her colorful descriptions of life and the passing of time in a family over several generations and two continents inspires laughter, a tear and a desire to call mom. Though there are some moments when her prose tastes a little too much like a Hollywood film, each course here is served with enough flavor to satisfy the stingiest connoisseur of good writing. What is most impressive about this collection is the way Khirallah Noble has managed to isolate small, physical, vivid moments and turn them into pivotal pieces of the lives of each character. Her smart and often charming sense of humor is a garnish; her insight into the interior lives of such rich characters makes The Situe Stories a memorable feast indeed."},{"Title":"Great Trucks","review":"This 1983 pictorial came to me as a very pleasant surprise, covering 52 major world wide truck brands and presenting them nicely in both color and black and white on glossy paper. This book is a huge improvement on the earlier Consumer Guide book entitled 'Big Trucks' published in 1979.Some of the best examples of these brands are depicted... examples include International's Transtar Eagle Brougham, and White's Road Commander II, Western Star's flashy cabover, and these pictures are a blend of both showroom and working examples.Text is concise yet does justice to each brand and describes models and their activities throughout the world.Well worth hunting down."},{"Title":"Major Airlines of the World (Vital Guide)","review":"Author G&uuml;nter Endres needs to get out more.But don't let him start just yet.

It is a scathing critique and analysis of the war on poverty, where bold rhetoric and political grandstanding have often supplanted action. The author in his analysis categorizes poverty as a cultural and often institutional way of life that would require radical innovations, social planning, and long term financial investment, were the government really serious about eradicating poverty in America. What is amazing is that the arguments made by the author, when he wrote this book forty years ago, are still sound today."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"The author was introduced to involuntary poverty by Dorothy Day. It is explained the poor are invisible because they dress as the rest of us do. Staying on interstates does not disclose the impoverished hamlets. The poor inhabit geographical areas of beauty. The poor are increasingly isolated in specific areas of the cities. They are invisible politically. (Note the discussion in the last election of helping the middle class.) Powerful political organizations not longer focus on the slums.Sometimes poverty is a matter of unintended consequences. For instance, a pension scheme may fetter mobility. In addition to pensions, home-owning and credit outlays may impede mobility, (the ability to move to where the work is). A technological revolution in agriculture produces rural poverty. The alcoholic poor come from every social class. Aged poverty is described. (This is a topic that has changed since the introduction of Medicare.) The prevalence of mental illness among the poor is covered and it is truly telling.This book mobilized public opinion in the sixties to create remedies for poverty and it remains relevant today. Its breadth, its formulations, its visions are remarkable."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"This book is a subjective analysis of the USA regarding poverty. Written in the early sixties and credited with an effort towards positive change. This book will leave liberal thinkers with something to talk about and the others with something to mock. Truly a book for everyone living the American Dream."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"I had to read this book for my History 1302 class and I must say I'm glad I chose this book out of all the others. The book was very easy to read, however, it sometimes gets confusing when all the facts about poverty are referenced at the same time. Although this book is short, at certain times it feels like Harrington is dragging out his ideology. Nonetheless, This book opened my eyes to the poverty in America not only in the past, but at its' present state."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"This is a classic for sure but a classic of what?

I read &quot;There are no Children here&quot; and loved it!!! I read somewhere that the author was inspired by this book, so I couldn't wait to get it. My guess is this author is a liberal, and not objective. The information was boring and one sided. I would have probably liked it more if the time frame was more current. I want to know more about today, not the 60's."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"Few works of contemporary non-fiction have had more lasting impact on the social consciousness of the overall society from which it arose than \\"The Other America\\", Michael Harrington's now classic tome on the egregious conditions under which what we would now call the \\"underclass\\" lived in mid-20th century American society. With an uncommon verve and uncanny precision, Harrington painstakingly detailed the disgusting and shocking realities of life for those many millions of Americans of both color and ethnicity living lives of desperate poverty in the midst of the affluent society. Millions of readers, myself included, were shocked to discover the extent to which this world coexisted with our own, and many of the social action programs that arose in the 1960s and thereafter used this book as a kind of reference guide to the realities of poverty in contemporary society. Indeed, what is most disturbing about anyone re-reading the book is the discovery of how little conditions have changed for those who through the accident of birth, color, and ethnic origin, find themselves inexorably trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty.Sadly, for all the glad-handing of politicians and the proclamations by global corporations of the new and more widespread prosperity of the 1990s, the sobering truth is that very little progress has been made. Indeed, in more recent books such as William Finnegan's excellent \\"Cold New World\\", Harrington's basic thesis of the co-existence of a starker, poorer, and powerless populace left stranded to live lives of quiet desperation is reconfirmed, putting the lie to the many proclamations of universal opportunity and promise that politicians now ballyhoo. The book, which was first published in the early 1960s, was required reading for most introductory sociology and contemporary history courses, and millions of young academics first learned of the extent of the national problem through a reading of this book. It is, in that sense at least, a modern classic. Harrington's basic thesis is incontrovertible; poverty is extensive and endemic, and is usually hidden from the view of most affluent Americans due to the ways in which the two subcultures coexist in modern society. Through the de-facto residential segregation of the two elements of the society, there is little meaningful contact, and the media tends to ignore the facts of the existence of the underclass, portraying arch-types which conform more to the sensibilities of the more affluent segments of the society that regularly view its programming and enforcing unrealistic images of what exists. As a previous reviewer commented, we no longer habituate the same environments, and we tend to avoid all unnecessary contact with anything to do with this other world of poverty and want. What Harrington originally described in such anguished and inflammatory terms, hoping to purposefully ignite America's slumbering conscience, has instead become a permanent feature of our conscienceless socio-cultural landscape.It is a sad truth that Harrington's book is as timely and as shocking today as it was some forty years ago. His account of the fate of millions of impoverished people of color and ethnicity remains as cogent and as relevant as it was then. Despite the long and tortured history of the social legislation that attempted to rework this problem in the decades since, the reality of the situation seems to be that nothing much has changed in terms of the life-chances and hopes of the members of the underclass. It remains a mainstay of introductory courses in social stratification, providing an excellent overview of the myriad of the sociological, political, and economic issues surrounding the underclass, and is a wonderful example of just how important one man's vision of the truth can be in orienting others meaningfully toward rectifying a social problem. Poverty may remain, as they say, always with us, but the shocking truths found in this book still sheds the light of day into an unappetizing aspect of contemporary society we all should be aware of."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"The Other America was first published in 1962, before Johnson's &quot;Great Society&quot; and &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; before Vietnam, before the urban riots of the late 60s, before the Civil Rights legislation, and before the formation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As such, it may well seem a dinosaur to apply the revelations and ideas proposed by author Michael Harrington to a society that has advanced so far. Or has it? Harrington develops his thesis on the central premise that poverty in America is both there and widespread. More importantly, however, is the fact that it is hidden. People no longer have day-to-day contact with the urban poor. Before the mass exodus of the middle class, the majority of Americans lived in or near areas inhabited by the poor. Even if they did not, they walked through or drove through the rows of tenements on their way to work downtown. They saw the conditions the poor lived in and saw the faces of the poor. When Harrington wrote, as is true today, the &quot;ghetto&quot; is a place to avoid. We have successfully severed all economic use of the poor from our daily lives and are able to drive into downtown from the suburban fringe without even having to stop to see the lives of the poor. Even today's trend toward reconstructing highways below-grade so as to have less impact on the poor neighborhoods they divide further removes the lives of the poor from our daily routine-we don't even have to see the buildings pass by anymore. They are safely beyond the highway wall. Harrington differentiates between the poverty existing today and that of previous urban centers. The old ethnic ghettos were indeed permeated by poverty, had miserable living conditions, and were centers of disease and urban mischief. They did have one thing, however, that is lacking in today's ghettos: aspiration. The ghettos of yesterday melded the old world with the new, and served as stepping-stones toward the American dream. Those who form today's ghettos, primarily African-Americans, do not have an &quot;old world.&quot; They come from within our society but are not part of it. Generations of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination, and despair have disenchanted many, so much so that most of America is foreign to them and they are said to have a &quot;twisted spirit.&quot; Harrington discusses the various classes of poverty, ranging from that of blacks to the elderly to the rural farmer and many in between. Curiously, however, he only mentions poverty of children, a major issue of modern times, in passing. Public housing is discussed in some detail, and looking back from the failures we have witnessed in public housing projects, much could have been avoided had we paid attention to Harrington's thoughts. He condemns the towering projects as instant ghettos, providing poverty with a simple facelift, detached from surrounding neighborhoods. As early as 1962, an argument was being made against the demolition and removal of entire neighborhoods for the construction of high-rise towers and in favor of dispersed public housing. Only recently have HUD programs such as Section 8 vouchers and HOPE VI project grants implemented this ideology. Overall, Harrington's account of poverty in America has, unfortunately, remained a very viable account. Even after Johnson's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; the civil rights legislation, urban riots, and the longest peacetime economic expansion ever, Harrington's book might as well have been written today. It provides a good summary of the sociological and economic issues concerning poverty, and would be a good introductory book before expanding on specific aspects of poverty by contemporary sociologists such as William Julius Wilson. A reader today may question his persistent call for a federal solution, given the miserable track record of federal programs and the increasing focus on local solutions. Harrington does, however, shed light and provide a realistic picture of a large portion of American's that most never see."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs. It is a scathing critique and analysis of the war on poverty, where bold rhetoric and political grandstanding have often supplanted action. The author in his analysis categorizes poverty as a cultural and often institutional way of life that would require radical innovations, social planning, and long term financial investment, were the government really serious about eradicating poverty in America. What is amazing is that the arguments made by the author, when he wrote this book forty years ago, are still sound today."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"What is most amazing about Harrington's book is how accurately it describes today's society. The impact of this book, first published in the early 60s, is testament to the power that a single book can have on a nation and its people. It directly affected the thoughts and actions of President Johnson's \\"war on poverty\\". Unfortunately, this \\"war on poverty\\" may never come to a conclusion, even in the richest country in the world.The book itself contains a good introduction by Howe, who puts the impact of Harrington's work in context. Filled with statistics, which are unfortunately not well referenced, the case is made that the scale of poverty in the US is a travesty and an outrage. Harrington himself lived amongst the poor and disenfranchised members of New York's society for a brief period of time and he writes about their general hopelessness and lack of purpose in life. The descriptions and analysis of this book allow you to view the world through the 'lens' of poverty, to know (on a superficial level) the crippling and depressing lives of our society's poorest members. Harrington was perhaps the leading American socialist of his time, so be warned that his views and crituqes have a liberal/leftist stance and that much of the book disparages the efforts of the US government (perhaps, rightly so).As an added bonus, this edition of the book includes some insightful afterwords by Harrington about poverty in the 70s and 80s. Overall, an important and powerful work that is a must-read for anyone concerned with the issue of poverty in the US (which should be everyone, shouldn't it?)."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"Not being an American, I cannot judge whether the poverty situation described in this book is still as prevalent as it was in the early 1960's.I found the book to be a good and easy read, the author was able to get his point across and made some good suggestions.

Liberals, conservatives and radicals seem not to really understand this culture. Perhaps help will come from a revived labor movement."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"During the 1950s, the poor were invisible; during the 1960s & 70s they were to be pulled up by the Great Society programs; during the 1980s they became the enemy of President Reagan and the middle class; during the 1990s and 2000s the poor have become clowns to laugh at on the \\"Jerry Springer Show\\".This book lends significant and valuable insight into poverty; not just economic poverty but \\"psychological\\" poverty. Although this book was written over forty years ago, much of the main ideas still seem to hold true. Instead of looking at today's poor Americans as \\"lazy welfare bums\\" we must look at the deep psychological and sociological subculture that is their situation. Harrington makes many interesting observations in this regard. The book is also very well written and researched.Please do not dismiss this book because of the author's liberal and socialistic political leanings. Take it for what it is. In any case, it will give you a lot to think about."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"The Other America has been around for a very long time. I read it when it first came out in 1962, and did not like it at all, because its basic thesis is that poverty is the result of cultural pathology (except in the case of the elderly). At the time I was a radical SDS anti-poverty and anti-war activist, and our ideology was that the poor were exploited and discriminated against, and simply lacked money. We had nothing but contempt for the notion of a \\"culture of poverty,\\" because that implied that the poor were responsible for their own fate.Well, I and my friends were very wrong. There is a culture of poverty and it accounts for much poverty, and this does not mean that we should ignore it because it's the poor's own fault. There but for the Grace of God go I, and you, dear reader, as well.The deep accuracy and sensitivity with which Harrington portrays cultures of poverty ring as true today as a half century ago. The tragedy is that the War on Poverty and other anti-poverty measures of the last third of the Twentieth Century did not understand Harrington's analysis, and treated poverty as the simple lack of material resources. How could the Federal Government have build public housing complexes, true breeding grounds of social pathologies, after reading Harrington's depiction of urban poverty. What an unmitigated tragedy.Many years ago I changed from criticizing the \\"blame the victim\\" mentality to embracing the notion that the victims should always blame themselves, because they are the only one who have the combined power and will to change things. When I am oppressed it is my fault and I better damn well figure out how to change the situation. Poverty in America will only be overcome when the culture of poverty is attacked, with vengeance and steadfastness, by the communities that are exploited by their pathological cultures of apathy and ignorance."},{"Title":"The Other America: Poverty in the United States","review":"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs.

Harrington who understood society better than most of his day shunned such discrimination based on race, class, economic standing, or national origin and these honorable views resound very highly in the pages of \\"The Other America. The book is a study of poverty and its underlying factors in the United States during the fifties and sixties, Harrington who would often move into and work in the neighborhoods and communities he was studying presents a dignified and unbiased case for the inhumanity that existed and still exists in the slums and poor towns of the United States.Harrington takes the gloves off for his analysis of the evolution of poverty. The writer explores the factors of racial discrimination, economic and socioeconomic discrimination, family structural instability, the effect of recessions and hard times on poor communities, and the gap in education that propagates the extension and survival of poverty into the future. One important factor that Harrington continuously brings up in \\"The Other America\\" is the views and feelings of indifference that the middle class and well off feel towards the poor and lower classes of the other America. Harrington exposes the inefficient and dastardly laws, mindsets, and societal norms that ensured the survival of poverty into the twentieth century (and surprisingly they ring true for the present day as well). The writer exposes the stories and faces behind the suffering of the other America but also presents ways in which the suffering could be alleviated or poverty stamped out completely in the United States.The socioeconomic analysis that is \\"The Other America can seem quite statistical to the reader with its constant use of numerical studies and figures to illuminate the problem of poverty, but these bothersome details can be overcome and even appreciated by understanding that \\"The Other America\\" was written during a time of rising economic and sociological disparities, and was brought forth to energize and push the country towards creating solutions to these problems in the course of attempting to create a more equal and humility-minded society. A great read nonetheless for it highlights to those willing to listen the need both then and now for a war on poverty."},{"Title":"Elementary principles of economics","review":"This particular version is so poorly reproduced that you can't make heads or tails of the many figures throughout the book.

Even though the book maybe a little outdated on some of its content, most of it still holds true to this very present day.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a glimpse of the study of economics."},{"Title":"Elementary principles of economics","review":"I'm pleased to be able to post the first review of Prof. Irving Fisher's \\"Elementary Principles of Economics\\" on Amazon.com. Considering the great minds that Fisher has inspired at his own Yale University (such as James Tobin and Robert Shiller) and elsewhere I'm greatly honored, although feeling some trepidation, to be in this position.Let me start by stating that it's a great book. For one who contributed so much to mathematical economics, Fisher's ability as a writer astounds. Fisher (1867-1947) is much like his British contemporary John Maynard Keynes in this respect with their worldly manner of expression explaining much about their staying power.The book's recap (p. 511, hardcover edition) - while giving his outline of \\"foundation stones,\\" determination of prices, and principles of distribution - states Fisher's larger purpose. Living through heady times, the author knew any attempts at reform needed to be informed by sound principles. This position sounds much like what Leon Walras wrote about necessary scientific prerequisites.Fisher stays away from applications and calls upon his readers to check their own partisan desires. Considering that Fisher was an inventive Yankee, thus geared toward practicality, \\"Elementary Principles\\" might have been his hardest book to write.Our wise author makes a remark, seemingly offhanded, which sums up the probably the biggest problem in modern economics - the bias toward positivism (read: government action). \\"But knowledge, to be of use, must be applied,\\" Fisher writes (p. 193). If taken as a license for perpetual policy-making this is not true. Knowledge is also useful in reckoning what not to do.At the risk of appearing \\"unscientific\\" I'll point out that Judaism's Holy Torah has 365 negative commandments (Thou Shall Nots) and 248 positive. The blueprint of the universe shows us that it's more important to refrain from action than to take action.The positivist bent becomes more understandable when Fisher discusses confidence and time. He calls confidence \\"the soul of trade\\" (p. 195). Factoring in instant worldwide communications and more complicated financial instruments and arrangements, which didn't exist when \\"Elementary Principles\\" was published in 1912, makes the professor's teachings about confidence more important to contemplate. Throw in the public's conditioning by the welfare/warfare state and the mass media over the past 60 years and we're drawn to the regrettable conclusion that economic efficiency, justice and liberty may all have to be impinged in the name of confidence.Fisher's avoidance of applications gives \\"Elementary Principles\\" its permanence. Its detailed index takes us quickly to the issues and the professor's thorough exposition keeps us glued there. Among them - free trade (a sort of labor-saving machinery, p. 454), currency stability (importance in fulfilling contracts, p. 248), and business cycles (the bubble bursts because banks can't expand too far beyond their reserves, p. 188).Social sacred cows are slaughtered along the way when the author explains the value of arbitrage and speculation (p. 340) and the destructive effects of vanity and social racing (p. 506). Agudath Israel of America's call for limits on wedding expenditures is a great example of using Fisher's teachings without resorting to government compulsion.If some took Fisher's writings as an anthem for big government, the professor also set the table for the welfare state's ultimate undoing. His discussion of the declining wages phenomenon (p. 461-463) goes to the heart of the matter. The decline of savings means less capital and less capital means falling wages. Nothing better summarizes the bankruptcy of spendaholic Keynesianism (It's called CAPITAL-ism, remember.). Increasing government guarantees (social programs) and the accompanying bureaucratization worsens conditions by making people less willing to bear risk. Losses of self-reliance and the entrepreneurial spirit mean declining incomes for most and less government revenue. Ergo, the nanny state eats itself.There are many more gems like this in \\"Elementary Principles,\\" especially in the chapters on wealth and poverty, waiting to be discovered and applied, if only in our minds. The book is testament to why Irving Fisher, more than six decades after his death, remains one of the world's most important economic sociologists."},{"Title":"Elementary principles of economics","review":"I am very very unhappy i have not received this book and i really wanted it.

Who knows? Perhaps I might even assimilate a whiff of cultcha.JOHN MACNAB was penned by Scotsman John Buchan, who was to eventually become Governor General of Canada and 1st Baron Tweedsmuir. Written in 1925, the novel opens with three gentleman friends - lawyer Sir Edward Leithen, banker John Palliser-Yeates, and Cabinet member Charles Lord Lamancha - discovering that they all suffer a common and debilitating malady, a loss of zest for life (for which, nowadays, one would simply be prescribed an antidepressant chemical).Enlisting the aid of another friend, Scottish landowner Sir Archibald Roylance, the trio contrives a plot to poach game - deer or salmon - from the hereditary lands of three of Archie's Highland neighbors under the guise of an assumed false identity, \\"John Macnab.\\" But, this is not to be common theft, but rather an exercise in sportsmanship. Letters over Macnab's \\"signature\\" are duly sent to the three targeted and unsuspecting lairds setting out the terms of the challenge, which includes monetary wagers. The life-stimulating danger to our three heroes comes from the damage to their reputations should they be caught and their identities revealed. Responses received from the three landowners indicate that they will take extraordinary measures to protect their holdings from trespass. The game is on.The story begins engagingly enough as the plotters repair to Roylance's lodge to plan their assaults with the help of some local talent, which includes an itinerant young tinker-boy, Fish Benjie, and Archie's veteran stalker, Wattie. Each of the three - Leithen, Palliser-Yeates, and Lamancha - takes responsibility for poaching one of the three targets.The narrative is successful through the first two acts. Then as more characters are added and the Press becomes involved, the story loses focus and what was, to my mind, an otherwise elegantly simple plot and concept. By the end of the third act, JOHN MACNAB disintegrates into a genteel Highland farce. Of course, it's all quite civilized in the upper-class, British manner. And the charming Scottish dialect is lovingly rendered.Perhaps the chief value to be gained from this relatively short book (188 pages) read today in 2010 is the window on a way of life struck a heavy blow by the Great War and soon to be eclipsed by World War Two and the subsequent loss of the Empire. Or perhaps I'm just reading too much into it.

From the first page, Alice Pinkerton muses about her life as a woman of the 20th century, still controlled by the rigid Victorian mores that govern every element of society. Likening herself to Rochester's wife, the madwoman in Jane Eyre, Alice is hardly mad, rather a lady of exquisite intellectual sensibilities who does not live incarcerated, attending church and performing other duties required by her station. Rather, it is Alice's mind that is imprisoned, for the entire work, takes place in the character's mind, segueing from one connection to another.Hers is a fascinating dialog, one that questions, pokes, prods and eviscerates the common mentality. Clearly, Alice is a woman born before her time. The forces that converge in Alice's thoughts, literary, musical, sometimes vaguely threatening, run from simple observations to more convoluted ideas. Were she a man, Alice would be considered a literary master of ideas and revolutionary concepts.That said, this is a stream-of-consciousness novel with Alice as the only character, driven by her own inner dialog, without the respite of other points of view. Although I tried, I could not continue the journey with Alice, eventually exhausted by the sheer force of words spinning through her intellect. This book is staggering in the number of pages and range of ideas, especially the literary references, which mine long-forgotten, if once beloved novels. I just could not continue past the first 200 pages. Alice proved too much for me.Such enormous energy is expended in the 727 pages that there must be a welcoming audience for this novel. I envision the author, churning out endless pages, falling deeper into Alice's mind and I cannot imagine that this literary monument should go unappreciated. There is an audience for stream-of-consciousness novels and I hope this one receives its share of applause. Luan Gaines/ 2005."},{"Title":"Pinkerton's Sister","review":"The first thing to warn potential readers of this book about - it isn't a story so much as the dialogue happening in a woman's mind. Imagine sitting down in the morning and daydreaming and reminiscing all day. Then sit down and write the whole thing down over 727 pages. That is what Pinkerton's Sister is like to read. Comparisons to James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" are apt. There is no \\"action\\", nothing actually happens. It is just thoughts written down (and it skips and jumps between topics like real thoughts do). So if you place a high value on plot, Pinkerton's Sister is best avoided.Having said that, the thoughts of Alice, the 35 year-old Victorian spinster, who \\"reads too much\\" are interesting. There are witty, cynical observations about the people in her neighbourhood and their social pretensions. There are numerous references to literary classics, from \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" to \\"Frankenstein\\", \\"Jane Eyre\\" and even the Bible. Alice Pinkerton relates all the characters and events in books to those people she knows in real life, and the two become intertwined. A play of reality and fiction forms in her mind, and the reader is invited inside.In the cave of Alice's mind we find bitterness, frustration and contempt for the world around her, all expressed with witty sarcasm. Alice realises the problem isn't with her, but with the society she lives in. A society where women who are unmarried and read literature are considered mad, and sent to see psychoanalists. She mocks this narrow world by comparing it to the rich and varied one she finds in books, the world of her mind.The writing style and literary knowledge of the author are great. The insights of Alice are beautiful despite their brutal truth. But unfortunately, I couldn't take 700+ pages of thought without any sort of events. With no \\"external stimulation\\" so to speak, I got wearing reading at times. It was like being stuck in an elevator, with nothing to do or see, just your thoughts. At times you just had to \\"get off\\" and take a break before returning to the \\"seclusion\\" of the book.If that doesn't bother you, I recommend it. As for me, I sort of wish it had been shorter. The experience was good, and I was glad of it, but it lasted too long. You get the flavour of Alice's thoughts in about 250 pages. After that, they begin to feel repetitive. I resented the loss of time I could have spent reading other books."},{"Title":"Pinkerton's Sister","review":"Whenever Alice, the novel's protagonist, turns her acerbic wit on the stuffy philistines surrounding her, the results are simply hilarious, and I honestly consider rereading some of these chapters to better savour their verbal acrobatics.Traversing this novel, however, was by no means an unalloyed pleasure: first, as Alice's fellow citizens tend to come across as cardboard caricatures, the sheer length of the harangues does not always seem justified; and what is more, these entertaining bits come in between expansive stretches of densely allusive prose, littered with literary references and snatches of verse.These parts definitely exhausted my patience and went beyond my intellectual grasp, but I still wonder if to some extent this is not simply a novel that wants to be too clever by half and in doing so diminishes the impact of the monstrosities lurking at its dark core."},{"Title":"Pinkerton's Sister","review":"I have to say that I'm surprised that this book hasn't received the praise and attention it richly deserves.

This is 400-some pages of rambling, in which nothing really happens. The first 270 pages are filled with what the thoughts of Alice Pinkerton as she gets ready for church, the last 100 or so are her thoughts that evening as she readies for bed. On top of not actually being about anything, this book commits the sin of being pretentious. Ooh, I know who Trilby is, ooh, I know what Lewis Carroll wrote other than the Alice books, ooh, I've read a lot of obscure and not so obscure plays. If you enjoy the unfocused ramblings of the mad, or you like playing find the literary reference, buy the book. If you want a plot and character development, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Pinkerton's Sister","review":"Ok, I get it...but this style is at best really annoying when it is ever present.

An annoying disappointment."},{"Title":"Pinkerton's Sister","review":"Peter Rushforth, Pinkerton's Sister (MacAdam and Cage, 2005)Writing a novel where the prose-- it's lyrical qualities, its construction, etc.-- is the focus is an admirable goal. Far too few do it these days. But the best novels of this type-- Wendy Walker's books, Cormac McCarthy's, Kathe Koja's, Lucius Shepard's-- all have one thing in common-- while we're all marveling at the prose, the author never lets us forget that there's something going on beneath the surface, as well. The novels of those authors all have exceptionally strong plots to go with their gorgeous prose. That's what makes their books some of the best in the English language-- you can sink your teeth into them on many different levels.Rushforth has created a nicely-written book here, but he forgot to add anything to it. Worse off, he's done it in seven hundred fifty-two pages. In books where this sort of thing works (James' The Aspern Papers comes to mind), their brevity is a controlling factor. Rushforth just kept going-- almost three hundred pages of Alice Pinkerton getting ready for church for forty-one chapters, and then a two-hundred-page, one-chapter depiction of the service itself. With, of course, long notes, digressions, and reminiscences from Alice's mind. It just keeps going, and going, and going, like the Energizer bunny.I devoured the almost-six-hundred pages of McCarthy's Blood Meridian, lingered over the four hundred fifty of Walker's The Secret Service. They were great novels. When MacAdam and Cage's publicists trumpeted this doorstop, which may have gotten a bigger advertising budget than any novel MacAdam and Cage has ever released, as \\"the book everyone will be talking about in 2005,\\" a small part of me expected something along those lines. To say I didn't get it would be quite the understatement. (And the blurb ended up being quite the overstatement; the novel has garnered a total of four reviews on Amazon, as I write this, in the years and a half since its release.) In fact, by the time I reached page three hundred of this bloated, overwrought, underperforming monstrosity, I was ready to use it for kindling; it's a good thing I finally abandoned it during one of the hottest weekends Cleveland has had in May in the past century. I ended up just taking it back to the library, so some other poor, unsuspecting fool might try to find something of use in its bloated pages. I couldn't.

Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"Simply put, The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine is an outstanding collection of essays by leading theologians and serves well as an introduction to contemporary trends in Christian theology. The authors are generally more conservative--postliberal or evangelical--and offer stimulating constructive and historical essays regarding Christian theology in general and the traditional doctrines.I use the text in a graduate level intro. course to compliment another standard text in systematic theology, giving the student another brief perspective on contemporary Christian theology. Readers with some background in philosophy or theology will find it extremely useful, but those with no philosophical or theological background may be a little overwhelmed (consider Alister McGrath's \\"Christian Theology: An Introduction\\" instead)."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"An earlier, self-described &quot;very conservative evangelical&quot; reviewer criticized the essays in this collection for their &quot;questionable&quot; liberal conclusions. It's curious how different people can read the same text and arrive at different conclusions. My own reading of this anthology is that the essays strive (perhaps overly much, in fact) to stay in the middle of the road. Few people would describe Robert Jenson or Stanley Hauerwas, two of the contributors, as &quot;liberal&quot; theologians. They're certainly adventurous and prophetic, but also utterly orthodox (this isn't meant, by the way, as criticism).Perhaps what displeased the earlier reviewer is this: _The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine_ takes as its working assumption the need of doctrinal theology to walk a fine line between remaining loyal to tradition on the one hand and re-thinking that tradition in light of each new generation's experience on the other. In the West, we've moved out of the modern into the postmodern era. Modernist modes of interpreting Christian doctrine cry to be replaced with newer ones that reflect the new postmodern ethos. Otherwise, the Good News runs the risk of coming across as increasingly irrelevant to too many people. The contributors to this volume aim to read traditional doctrine against this new background.The essays are divided into two sections. The first deals with the nature and scope of doctrinal theology and its relationship to nonChristian traditions (Judaism) and the symbols of secular society (the arts). The second examines several key topics traditionally included in doctrinal or systematic theology: the trinity, creation, anthropology, sacraments, Christology, pneumatology, eschatology.Geoffrey Wainwright's essay on &quot;The Holy Spirit&quot; is especially noteworthy. Perhaps the single best essay in the entire collection, it seeks to reawaken the West to theological reflection on the Holy Spirit without falling victim to a &quot;pneumatological hypertrophy&quot; characteristic of, for example, Pentecostalism (p. 289). Equally worthy of note is Gerard Loughlin's &quot;The Basis and Authority of Doctrine,&quot; which attempts a postmodern reading of that most un-postmodern of doctrines: authority. But although of varying quality, none of the articles in the collection are heavy-handed or simplistic. There are certain gaps in the collection--the editor himself seems uncomfortable that no essay explicitly dealing with the topics of justification and sanctification is included, and on a related note, I worry about the lack of a sustained treatment of grace. But all in all, a good, through-provoking anthology."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"Gunton was a great theologian. His own works are powerful and encourage one to take the Trinity and the doctrine of creation with great seriousness. As an editor, he does not disappoint. Here, he compiled essays by prominent theologians on the major doctrinal areas of Christian theology: method, ethics, culture, art, trinity, creation, redemption, ecclesiology, human nature, etc. Surprising to me was the essay on Christianity and the arts, in which Jeremy Begbie asked that Christian art offer an image of redemption.None of the essays were less than excellent and all of them are a great place to start in investigating these areas in Christian theology. Also valuable for students, at the end of each essay is included suggestions for further reading.Mostly a valuable resource and introduction for students, but should be valuable to any level of theologian."},{"Title":"CHECKLIST Interactive CD-ROM Training Companion to the book Checklist for Success (Professional Aviation series)","review":"This CD uses avi &quot;movies&quot; to show you good and bad ways to answer interview questions among other things.

I also believe there is nothing wrong with trying to help yourself in life. Sarah reminds you to keep your intentions in tact and to really think about what you are doing before you do it. This book also offers more different collections and beliefs to view and appreciate. I believe if you feel strongly about something and try to be the best person you can be-- whatever religion you choose or create for yourself is right for you.

While it is important to acknowledge that there is a dark side, ( good light, bad light, good dark and bad dark, ) Wicca teaches first and foremost how to recognize and make the distinctions, how to defend oneself psychically, how to work out a situation for the good of all and warns of the threefold rede; &quot;As it harm none, do what ye will.&quot; I found a lot of dark light in this book as I perused it at length at the bookstore....then placed it back on the shelf. What I like about Wicca is how it makes one take responsibility for your spiritual thoughts and actions towards others. That is not conveyed to the reader of this book. At some point, we will all be in the spirit....and we need to practice how to &quot;be&quot; in that realm. (while understanding that not acknowledging the dark in ourselves will cause it to overflow and taint the good light in ourselves, thus becoming bad light) The spells in this book are just downright irresponsible.

Even if you are ok with delving a litle into the dark side (not everyone believes in the rule of three) there are better books out there that deal with this. Embracing The Moon by Yasmine Galenorn was a great book that included sexually charged spells and spells to mete out justice.

I would, however like to commet about Sarah Lyddon Morrison's books and the controversy they have caused because of their negative and death spells. I have three of her spell books and am aware of the negative material that they contain. However, these spells are included, in my eyes, more out of showing that they exist, and the practices of Hawaiian and Obedah magic are facsinating and reading them I felt no inclination to practice them, but eager to see the dark side of sorcery, more to inform and educate myself than harm anyone else, no matter how much anyone else has spited me in the past. We all have our paths to follow in life, and good and bad is in front of us every day, WE ARE THE ONES who have to chose which road we are going to take. If someone attempts a negative spell from any of these books, the author is not to blame but the person themselves who are filled with rage enough to harm someone using these spells. Look at these books as a metaphor of life, good and bad, and what we choose is up to us. The author stresses that negative spells can and will harm, and when I first bought her first book I was angered and wanted to find a negative spell. But since that time I've grown up, and realized that we make our own fate and we have the power to choose right from wrong, no one can &quot;promote&quot; the former or latter to us. I would never use a black spell from any of these books but don't condemn the author for including them(Crowley and Levoy have been doing it for years as a PHILOSOHPY and I hear no one condemning them as much as Ms. Morrison) This book is a take on sorcery, not wicca. It shows both sides of the coin and the reader should be mature enough to decide which spells to use to improve his or her life. I wonder if LeVoy gets these many hate reviews. Whether her spells work is up to anyone who has tried them because her spells DO work for anyone who knows what they are doing.

The Kahunas would have called it ho'omanamana if they called it anything. The system called HUNA began in 1917 or 1918 by Max Freedom Long (MFL). MFL was trying to reclaim the lost secrets of the kahunas. The Hawaiian people would not discuss these spiritual matters with MFL for fear of persecution. The &quot;christian&quot; missionaries, and their puppets in the government made it ILLEGAL for the Hawaiians to practise their form of spiritualiy. MFL gave this system the name HUNA because Huna means secret.MFL made several leaps in logic (I am fond of saying that in some places MFL added 2 and 2 and came up with 6). Such instances are --- 1. MFL's belief that Jesus was an initiated kahuna. 2. That Hawaiians are a lost tribe of Israel. 3. That HUNA was a lost tradition of &quot;christianity&quot;, and others.Page x: &quot;I do not wish you to harm anyone very much with the darker spells, as it may be that they'll backfire and harm you instead. _| This author feels it is perfectly OK to to work magick on others against their will. This is NOT acceptable. May I remind you of a few things?1. The one HUNA commandment is &quot;Harm No One And Nothing With Hate&quot; which I abbreviated to &quot;Harm Nothing with hatred&quot;.2. A line from the Wiccan Rede says &quot;An ye harm none; do what ye will.&quot;3. The young carpenter cautioned people correctly with &quot;Ye reap what ye sow (paraphrased)&quot;4. India amd Tibet teaches the law of karma.Page 5: &quot;If you can't visualize a face clearly, then you can't do spells. It's as simple as that.&quot; _| Balderdash. Whether magick works or not depends on how much energy, emotion and intent you put into the magickal working.Page 6: &quot;Wicca is the witchcraft you hear the most about these days. It is a nature religion, I feel, believes it's the one true faith. I never met a ruder, more self-righteous bunch of people in my life.

Gardner. a blending of witchcraft, mental mysticism, and freemasonry.It is MY opinion that Ms. Morrison is not as enlightened as she believes herself to be; or she would not be so reactionary against people of another faith. Everyone must walk the path that is right for them.Page 6-7: &quot;I received many letters from Wiccans over the years and they are so ignorant that they do not even realize that the brand of witchcraft I write about is an ancient belief predating theirs. They think my witchcraft is phony and doesn't work. That I try to promote beliefs (which I don't) and that in general I have no right to be writing my books._| The author DOES have a point; but she did not need to be so harsh. Wicca only goes back to 1949 when Gerald B. Gardner went public. Many wiccans are introduced to the one size fits all vision of witchcraft espoused by Silver Raven Wolf, and many other Wiccan authors today, and they are POORLY trained in how magick really works. It is NOT in the spell. The magick is in YOU; How much emotion, energy, and intent are you willing to put into the magickal working?Page 7: &quot;I learned this pool game trick from a Kahuna in Hawaii who taught me to concentrate mt powers. After practicing concentration for a while, I killed a bee by concentrating on it. I willed it to die, and it did.&quot; _| The author is telling the truth about the power of magic. However; the Kahuna should have taught her the one HUNA commandment. To willfuly kill one of the Great Spirits creations for no reason is evil.Page 24 lists a spell that I will quote part of.&quot;Bring the man to the woman,O Amakua of the forests andthe oceans and the skies.&quot;I have studied MANY mystical traditions (HUNA is only one of them); but throughout this book the author continually misspells the Hawaiian name for this guardian spirit. The correct spelling is 'Aumakua, and is pronounced (Owmakooa).I would sincerely recommend that you allow this book to collect dust on the bookshelf.If you choose to follow this book; then do so at your own peril; because I can do nothing more than try to warn you.Aloha nui loa: Two Bears"},{"Title":"The Modern Witch's Guide To Magic And Spells: A Remarkable Collection of Over 100 Spells to Entice a Lover, Win Back One Who Strays, Protect Your ...

The book reads quickly and does a good job of immersing the reader in an interesting universe without excessive buildup. One interesting touch is that the flawed hero is REALLY flawed, almost to the point that the reader would rather &quot;be&quot; someone else. I'm not a physicist so I can't really comment on the physics, though from a laymans perspective most of it seems believable in context. Echos Of Earth is short on biology and heavy on AI and technology. The biology extends only to say that cyanobacteria inhabit many planets and brief mention of the resemblance of some alien races to earth animals. With a decent plot and some interesting twists, you'll probably enjoy it like I did."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"For me, this book recaptures what I particularly enjoy about Science Fiction; lots of mind expanding ideas set in the near future as humanity begins to explore our galaxy. The authors cleverly extrapolate from several key ideas; the use of software agents (engrams) capturing the essential abilities of appropriately skilled personnel to make galactic exploration practical, first contact with a vastly superior alien race, via gifts that encourage development, Artificial Intelligence exceeding human intelligence and leading to \\"The Spike\\", a dramatic crash in human development and its subsequent renormalisation in the new environment and finally, the risk of species extermination by malevolent, unapproachable aliens.These ideas have been cleverly presented in an evenly paced, entertaining story, told through the viewpoint of the embodied engram, Peter Alander, who struggles to overcome his own flaws while interacting with his old shipmates, the alien gifts, and an enhanced embodied version of his survey manager crew-mate when he returns to the solar system. I found it somewhat distracting having to wait for \\"The Spike\\" and the political background in the solar system to be explained as the story focus relocates there, but perhaps this was a deliberate ploy by the authors to communicate some of what Peter would have experienced.Nice to see the story supported by interesting appendices, including background on the use of the 'Adjusted Planck Standard International Units'. I'm not sure if the latter helps or distracts from the story, but full marks to the authors for bravely including them."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"_Echoes of Earth_ by Sean Williams and Shane Dix in the opening pages introduces us to the character Peter Alander, a member of the deep space survey ship _Frank Tipler_. Launched in the year 2050 and traveling at 80% the speed of light, the _Tipler_ carried Alander and the rest of his crew 72 light years from Earth to the star Upsilon Aquarius. They were sent there to survey the third planet in the system, a planet named Adrasteia, one that was known to be the source of oxygen and water spectra detected by interferometers in the Sol system. The _Tipler_ was one of a thousand other similar survey ships launched as part of the United Near-Earth Stellar Survey Program (UNESSPRO) in a great wave of exploration.In a real twist Alander is not human. Nor is anyone else on the _Tipler_. Or at least, not completely human. Alander, mission leader Caryl Hatzis, and the dozens of other specialists on the _Tipler_ are engrams, electronic simulations of actual people, people that were chosen in the 2040s to have their thought processes copied and molded into a highly complex simulations, ones that could perform - hopefully - just as well as their originals could. Carefully modeled to experience such hormonally influenced traits as desire, hunger, and fatigue, they nevertheless were much better suited to the rigors of interstellar travel. Not only weighing virtually nothing (as it is extremely expensive to accelerate anything to near light speeds), they are much better suited to survive the nearly one hundred year trip to Upsilon Aquarius, able to adjust their internal clocks or even shut themselves off to avoid consumption of resources and to avoid boredom. Once at the planet they generally stayed purely electronic, interacting in a virtual ship-wide environment called ConSense, though they can elect if resources permit to grow and inhabit partially biological androids. In the case of the _Tipler_ mission Alander was the only individual to inhabit such a body, though this was done in large part to keep his engram from breaking down, as he was in danger of merging with and losing his distinctiveness within ConSense due to an apparent flaw in his pattern.At first the survey looked routine, as while Adrasteia had life, there wasn't much of it; just simple cyanobacteria analogues surviving in the clouds thanks to the planet's bizarre climate. Things did not stay that way for long. After some unusual energy discharges near Adrasteia, strange, perhaps alien objects appear in orbit around the planet. Quickly dubbed Spinners by the crew, they within less than a day construct ten orbital towers around the planet's equator, towering structures that reach from the planet's surface up into space, connected by a vast ring. Ignoring all hails from the _Tipler_, there is only one apparent means of interaction; what looks to be an elevator of sorts in the base of one of the towers. Against the wishes and at first without the knowledge of Hatzis and the others, Alander steals a shuttle and flies to that tower and takes the lift. Once inside, he finds that the towers were indeed built by an alien intelligence, a race that is vastly superior technologically to the one the engrams came from. Greeting Alander is a highly complex artificial intelligence that they dub the Gifts, for they inform Alander that they are in fact a gift from this race, the Spinners. Refusing to answer any questions about the Spinners themselves - claiming that they do not possess such knowledge - the inform Alander that he has been specially selected to act an emissary to those on the _Tipler_, that the Gifts will speak to him and him alone, guiding him to the various treasures in the towers.For purposes of the story the two most significant of the various gifts are faster-than-light communication, and a small faster-than-light ship that the Gifts tell Alander is called a hole ship. Using the communicator, they send a message to Earth. They receive no reply. The _Tipler_ had lost contact with Earth during the flight to Upsilon Aquarius but felt it was possibly due to any of a number of reasons, including time lag. After some discussion and a near disastrous crisis, Alander decides to pilot the hole ship back to the Sol system (being the only one that the Gifts will allow to do so).What he finds upon his return astounds him. Though he thought he was prepared to have found humanity to have vastly advanced during the hundred years he had been gone, Alander was shocked. Venus and Earth were missing, and there was a vast structure in its place instead, the start of a Dyson sphere. Artificial intelligences, having become self-aware after the _Tipler_ left, nearly wiped out humanity, with only 3 million still alive, many of those not entirely biological any more. Alander, ignorant of current Sol politics, tries to contact whatever successor exists to UNESSPRO. Instead he comes to the attention of the Vincula, a group mind of sorts that rules the system now, one that attempts to use Caryl Hatzis, the sole surviving engram contributor, to gain control of Alander and gain access to the Gifts.Alander's arrival touched off a conflict within the system, the Vincula viewing his apparently faster-than-light ship as extremely valuable while the few remaining individualists were not keen to let the Vincula control the technology, the latter trying to oppose the Vincula. Though that seems bad enough at first, a far, far worse conflict occurs. Humanity learns the terrible, awful consequences that result from the use of the Gifts, not one coming from the Spinners, but from some other, darker alien menace.According to the Gifts, \\"There are civilizations who take delight in the destruction of others.\\"And thus begins a trilogy. Things look extremely bleak at the end, but there is a ray of hope. I found it very well written and highly engaging and look forward to other books in the series."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"I hesitate to say that I enjoyed this book, as there isn't much joy to be found in the story. However, I was sufficiently engaged in the story to keep reading the book and I cared about the characters enough to worry about what might happen to them.I think the fundamental reason that I gave this book 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is that the authors and I simply don't think in the same way. Many times in the book, the authors spent several pages on things that seemed less interesting to me while passing over things that I found fascinating with little comment. In addition, the authors make use of the technique of dropping the readers into the middle of things and leaving them to sort out what is going on as the story unfolds. While this is a valid literary technique, it happens to be one that I don't typically enjoy.I'm not sure that I would recommend this book to a friend, but what I would do is highly recommend it to all the Sci-Fi book discussion groups out there. After I finished Echoes of Earth, the first thing I wanted to do was sit down with a book group, have a long discussion on the nature of humanity and the definition of life, and toss around words like &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;corporeal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"This novel begins with a man taking a bath for his first time in about one hundred years, and zips on from there. It is the mid 22nd century and survey ships from earth are arriving at distant stars after very long voyages. The crews consist of engrams which are electronic personalities, copies of real people's minds, sent out to explore distant reaches of space. One ship, the Frank Tipler, was sent to a planet orbiting the star Upsilon Aquarium, over 72 light years from earth. Nanotech can manufacture bodies so the engrams can inhabit them, to work and explore the planet's surface, etc. For the most part the engrams remain aboard ship as cyberspace beings, the real ship only a few meters across, mostly just a computer with few moving parts, cool! Simulated living quarters and bridge create a liveable environment for them, the engrams can even slow or speed up their perception of time as they see a need for, with their internal clocks, so a flight to the stars taking decades may seem to take only a few days to them. All this is really nothing original, these authors, Sean Williams and Shane Dix, use these concepts cleverly in a well written novel. This is the way we will likely explore the stars someday, take human minds as engrams aboard small compact starships, with a mature nanotechnology able to manifest the humans (and any supplies needed) at the destination, using local materials.As with a lot of good science fiction lately, the identity question is given good treatment here: should a person be considered the original, or a copy, as that person's consciousness is tranferred into various formats. Also in this novel the authors feature an alien first contact that is very believable, that is rare and difficult to do, well done here. My only criticism of this book is how a &quot;Spike&quot; (a period of very rapid technological advancement which overturns nearly everything that existed prior...if you don't know) is presented, I feel it was overdone, my opinion.For me this was a great adventure in the hard science fiction tradition, great plot and character development, Dix and Williams are adept at illustrating our oftentimes fragile relationships with each other, brilliantly executed, a page turner and one of the best sci-fi you are likely to find. The authors in my view have left room for a sequel."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"Wow! What imagry! After reading this book I'm now very picky on others that I read. The pictures, situations, planets, travel... everything seemed to flow exactly with each other. I'll tell you this... don't stop reading untill the ending. Even after the climax keep reading, it'll give you insights on the sequal (in which there HAS to be one) plus things that will make you think for days.Hey, I liked this book so much I read it four times. I scan the book stand every time for it's sequal."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"I bought Echoes of Earth on the strength of the Evergence series. Based on William's and Dix's previous work, I was somewhat disappointed by this book. A lot of science-fiction falls into the trap of being about ideas and science, and forgetting the vital elements of plot and character. I was certainly intrigued by the plot of Echoes of Earth - humanity (if you want to call it that) discovers alien intelligence and then discovers very quickly that being contacted by the unknown can have catastrophic results - but character is where this book fell down, for me. The Evergence Trilogy had interesting and likeable characters such as Morgan Roche, Uri Kajic, et al.; but Peter Alander and Caryl have so far failed to appeal to me in the same way. Caryl, in particular, (the \\"real\\" one, that is) is downright unpleasant so far. The tone of the book is somewhat flat. For example, the way Peter misses Lucia and the \\"death\\" of Cleo Samson should have engaged the emotions and had more impact than they did. I like a sense of wonder in my science-fiction, not the feeling that this is all ho-hum. It did seem to me that Williams and Dix skated over all the technological marvels they wrote about, especially in Sol system, rather than emphasising how astonishing it was. Some of the action in Sol system was pretty hard to understand, too. Without citing particular references, Echoes of Earth is somewhat derivative on a number of its plot points. That was true of Evergence as well, but the authors specifically acknowledged that, and it's not something I mind in the slightest if what you do with your borrowing is fresh enough. But it wasn't fresh enough in Echoes of Earth.Will I read the sequels to this book? I will - because on the authors' past performance, I can hope that the Orphans of Earth series will get better, and I'm certainly interested enough to want to know what happens next. There were signs of some potential improvement at the very end. But more appealing characters and a greater sense of excitment and wonder would certainly improve things."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"How did this book get published?Alright, let me be fair as I can be ... the writing (use of language, forms, syntax) was good if not great, but the story in general sucked.The future, near future - only a couple/few decades away - contains some serious technological advances, but the people in whom the general populace should/would/could entrust their hopes and dreams are apparently a bunch of egocentric jerks. Humanity achieves access to the stars by not sending real people in their slower than light craft, but by creating artificial humans called engrams, which are basically just recordings of individual humans running as programs in a super computer. The problem I see is that most if not all of these \\"engrams\\" are brutally stupid or selfish beyond the norm ... if you were running a very expensive long term space program which relied heavily on the people involved, wouldn't you select participants based on some seriously in-depth understanding of the personalities available?Okay, I'll take the proverbial grain of salt and try to see what I'm missing ... sorry, just doesn't compute.The story is a tragedy in the Grecian sense (i.e., unpleasant ending or downbeat story overall [versus comedy which simply means 'happy ending']), which is dreary enough, but the worst part is that there are absolutely no sympathetic characters in the entire novel unless you find stupid and willfully ignorant people to be endearing.Beyond the characters that I couldn't find any rapor for, the story itself was simply boring through most of the book, and felt enormously contrived and shallow by the end. The story pretty much ends with a trivial and meaningless whimper ... I don't know, but seriously doubt, that there could be a sequel ... there's just no 'bang' for your buck here.My final recommendation: don't bother unless you've already read everything else that's available to you."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"A engram crew of a survey ship runs into an alien race that likes to leave gifts.

Was the survey ship just at the right place at the right time, or is there something more happening?This is a hard science fiction adventure, a first contact novel and a dangerous mystery all in one. Can Peter Alander figure out what to do?

These are Science Fiction rather than Science Fantasy novels. A lot of thought has gone into the science behind this story of a sudden gift of alien advanced technology and the destruction of earth and humanity as we know it.I have to say that I found this book slow going, especially in the early chapters. I wasn't expecting a novel that was so heavily science based. In the end I found this a well written story, with some very clever technological ideas, but at the same time a rather depressing book about a possible future for earth. We see our home destroyed in more ways than one and not just by aliens.If you are after a real SF novel with well thought out science to back up an apocalyptic story then this book is for you - but I'm not sure its really my favourite type of story"},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"I have been reading Science Fiction for 45 years and this is one of the best hard Science Fiction novels I have ever read. It is also one of the most depressing. I won't spoil it for you by telling you why except to say that you may look differently at your computer and at technological research after you finish the book."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"This is the first volume in a series? Trilogy? I dunno. I can say that at least two more books follow it.So once again, it's the future: 2165 or around about that. It appears that by 2050, Earth had become all peaceable and stuff and also monstrously prosperous, thanks to technology. So everyone became real keen on exploring space. 'Cept that it would be really expensive and not terribly feasible to send human crews blasting around for hundreds of years to reach our nearest neighbors. So engram crews were sent instead: super-complex software recreations of actual people, or bodiless clones, if you will. This meant that the ships just basically had to be flying computers with some nanofacturing capabilities to build stuff at the destination. Also the engrams could basically ride along in stand-by mode, more or less sleeping, so as to not, you know, flip out through the sheer boredom of the long voyage.Well, at this here one distant destination, many light years away, and a hundred years after launch time, one engram does wig out over the basic disconnect over &quot;my memories tell me I am Peter but really I know I am a computer program in a VR environment&quot;. So his crew dumps him in an android body on the planet's surface and tells him to just kind of putter about at the base camp there and stay out of their way. They get no transmissions from Earth, so obviously something happened during the trip and the home planet cannot or will not talk to them (although of course any real-time communications would be out of the question due to the years-long time lag).A coupla years later, the engrams are just minding their business and building robo-facilities and exploring and stuff, when, within a day, a bunch of linked orbital towers get connected via space elevator to the surface. Who built these, and how and why, are mysteries. Pete the engram/android flies over to the base of one of the tower-things and gets a free ride up to the spindle attached above, way up in orbit. Then a pack of alien AIs go all, &quot;I am for you, Peter&quot; and tell him, yeah, some benevolent super-aliens just did a quick fly-by and built this whole complex installation with some of their Model T-level technology, 'cuz they're all hyper-advanced but they like to throw a few crumbs at the more primitive species they encounter, to help 'em bootstrap their way up. And oh, yeah, the alien AIs will only talk to and obey Peter and no one else in the crew.So the novel goes from there. Who are these aliens? What do they want? Are they good? Are they bad? Should the engrammites use all of the kewl toys the aliens have given them? And what has become of Earth in the meantime?This is a tale on yer epic Clarkean scale with a bit of Vernor Vinge thrown in. Huge revelations are...um...revealed. And action takes place on literally a stellar level. Lots of big ideas get thrown around. (The authors are a little too proud of their use of the revised Planckian measurement system, but it shows how seriously they take some of their scientific gimcrackery.)It's pretty good and definitely bold. Zesty, with a big finish and a slightly nutty aftertaste. I enjoyed it, and my cat Mr. Hate gives it his highest recommendation of &quot;I would sleep on top of that book&quot;."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"Echoes of Earth is the first novel in a new series. It is the story of the destruction of civilization in the Solar System and the discovery of aliens with greatly superior technology, combining elements of Allen's Ring of Charon, Vinge's Marooned in Real Time, Williamson's Manseed and Pohl's Heechee series.In 2050, Earth begins to send out 1000 exploration ships containing engrams, cybernetic personality simulations, rather than actual humans. All the engram crews are based on only 60 personalities. One of these engrams, based on Peter Stanmore Alander, is particularly unstable, but all break down within a few decades.The engram ship Frank Tipler has the mission to Upsilon Aquarius. In 2160, the ship reaches its target and the engram crew begins their mission to study the solar system. They had lost communications with Earth shortly after they left, but are confident that Earth will contact them later. Alien ships suddenly enter the UA system and build 10 orbital towers -- beanstalks -- and an interconnecting ring in only a few hours as the engrams watch. Peter Alander, who has been permanently assigned an android body to slow down his personality deterioration, enters an alien device at the bottom of one tower and is carried up to orbit. There he encounters the Gifts, 11 artificial intelligences who control the advanced technology provided by the aliens as gifts to the less advanced humans. Among these gifts are devices to communicate and travel faster than light.The Gifts are programmed to obey only one person -- Peter Alander -- among the crew; the aliens, who the engrams call Spinners, apparently want the Gift recipients to absorb the new technology slowly to reduce cultural shock. However, the other engrams can operate the alien technology after learning the control interface protocols. Since the other engrams are running on the computers within the Frank Tipler and controlling drones remotely, Peter is the only engram that can operate the FTL ship at this time. After secret programming in one of the engrams almost destroys the mission, Peter takes the FTL ship back to Earth to ensure that information on the Spinner technology is not lost.The Solar System has changed drastically since the Frank Tipler left. The artificial intelligences have reached self-awareness and followed their own agenda, destroying the Earth and Venus to build the beginning of a Dyson sphere around the sun. The eruption of AI has almost wiped out the biological intelligences and only about 3 million are left. The surviving humans have incorporated cybernetic technology to form personality gestalts with multiple points of view. All these intelligences are joined to some extent into the Vincula, a sort of group mind, but some resist the conservatism of that body. One of the human gestalts is based on Caryl Hatzis, one of the engram contributors. When Alander arrives in the Solar System, he tries to contact the proper authorities, but finds that only Hatzis has survived. The Vincula tries to take the FTL ship away from him to suppress the technology, but he escapes back to UA with the original Hatzis.This story contains little new in plot or concepts, but the level of detail makes it more immediate. It grabs your attention like a good widescreen movie. Recommended for Williams and Dix fans and anyone who enjoys the interstellar adventures of Roger MacBride Allen, Vernor Vinge, Jack Williamson and Frederik Pohl."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"Many different possible story lines in this one.This book could have been exploded into several novels just to get to the point where the story picks up.1. How the Earth and civilization changed during the 100 years the scouting team took to reach the star system.2. How the scouting team developed its social and physical interactions.3. More details on the gifts of the aliens.Now if you don't like to dig facts out, this is probably not your book. Many aspects will keep you puzzeled until they are finaly revealed in the story line. I happened to like this but you may not. I would definitely say that there are more books coming out to make this into a trilogy because there are still some major questions left unanswered at the end of the book.And uh, pay no attention the side plot that resembles a famous science fiction movie produced by Stanley Kubrick.Overall, I liked it very much and I especially like the up-to-date, hard science that was put into the story. And yes, the hero-protaganist is a flawed, passive-agressive person. But it's done well. Buy it! Especially if you like hard science fiction."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I found this book hard to really like. It has some good elements: the aliens are intriguing and so is the technology, both human and alien. The premise of humans exploring beyond the solar system, encountering technologically superior aliens, and dealing with the consequences of such an encounter all appealed to me. Nor can I complain about the pace of the book. Events moved along and there was enough action to keep me involved. On the other hand, the story always had something of a cold, impersonal feel for me. I found it impossible to really care about the principal characters, most of whom are computer &quot;engrams&quot; (i.e. programmed personalities based on real people who remained back on Earth). These engrams run the starships while &quot;inhabiting&quot; a virtual environment within the starship computers. A &quot;dead&quot; engram is just a deleted program when all is said and done, and I just couldn't get emotionally involved with that. Further, what is done to humanity and to Earth, both by aliens and by ourselves and our own technology, felt both far-fetched and improbably grim to me.I read this book all the way through but, while it was interesting, I can't say that I liked it very much by the time I got to the end. Intellectually stimulating perhaps, but not emotionally satisfying. Some readers will like it a lot, I'm sure, but I had a very mixed reaction to it. At this point, I'm not sure if I will read the next book in this series or not. I can't give ECHOES OF EARTH a strong recommendation. Proceed at your own risk."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"I've been reading science fiction for 25 years, and these days it's rare for me to encounter something that evokes the same wonder and excitement I felt the first time I read Ringworld or the Foundation Trilogy. Echoes of Earth is just such a novel.This book held my attention from cover to cover, starting with the mystery of an alien race that bestows wonderous technological gifts to the first human interstellar explorers, and continuing with the frightening and awe-inspiring discovery by the explorers of just why Earth fell silent 100 years earlier. The conclusion of this book is the most surprising of all, but I will say nothing of that here, save that Williams and Dix take their storyline to an extreme that few authors would dare.One of the most gratifying things about Echoes of Earth is that the authors didn't just crank out a cookie cutter plot - there were plenty of unexpected surprises to keep me on my toes, and to lend a sense of freshness to the story. What's more, the choice of a damaged engram who is struggling to remain stable as the primary character adds another layer of interest to this novel. (An engram is a computer simulation of a human mind, based on the memories and personality of an actual person.)I can't really think of anything negative to say about this book. You should be forewarned, however, that when you get to the end you will immediately want to run out and purchase the next book in the series: Orphans of Earth.

Echoes of Earth though, is a solid bit of work in its own right! Unlike the Evergence trilogy, this book is thought provoking, and uses science to introduce mind-boggling ways fight. There is plenty of action in these books, but its more at the level of incredible cyberwars that we can only imagine in these books, but could (but hopefully not) happen in the future. Its an unbelievable vision.The climax is quite shocking and sends your mind reeling as you work out the repercussions. Tragically, Williams and Dix go on to write another chapter/epilogue that it has all the atmosphere of a damn squib fizzling out. They should have just wound everything up at the climax and reworked that final chapter as the opening to the next novel in the series (I am reassured that having &quot;Book 1&quot; plastered over it means there is more to come in this series!). In my youth, I would get angry and finish the series there, but such wonders as &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; have taught me not to diss a series based on the ending of the first book. So I shall hang in there and support the boys from Oz. But, you'd like to think Williams and Dix had enough experience and exposure between them to have not had such a rubbishy weak link leading into the next book..."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"After surging to bestseller status with the impressive Convergence series, Sean Williams and Shane Dix return with a hard science fiction adventure that spans the stars. Peter Alander is a shadow of his former self in more ways than one, in a future where multiple copies of explorers have ventured out to see the universe, leaving their human bodies far behind on Earth. But, it is on the far edge of the universe that Alander and his shipmates discover something that Earth must hear about immediately. Or must it?Williams and Dix never deliver anything less than heart-pounding action and excitement in there collaborations and ECHOES OF EARTH is no exception. It's a world we will barely recognise as our own, peopled with creatures that no longer resemble us in anything but the most superficial way. And that's the most stunning aspect of this new world of Williams and Dix's creation: the aliens encountered are scarely more inhuman than what awaits Alander on Earth.No one in the genre is delivering more vivid, more mind-boggling far-space adventure than these two Australian authors. If you haven't caught onto their work yet, ECHOES OF EARTH is a perfect place to start. Don't blame me if you find yourself scrambling to find all their previous work, that's just the way it is with these guys..."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"Having thourouhly enjoyed the Evergence series, I was thrilled to see another book by Dix and Williams. This book (hopefully the first in a series) is NOT a clone of their previous series. There is a different kind of action here, yet no less gripping in my opinion. I was drawn in within the first chapter and the book continued to fill my head with questions and provoked some interesting thoughts on some age old concepts involving our species. This book had a kind of &quot;Michael Crichton&quot; feel to it, a group of scientists trying to unravel a mysterious something. I intentionally am not putting any story details in my review, as that will be for each person to discover on thier own. I will say that just like Evergence, I had trouble putting the book down each night and am anxiously awaiting the next book. Dix and Williams have a knack for creating lush environments in which their interesting characters can interact.Keep em comin guys! You rock!"},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"This book isn't the best that I have ever read, or the deepest novel, idea wise (but it wasn't exactly shallow either) but it kept my interest all the way through and was hard to put down. I read the last 1/3 in one go. Which is saying a lot comming from me because lately I have had a hard time finishing books - I have picked up a lot of novels but lost interest 2/3 of the way through and left them unfinished. But the last 1/3 of this novel was interesting enough to keep me reading - and wanting to read, and even *enjoying* the read.Unfortunately - or not - this book is obviously part of a series (probably a trilogy)- as you will figure pretty quickly into the story (The &quot;Orphans Series&quot; as it is refered to in one part of the apendix - and that is the only place where it is acknowledged directly in the book that it *is* part of a series, but if you read it to the end it leaves many threads left hanging and many plot points unresolved) and you will have to wait for the next book, or books, in the series to find out how it all ends.Still, like the previous &quot;Evergence Series&quot; (by the same authors) it is interesting and engaging enough to make you *want* to come back for more. And the universe that the novel takes place in is a place that is large enough in scope and wonder that, while you may not want to actually live there, it's a fun place to visit.Not the greatest book every written, but better than most, anda very good read. I recomend it."},{"Title":"Echoes of Earth","review":"This book is full of half realized fantastical ideas that it doesn't back up at all.It pretty much loses its own thread and concentrates on some kind of existential crisis that the fake people in the bookshould have learned to live with before being sent on a long space mission.The technology is magical with no explanation at all.And the ending while impressive, is depressing and meaningless, leaving one with vast sense of dissatisfaction.This novel should have had an EDITOR who might have pushed the authors to work a little harder and back up their half formed concepts.Why would I want to read a trilogy, if they are all as tedious as this one ?"},{"Title":"Powering Apollo: James E. Webb of NASA (New Series in NASA History)","review":"A nice book about the second NASA administrator who able to guide NASA from the early days of the Mercury program to right up to the first journey to the moon (Apollo 8) when Webb was forced to leave as the Nixon Administration took over.The book is divided into two parts. The first third of the book describes Webb's early years including his employment with the State Department, the Bureau of the Budget and Republic Supply, a division of Kerr-McGee. The remainder of the book focuses on Webb's involvement in the development of the NASA management system and the problems he overcame to get Apollo to the Moon.In general, I found the book quite interesting. There are many descriptions of the personal battles he had to fight with contractors, the congress and his own top-level employees, how set up the NASA management system, his involvement with the academic world and in how upper management viewed various disasters and triumphs. The management system which he developed for the largest engineering and research effort mankind has ever undertaken, carried on well after he left NASA. For example, the Apollo 11 moon landing took place when it was suppose to even the there was a new Nixon appointed leader. This management system carried on well into the Space Shuttle and Space Station programs. I also found it refreshing that Jim Webb felt a sense of personal responsibility for the loss of the Apollo 1 crew. Compare that to the finger pointing associated with the Challenger explosion and the majority of today's politicians.After finishing the book, I came away with the feeling that Jim Webb was truly believed in the dream that mankind should explore space and made every effort to make this dream a reality."},{"Title":"Powering Apollo: James E. Webb of NASA (New Series in NASA History)","review":"What a great book and James Webb writes it so well. This is one of the first of the new history books about NASA and the history of NASA during Apollo. If it weren't for NASA, there would be no Apollo. But NASA at that time was not the huge organization it is now. This book takes a look at the formative years and of the tragedy of Apollo 1.I was one of the 450,000 people who worked on Apollo. It took an immense number of people, huge assembly and testing sites and 23,000 contractors and the biggest, most powerful rocket in the world, the Saturn V.I like what James Webb wrote. You might not agree but he and I were both there.\\"Something Funny Happened on the Way to the Moon.\\" by Sara Howard"},{"Title":"Powering Apollo: James E. Webb of NASA (New Series in NASA History)","review":"This is an excellent biography of James E. Webb (1906-1992), NASA administrator between 1961 and 1968, the critical period in which Project Apollo was underway. During his tenure NASA developed the modern techniques necessary to coordinate and direct the most unique and complex technological enterprise in human history, the sending of human beings to the Moon and bringing them safely back to the Earth.Political scientist W. Henry Lambright focuses here on the biography of a stellar public administrator. He finds that Webb, a North Carolinian with a thick southern accent that charmed all and helped to hide a steel trap mind, was well-prepared for guiding NASA during this critical era because of his place as a Federal government insider well-versed in the bobs and weaves, ins and outs of New Deal Washington and the highest echelons of the Democratic Party.Coming to Washington in 1932, Webb served as secretary to Representative Edward W. Pou of the 4th North Carolina District and Chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee until 1934. He then went to work in the law office of O. Max Gardner, attorney and former Governor of South Carolina, in Washington, D.C., between 1934 and 1936. He then moved to the private sector, eventually rising to vice president of the Sperry Gyroscope Company, before entering the U.S. Marine Corps in 1944. After World War II, Webb returned to Washington and served as Executive Assistant to Max Gardner, by then Under Secretary of the Treasury, before being named as Director of the Bureau of the Budget in the Executive Office of the President, a position he held until 1949. President Harry S Truman then asked Webb to serve as Under Secretary of State. When the Truman administration ended early in 1953, Webb left Washington for a position in the Kerr-McGee Oil Corp. in Oklahoma.James Webb returned to Washington on February 14, 1961, when he accepted the position of administrator of NASA. Webb's long experience in Washington paid handsomely during his years at NASA, where he lobbied for federal support for the space program and dealt with competing interests on Capitol Hill and in the White House. His career changed fundamentally after May 25, 1961, when President John F. Kennedy announced that the United States would commit itself to landing an American on the Moon before the end of the decade. For seven years after Kennedy's 1961 lunar landing announcement, through October 1968, James Webb politicked, coaxed, cajoled, and maneuvered for NASA in Washington. The longtime Washington insider proved a master at bureaucratic politics. In the end, through a variety of methods Administrator Webb built a seamless web of political liaisons that brought continued support for and resources to accomplish the Apollo Moon landing on the schedule Kennedy had announced. He left NASA in October 1968, just as Apollo was nearing a successful completion.All of this is detailed in Lambright's excellent book. Once reading it, everyone will understand the book's title, \\"Powering Apollo,\\" which Webb did with brilliant political leadership.Lambright deals extensively with the most difficult challenge faced by Webb, the Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967 that killed astronauts Gus Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee. As shock gripped the nation during the days that followed, Webb told the media, \\"We've always known that something like this was going to happen sooner or later....who would have thought that the first tragedy would be on the ground?\\"Webb took the brunt of public criticism for the accident, and went before various congressional committees and took a personal grilling every time. His answers were sometimes evasive and always defensive. The New York Times said that under Webb NASA stood for \\"Never a Straight Answer.\\" While the ordeal was personally taxing, whether by happenstance or design Webb deflected much of the backlash over the fire from both NASA as an agency and from the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. While he was personally tarred with the disaster, the space agency's image and popular support were largely undamaged. Webb himself never recovered from the stigma of the fire, Lambright notes, and when he left NASA in October 1968, even as Apollo was nearing a successful completion, few mourned his departure.In all, this is an outstanding administrative biography of Jim Webb, still by far NASA's most significant administrator, although some-Daniel S. Goldin and James M. Fletcher (when his two appointments are counted together)-have served longer. \\"Powering Apollo\\" is must reading for anyone seeking to understand the Apollo program."},{"Title":"Powering Apollo: James E.

Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin were Sociopaths who had the good fortune to obtain their dream: overthrow a nation against the will of the people and murder everyone, men, women, and children who didn't want to become insects without individuality, feelings, or soul; which is how communists envision people, not as individuals, but as mindless machines used to fulfill the party's goals, or get crushed. Read quotes from Trotsky and Bolshevik poets who dreamed of a day when humans would no longer need to think as individuals, but become a faceless mass of radios tuned to the same station waiting for a message from the party as to what to do that day. A reviewer below suggests for balance, read Trotsky! Gee, and while you're at it, read Hitler's apologist justifications why he just simply couldn't help himself, and just had to murder millions of Jews, Gypsies, Christians, for the Fatherland and the Party! What reeking hypocrisy! Bolsheviks, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung, communists are all Sociopathic, hypocritical monsters who spoke on a little more sophisticated level than Al Capone. But mobsters and bolshevisks were all cut from the same cloth. Be warned, it's not what is said, but what is done that speaks the truth. This is a wonderful book. Thank God we live in a time and a country when it could be published. Yet, no publisher in any part of the world would have printed this book in the 30s. Think about it."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"I reviewed this before but I notice Richard Pipes fans have found it neccessary to portray those against this book as &quot;Marxist-Leninists&quot; who let their &quot;bias&quot; get in the way of their fair judgement of the book. This is not true, and in reality the reason is because we've read other books that do more justice to history, pointing out the facts in most cases, pointing out the lack of them in some cases ( and in some claims! ;P ), and show why the Bolsheviks did things, why the Whites did things, and why certain things were neccessary without making a tyrant out of one side or the other. In other words, they present fair, accurate, honest history, not slanted history portrayed as supposed, unbiased &quot;truth&quot;. One is better off reading the works of Deutscher, which give one more understanding, before reading this somewhat biased book. An attempt to be fair by someone with a secret bias best describes this book, but the more informed will note certain facts are left out."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Pipes has written this account for one sole reason - certainly not to present a review or interpretation of the historry of the Bolshevik party and the Russian Revolution, but rather as an attempt to destroy Lenin and Bolshevism. While this one-sided attempt may be fine for some, it certainly does not help those readers who would actually like to make up their minds for themselves. But then again, can one possibly expect a right-wing historian who worked under the Reagan administration to give a fair account of the Russian Revolution? With that being said, Pipes is really no different then many leftist historians who attempt to glorify the USSR and the Revolution (Communist writers of the 30's and 40's come to mind). In my experience I have found that the book that carries the least biased account (of course, complete objectivity is impossible) of the Russian Revolution is E.H. Carr's History of the Bolshevik Revolution. If you are interested in the facts of the Revolution and not merely a book-long effort to demonize Lenin et al., then I suggest you pick up Carr's book."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Or perhaps &quot;pointed&quot; is a better word. At any rate it certainly is not presented as even a marginally disinterested history of the Russian Revolution. I should have paid a bit more attention to the back cover and introduction before the purchase where it hints at the authors point -- the Russian Revolution -- in fact the Marxist revolution -- was a failure and there's a good deal of context going into how and why the author believes this to be true.There are some wonderful tidbits along the way and the author's knowledge on the matter is not what's in question, but there are some portions that feel almost &quot;smug&quot; in the recounting of the events.Now the failure or success of the Marxist revolution is first not as simple of an issue as it is treated to be in this volume; it's simply not an addequate answer to such a prominant feature of the last century's history to say &quot;Marxism failed; capitalism won&quot;. I would have preferred that the author would have showed a bit more restraint on airing his own take on this broader issue and simply stuck to, well, &quot;a concise history of the Russian Revolution&quot;.Simply put -- if I had wanted to read an apology for the failure of communism with an emphasis on the Russian Revolution and history along the way this would have fit the bill. However if you're looking for something a bit &quot;drier&quot;, I'd suggest to keep looking. I gave it two stars for upsetting my expectations."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"I'm a history student in my fourth year honours(with my major in Russia) and this book was the text book for my fourth year honours class. It is a great book because Pipes gives a summary of his previous 3 books &quot;Russia Under the Old Regime&quot;, &quot;The Russian Revolution&quot; and &quot;Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime&quot;. It is the equivalent to buy 3 books in one. The novelty of the book is that if the reader is interested in reading a relative short book about Russian history, this is the best book for that. However if one is interested in further details, I recommend people to read any of the 3 books summarized here in details. Pipes proves with enough arguments the gangster character of Lenin and his ambition for power. As Pipes argues, 'power' was the only ideology of the Bolshevik Party. The first part of the book provides a good background of the origins of 'autocracy' in the Old Regime. The last chapter gives the reader details about other aspects of the Bolsheviks after they achieved power, including among others 'the chapter on culture'. The chapters 'The October Coup' (here Pipes proves with details that in October 1917 a coup d'&eacute;tat took place and not a revolution), 'The Red Terror' (proves that it was through killing nearly a million people that Bolsheviks stayed in power) and the chapter on Lenin are of course the worst nightmare for communists around the world. I one word I have to say that Pipes' books are the 'bible' of Russian history. My deepest admiration to Dr Pipes."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Dr. Pipes is one of the great scholars of Russia and the Soviet Union. He has written at length on the origin and events of the revolution that led to the founding of the USSR. Only someone with his deep knowledge of the material and his skill at writing could pull off such a brilliant telling of these important, and tragic, historical events in only 400 pages.The book is divided into three sections. The first is called &quot;The Agony of the Old Regime&quot; and provides a snapshot of the way Russia was governed and the lives of its citizens and peasants in 1900. It also discusses its experiments in constitutional government and the crisis of the First World War and the February Revolution.The second part is entitled &quot;The Bolsheviks Conquer Russia&quot; and tells us about Lenin, the October Coup, and the building of the terror state.Part three is called &quot;Russia under the Bolshevik Regime&quot; and discusses the Civil War, the building of the mechanisms to export communism and revolution to the rest of the world, the crisis of Lenin's stroke and the positioning for power by Stalin and then Lenin's death.

It proved to be an excellent choice.Don't let the word Concise in the title fool you. It is not concise in that it is short or brief. All the details are here to present a well fleshed out picture of the tumultuous events of 1917.The necessary background of Nicholas II and Alexandra is presented. The moves of Lenin and his supporting cast are provided in detail. One also learns that the foundations murderous regime of Stalin were all put into place and utilized by Lenin himself.The book ends with Lenin's death, and provides a glimple into Stalin and how he came to succeed Lenin.Pipe's work is a very worthwhile work. For reading only one book on this subject, I have yet to have come across one that would better replace it."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This book has a strong advantage and a disadvantage.The advantage is that it is written by an expert in the field, Richard Pipes, who spent most of his life researching and writing about Russian history. The man is an outstanding historian.In addition, the book is written based on never before seen archive files from the Soviet Union archives which were made available only since 1991, the year the regime collapsed. When it comes to the Russian Revolution, pre-1991 books are outdated, while Pipes' book is fresh, well-researched and reliable.The disadvantage is that the author is, as other people noted, biased. He hates Bolshevism and Communism, which is something that the reader will come to realise pretty soon in the book. However, I do not find this as a particular issue. Pipes is still a recognised expert, and there is a clear distinction between opinion and fact when you read his book.The reactions of people against the historian's opinions, I believe, is rooted more in the intolerance of people sympathetic to communist ideas to accept the finally relieved reality of the regime that was once called the \\"worker's paradise\\", rather than a real problem concerning the history Pipes writes. After all, I do not expect to find many historians sympathetic to the Bolsheviks, as I do not expect to find many historians sympathetic to the Nazis.A Concise History of the Russian Revolution is an outstanding summary of the events that changed the world, and I would suggest it to anyone interested in the Russian Revolution.But if you are really concerned about the supposed bias of the writer, I would advice \\"A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924\\", a longer and more detailed work by Orlando Figes, based again on the newly-discovered Soviet Archives."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This book is an abridged version of two much longer books Pipes has written (RUSSIA UNDER THE OLD REGIME and RUSSIA UNDER THE BOLSHEVIK REGIME). And it feels abridged. On many topics, I wanted more details, and there was a lack of endnotes. However, the details and VERY extensive endnotes are found in the extended volumes. It was written in a very matter-of-fact manner, without much narrative flair.Which is why I find it suprising how I was nearly moved to tears on more than one occasion. This has to be one of the saddest stories in history. How one of the largest nations on Earth could be subjegated by a pack of dillusional intellectuals and then terrorized by the most brutal regime the world has ever seen should scare us all.Pipes's longer book (of which this is the abridged version) is one of many recent histories, including Service's LENIN, and many Russian language histories, to utilize the many Soviet documents made available since the collapse of the USSR. An examination of the primary historical record only makes the Bolsheviks look worse than we thought.This should be a must read for all. That there are still Communists and fellow-travellers out there with all we have recently learned of the Soviet regime is a stunning indictment of the failure of our educational system."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This book is Richard Pipes own consolidation and abridgement of his two masterworks, \\"Russian Revolution\\" (1990) and \\"Russia under the Bolshevik Regime\\" (1994).

It also has 76 photos and five maps. Although it is a work of impeccable scholarship, it is also highly readable and accessible to the average reader.Pipes is a virtuoso historian and perhaps the greatest chronicler of Russian history of all time. If you decide to read this history, you will learn a great deal about the most important event of the 20th Century (which spanned the two World Wars), and certainly the greatest experiment in utopian social engineering ever. In the process you will gain an extensive knowledge about the greatest foe the United States faced in the last Century, and how that foe came to its defeat.Pipes concludes that \\"the Russian Revolution appears as the unfolding of a tragedy in which events follow with inexorable force from the mentality and character of the protagonists.\\" And his lifetime of study of these events has left him \\"...less sanguine about humanity's capacity to change itself.\\"Recommended companion read: Aleksander Zolzhenitsyn's \\"The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956,\\" HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2002.

This latest \\"concise\\" volume serves to confirm the views he has previously expressed, including a long list of things that anger him (indeed, he quotes Aristotle: \\"Those who are not angry at those things they should be angry at are deemed fools.\\") Pipes' list includes: the Englightenment; intellectuals (in general), Russians (in general), Russian intellectuals (in particular), Bolsheviks, Lenin, etc. He argues that the revolutions of 1917 had little to do with political oppression or social conditions (causes the vast majority of Russian historians acknowledge). Rather Pipes argues that the revolutions resulted directly from the intransigence of the intelligentsia, who believed that every problem - no matter how trivial - reflected the need to overthrow the entire political/social order. Indeed, he argues that ALL rebellions are conservative in nature (based on people looking to restore traditional rights), but that middle-class intellectuals turn rebellions into revolutions by ignoring the desires of the masses and instead insisting on changing the entire social/political structure without securing a popular mandate. They do this, he insists, because they are imbued with the \\"erroneous doctrine of the Enlightenment\\" that man is a product of his social environment, which can be altered to produce a \\"new man.\\" The demise of the USSR in 1991 should \\"be interpreted as conclusive proof that utopianism inevitably leads to its very opposite.\\" All of this makes for a provocative polemic, but certainly does not qualify as a careful, balanced, nuanced history of the Russian revolutions.

A finely written history book, it manages to cram in a topical description of every major happening (and some not so major) during the aforementioned time frame as well as provide a solid foundation upon which to delve deeper into the subject matter. Pipes, a Harvard professor as well as an ex-National Security Advisor for Reagan on Soviet and Eastern European affairs (but don't let this fact dissuade you from reading the book) writes thought-provoking and informative prose with a well-tuned eye for context. The only turn-off is his constant reminders of just how awful the Bolsheviks were, finishing the book with a short diatribe supporting subjective reporting of history (which might be better wrestled with in a different book entirely).

As someone previously uninformed about the events described, it was helpful that Pipes did not assume an informed viewer and described the simple terms and concepts before he elaborated any further. Information is presented in an interesting form, providing information not only about the events but also the people behind the events. The pictures throughout are also useful in attatching a name to the many faces described, which results in the history being more personal, and thus more 'real', to the reader. My only complaint was that I found the last two chapters slightly hard to get through.

Based on my readings of other sources and the indisputable facts, Pipes presents very accurate and fair descriptions and analyses. Some reviewers who are critical of Pipes are guilty of bias themselves in favor of Marxist/Leninist ideology. Pipes provides fascinating biographical summaries and narratives of events."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"There are boring books about history, but there is no boring history, according to Richard Pipes. I understand him to believe that what happens matters; that life is significant. (Something many modern historians seem none too sure about.) History carries meaning and its dynamism affects us in the present and on the other side of the world. With this level of respect and sensitivity he approaches his subject. And so this book--albeit of a difficult subject matter--is a pleasure to read.Pipe's approach helps the reader to stay open to discoveries and insights about what may be considered the \\"Red Elephant\\" in the room. The \\"Red Elephant\\" is a topic we can no longer avoid and yet still hope to progress in the worldview often simply called \\"modernity.\\" Even though the proper care and role of capitalism is highly contested in our day, denial of the deeper realizations to be gleaned from this socialist experiment is not an option.Pipes emphasizes the uniqueness of Russia throughout his study. Only by deeply and thoroughly understanding Russia can we truly weigh the behavior of the Revolution's actors, or should I say bullies and beasts. That this history is ugly and deeply disturbing is an understatement.To understand the uniqueness of the Russian monarch, the Tsar, necessitates understanding the uniqueness of the Russian peasants. This is the central duality that the Bolsheviks had to contend with. Neither fit into Marx's Hegelian critique, the central player of which was supposed to be the proletariat--only 1% of the population, and only a tiny percentage of this 1% were ever central players.Pipes challenges the conventional view adopted uncritically from the Enlightenment of the \\"oppressed\\" peasants who simply need to be freed from monarch, church, and all other authorities, and modernism will triumph. Actually the main problem for the peasants was they were in their own world, isolated from education and technology and were a law and society onto themselves, with no real political or national awareness.Surprisingly, peasants \\"owned\\" 9/10 of the arable land--but communally, not individually. They believed that all the rest of the land was their due from God, and, through the Tsar, soon to be totally theirs--revolution or not. A humorous note: the peasants looked down on city dwellers and men without beards.Everyone seemed to be terrified of the peasants partly because they were 80 percent of the population and were taxed but barely communicated with or even acknowledged. They often rebelled, and are described as Hobbesian anarchist--without respect for law; yet they often responded with an attitude of fatalism--understandably so since edicts would drop down on them out of nowhere. (This did not change with the Revolution.)The peasants were the wild card for the Revolutionaries. Everyone wished they would just go away; they didn't fit the formula. Whether they were destined for the Gulag or not very much depended on where they lived. Those in the wealthier bread-basket areas could and would be considered by the Bolsheviks petty bourgeoisie or kulaks, peasants with some ownership interests, capitalists, hence \\"enemies of the people\\"--believe it or not. Their socialistic traditions of always breaking up the land and sharing equally in everything kept anyone from really developing a strong system of agriculture for even one generation. (Orlando Figes' book, \\"A People's Tragedy,\\" fleshes out peasant life with numerous fascinating examples, and I highly recommend it.)The Bolsheviks would not be stopped merely by reality, but rather forced reality into their Marxist critique or changed the critique as they took control. Pipes seems to give Marx more of a pass than I would, in terms of responsibility for crazy thinking masquerading as scientific reason.A belief in history as inexorable was at the heart of the Marxist-Leninism ideology. In his chapter \\"Spiritual Life,\\" Pipes describes this belief as a primitive faith rooted in much deeper layers of human psychology than the relatively recent traditions and beliefs the Bolsheviks sought, in the name of modernity, to utterly eradicate. In seeking to deny and escape faith, the Revolutionaries became a fanatical example of what they hated.Though I cannot agree with the author's conservation politics and economics--conclusions he may have drawn from his studies--nevertheless, his writing should be challenged only on its truth and rigor: He leaves you plenty of room to draw your own conclusions.Dr. Pipes seems to apologize for his emotional responses and judgments--highly educated as they obviously are. But I think he simply is not willing to check his humanity at the door when seeking to understand and interpret a subject that is central to the health and development of modern thought. He is leading the way not just to an educated scientific understanding of the events of the Russian Revolution, but to a wise and deeply human one."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Pipes' history book is a well formatted and interesting look at this period of Russian history.A great tool for professors that are trying to find something that will hold the attention of students without sacrificing the needed information in the Russian Revolutionary period.This period of Russian history (as with most periods) is full of many confusing names, complex patterns and social happenings.

Don't read this book; Read Trotsky's history of the Russian Revolution, and I've found E.H.Carr's book to be good as well. This is too biased."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"It is the single best introduction to the Russian Revolution. A great read and very informative."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"I enjoyed Pipes' extensive knowledge on the subject of the Russian Revolution. However, I did not have to read very far to see how absolutely biased this book is. For example, Pipes talks about how disconnected and corrupt the Tsarist government had become before the revolution. But Pipes is not concerned with the abuses of a totalitarian Tsarist government. Pipes passes over this corruption with barely a glance. Yet, Pipes, in the very next section of the book, proceeds with a full scale denunciation of \\"intellectuals\\" who try to influence politics. For Pipes, \\"intellectuals\\" are silly people who don't understand the world and cause problems. Listen to this blanket statement about all \\"intellectuals\\" involved in politics: \\"And, of course, involvement in politics makes them politicians, and, like others of the breed, prone to pursue their private interests in the guise of working for the common good.\\" Need I say more? He refers to intellectuals as a \\"breed.\\" Do you mean sub-human Mr. Pipes? The authors distaste for intellectuals is a hallmark of conservative politics. Mr. Pipes even goes beyond 20th century intellectuals in an attempt to discredit some of the most brilliant minds of The Enlightenment. I am not a socialist; however, Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky, wanted a better world for their fellow man than what capitalism could offer. Of course, Communism does not work. Communism was an epic failure and Stalin was a historic tragedy. Therefore, the world is stuck with the horror of capitalism. Marx and Lenin wanted something better but unwittingly they started down a road that led to even worse suffering. The contradiction between good intentions and horrific outcomes is what makes the Russian revolution such an interesting development in history. This is why people are so fascinated by this tragedy. Mr. Pipes has extensive knowledge of the Russian Revolution; too bad he ruins his history by looking at these events through darkly tinted partisan shades."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Richard Pipes falsifies the history of the Russian Revolution. He does it in a \\"brilliant\\" and totally stupid manner for one simple reason: he is blinded by his own primitive ideology .His primitive ideology could be resumed in this simple idea: the movement of History is possible without violence at the conditions that the Democracy principals are respected.Revolutions are bad, peaceful democratic movements with fair elections ( of course meaning principally USA during this period) are great. Discussions between oppositions are better than civil wars. The majority of the people want peace and stability - consequently the democratic elections will always support conservatism political movements.Strange ways to forget the lessons taught by Machiavelli.Strange ways to forget that none of our \\"Western\\" democracies has been built without civil wars inside and wars outside. They are sustainable democracies only through violences of all sorts.Richard Pipes's ideology is well to be resumed by his title : adviser of Ronald Reagan\\" - one of the most ignorant USA Presidents.\\"In the book, almost each fact seems right, except that almost each of them is totally out of context and most of the time wrongly commented.Worst: falsified. It is really amazing that this man who has had all the background qualities to understand Russian history - as a Jewish Polish - could become such propagandist of a primitive view of History.It tells us a lot of the level of the Establishments where he has worked : Pipes taught at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1996. He was the director of Harvard's Russian Research Center from 1968 to 1973 and is now Baird Professor Emeritus of History at Harvard University.It is laughable to read how he defines in this book Lenin's actions. How many times he repeats the most overused conservatives clich&eacute;s on Lenin:for example, Lenin was a German spy. And to demonstrate this lie - which has been repeated and repeated by the \\"White\\" Russians, by the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s during decades , even today in Russia to demonstrate how much Lenin was not a patriot - Richard Pipes uses the old tricks. One of the most stupid amalgams is to insist of the comparison between Joseph Caillaux and Lenin.It is really fantastic to read this falsification of History because Richard Pipes, as could do a good lawyer , established his demonstrations with almost \\"indisputable\\" facts - except that none of them is meaningful -but at the opposite he uses them in a total deformed and misleading understanding that you feel a little bit shame for the low level of intelligence and culture of the writer. You feel sorry for Richard Pipes.Of course you understand also why he is doing in this way - as the son of Polish &eacute;migr&eacute;s in USA - to be paid as Professor, he needs to serve his Masters; he needs to repeat and repeat that \\"USA is the greatest democracy in the World\\", that \\"Revolution\\" is bad\\", that the\\" Masters need to stay \\"Masters\\" because \\"Masters\\" know better, etc etc.Great thing with a stupid book like this is to allow you to think by yourself, to try to answer to the real questions like: the nature of the democratic movements in February 1917 in Russia, the reasons of the sudden disappearance of the Russian state in the summer 1917, the reasons why there was no \\"coup d Etat\\" ,as Richard Pipes said , in October 1917 because there was simply no \\"Etat\\" at all; the reasons why the \\"Soviets\\" won; what are the nature the Soviets - in the Cities and in the small towns ?, why Lenin was a genius politician who understood so deeply the nature of Russian Revolution, why \\"hegemony\\" and not \\"majority\\" was the most important concept in rapid changes of a revolutionary movements, what are the continuities and the radical changes in the creation of the new Russian state, why Stalin represented the winners in this struggle between power groups in Russia, where are the main elements who have allowed the creation the totalitarian state - the dictatorship of the new ruling class - what is the nature of this ruling class - why this ruling class accepted to kill between 1934-38 almost 85% of his members, what type of people could do that without to provoke a new Revolution etc etcI could assure you that you will not find in this book the answers to this type of questions except that Lenin was a German spy and that he was not elected in a fair democratic election in October 1917 because of that Lenin and his political allies took the power in a no-democratic fashion, etc etc.For example you couldn't find the answer why the NKVD people in 1928-38 have succeeded to kill in a such easy way so many millions of Soviet Union citizens - by starvation, gun killings, mass deportation, slave labors, etc ...Look the Andrej Wajda's film \\"Katyn\\" and you will understand. Read Varlam Shalamov's \\"Kolyma Tales\\" and you will understand.The best - after to have read this primitive book - is to read Trotsky books about this Revolution and many others written during this period or after by writers who are real Historian and not like Richard Pipes old-fashioned propagandist.Richard Pipes is a pure product of this extreme USA right movement which has tried to underline , in the 70's,80's,90's and 2000's how much USA is exceptional compare to the Stalinist regime, compare to Soviet Union.Could you imagine to publish such a book in 1995! It is really ridiculous."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This book shows that anyone can be published as long as they can write, and of course write what the public wants to read. The consistency of the authors arguments is apparently of little importance. Within the first 50 pages of this book, the reader will be bludgeoned with contradiction after contradiction, fallacy after fallacy. But how could this be- from a Harvard professor? One is reminded of the axiom, \\"its who you know\\". To list the deceptions would take longer than I care to spend, but glaringly, his omission of the need for radical reform caused by autocratic and entrenched governments. He blames the radical left for demanding more and more reforms and then acknowledges that there were no meaningful reforms offered or instituted, at least in a timely manner. Laughingly,the revolution was sparked by the government refusing to allow students a drunken revel. I hate the phrase \\"really\\", but really? Whats he hiding? Certainly communism was responsible for its excesses, but in this book, the centuries of tsarist,( and capitalist) excesses is basically ignored. The author claims that theres no need to reshape man or improve Man, in his view, Man and established authorities are already perfected. At times this book reads like a textbook, quite dry and monotonous, almost painfully dull."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Richard Pipes is the eminent scholar of Russia who has taught for years at Harvard. Pipes has also worked in the Reagan administration as a Sovietology expert. Dr. Pipes has authored several volumes on Russia and the rise and fall of the Communist police state.\\"A Concise Hisory of the Russian Revolution is notable for:a. The book is a condensation of Pipes huge two volumes \\"The Russian Revolution\\" and \\"Russia under the Bolshevik Regime.\\" Those two doorstop size books are often laborious and lengthy reading.b. The condensation of the two books hits the major episodes and thumbnail sketches the major personalities of the period in a readable and easy to understand style.c. This book would serve as an excellent resource and textbook for a course in the Russian Revolution taught in a university setting.d. The book is well illustrated with period photos. A few maps are also included.The Russian Revolution's leader was Lenin (1870-1924) a Bolshevist lawyer and professional revolutionary. He and the Bolsheviks were supported by Germany. Germany wished to end the war on the Eastern Front and neutralize their Russian enemy. The German plan was then to assault a major breakthrough against the Allies on the Western Front. The German plan failed.Russia regained most of the territory she had ceded to the Germans at the treaty of Brest-Litovsk.e. Red Terror, famine and Civil War would torture the Russian people. Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered. Vast famines and the seizure of peasant property was widespread. Over 80% of Russians were peasants.Pipes gives Western readers a grim look at the rise of a totalitarian government led by a cruel party. The Soviets outlawed laws. Frightening reading. An excellent resource!"},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This is a very insightful book into what happened in Russia during that fateful year. Sure, Pipes does not like Bolshevism, but who cares? He understands that it is ok to display a dislike for an ideology while still being able to explain it. I strongly recommmend this book to anyone who is interested in the Russian Revolution.P.S. Someone said Trotsky's book was better and less biased. On what planet?"},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This work thoroughly documents the Russian Revolutions, which serve as a crucial case study on the importance of ideas in shaping history. Why did the Russian history descend into so much chaos?The author is a professor at Harvard, an eminent historian and a noted conservative who has written extensively on Communism in history. There is no better author for a book of this importance.The historical content of this book is fantastic. It is greatly detailed but appropriate for an armchair intellectual who is picking up his first book on the Russian Revolution. In this book, you will learn about Russia under Tsar Alexander II, the February Revolution of 1917, which replaced Alexander with a provisional government and the October Revolution later that year, which is more commonly known as the Bolshevik Revolution. Although there is plenty of material on the former two periods, this last revolution is the main focus of the book. Here, you will learn about many of the grim realities of what transpired during this time, including roaming gangs of state-appointed foragers who were ordered to secure \\"surpluses\\" but in reality just plunder property. In addition to Lenin's efforts to eradicate the concept of private property, You will also learn about Lenin's futile attempt to eliminate money as a medium of exchange, which actually just lead to an enormous black market for underground commerce. Finally, you will learn about all of the various opposing political factions, including the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks, the White Russians, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the other independent groups who were of lesser importance.Amongst many other key points, Richard Pipes will argue the following:* Lenin, in terms of essentials, was just as tyrannical as Stalin.* Although Alexander was despotic, Lenin and Trotsky were clearly worse than Alexander in terms of brutally oppressing the general public and suppressing political opposition.* The Bolsheviks not only destroyed the lives of many aristocrats but also ultimately made everyone (including workers) worse off as well.* The White Russians, irrationally blaming Jews for Bolshevism, were heavily responsible for the devastating pogroms that took place during this tumultuous time.The author's bias against Marxist-Leninism is quite clear throughout the book. However, Pipes is not a fan of their opposition either. Nevertheless, I think this bias enhances the book because these groups, in reality, did not fight for admirable ideals and should be judged accordingly.This is an excellent book overall. If I were to offer criticism, it would be that the author could have further explored the influence of Chernyshevsky's work \\"What is to be done?\\" on Lenin, which seems key to understanding Lenin's philosophy."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Sometimes it is hard to write a review simply because you don't want to sound like a blind acolyte and follower of the person involved. I am having this problem now- this book should be the first book any student of the Russian Revolution reads. It is simply fantastic- with excellent prose, imminently readable style, and an eye toward leaving out irrelevant detail, Dr. Pipes manages to make the Russian Revolution a parable with a point worth listening to. The one thing that will never be said of Mr. Pipes is that he did not see the forest for the trees. Having read many books on the Russian Revolution, I can honestly say this opus is hands down the best.Buy this book if you want to understand, not just know."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"I have a strange fascination with the russian revolution, and the psychopathic men who took over a country and stole everything for themselves. I promised myself 5 years ago i would not read this stuff anymore. But like an addict, i keep reading about this period of human history (the most miserable time on earth, as bad as the Black Death).I've read 20 books on the subject. And somehow, someway, i hadn't read Dr. Pipe's book. (I started out primarily with biographies of Stalin, then Trotsky, focused on the biographies, not the big picture history).Well, when i read Dr. Pipes account, i was struck by how clear and concise his writing is. He addresses key ideas he knows that supporters of planned economics put forward, and he refutes them with multiple historical examples, and clearly drawn conclusions that he clearly claims are opinions.After all my reading, by the time i read this book, i already agreed that the Soviet Union and totalitarian governments were harmful. And that is Dr. Pipe's explicitly expressed opinion as well. All that being said, Dr. Pipes conclusions and reasons were very clearly expressed.I ended up getting his autobiography, to learn how an academic works in the presidential circles of power. I'm interested in the topic, and i know that his writing enables me to understand a topic quickly. He does the hard work, and creates beautiful historical writing.In the words of Mark Twain \\"I didn't have time to write you a short letter, so i wrote you a long one instead.\\" Dr. Pipe's writes short, clear works of history."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"When I wanted to read about the Russian Revolution a history professor I knew said that this was the book. (Actually, Pipes has written a 976-page account called The Russian Revolution, but I went for the abridged version.)This 406-page, detailed, historical account of the revolution is definitely complete, and I learned a great deal that I did not know, of the state of the nation before the February Revolution in 1917, the revolutionaries, the Whites in the Civil War, the economic and geopolitical position of Russia in the world during World War I, and the methods and means of the Communist government and international Communist party in the early 1920s, and the horrible deaths that Lenin decreed were not warranted but were &quot;needed&quot; for the state to survive. Pipes' writing is clear, concise and chock full of facts. It's well organized, contains many photos of key players, as well as maps. The writing style is academic in terms of the ordering of thoughts, but completely accessible for interested parties. It really helped me sort and separate much of the information I had randomly received about this event and the shift in our world that resulted from it.I think this book was good, well written, well researched and deeply informative. I did find myself as I read it weighing what he wrote and asserted with his political affiliations. Pipes, who is the Baird Professor of History at Harvard University, served as President Reagan's National Security Council adviser on Soviet and East European affairs. As a neophyte to this body of knowledge, I don't know how much to except at face value assertions such as:* The October Revolution was not a revolution, as defined by a grassroots quest for governmental change, but rather a coup d'etat orchestrated by a small group representing a minority view. (Pipes feels so strongly about this, he puts the word &quot;revolution&quot; in quotes when writing of the October &quot;revolution.&quot;)* Winston Churchill was one of the few Europeans or Americans who recognized that with the advent of the communist government in Russia, the world was undergoing a shift in orientation, from nation-state focus to an ideological focus split between communism and capitalism.*The Whites, the revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow Lenin and the communist government, were not fighting for a return to tsarism, but rather for the return to the Provisional Government, which was democratic.While Pipes writes at length and fascinatingly about the inner workings of the party and government structure, the transformation from the revolution to the totalitarian regime of Lenin, he is deeply critical of the motives of the revolutionaries, and his kindest classification of them is that they are &quot;naive.&quot;One of the best features of this book is the eloquent closing chapter, &quot;Reflections on the Russian Revolution,&quot; which sums up Pipes's views of what happened. He also includes a helpful timeline and glossary.I learned a great deal from this book and feel I would like to read more from other perspectives. I do know of books by a London School of Economics professor, Robert Service, A Twentieth-Century History of Russia and Lenin: A Biography. I would like to get more of a grounding on the topic so that I can weigh the extensive and valuable viewpoints I got from Pipes.I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"If you want to know about the Russian Revolution, but don't have time to read a huge tome, this is the book for you (hence the name). I really liked it and have read more about this time period as a result."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"Lucid, scholarly, and reasonably concise as advertised. For those still hoping for a successful socialist state somewhere sometime, this would be an uncomfortable read. Pipes acknowledges that the circumstances were distinctively Russian in some ways. The absolute power of the czars was the forerunner of the absolute power of Lenin, and then Stalin. But the failures of socialism were exportable.Lenin had actually more power than the last czar, who had divested some, and who had the handicap of patriotism, which Lenin never had. Lenin expected to rule the world. His guiding star though his life was his hatred of the rich. Stalin was more democratic; he hated everybody that he thought was superior to him in any way.This book has a chronology at the end. Refer to it.Lenin had some young army officers executed secretly, without warning. They had nobody to say goodbye to, so they hugged their executioners.Pipes advocates unbiased collection of facts, but then angry and/or enthusiastic analysis. There are a lot of candidates for anger in this book, but my favorite is Walter Duranty, New York Times reporter given access (the London Times was barred.), luxury, a Russian mistress, who tried to expunge six million planned starvations from history, and got a Pulitzer prize for his work."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"This is an excellent overview and introduction to the Russian Revolution. Based on my readings of other sources and the indisputable facts, Pipes presents very accurate and fair descriptions and analyses. Some reviewers who are critical of Pipes are guilty of bias themselves in favor of Marxist/Leninist ideology. Pipes provides fascinating biographical summaries and narratives of events."},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","review":"To read this book you have to understand what was happening around the world at that time and if you did not, well this book will put you in the right state of mind. The Russian Revolution, the single event that changed world history is well chronicled here by the excellent author Richard Pipes. The author is inspired and writes the great history of the events, that lead to this event.This book is not hard to read as it fallows a good order and explains all of the people involved in the events. A pitful Bolshevik party, who no one took seriously even as they took over the goverment. People thought they would also be expedited soon by another goverment but it was not so. As Lenin, who is described well in this book put to work his new system of taking over, treating politics as War. Using that doctrine he cunningly destroyed the opposition and won Russia for himself and the party.For those of us who do not understand what the \\"paradise on Earth\\" really was, Pipes explains it all to us and how it failed. The people who this system wanted to represent did not even want the system, in fact no one really wanted it they just wanted an end to the Tsar and the war which Lenin gave but no one thought ahead. Witness the tragedy that was the revolution and how intellectuals given the drive and power can turn a society into terror. If you are interested on reading more on Comminism, also read by the author his review on that subject on the World Chronicles books."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"My original copy of Gift from the Sea was a gift. I loaned it to a trusted friend, but when she moved away, so did my copy. It was several years before I gave in to the need to reread it and ordered another one. Every chapter speaks to some part of a woman's heart. While not meant as a spiritual book, Gift from the Sea burrows deeply into the psyche of every woman. One woman's reflection on her journey may not sound like something you would read. We can all think of a few women we'd like to know a little LESS about. However, Anne Morrow Lindburg connects each facet of her journey to a shell she finds in her daily walks on the beach. It is a charming read and will fill your soul."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Something on a listmania list made me think of this book. I would say it has been at least 40 years since I first read it, but I too marked my copy with pencil marks and underlining, the first time I ever did that to a book. This was probably the book I re-read the most, from my teens into my early twenties. As a teen, I was an avid fiction reader and of course the non-fiction that came with school but this book opened my eyes. I don't even remember where I got it. I just know that as a teenager this book influenced the rest of my life. My original copy is probably packed away somewhere in one of my boxes but I am going to buy a new one and reread it. This was the book that also started me on a journey of keeping a journal. I can't even express in words how Anne Morrow Lindbergh inspired me! At the time I read the book I had never heard of Charles Lindbergh and of course, knew nothing about the Lindbergh kidnapping. My mother also read the book and I think it led to the beginning of our first woman-to-woman talks; that is adult-to-adult (even though I hadn't quite reached that adult level myself). I learned that my mother was more than just a mom. This book also greatly influenced my faith in a higher power."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"These pages of truth and inspiration are worthy of keeping close at hand and reading often as the author, the late famous Anne Lindbergh, is knowledgeable about stages of life that females find themselves in and her awareness and beautiful descriptions of passages of living are very sweet to read.

Wished the book jacket was in better shape when I received it."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh writes of finding peace in an uneasy world. The peace she seeks and seems to find is in her inner world. She knows she will return to the hectic and often chaotic life she shares with her husband and five children when she leaves the beach. It is interesting to read this account of a slice of her life 50 years after she wrote it. Athough she writes of devotion to hearth and home, it is clear that she is foreshadowing the feminist movement still some 20 years away. Perhaps she is seen as the anti-feminist, putting her husband(and possibly a cheating husband at that)ahead of herself but clearly she is aware that there is more to life then being a mother and a wife. She is seeking balance so that she may continue her role as nurturer but also incorporate the equally important roles of artist, friend and citizen. We continue to search for that balance today and this book gives voice and hope to that struggle. Her intelligence and gentleness shine through in her prose."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I read this book once a year, and it speaks to me differently every time.

I learned from The Aviator's Wife that Anne was a smart, poetic, insightful and strong woman. This definitely shows through out the book A Gift From Sea. Her interpretation of shells along the beach comparing them to a woman's life as we grow, marry, have children still keeping our individuality as strong women.What I like about a Gift From The Sea is that it is a book that can be reread over the years and you keep learning from it. I feel that this first time that I have read it, that I am (at 35) still an infant in my years and have yet much to learn from this world. I feel as Anne's daughter Reeve said, in the intro I have that, it is a book that should be read once a year.The interpretation of the shells found along the beach, and comparing them to life, was sometimes lost on me but still interesting.In the end this a book I am keeping.

I bought 4 copies, one for each woman in my family."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"My gifts of the inspirational book, \\"Gift from the Sea\\" were well received. It is a book for all seasons on how to cope with a busy life. Ann Lindburg was a special lady that most people know nothing about. Her take on how to find time for \\"self\\" is very profound. The analogies she found at the seashore give inspiraton to anyone, women and men, who are restricted by schedules and how to adjust those schedules. Finding inner peace and knowing one's self is the key to a more productive and acceptable way of life. Gift from the Sea can be read and re-read at all times of the year. I have read my copy three times.I'm sure I will read it throughout my lifetime."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh was as introspective a woman as I have come across in my reading.

It is thoughtful and thought provoking. I use it as a form of meditation. I read a few pages and let it speak to me.

I read it for my class, thought it was good, and the put it aside for years. About 10 years ago, I found it again and re-read it. At the phase I was at in my life, it had a whole new meaning. Now I read it every Spring/Summer as a reminder of what's really important in life. Each time I read it a gain another helpful insight into myself and a perspective on my life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to live a simpler, more meaningful life."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This book is thought-provoking and meaningful. It is deceptively simple, bringingto mind that old adage: 'big things come in small packages'.Lindberg examines women's need for solitude and inner focus. She discusses howwomen are often faced with competing demands and expectations on their livesfrom family and society. This creates conflicts and it is often the personal needsthat give way to the needs of others.This is the second time I've read this book and I know it will not be the last time.It is so easy to identify with her observations of how modern life fragments anddraws energy away from our centers. Lindberg explores how we need to focusand gain strength from solitude, aim towards being whole and reject demandsthat conflict with our most important goals. To do this, we must prioritize andaccept the importance of making time for ourselves.As a clinical social worker and marriage and family therapist, I find that this isone of the books I most often recommend to my female clients. It is also one ofthe books that I have internalized for myself. It is filled with wisdom and truth."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I found an original print of this book, and have loved every single page.

It was like taking another walk with my grandmother -- something I haven't been able to do since she passed away in 2002. While some of the specific details of Lindbergh's essays are out dated, they still spoke to me. The metaphor of the sea shell is a simple but powerful one. I ended up reading the book in the course of about half an hour."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I have read this book at least twice and find that each time I pick it up, although in a different stage of my life, I extract a whole different meaning. It's beautifully written by an elegant, educated woman who dared to speak the truth long before saying exactly how you feel was fashionable. She dared to elegantly express her feelings knowing full well what the ramifications for doing so could be. This book is a treasure and a wonderful gift that continues to give every time its' pages are turned. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This is a book about life and living.

It is a quick read, but the author's thoughts may linger and continue to inspire you."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"When I left home for college in 1978, my mother gave me a copy of this book. Some twenty years before, her mother gave her a copy of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's sweet musings of life as a woman. A few years ago, I bought a copy of Gift From the Sea to give to my own daughter who was leaving home for the first time. That this book speaks to multi-generations is part of its allure. People from my mother's generation will recall the Lindbergh's public tragedy of a kidnapped and murdered son. Although AML doesn't speak of this in her book, the knowledge of this awful event and what it must have meant to the author colored my perspective as a reader, adding to my respect for her essays. Gift from the Sea has become a legacy in my family; someday I hope to give copies to my grandchildren."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Gift from the Sea is a beautiful story about the author's summer of solitude on the shore.

It provides much food for thought and is a source of inspiration through her personal musings and easy flowing prose.

Obviously others have the same life experiences to consider and learn from."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I would not have believed that any book written in 1955 about women's problems could be so absolutely relevant today, and not only that, but says exactly what I believe about aloneness and solitude and how combined with nature, such solitude can truly refresh the soul. Deserves many re-readings. And what a novel idea, having many different types of shells represent the stages and relationships in a woman's life. It echos so exactly that line from \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" - \\"Once a woman marries and has children, her life becomes one of details.\\" How baking biscuits can be creative and renew the spirit."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I purchased \\"Gifts From the Sea\\" not sure what to expect, and as I write this I find myself unsure once again, but this time about how to describe it - let me give it a try...This beautifully written collection of \\"essays\\" has to do with the lives of women, and how many facets of our lives can be understood through the reflection of the various gifts from the sea - namely sea shells.Anne Morrow Lindbergh takes the reader on a journey with her to a private, and very personal beach vacation that took place sometime in the early 1950's. She went on this vacation by herself, in order to take time to relax & reflect. During this time, she noticed that each type of shell that she picked up had a \\"gift\\" - a way of looking at life that helped her to understand herself & other's better.She discusses the various periods in life that we all (or at least most) tend to go through, and what can be learned by each. One of the most important of which is to learn who YOU are.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to any woman who feels overworked &/or underappreciated in any area of their life - you may find a better understanding to your issues throughout these pages..."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This is supposedly a self-help classic, but I wouldn't want to turn to it in a time of need. The writing is schlocky and the book is full of vague generalizations without concrete examples.

I definitely didn't want such terrible writing to be a part of my big day."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"The 50th Anniversary Edition would have been a nice book with a beautiful cover design, except the paper book cover was very wrinkled. It made for a disappointing gift. It was not wrinkled in transit but due to poor quality control at Amazon."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Written as a personal journal during her alone time visiting the beach in the 1950s, Anne Morrow Lindbergh's eloquent meditations on age, marriage, solitude, creativity, peace, and contentment beautifully illustrate the timelessness of these issues for women as wives and mothers.Gift from the Sea would be an excellent book club selection for a group that is interested in discussing the joys and challenges of motherhood.Lindbergh's book would also make a lovely baby shower or Mother's Day gift."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I was first introduced to \\"Gift from the Sea\\" as a gift from my college sorority big sister in 1968. In an all female college and a world that was both torn apart and boiling with changing roles, I found solice and an inner peace with the words that I must have read dozens of times that first year. Our challenge was to enter a world that required all the inner balance that we could achieve. The book for more than 35 years has been an inspiration and emotional challenge to me.I used the book's message as a theme, and quotes from it as chapter markers in the yearbook I edited for my college and it has been a standard 'right of passage' high school graduation gift to every special young lady in our family and among our friends. For a number of very personal reasons, it will be included with all the essentials for a beach vacation week in the early spring that my closest girlfriends and I share every year....... I feel so blessed to be able to share this true \\"gift\\" with these very special women ......... and with you."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I try to read this book every year or so, and have done so the past 5 years. I am amazed at how true Mrs. Lindburgh's insights continue to be! This is an important book for women (and enlightened men) to read and absorb today, even though it was written decades ago. She will restore your soul."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This little book is highly enjoyable. It is a unique form of self-help book. It doesn't bombard you with endless words about this or that problem (alcoholism, codependency, self-esteem, etc.) but gives the reader the desire to return to the basics of life. Isak Dineson wrote &quot;the answer to everything is salt water: sweat, tears, and the ocean.&quot; In those quiet moments of life, a simple act of contemplation on the basic objects around us can be so rewarding, so freeing. This is what Anne Morrow Lindbergh does in this little book. It is as much a book about prayer, as it is about the lives and issues of women. I am proof that one need not be a woman to enjoy this book. I enjoyed Lindbergh's ability to touch the numinous in so few words, to shift quickly in her meditation between the tangible reality and the intangible truth contained therein. I recommend this book to anyone (but especially a woman, Lindbergh's audience) who wants to understand just what at the core of one's life is truly important."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Gift From The Sea was first published in 1955 and was the best-selling nonfiction book of the year with 80 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list. I'm discovering it for the first time. It's simply lovely and is deserving of this new 50th Anniversary edition of 130 pages.It is obvious that the sea and the beach were an integral part of Ann Morrow Lindbergh's life as her writings are full of references to them.Gift From The Sea is a woman's poetic reflection about the challenges we all face in our relationships with our family, friends, the world and ourselves. They are her thoughts and ideas but are universal when thinking about the human condition.The introduction is written by Anne Morrow Lindbergh's son Reeve. Even 50 years after it was written, it continues to be fresh and filled with wisdom. It's a book to be read, savored and read again."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I am an author myself. Recently, a woman who had purchased two of my books mentioned to me that my style of writing reminded her of this little gem of a book titled Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh. As soon as she shared this comment with me, I quickly jotted down the title and name of the author. I had every desire to get my hands on this book to discover if I could spot any similarities.My review today will not be as long as my typical book reviews. I can only say thank you to Anne Morrow Lindbergh for sharing her wonderful gift with the world. I would also like to say thank you to the woman who honored me by putting me in the same league as this gifted author. I am deeply moved to be compared even in the remotest way to such an inspirational, talented, deep-thinking author as Anne Morrow Lindbergh...it renders me almost speechless. What a fine compliment indeed!"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"What a beautiful book! Anne Morrow Lindbergh has truly captured the essence of simplicity. As our lives grow increasingly more busy every day, this book is truly a gem that reminds us of the beauty and the peace that comes when we pause and allow our hearts and our souls time to breathe. This book is an easy ready and not very long, but each chapter is a soothing respite for a busy soul. I've given this book as a gift and recommended it to many others. A favorite!"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This is a book you will revisit again and again, although it is a very fast read, she packs so much in it to think about, be encourage with and be challenged by as well. The rythm of the book brings you to place where you need to slow down and enter into an almost symbiotic, even if imagined, relationship with the sea. Whether you are just getting started on your journey of becoming a woman or well into the heart of it, you will find something in this book that will make Ann Murrow Lindberg a welcome and sought after companion."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"So timeless (even after 50 years) that I kept my own and bought five more for my daughters and my friends. So much wisdom in such a small book. Why wasn't this advice in the \\"instructions\\" on what life would deliver?"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I read this book more than 50 years ago and it changed my life. I was desperately unhappy and it opened up for me a way to change. I found 'a room of my own' -- a career, or better still, a calling. It gave me the strength and determination to leave my unhappy marriage and to start life anew with, ultimately, a new partner, my husband now of almost 50 years."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"After watching _The Spirit of St. Louis_ one afternoon, my boyfriend (who is also a pilot) told me that Anne Morrow Lindbergh had written a book, which, as he was told, \\"every woman should read.\\" The next time I went to his house, _Gift from the Sea_ was waiting for me.What amazed me about this book was its timeliness, or should I say, timelessness. That a middle-aged Caucasian woman, writing during the 50's, could strike such a deeply-felt chord of sisterhood with me, a 30-something African-American woman living at the brink of a new millennium, is truly the mark of a gifted writer. We \\"enlightened, liberated\\" women of the year 2000 think, with a fair amount of condescension, that we have \\"progressed\\" so much from that time period. And yet, the issues Mrs. Lindbergh addressed are still very much with us today: how does a woman fulfill the roles of citizen, artist, wife/partner, mother, career person, friend, sibling/relative, and balance all of that with the time and self-commitment for spiritual/emotional nurturing?I have a quote from this precious gift posted on the wall at my workstation; it is a state of being I seek as a humble pilgrim on life's journey:\\"...I want first of all...to be at peace with myself. I want a singleness of eye, a purity of intention, a central core to my life that will enable me to carry out these obligations and activities as well as I can. I want, in fact - to borrow from the language of the saints - to live \\"in grace\\" as much of the time as possible...By grace I mean an inner harmony, essentially spiritual, which can be translated into outward harmony...I would like to achieve a state of inner spiritual grace from which I could function and give as I was meant to in the eye of God...\\"This is a must read for women everywhere!"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Not a book to race through! To be read slowly, alone, savored, re-read, meditated and mused on, with contentment. And if you can't find contentment, it will find you -- in Anne's words -- her gift from the sea.Anne Morrow Lindbergh's thoughts are woven around her impressions gathered from her ocean-side stay away from society and civilization -- from people and things -- from noise and confusion -- from musts and don'ts.What Anne discovers in her solitude at the beach, she offers to you the reader by way of her journal. The tiny shells she held and studied provide lessons to her and all of us.Anne's musings about life, relationships, love, busy-ness, aging, simplicity and solitude came to me several years ago at a time I was re-assessing many things in my life. Like a grace, her words soothed me and helped me quiet my turbulent thoughts, and to gather my inmost spirit to bind the wounds, to fill myself with the good already all around me and to go forward.I realized I could slow down my pace, choose my own path, ask for and expect some peace and quiet and harmony, because these gifts are there for all of us to enhance our lives.Although written from a woman's perspective, Anne's gift from the sea is for all of us who hunger for the slower pace, the garden path, the sanctity in God's every creation down to the intricate sea shell in Anne's hand as she coddles it, examines its artistic swirls and ridges and colors, and listens to the lessons -- the homilies -- within its delicate curves.A keeper of a book. You'll go back to this one, like to a favorite vacation hideaway or armchair by the fireside or corner in the garden under the stars. It'll be an old friend, a comfort and blessing.Take a deep breath......Can you just smell the salty tang of those soft breezes off the ocean"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This title was a recent selection for a book discussion group that I helped organize for my library. As the only male in the group, I felt somewhat compelled to offer token protest to the selection of this classic example of a &quot;woman's book,&quot; but actually I was intrigued by it. Everything I had read about &quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; praised its meditative quality and I had to admit that the promise of that rather appealed to me.I wound up reading the bulk of the book on Mothers' Day, which seemed quite appropriate, given that among the many issues Lindbergh addresses here is the need for mothers to find a balance between their own needs and those of their children and husbands. The need for time to one's self, a &quot;room of one's own&quot;, the need for a spriritual dimension to one's existence--well, it seems so obvious that these needs have to be met if a woman--if any human being--is to be fulfilled and to be able to meet her (or his) responsibilities with joy rather than with dread. But the lessons that Anne Morrow Lindbergh taught in 1955 still need to be voiced in 2000--perhaps more than ever. Lindbergh seems prescient when she speaks of the dangers of the &quot;life of multiplicity&quot; which had already taken root in the immediate post-War era. We know all too well that it has not gotten any better in the past 50 years and that women's lives in particular have become more stressful and, to use Lindbergh's word, &quot;fragmented&quot; in the past half-century.What distinguishes Lindbergh's book from today's current crop of self-help or New Age sprititual books though is its lyrical quality. Her careful, belletristic prose is soothing and, yes, meditative in and of itself. Reading it seems to bring about the very centeredness and balance that she seeks to describe.Although she includes no bibliography (and rightly so, as this is not a tract), I would hope that many of her readers would be inspired to seek out the works of some of the writers she quotes in the context of these essays. She does the world a great service in suggesting how Rilke, for example, whose poetry may seem impenetrable at first, can actually speak to the concerns of our own lives."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Based on its reputation as one of the seminal works of Feminism and a callow belief that the author was merely riding her husband's coattails to fame, this is a book that I have pretty studiously avoided. As it turns out, that was a colossal mistake on my part. This little book contains more interesting and compelling thoughts on the nature of human relationships, particularly the marriage relationship, than just about any other book I've ever read.It's not possible to address them all here, but here are two ideas that I found particularly striking. Here is a passage describing a quality marriage:A good relationship has a pattern like a dance, and is built on some of the same rules. The partners do not need to hold on tightly, because they move confidently in the same pattern, intricate but gay and swift and free, like a country dance of Mozart's. To touch heavily would be to arrest the pattern and freeze the movement, to check the endlessly changing beauty of its unfolding. There is no place here for the possessive clutch, the clinging arm, the heavy hand, only the barest touch is assign. Now arm in arm, now face to face, now back to back - it does not matter which. Because they know they are partners moving to the same rhythm, creating a pattern together, and being invisibly nourished by it. The joy of such a pattern is not only the joy of creation or the joy of participation, it is also the joy of living in the moment. Lightness of touch and living in the moment are intertwined.When you love someone, you do not love them all the time, in exactly the same way, from moment to moment. It is an impossibility. It is even a lie to pretend to. And yet this is exactly what most of us demand. We have so little faith in the ebb and flow of life, of love, of relationships. We leap at the flow of the tide and resist in terror its ebb. We are afraid it will never return. We insist on permanency, on duration, on continuity; when the only continuity possible, in life as in love, is in growth, in fluidity - in freedom, in the sense that the dancers are free, barely touching as they pass, but partners in the same pattern.The only real security is not in owning or possessing, not in demanding or expecting, not in hoping, even. Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what was in nostalgia, nor forward to what it might be in dread or anticipation, but living in the present relationship and accepting it as it is now. Relationships must be like islands, one must accept them for what they are here and now, within their limits - islands, surrounded and interrupted by the sea, and continually visited and abandoned by the tides.This image, of a loving couple as partners in a dance, not gripped in a hammer lock, but tracing a unified pattern via different steps, just seems profound to me. We all know people who demand of love that it be unchanging, or demand of a partner that they do things in lockstep; these people are never happy and we immediately recognize their relationships as unhealthy. At the same time, we recognize the good marriages around us as the ones where each partner is confident enough in the other to have faith that their separate paths will remain intertwined and will lead to the same place.The other section that truly brought about a personal epiphany, was when she says:...marriage, which is always spoken of as a bond, becomes actually, in this stage, many bonds, many strands, of different texture and strength, making up a web that is taut and firm. The web is fashioned of love. Yes, but many kinds of love: romantic love first, then a slow-growing devotion and, playing through these, a constantly rippling companionship. It is made of loyalties, and interdependencies, and shared experiences. It is woven of memories of meetings and conflicts; of triumphs and disappointments. It is a web of communication, a common language, and the acceptance of lack of language, too; a knowledge of likes and dislikes, of habits and reactions, both physical and mental. It is a web of instincts and intuitions, and known and unknown exchanges. The web of marriage is made by propinquity, in the day to day living side by side, looking outward and working outward in the same direction.As I read that, I was reminded of some of the marriages i've never been able to fathom, from my own grandparents to that most analyzed relationship of our day, the Clintons. The notion of the years together creating a web and of reaching a point where you, the couple, are within, looking out in the same direction, seems to me to go a long way to explaining such marriages. Think of how completely the Clintons are entangled within their own unique web, how insular their world must be, and, so long as they do work in the same direction, their relationship at least starts to make a little sense.There is much more here besides. I approached with trepidation, fearing a chick book, and found instead a marvelous exploration of the human condition in general and of the extraordinarily complex nature of marriage in particular. It is a book that anyone will benefit by, especially actual or prospective husbands and wives.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh could teach today's modern woman a wealth of knowledge on fulfillment and the balancing act of motherhood, wife and self. She has come to understand, the importance of finding peace and happiness within yourself, before you can share those qualities with others. Anne was, indeed, in her simplistic approach to life, a woman light-years ahead of her time. She had discovered, long before self-help books were fashionable, the ultimate joys and pleasures of a simplistic lifestyle, the richness of spiritual well being, and the importance of inner peace.Written in a unique, vibrant, flowing style, this book says in a lot less words what dozens of other self-help books set out to accomplish in long-winded, psycho-analytic terminology. &quot;Gift from the Sea&quot; is truly a gift from the soul of a woman with great wisdom and inner beauty, and one which you will long remember. Another book I would highly recommend is, &quot;A Year by the Sea&quot; by Joan Anderson."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I had no idea, when I found this book in a little beach bookstore recently, that it was written in 1955. Had I known, it probably would have dissuaded me from buying it. I now know how fortunate I am to have not known!I believe that books, words and people come into our lives at the time they are most needed, and Gift from the Sea certainly fits that bill for me. While small bits of it may be dated, most of it speaks as clearly and truly to modern day woman as it would have to 1950s women. In fact, with so many women in search of their most authentic self these days, it may even be MORE relevant to today's woman! It is a delicate and thoughtful essay on solitude, couplehood, inner peace and the wonder of nature. I can't imagine anyone not being inspired and uplifted by reading it. Truly, a gift for the soul."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"&quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; is the kind of book that makes you want to leave your life for a couple of days and find the existance that Anne Lindbergh seemed to be living in when she wrote it. When I began reading it (by accident), I felt that she must have found some secret passage into my own soul and put its meaning into words I could never even dream of thinking. Her approach is incredible- because it seems as if she took no approach. She just sat down and wrote what seemed to pour uncontrollably from her own soul. She is heroic in her honest, simple view of life and its possibilities. It is a book I advise every woman to read at every stage of her life to remind her of the opportunity she has as as woman- to not only be equal to the opposite sex, but to also delve deep within herself to be what she was created to be."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"For anyone -- but most particularly any woman -- in search of self and her place in the world this book, written in 1955, is a must read. It so fully articulates the inner struggles so many women today try to come to grips with-- while at the same time it illustrates that as much as we would like to believe that much of what occurs in our lives is a new occurence, the fact is that there truly is nothing new under the sun, that these struggles just persist from generation to generation.This diary is so timely throughout that it is at times almost spooky. Hear Lindbergh, for example, conjure up images of the impact of today's Martha Stewart at a time when Martha Stewart was just 14 years old and still a very long way from Lindbergh's consciousness or that of the general public:&quot;Here I live in a bare sea-shell cottage. No heat, no telephone, sweeping and clearning here. I am no longer aware of the dust no plumbing to speak of, no hot water, a two-burner oil stove, no gadgets to go wrong. No rugs. There were some, but I rolled them up the first day; it is easier to sweep the sand off a bare floor. But I find I don't bustle about with unnecessary sweeping and cleaning here. I have shed my Puritan conscience about absolute tidiness and cleanliness. Is it possible that, too, is a material burden? No curtains. I do not need them for privacy; the pines around my house are enough protection. I want the windows open all the time and I don't want to worry about rain. I begin to shed my Martha-like anxiety about many things. Washable slipcovers, faded and old -- I hardly see them; I don't worry about the impression they make on other people. I am shedding pride. As little furniture as possible; I shall not need much. I shall ask into my shell only those friends with whom I can be completely honest.&quot;And listen to her speak directly to women of both the 20th and 21st (and probably the 22nd) centuries when she writes:&quot;With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balance, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel&quot;I can barely in a few quotes pay this book the respect it deserves. Suffice it to say that I highly recommend this book. In fact, I suspect it is going to be my goal in 2002 to put it in the hands of many friends, family members and acquaintances!"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"As a man I immensely enjoyed this 'woman's' book. Mrs. Lindberg uses masterful metaphor to tell her tale of inner discovery. Her level of insight kept my attention throughout this short memoir. I will go on the record and call this a man's book also. There are so many lessons that cross the gender lines. I believe that I also have a better understanding of women in general. Her relationship advice is sublime. I have included my favorite quotes:\\"Duration is not the test of true or false.\\"\\"There is no one-and-only, there are just one-and-only moments.\\"\\"Neither is the answer in dissipating our time and energy in more purposeless occupations, more accumulations which supposedly simplify life but actually burden it, more possessions which we have not time to use or appreciate, more diversions to fill up the void.\\"\\"Saint Exupery said 'Love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction.'\\"Five Stars"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This book was given to me by a family friend after the birth of my first child. My initial thought was &quot;like I have time to read&quot;, but I put it on my nightstand. Finally, when the baby began sleeping through the night, I would read a few pages before turning in myself.What a soul-refresher this little whisp of a book turned out to be! I had to look a few times at the author's name, and the date the book was first published, to convince myself it was really THAT Lindberg and THAT old. But everything she says, and she says it so beautifully and poetically (even given the circumstances of her own life)holds true today - and most likely as long as women exist on this earth.Sometimes it is hard for women to do for themselves because they are trying so hard to do for so many others. This time, take the time for yourself, and read this book."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"My grandmother gave this to my mother. When I was in my mid thirties, my mother passed it on to me. Originally written in 1955, Anne Morrow Lindberg has captured a timeless understanding of the stages of life that women experience. Using the metaphor of the shells she finds on the beach one summer, Lindberg provides insight on topics like love, marriage, motherhood, the loss of identity, the subtlety of living and finding meaning in even the smallest events of life. Outstanding! Since I don't have a daughter to whom to pass this on, I only hope I can convince as many women as possible to obtain their own copy--or two: one to underline and keep on their nightstand, another to pass on to their best friend, mother or daughter."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I first listened to this book on CD and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It is pretty much just the musings of a wife and mother about her life and relationship with her family. She talks about her need for alone time, simplification of her life, and her marriage. I read it quite a while ago and I still reflect upon insights from the book. I would highly recommend that everyone take a chance to read this book. It's not long, but it is truly a gem."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This is a book that you don't just read once. It is onethat you reread over and over, everytime you get sometimenew out of it."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I read this book years and years ago. Recently, when looking for a book club selection this was listed as a \\"must\\" because it created such a great discussion. Now after re-reading, I couldn't agree more! Anne Morrow Lindbergh's writing is as timeless as Shakespeare's. Although our society is much different now than in the 1950s, her thoughts are still as appropriate--in some ways even more so. From a literary standpoint, her use of shells to describe stages of life is remarkable! Can't wait to discuss this in our book club."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This book and it's message are timeless. The message is as true today as it was 50 years ago.This book was given to me many summers ago and it has become an annual read."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Thank you Anne Morrow Lindbergh for this lovely book that reads like poetry.

This is such a quiet and serene short story, written w/ utmost grace and contemplation. Lindbergh goes to the sea seeking to understand a balance of inner peace and self-fulfillment. She reflects on personal needs in contrast to the obligation of family and work and the solace that can be found in necessary solitude."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"&quot;A gift from the Sea&quot; was given to me by a friend to read recently and it really did turn out to be a &quot;Gift&quot;. I cannot believe that this book was written over 40 years ago as it is just so relevant today. I have already ordered three copies for my friends and the audio tapes for myself which I just love. This is such an important book for women, but sadly I imagine very few men read it and they should. Her words are just as meaningful for the males species of this world."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I keep re-reading this book and find something new in it every time.

As I think back on it now, I'm sure I didn't fully grasp the full scope of her profound writing.... or perhaps, I pushed it back somewhere in my subconscience mind-- the compelling content making up a small part of the woman I am today.Recently, I picked the book up again and was immediately consumed by the author's opening words: \\"I began these pages for myself, in order to think out my own particular pattern of living, my own individual balance of life, work and human relationships...\\" Those could have been my own words--that being one of the primary reasons I began my blog writings!!First published in 1955, the timeless masterpiece encompasses themes of solitude, relationship and inner peace intertwined with the wonders of the sea.If you are a woman in search of self, peace and your place in the world, this eloquent book will whisper your name.

Yet it is the subject of my next week's book club, and I download it to my Kindle. I finish it in less than an hour. But it is not a book intended for completion. But a book for contemplation.This is a book that holds complex yet simple thoughts on living and loving; finding purpose or drifting; seeking the impossible; finding meaning and direction. Using various types of seashells as metaphor, Lindbergh allows us to look closely at the nooks and crannies of our own lives. And in the process, discover what this life is all about."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"My husband had an old copy of this book in his grandfather's collections after he died.

In addition, the book was very small, not the size of the usual softcover books I previously ordered."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Listed as a 'summer read' in a local magazine list - I hadn't heard of this book. I picked it up and finished it from one afternoon into the next morning.

Lindbergh thinks too much. She is educated to the max, andenjoys intellectual musings. She seems to be concerned about people not spending enough time alone, especially women. I think this book would have been better if given to my wife for a gift, that she could read at the beach while camping. I do not recommend it for men."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Excellent service; received book immediately and in excellent condition.

I received a book without the sleeve. This is not what I had purchased."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This book came very highly recommended by two friends who are avid book readers. However I hate to admit that the book did not move me as much as my friends claimed that it moved them. I was more interested about the background references to the author's personal life and how the book came into being. That I would have read voraciously. The book is short but I don't intend to read it again to see what I missed. I believe a book either moves you or it doesn't. This particular book despite other rave reviews did not move me despite my great affinity for the sea and women writers. I wonder if perhaps if the book would have touched me differently if I read it in the beach rather than on a plane which I did."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This book was last months book club read. While I think Anne Morrow Lindbergh was ahead of her time, I enjoyed her daughter's introduction to the book more. It was worth reading but it wasn't my favorite type of book."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I was shocked at the quality of this print run. The pages are roughly cut and it looks like a back yard job. I thought this had painted pictures as well, not boring black and white scribbles. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I found this book frustrating and annoying. It was, for my taste, filled with too much non-productive lamentation. Perhaps I could have read farther, but I could not relate to this woman's feelings when I am quite satisfied with my already simplified, purpose-driven life. (This is not a reference to the popular book by a similar title.)"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Just as other reviewers have suggested, how unusual and wonderful to find a work that is perhaps more poignant and fudamental to modern life than when it was first published in the 1950s. How significant for a woman of that time to wax lyrical on the need for female solitude and independence.This is a tiny sweet little book whose narrative is framed by the beauty of nature and the complex lessons of shells. I loved her description of the day shared by lovers, from waking in the morning to walking and working and watching the stars. Her lessons were perfectly applicable and inspiring.Essentially, Lindbergh is also suggesting that women slow themselves, which has become more relevant in this epoch. On bad days, she suggests baking biscuits, something which warmed my heart.The only limitation of this little work is that it, at times, is restricted by the constructs of its periods. For example, as Lindbergh suggests in the 'Reopening' of the work, women are even still a long way from the equality she initially describes. My only other minor complaint is that she occasionally simplifies the intricate complexity of relationships.But even still, I am off to bake some biscuits."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I had purchased and read this book years ago, and my most recent purchase was a gift for a friend going through a life passage. This book speaks lyrically and poignantly to the life stages especially of women and should be in everyone's library."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Odd that a book written in the 1950s by the patrician wife of the-then most famous man in America could feel so relevant to women and men of many races and classes fifty years later. It warms my heart to feel a shared human connection with this woman, who is very different from myself. This book, a short, intimate meditation on how to successfully and joyfully manage the different stages of adult life, has proven itself to be universal. To read it is to affirm what we have in common with others.We live in an era when many of us (particularly the brown people of this world) have access to more wealth than any of our ancestors. This potential affluence is definitely a good thing, but it also comes with complications and challenges. The pursuit of money and achievement can also lead to materialism and self-absorption, which ultimately decays the spirit and destroys the family. This book can serve as a guide of how to manage these pitfalls with grace. There are elements of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's life that I don't necessarily support, but this book represents the best of what she has to offer. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This book awakened me to the real nature of women. I am a man who was really not in touch. Ann Morrow Lindburgh has made such an eloquant way to describe the inner makings of the feminine that makes it easy to read with much appreciation."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I read this book over 25 years ago, and it was four times as rich and deep after 25 years of lived experience. I will reread every year now. Both inspirational and insightful."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Heard GIFT FROM THE SEA (Random House Audio) by Anne Morrow Lindbergh and read by Claudette Colbert.This was the 50th anniversary edition, and it contained an introduction by the author's daughter that I found help in that it gave some background information on the acclaimed writer and mother of five.In this book, Lindbergh shares her observations about youth and age; love and marriage; peace, solitude and contentment that she set down during a vacation by the sea . . . as she notes:* I began these pages for myself, in order to think out my own particular pattern of living, my own individual balance of life, work and human relationships. And since I think best with a pencil in my hand, I started naturally to write . . .She then shared her thoughts about the beach:* The sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too greedy, or too impatient. To dig for treasures shows not only impatience and greed, but lack of faith. Patience, patience, patience, is what the sea teaches. Patience and faith. One should lie empty, open, choiceless as a beach--waiting for a gift from the sea.And, also, oyster beds:* Yes, I believe the oyster shell is a good one to express the middle years of marriage. It suggests the struggle of life itself. The oyster has fought to have that place on the rock to which it has fitted itself perfectly and to which it clings tenaciously. So most couples in the growing years of marriage struggle to achieve a place in the world. It is a physical and material battle first of all, for a home, for children, for a place in their particular society. . . . In these years one recognizes the truth of Saint-Exupery's line: \\"Love does not consist in gazing at each other (one perfect sunrise gazing at another!) but in looking outward together in the same direction.\\" For, in fact, man and woman are not only looking outward in the same direction; they are working outward. (Observe the steady encroachment of the oyster bed over the rock.) Here one forms ties, roots, a firm base. (Try and pry an oyster loose from its ledge!)I found GIFT FROM THE SEAS beautifully written and surprisingly soothing . . . yet it is not for everybody; in particular, it is definitely more a woman's book, and I'm not sure how many males would even want to read it.In addition, I think some readers might have trouble relating to the author . . . at the time, she resided in the upper 1% of society and as a result, could take advantage of many things not ordinarily available to most Americans."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Gift From the Sea is one of my favorites. At various stages in my life, I have read it over and over again. It is a timeless classic. A major reason why it is such a favorite, is that it relates to the ocean/sea, which is my favorite place. Not only that, Anne is a very strong woman; a wonderful example for women. This book is a great gift to give to female friends and relatives."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"When I received the book, I was a little dissapointed. It is really small. However, when I started reading, it was great. I love the sea, and therefore loved the connection of shells to her stories. A lovely, quick read."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"My Mother loved Sanibel and this book. This fall we spent 5 days on Sanibel and there was an article on the 50th anniversary of this book. That inspired me to get it. It is a wonderful, thought provoking book on life. You won't be disappointed if you read it."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This years women's retreat is using Anne Lindbergh's book as its basic resource, finding her words as relevant today as when first published in 1955. We have developed our curriculum using Scripture, up-to-date examples, Anne M. Johnson's reflections on Ms. Lindbergh's book in her \\"Return to the Sea,\\" and more, bridging the 55 years for today's women. I have been so pleased to be able to find multiple copies at reasonable prices so that we are able to have them available for each participant. We love the various inscriptions, personal notes that others have passed on in these used editions."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I'm a bit surprised to see this little gem of a book described as being primarily aimed at women. It struck me as being more in line with Marcus Aurelius' Meditations and the Essays of Montaigne. In a way, I think Ms. Lindbergh's writing is even better: more poetic, and less chatty. And her vision encompasses contemporary issues those fellows never experienced. Even though it has a 1955 copyright, this book has a very modern sensibility. (Not modern as in loud and decadent, but rather modern as in addressing issues of technological acceleration and information overload.) And she is no slouch in the wisdom department, either. Her vivid delineation of the several stages of life, and especially her insights into middle age make for though-provoking reading. I imagine she would make for a very wise and reasonable traveling companion. This book isn't just for the gals, guys. It's just plain great writing. It's a skinny book, too. Like the man once said, &quot;There ain't much there, but what there is, is choice.&quot;"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"A beautifully written timeless treasure from an amazing hero of a woman reaching across the generations with her words.She exposes her soul and wisdom to every woman today as she relates various sea shells to life. The anniversary edition is printed on pages that just feel good in your hand and heart. I loved the additional chapter that Anne Morrow Lindberg added twenty years after the original book. She inspires me!"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Even though this book was written in the 1950's, it's subject matter is as current and relevant as if it was written yesterday. This is a small, sensible, gem of a book on the often overwhelming and thankless task of being a wife and mother. No, it's not a feminist rant, just a realistic look at what it means to sacrifice yourself for others. This book would make the perfect gift for every mother with young children...trust me."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I read this book at least once a year. It is a part of my summer time vacation ritual. I received my first copy of this book from my sister and let it sit on my shelf for years before cracking it open. I had no idea the treasure I had sitting on my bookshelf. I have given it as a gift a number of times since. It is amazingly relevant to today's woman even though it was written over forty years ago. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This book is an excellent source of strength and support to women who love the sand, sea and surf. What is so very amazing is that I have read it 4 times over the last 20 years and have found parts of it to apply to each stage of my life making a comparison to the types of shells that litter the beach."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh (AML) originally wrote these words only for herself, her own processing, her own experience of the cycles of life, of love, of friendship, of feelings. I am grateful she expanded her reach with these words to include any of us who care to take a brief break from our everyday routines to read this slim, very accessible volume.A couple surprises - I found this title in the Christian Inspiration section of the bookstore. I had previously read \\"War Within and War Without\\" in which I discovered Anne Morrow Lindbergh didn't regularly attend church. I had thought she was one of those \\"iconic\\" Christian writers - instead in these pages I discovered a woman who deeply knows the tenets of the Bible and uses them, integrates them in her life without being preachy about it.That is a good way to sum up the entire tone of the book - using metaphors from the Ocean itself, AML opens her own heart - and ours - to an entirely new way of seeing. Her writing voice is clear, concise. She says absolutely everything that needs to be said and nothing more.Her writing is like the perfectly sized meal. Satisfied, not satiated, with plenty of space to breathe, converse and make new discoveries about the entire experience.In the closing chapter, written for a new edition of the book twenty years later, AML writes of being \\"astonished\\" about the impact of this volume \\"written to work out my own problems\\" was still being read and appreciated by so many readers - and continuing for another generation... and now, continuing still to future generations.AML's daughter, Reeve, also scribes a heartfelt introduction for this fiftieth anniversary edition which allows us another view into the life of the woman who left these words for us, more than fifty years ago... yet feel as if they could have been written five minutes ago.This book makes me hungry for more. I now have two AML books under my heart. I will now read more, as well as books by her children. (One note that probably means nothing else to any of you, but the copyright was reissued in 2003 by four of her children. My heart literally leaped in reading those familiar names. I actually exclaimed \\"Land! Jon!\\" outloud. And then, \\"Where is (daughter) little Anne?\\"That is what the writing of Anne Morrow Lindbergh does, in a nutshell. She makes you care, not only about her and her life, but about life itself."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh crafted this classic of lyrical meditations while on a private beach retreat on Florida's Captiva island, away from family and work. The book remains as fresh and meaningful today as when it first came out over a half century ago. Though most known as the wife of famous aviator, Anne was very accomplished in her own right as the first licensed woman glider pilot int the US, the author of 13 books, including Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead, in which she shared her pain at the kidnaping and murder of her infant son. In it, she wrote, \\"I must write it all out, at any cost. Writing is thinking. It is more than living, for it is being conscious of living.\\" Anne died on February 7, 2001 at the age of 94. Gift from the Sea, has sold more than three million copies during the past half-century, and has been translated into 45 languages.Lindbergh wrote this inspirational book for herself \\"in order to think out my own particular pattern of living, my own individual balance of life, work and human relationships. . . . \\" It became a bestseller among all who find the complexity and demands of life and work eroding their idea of who they are, why they are here and how to regain a more peace filled life. Of the beach and peace, Lindbergh writes: \\"Here there is time, time to be quiet, time to work without pressure, time to think, time to watch the heron, watching with frozen patience for his prey.\\"The beach is not a place to work, to answer long overdue letters, or read a half dozen books or even to arrive with the intent to do anything. At first it is a place to rest and descend into apathy:One is forced against one's mind, against all tidy resolutions, back into the primeval rhythms of the sea-shore. Rollers on the beach, wind in the pines, the slow flapping of herons across sand dunes, drown out the hectic rhythms of city and suburb, time tables and schedules. One falls under their spell, relaxes, stretches out prone. One becomes, in fact, like the element on which one lies, flattened by the sea; bare, open, empty as the beach, erased by today's tides of all yesterday's scribblings.During the second week her mind comes alive, and wanders and turns over like the gentle waves and a life that had drifted away with the ebb and flow of doing and being comes ashore as lessons from the sea. The gifts are in the form of rare sea shells that find their way up form the ocean floor like lost dreams and are deposited upon the sandy beach awaiting discovery and careful study which Anne does each evening..Each chapter of the book is titled for a different sea shell. A Double-Sunrise seashell, a Moon shell, an Oyster shell, or even an Argonaut all serve as metaphors through which Lindbergh reviews her life and obligations to work, family, marriages, children and career. In coming across a deserted Channeled whelk shell that was once home to a hermit crab, who mysteriously ran away and left his only shelter, Anne wonders about her own running away and how in comparison to this pear shaped beauty that winds in a gentle spiral, she sees her life as untidy, barnacled, a barely recognizable shape that now seeks the grace of inner peace.But I want first of all . . . to be at peace with myself. I want a singleness of eye, a purity of intention, a central core to my life that will enable me to carry out these obligations and activities as well as I can. I want, in fact - to borrow from the languages of the saints - to live \\"in grace\\" as much of the time as possible. . . . By grace I mean an inner harmony, essentially spiritual, which can be translated into outward harmony. I am seeking perhaps what Socrates asked for in the prayer from the Phaedrus when he said, \\"May the outward and inward man be at one.\\" I would like to achieve a state of inner spiritual grace from which I could function and give as I was meant to in the eye of God.The adaptable and tenacious Oyster Shell was her choice to represent the difficult middle years of marriage about which she writes:. . . marriage, which is always spoken of as a bond, becomes actually, in this stage, many bonds, many strands, of different texture and strength, making up a web that is taut and firm. The web is fashioned of love. Yes, but many kinds of love: romantic love first, then a slow-growing devotion and, playing through these, a constantly rippling companionship. It is made of loyalties, and interdependencies, and shared experiences. It is woven of memories of meetings and conflicts; of triumphs and disappointments. It is a web of communication, a common language, and the acceptance of lack of language, too; a knowledge of likes and dislikes, of habits and reactions, both physical and mental. It is a web of instincts and intuitions, and known and unknown exchanges. The web of marriage is made by propinquity, in the day to day living side by side, looking outward and working outward in the same direction.Ths is a book full of timeless insights, one that explores in exquisite language and imagery what is most important in life: a time to oneself, the need for spirituality, the dangers of \\"a life on multiplicity,\\" balance, creativity, inner strength solitude, intimacy and independence, and the shedding of masks. Gift from the Sea transcends gender boundaries and is like reading the shared confidences of a special friend. And of course, it makes for ideal beach reading,\\"The sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too greedy or too impatient,\\" she writes. \\"To dig for treasures shows not only impatience and greed, but lack of faith. Patience, patience, patience is what the sea teaches. Patience and faith. One should be empty, open, choiceless, as a beach waiting for a gift from the sea.\\""},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"There is much to gain by reading this book. This book captures the aspects of life and love by a woman's reflections while looking over her \\"Gifts from the sea.\\"This is a book that everyone (women and men) would benefit from reading sometime/anytime in their life.I enjoyed the simple style of the book. You can get into it easy, and then can't put it down.It's just beautiful. This book would be a great gift."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This is Anne Morrow Lindbergh's masterpiece.Ms. Lindbergh was a great writer. She had the ability to make a few words say a lot, to express the transcendant through the mundane. In none of her books does she do a better job than this one. In all of her writings Ms. Lindbergh shares a little part of herself; in this book, she shares her essence. One tends to feel, while reading her book, that one is receiving the confidences of a dear friend.Decades ago, after a brief perusal of Gift from the Sea, I concluded that it was a book for women. For years I gave away copies to female friends as Christmas gifts. More recently, I took a closer look and realized that it transcends gender boundaries. This book is for everyone who longs to find and maintain their spiritual center in the midst of a busy and hectic world. Take Gift to a quiet place in nature and read it alone. If you're like me, when you get to the end you'll want to whisper a word of thanks to the author.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"20 years or so ago this book stunned me with its timely message for women and artists. Recently I heard Anne Morrow Lindbergh's youngest child, Reeve, discussing the 50th anniversary release of her mother's book. She said her mother's sister thought Anne had gone to Captiva alone, intending to \\"write herself out of her marriage, but instead had written herself back into it.\\" Intrigued by this personal insight I took up my old copy and have started reading it again.I am now a few years older than she was when she wrote the book at mid-life. I amazed at how the book holds up, how relevant are her words to modern life and Feminism (with a captial \\"F\\" as she writes it), and her spot-on advice to artists of all media. Recent revelations that her American hero husband was a secret world-class philanderer, fathering at least seven illegimate children with three different European women, make the veiled anguish she must have been experiencing all the more poignant.Without whining or humbling herself, the author conveys with grace her personal truths, wrested in the quiet solitude of beachcombing. A spare and simple writer who yearned for a simple life, she must have been often overwhelmed by the complexities of her own. The seashell analogies are thoughtful and lovely, simple and clean as her writing. But this simple book of few pages requires a long and gentle read, made so by the inevitable introspection it will provoke. I hope that Anne Morrow Lindbergh achieved the inner peace she sought, because her simple words have surely been a gift to others."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This is a very touching book and it brings up many feelings that I needed to get in touch with.

I am glad now that I have it though, and that I got it first. Otherwise I might not have ordered it at all. It is well worth it... Now for the novel :-)"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. In concise, philosophical and thought-provoking language, Anne Morrow Lindbergh provides the reader with wonderful revelations of what it's like to be a modern woman. As the wife of Charles Lindbergh, she certainly felt the constraints of public engagements and social events, as well as the demands of being a wife and busy mother of five children. Perhaps that is why she was able to provide such a keen insight into the value of solitude and creativity.Often, in our \\"busy-ness,\\" we forget about maintaining and growing as individuals. Every man, woman and child needs time alone, every day, in which to nourish his soul. What joy can be found in creative tasks, even if they are as simple as arranging a vase of flowers or baking a batch of cookies. Women, by their very nature, wish to give. Sometimes, we give so much of ourselves that the well runs dry.Anne Morrow Lindbergh used her valuable vacation time on a remote island to replenish herself. There, she embraced the simple pleasures such as watching the ebb and flow of waves on the beach, collecting shells on the shore and strolling on the sand beneath the twinkling stars. She didn't need curtains to shelter the windows, cooked simply but well, and performed household chores only as necessary. She lived in the present, like a dancer perfectly poised in the here and now. In this special time, she found her center, replenishing the wellspring of who and what she was.Rarely have I read such a wonderful book! Every woman should own a copy for her personal library and if men seek to understand the true nature of women, they should read it as well. I applaud Anne Morrow Lindbergh's foresight and her rare ability to put into words what I feel deep inside my heart."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"My sister gave me this book on my 60th birthday.

Although it was written many decades ago, the challenges and issues faced by Anne Morrow Lindbergh are the same ones faced by women in today's crazy, bustling world. In fact, although women in Siberia, Cameroon, or Ceylon might not have her specific set of circumstances, they can still identify with Lindbergh's ponderings about a woman's life, her obligations, her relationships, and her needs. She lived in an upscale suburb of Connecticut and was the mother of five children, and yet there's something in her writing that can touch the souls of women everywhere whether in a grass hut or trailer beside a busy highwayThe chapters in Gift from the Sea center on Lindbergh's musings during a two-week vacation at the shore. Leaving husband, children, and house behind, she lives in a bare beach cabin without heat, telephone, plumbing, hot water, rugs, or curtains. She finds simplicity beautiful and longs to take it home to Connecticut when her vacation ends.Lindbergh takes a shell at a time and describes it in relation to other things in a woman's life. For instance, the moon shell reminds her that quiet time, solitude, contemplation, and \\"something of one's own\\" is needed. The double-sunrise represents the pure relationship found in early stages of friendship and marriage, and she reminds the reader that there is no permanent return to an old form of relationship since all are in the process of change. The oyster bed symbolizes the middle years of marriage and family, especially as the home itself grows and expands to accommodate the growing family.I first read this book when I was a young mother and could readily understand Lindbergh's comment that saints were so rarely married woman because of the distractions inherent in raising children and running a house. \\"Human relationships with their myriad pulls--woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life.\\" Now in midlife, I can better understand her affinity for all the shells as reminders that each cycle of the wave, the tide, and the relationship is valid."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I have never been a big fan of books on CD.

It is indeed as relevant today as it was fifty years ago and probably even more pertinent in today's fast paced world where we fail to slow down give ourselves alone time to comtemplate our lives.

She uses different kinds of sea shells to describe the phases of a woman's life. I first read this book more than 15 years ago and I have read it many times since. Although it was first written in the 1950s, many women reading it today can relate to what Mrs. Lindbergh has written in the book.

I felt that I read the words of a kindred spirit. Each essay was like a letter from a long lost friend.

The book has some wonderful insights about life in general, although I did not agree with all the conclusions. However, isn't that the reason we read--to learn new things and to challenge our current way of thinking. The book is about the reflections, while vacationing alone in a seaside house, of a woman living in the first half of the 20th century. A woman who lives in the upper class society (the top 1% in todays parlance). While many of her observations are valid, it would be interesting to know if she was able to live out her observations/reflections when she returned to the \\"real world\\" and if not, why not. As I said, this is primarily a woman's book, but an introspective guy might like it. Finally, the end of the book is poorly written--it seems to me that the author was not sure how to wrap it up and so just meandered to a close--thus, the 3 stars. The updated version of the book which has an introduction by the author's daughter really adds nothing to the originally other than giving some background info on the author--who was apparently an amazing woman. As the book continues to sell after all these years, it apparently speaks at a deeper level."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I'm afraid I'm going to get into trouble for writing this review because I believe I may be critical of one of the darlings of American Literature, especially a woman who was such a pioneer. For the most part, Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the wife of aviation legend Charles Lindbergh, is a poignant meditation of a woman's life, her role, her place in society, her demands of motherhood, wifedom, and her needs for solitude and inward contemplation. Lindbergh writes from her own experience while spending time alone in a cottage on an island far from her mainstay life. Each chapter is the name of a shell on the shore that she collects and that inspires her musings on life. She also discusses her feelings on approaching middle age.Though the book is well written, and well thought out, I found it at times to be bizarre and disconnected from the real world. Lindbergh spends time alone on her cottage, near the shore, away from her husband and five children. At times she actually advocates being away from one's children for as long as a month. Now I know Thoreau did this or something similar when he lived in a tiny log cabin in the woods alone for 2 years and 2 months, but he was not married and had no children. I find this type of experiment quite detached for a mother, and I can't say if she began this habit when her children were young, but to advise such a thing to me was strange.Lindbergh makes many analogies between seashells and life and though at times I found it poetic and moving, all the pieces didn't connect for me, and I felt these analogies forced. I also couldn't help that she was writing from a place of privilege (was she really making her children's beds when she was born into a privileged life and married to a famed aviator?). Her message is engaging--find time as a woman to cultivate your inner life in your own space, similar to what Virginia Woolf preached in her essay, A Room of One's Own. But Woolf didn't have any children; Lindbergh had five. You don't go to a cabin and leave your husband when you have five children to tend to. Why would you have five children then? Could a middle class woman who has everyday childcare and household responsibilities really do this?Another bizarre clip: she keeps mentioning love affairs, and how if we as women don't cultivate our inner life, we may be rushing off into a love affair. She had mentioned this several times, peppered throughout her book. A woman who has normal family responsibilities does not easily rush into a love affair, as far as I know. But then again, who knows? I only have one young child myself. Gift from the Sea is a sermon that's quite original. As a woman of privilege, Lindbergh could speak this way, but many other middle class women couldn't live this Thoreauvian life she depicts by the sea. A cottage on the sea, by the way, is probably very expensive too."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This is THE book for your feminine lifetime. It is not only a journey.... it's an adventure... and a healing. (+ reality check!)"},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"The life of a woman is complex. There is more to it than an average woman might realize. Anne Morrow Lindberg is definitely one woman who does not easily overlook all that is included in the life of a woman. In the same way she does not leave aspects of the sea unobserved. In her book, Gift from the Sea, Anne Lindberg examines various articles of the sea and not only sees the objects as what they logically are, but also as how they relate to a woman's life. The book is beneficial because it has a good scientific focus while still retaining a profound literary outlook and it's detail and description is sensible.In the novel, Lindberg describes things such as shells and then cleverly uses her observations as analogies for life. The inclusion of the life comparison is how she attains the literary outlook that is present in the book. After describing the moon shell's \`smooth circles winding inward to the tiny core', Lindberg then states that it is a reminder that we must be alone even for an hour or a few minutes a day to remain in touch with our core. The observing of the double sunrise and how it has a hinge binding two shells together is ingeniously used as a metaphor for relationships.The book is not very difficult to read because it uses everyday terms and an extensive scientific background is not necessary to follow along with the author. Because Lindberg's diction is not difficult to understand, she can focus more on explaining each item and the description of each is more rational. Because Lindberg is not tedious in her describing of objects the reader's attention is kept throughout the book. They are illustrated until the reader has a clear picture of the item in their mind. Just as she has done this she goes into comparing the object to life and the reader is able to see how it relates to their own life as well.Anne Morrow Lindberg has written an enjoyable yet significant novel which many woman would enjoy reading. Her diction is colorful and to the point and does not allow the reader to lose interest or the desire to read on. The scientific focus is evident but not in excess, she has achieved a perfect balance between science and literature in her book, Gift from the Sea."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I haven't finished the book yet, because it is pretty blah...its not even a long book!

Her analogies to sea shells didn't add anything for me. Her comments on feminism in the last chapter, which was added in 1975, give the impression that this is a book for feminists.If you want reading about calming your life, a good way to start is to read books by Albert Ellis.

Amazingly the author used the imagery of shells as a symbol of the different stages in a woman's life.

Especially memorable was a section of \\"simplifying one's life\\", and to take to to reconcile our personal needs without feeling guilty about doing something for us.For those of you who are not familiar with this lovely book, the author was a mother, and wife to pilot Charles Lindbergh. Although the book was first written some 55 years ago, the message is still important to today's modern woman It is important to finds personal fulfillment in life. You must find the right balance and inner peace within yourself, before you can share those qualities with others.This little gem of a book should be read by every woman trying who tires to do everything for everyone.

We need to find out what it means to us. What is the purpose? Where do we go from here? Anne Morrow Lindbergh did just that when she went to an island beach alone for two weeks and, while there, wrote a book called \\"Gift From The Sea.\\" Anne made the transition to her retreat by leaving behind a New York suburbia house, five children, and the many other hats she put on to fulfill her role in the community and as a wife. She not only went to the beach to write, but also to find and shape her life.What she found was even more valuable. It came to her as a gift from nature without requiring anything from her in return. The gift nature gave Anne was the gift of seashells. She went on to write in the most eloquent and descriptive language about the shells she found. She described how each one related to her life and how the simplicity of the beach was transformational. In her book, the \\"Moon Shell\\" represents the encumbrances we experience in life by its attachments. The \\"Double-Sunrise\\" shell exhibits the qualities of how we love, and the \\"Argonauta\\" distinguishes the final freedom we have to be independent, while still loving another person.The \\"Moon Shell\\" is representative of a snail shell in which its inhabitants leave to gain freedom. Anne's life had paralleled this type of escape, if even for only two weeks. When she looks at this shell, she sees the beauty of the simple lines - unlike her life in New York - which she compares to being a shell covered in barnacles. Her life had grown complicated and she felt like she lost the simple shape and design of her life in many ways. Anne was a business woman, a mother, a wife, and a member of society with many social duties. Her life was scattered and frantic. She felt like she had to wear a mask - so much so - that in doing so, she lost herself. Perhaps the \\"Double-Sunrise\\" shell would help in her journey to find her true shape and nature.The \\"Double-Sunrise\\" shell is the type of shell that is double winged. With its amazing pink and peach hues, if you found one on the beach, you would see that the color and magnificence of the lines were simply remarkable. Just like first love's beauty, Anne remembered this feeling as she gazed at the shell. It symbolized feeling at one with another person - so that if they left your side for a just a moment - it would mean utter death. Looking at the shell, she remembered feeling her heart beat simultaneously with another, and knowing the love was so strong that nothing else mattered. This was the kind of love Anne first remembered when looking at the shell. After questioning if this type of love was real, she assessed it was as real as anything in the world could be, even if only for a brief moment in eternity. Practical love and duties would eventually take over - she muses - as she comments on the other shells and forms of love and marriage.The ultimate shell she eventually finds is the \\"Argonauta.\\" The \`Argonauta\\" shell houses rare creatures that are not fastened to the shell at all, and Anne is looking for this type of freedom to shape her life. Yes, we can have a house, a body, a family, and all of the things the world gives us, but to become so undeniably detached from them, would be achieving perfect freedom. This is an evolutionary process that usually only occurs once we have come of age. She relates the process of the trees coming from the same source. They are individual, yet together, as their branches reach out and touch each other, each branch being the same, yet intrinsically different. As with the changing tides, the \\"Argonauta\\" shell will remind Anne of the changing tides and cycles of life."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"This book is a gem of feminine insight and should be required reading (I truly hate that term, but in this case, it is valid)for women over 30. Not to mention women who plan to reach 30. I recall having this book forced down our immature throats injunior high English class, when the book first came out to critical acclaim in the late 50's. This seemed ill-advised, as the subject matter, plus lack of plot and character development or even characters in the first place, proved quite beyond the limited literary appreciation of the class.Half a lifetime later, while perusing the dusty shelves of a used book store, I came across a copy of that almost forgotten book, presented so enthusiastically but naively by my long-ago English teacher. Now, as an adult, I decided to give it mature consideration; Ic can't believe what a treasure I had in my hands--how I had missed these pearls of human wisdom for decades! But it is never too late to recognize a jewel between covers.The author felt impelled to take a retreat on an almost deserted island--perhaps to reflect at lesiure upon her roles as daughter, sister, wife, mother, woman and human being. As she strolls carelessly along the soothingly indifferent shore, she can not resist picking up vairous shells--all gifts, as it were, from the sea. Considering each type at length at days' end, she realizes that these various shells represent the the different stages of a woman's life. The bivalves, like butterly shells, remind her of the marriage bonds; the chambered nautilus reflects her home, which needs more rooms as the family expands. For Lindbergh each shell fills a special niche in the multitudinous roles which is a woman's privilege to perform. So I invite all thoughtful, sensitive women to plunge their hands into the foamy surf and contemplate the gifts from the sea...of Life. Don't be afraid to recall the stages of your own past, for all personal struggles have validity in one's private destiny. Lindbergh's gift to humanity is a her tender but timeless insight."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"\\"I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women,\\" Anne Morrow Lindbergh writes. \\"The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery.\\"Using the illustration of shells from the sea, Anne Morrow Lindbergh clears away the clutter of life, pares it down to its most simple form, that of an internal life that lends clarity to the externals. Each section of the book is a different shell, and a different lesson learned. Peace within one's self, simplicity, clarity, joy, the validity of each cycle and era of a lifetime, strength, and wholeness are just some of the lessons she imparts.In about 50 years things have not become any less complicated, and this short, simple little book is even more relevant to our busy and noisy modern lives. The lesson one takes away from the book is not how to get rid of all the things, but how to find a calm, still center within one's self to maintain sanity, and that need never change, no matter what the distractions might be."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh was ahead of her time when she wrote Gift From the Sea.

Having lost her first child to kidnapping and murder, it must have been very difficult for her to find a purpose to start over and bear other children. One reads between the lines and realizes that only in going deep within in solitude can one's soul be healed. One must give herself/himself time and not rush into busyness, looking for new relationships, new books to read, movies to see, or hiding your emotions, you have to play the whole thing out or you will perish. There are many situations we have to die to, to lose control of, and not try to possess. We have to detach ourselves, not by becoming indifferent but compassionate. Only then will we find peace of mind and soul. Anthony De Mello in his book: Sadhana: Way to GodSadhana, a Way to God: Christian Exercises in Eastern Formalso explores with us the joy that comes from detaching ourselves from any preconceived endings.

The Lindberghs had a summer cabin on the beach. Anne relished the time she spent at the cabin alone, free from the worries and petty details of raising five children. One summer, she decided to write out her daily meditations, and the result is found here in this slim book.Inspired by the seashells she found washed up on the shore, Lindbergh has arranged the book in chapters based on analogies with types of shells. Although the writing was produced in one particular summer in the 1950s, the topics of the chapters are timeless. The chapter on simplicity has become a classic in the simplicity literature, and some readers may already be familiar with its content through encountering excerpts elsewhere. Besides simplicity, Lindbergh also discusses the need for taking time for oneself to rest, and how this need is particularly strong for caregivers (like mothers of small children). She reflects on the types and stages of intimate relationships, and ways to nourish closeness between partners. When I first picked up the book, I figured I would read it cover to cover in an hour or so and move on to something else. But the content of the book was so thought-provoking, I soon put the brakes on, slowing my reading pace down to savor every word. The book is short and simple, but very profound."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I can only echo those who rave about this book.

A source of inspiration to read over and over."},{"Title":"Gift From the Sea","review":"I picked up Anne Morrow Lindbergh's &quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; with a good deal of trepidation. The Oprahfication of America has too often brought the sexes into warring opposition. So much so that when men or women write about what it means to be men and women, they can't seem to resist taking backhanded swipes at the value of one another. At the time, I did not know that &quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; was so old...I figured it would be the same stuff we see too much of today rehashed in pleasant warm-fuzzy, faux spiritual fashion to fit the market. I stand corrected.Mrs. Lindbergh shows herself to be an author of deep insight, intellectual honesty and true caring. As she reflected on each shell she found on the beach and related them to life not only as a woman (although it is a central theme) but as a human in our modern times (it still fits--even fifty years later), I was swept up into her thoughts and dazzled by her soul.Lindbergh finds much worth in what we are when all the noise of our surroundings is stripped away. She seeks to cling to this essence and bring it to bear as she reenters to tempest of everyday life. I can relate to this.&quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; reminds me forcefully of what David said in the seventeenth Psalm. He cries out to the one who has made him. He asks that God keep him as the apple of his eye--to allow him to seek shelter in shadow of his wings. This is a cry for protection but also for a wholeness we all lack, whatever the age we live in. I believe Morrow Lindbergh's words echo this. David concludes with these words:&quot;And I--in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness&quot; (v. 15).May we all!

In between he tells the biographies (too often tragic)of such luminaries of the musical heaven as Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Rossini, Verdi, Puccini, Mahler, Richard Strauss,Berlioz, Dvorak, Janacek, Sibelieus and several others.What the book does not do is to analyze individual pieces composed by the composers discussed.The book can be enjoyed by a general reader as well as classical music fan who wants to know:1. Details of the biographies of the composeers2. A knowledge of what the political and social mileu was inwhich the artist worked. (For instance you will learn about what the London and Paris, Vienna and Berlin, Milan and Naples of Europe were like. You will learn European politics and go to several wars.

It was thus no wonder that the boy suffered from hallucinations.' - The Lives and Times of the Great Composers, pg. 474There are startling, or new, or witty observations like this on practically every page of this meticulously researched 984-page book that chronicles the lives of the great composers and the times in which they lived. I have been reading such books for nigh on fifty years and yet I found something new and instructive frequently in this marvelously written book. Michael Steen studied at London's Royal College of Music but later made a career in the City. He writes in a graceful style that urges the reader on.There are chapters devoted to individual composers (or groups such as 'Glinka and The Five') from Handel to Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten. Lesser composers are remarked upon in the many interesting digressions contained within the main chapters. One certainly gets a sense of the social and political ambiance of the times under discussion, and Steen makes an effort to draw connections between those events and the works written in their midst. There are many illustrations including maps, pictures of the composers and other musicians and other cultural figures of the times. There is something here for the neophyte as well as for the grizzled music history buff like me. Clearly great thought was given by the author and by Oxford University Press to the arrangement and presentation of the book and it could hardly be bettered.An enthusiastic recommendation. (Even in spite of the few howlers like this one: When talking about Dvor&aacute;k's sojourn in the US, Britisher Steen says the composer spent time in Spillville in 'Iowa, Massachusetts').Scott Morrison"},{"Title":"The Lives and Times of the Great Composers","review":"I am not a professional musicologist, just a passionate amateur. I read a lot of musical biography and such, so I was pleasantly surprised to see just how much I learned from this book. It is a real joy to read, the sort of book one doesn't want to end. In my view, it is generally balanced and fair (though the chapters on Wagner and R. Strauss come close to assassination at times). Rather like Edward Gibbon, Steen lives out his sex life in his footnotes, which are often hilarious. The book is elaborately, even tediously, documented; but the source notes are in the back, so as not to distract from the text notes. This is not a book on music; it is a book on composers: biography not musicology. (As Steen explains in a humorous introduction, music is about cellos, biography about fellows.)I really enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. At the risk of sounding petty, I wish that so distinguished publisher as Oxford could have employed an editor to rid this otherwise fine work of numerous grammatical errors. But put down your red pen for a while and just have a good time with Steen's exploration of Western music."},{"Title":"The Lives and Times of the Great Composers","review":"It's \\"The Lives and Times of the Great Composers\\". Not \\"The Lives and Works of the Great Composers\\". There's a significant difference. As Michael Steen points out in his introduction:-\\"The art of BiographyIs different from Musicography.Musicography is about cellosBut Biography is about fellows\\".This is very much a book about fellows; it is certainly not an introduction to classical music for the beginner, but appears to be written for those who are already familiar with the Classical repertoire and want to know more about the personal lives of those who wrote it. It is essentially a series of potted biographies of famous composers, concentrating less on their works than on their finances and their love lives and also, often, on the political background against which they wrote. That phrase \\"and Times\\" in the title is significant too; Steen clearly has a good knowledge of European political history and wants to make maximum use of it.It is always going to be a matter of debate which composers deserve the label \\"great\\", and fashions in musical greatness tend to vary over the years. Bach's music was regarded as unfashionable for nearly a century after his death. Mozart was not venerated in the late nineteenth century in the way he is today. It is unlikely that a book with this title published fifty years earlier would have included Mahler; today it would be virtually impossible to exclude him.Steen's emphasis in this book is very much on the nineteenth century, possibly reflecting his own personal preferences. The Baroque period is represented by Handel and Bach alone, and then it's straight on to Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Even a figure as familiar to the modern concert-goer as Vivaldi is omitted. Only two composers born after 1900 (Britten and Shostakovich) are covered at all, and no composer born in the final third of the nineteenth century has a whole chapter dedicated to him. Modernist atonal composers are omitted altogether. Even among nineteenth century composers there are some surprises, with Bruckner possibly the most surprising omission and Scriabin the most surprising inclusion (apart from the minor members of the Russian \\"mighty handful\\" who get in by association with the likes of Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov). The entries on some big names are surprisingly brief; Dvorak, for example, is lumped in with Smetana, Janacek and Bartok as a \\"Central European Nationalist\\", although that may be less a reflection on the quality of his music than on the fact that his life was not very eventful.Any music-lover will be able to think of his own particular favourite whom he would like to have seen included, but that is not really a criticism of the book. Any attempt to increase the number of composers covered would have either led to the book becoming impossibly bulky or to a reduction in the length of individual entries, which would have made it indistinguishable from a biographical dictionary. My own criticism would be that I would have liked to have seen more about music and less about politics. To take an example, was it really necessary to take up three of the ten pages devoted to Edvard Grieg with a discussion of the Dreyfus affair? (His Piano concerto, however, possibly his greatest work, only merits a few lines). Steen's justification for bringing French politics into a discussion of a Norwegian composer was that Grieg played a very minor part in this affair, refusing an invitation to conduct in Paris in protest at the way Dreyfus had been treated. Oddly, however, Steen ignores altogether Grieg's support for Norway's independence from Sweden, something achieved two years before his death.Events such as the War of the Austrian Succession or the Crimean War may be of great interest in themselves, but here they are given more prominence than one might expect in a book on music. I felt that political matters like these only needed to be dealt with in depth where composers were directly caught up in them (e.g. Wagner's participation in the 1848 revolutions) or where they directly affected their music. Beethoven's music, for example, would doubtless have been very different had there been no French Revolution or Napoleonic Wars, and one cannot understand Shostakovich without reference to Soviet cultural politics.Although Steen states that detailed musical analysis was beyond the scope of his book, there are times when I felt there should have been a greater emphasis on the music written by his subjects. To take an example, I would not have expected in a book of this nature a lengthy disquisition on all five movements of Beethoven's \\"Pastoral Symphony\\", but I would have welcomed a mention of the fact that Beethoven wrote it, if only because the fact that he had a deep love of nature and was inspired by that love to write one of his finest works would have acted as an antidote to the general picture given of Beethoven as a grumpy, reclusive, drink-sodden misanthrope.Beethoven is not alone in having a negative picture drawn of his character; a lot of others come off equally badly. Steen writes of Puccini that, apart from Janacek, he is \\"probably the least likeable of all the composers described in this book\\", but does not say why he finds either man so obnoxious. (To be less likeable than Wagner is no mean feat, and if Steen's allegations about Tchaikovsky are correct he was not only a deeply unhappy man but also a deeply unpleasant one). Certainly, both Puccini and Janacek were serial womanisers, and compulsively unfaithful to their wives, but they were far from being alone in that. Indeed, miserably unhappy marriages are a recurring theme in this book, Elgar being singled out as a rare exception. Sometimes I felt that it was the wives who the subject of unfair criticism. Steen writes of Berlioz being \\"caught between two dreadful women\\"; this may be true of his mistress Marie Recio, but I have always felt sorry for his wife Harriet. Someone should have taken her on one side and told her that a man who writes a programme symphony depicting, inter alia, his own execution on a charge of uxoricide is unlikely to prove an ideal husband.There were a few errors, most surprising being the statement that Mahler completed his tenth symphony, which was famously left unfinished at his death. The French president who sent troops to Rome in 1849 was Louis Napoleon, not Cavaignac, and Mussorgsky's birthplace Karevo is 250 miles south-east of St Petersburg, not south-west (which would place it in Latvia).Overall there is a lot of useful biographical information in this book, but I felt that Steen fell into the same trap as Bill Bryson did when writing about scientists in his recent \\" Short History of Nearly Everything\\", that of writing about famous men with insufficient reference to what they did to become famous. The subjects of this book are, after all, famous because of the music they wrote, not because of their personal eccentricities or the number of women they slept with."},{"Title":"The Lives and Times of the Great Composers","review":"I have not yet read the whole book, since I don't think it particularly lends itself to this kind of reading; but I read the chapter on Mahler very carefully, since I have read all books on him (including the multivolume LaGrange's); as well as evaluating the book on this chapter (perhaps not fair, but I felt to publish my preliminary caveats anyway)I found the book very interesting but there are enough caveats that I recommend one either see whether the book satisfies you by looking at parts of it first, or be prepared to return it.General faults, in my opinion, are:(1) There are many places where statements have no relation to what is being discussed.Example: On page 747, there is a six-line paragraph which states in the beginning the relationship of Hugo Wolf and Mahler with the association of the former's songs to some of Mahler's works (very good; I learned an association I did not know.) Then on line 5 we learn that Wolf died of syphilis (what's the connection?). On the same (5th) line we learn that the two 'at times' slept in the same bed (!). and after a semicolon is stated \\"they often lived on cheese-parings\\" (no footnote explaining what this is, nor its relevance), and slept 'rough'. I also do not know what 'sleeping rough' means, or what is has to do with the disjointed statements--all in six lines!(2) I did not notice, as found by another, any typos, but surely (page 761) 'The Tenth was completed (!) the following year . .\\" is not so.(3) There are about 4500 (!) references at the back of the book indicating his profusion of listing practically anything and everything written about Mahler. There seems to be no selectivity in the quotes (and therefore the 4500 references.)(4) Very frequently the profusion of numbered references seem to be just a thorough collection of any and all references to M.(5) At the bottom of each page there are explanations with stars and daggers -- some of which have no relation to the text: On page 764 there is a starred footnote relative to the text statement of M's sailing to Europe. The note tells of a Dr. Crippen (never mentioned before or after) being arrested on the ship eight months earlier (!), and a statement of the Titanic sinking after M's death. !?!?!?Summary: There is much of interest, whether 'more' or 'less' depending on the reader. There is no editing, little attempt in many places for one statement to follow the other ( = organization), and in many places I got the distinct impression that this was (to misquote Mr. Bush) 'no fact left behind'.This is a good book; but it could have been edited and organized much better, which would have made for more pleasant reading.You be the judge."},{"Title":"The Lives and Times of the Great Composers","review":"The book came promptly from Amazon in excellent condition.

Over the last several decades, the average size of a family, and of a household, has steadily decreased. Several factors contribute to this decline, more frequent divorce, more independent elderly and children, etc. This decline makes average &quot;family income&quot; and &quot;household income&quot; very misleading measures of changing wealth, because these statistics measure the income of fewer and fewer people as time passes. &quot;Household income&quot; rose little between the seventies and mid-nineties for example, according to the Census Bureau's annual household survey, but individual income (per capita income) rose steadily in the same period. Not surprisingly, as people become wealthier, they choose to live more independently, in smaller groups. If we accept &quot;family income&quot; or &quot;household income&quot; as a measure of wealth, rather than per capita income, we're assuming that six people living in one house with an income of $50k are richer than six people living in two houses, each with three people earning $40k. Of course, this assumption is absurd."},{"Title":"It's Getting Better All the Time: 100 Greatest Trends of the Last 100 years","review":"Moore is president of the conservative Club for Growth and has been a vociferous spokesperson for slashing taxes and reducing the size of government. He is well known for twisting the facts and employing faulty statistics to prove his point. An example of this is relying upon per capita income rather than the more widely accepted (and more revealing) family income.Clearly, many of the trends described in the book are what most people, including myself, would agree to be improvements over the past 100 years. From educational and environmental improvements to declining poverty rates for the elderly, these are good things.However, many of the improvements they list could be ascribed to the big government they loathe. The improvements in the environment which Moore and Simon laud did not come about because industry volunteered to restrict their emission of pollutants. Those improvements came about because of government legislation and adequate tax revenues to enforce it. For example, Detroit automakers refused to increase fuel efficiency until legislation required it, just as they refused seatbelts. It could also be argued that the improvements in education are the result of government intervention. Likewise, elderly poverty rates. Even the Internet we are using this very moment was ultimately derived from the Department of Defense.Moore and Simon also never discuss the growing disparity in wealth in the United States, in which inequality has grown since the late 1960's. This inequality, as quantified by the Gini Index, shows the U.S. with greater inequality than any other industrial or &quot;wealthy&quot; nation. While those at the top control ever more wealth, there is less for those at the bottom of the ladder. Sure, the poor in America are mostly better off than in a third world country, but it doesn't follow that that's good enough.In all, I'd say there are some reasonable points made here, but Moore and Simon paint a picture that is somewhat brighter than reality."},{"Title":"It's Getting Better All the Time: 100 Greatest Trends of the Last 100 years","review":"Potential readers of this book have a right to know that this book was not authored by Julian Lincoln Simon, as the title indicates. Rather, the book was authorized, or commissioned, by the late Professor Simon shortly before his lamentable death. Although Professor Simon did agree to collaborate with Mr. Moore on a book, and fully intended to write a book along these lines, and prepared some material for a possible use in a manuscript (and we have no way of knowing if any of this material was indeed used, and in what form), the final text is most likely not what Mr. Simon had in mind. After receiving permission from the Simon estate to go ahead with the project, Mr. Moore freely chose to engage in a comical sort of economic, environmental and social axe-grinding, as opposed to a balanced, well-reasoned exposition on some of the more remarkable trends in human history. A comparison of this text to any other book written by Dr. Simon while he was alive would demonstrate a difference as clear as night and day.Now, let me be clear on what this book really is. The book's introduction, written by Mrs. Simon, contains the greatest amount of useful and objective information in the book, and it is where the truth about the contents of the book are told. As for the rest of the book, the motivation for and the assummptions underlying the text are explicitly stated and are as follows: big (and thus bad) government is bad and unnecessary, America's founding fathers are right about everything and are Great Thinkers, (high) taxes should be lowered (even if they are already low by comparison), all government regulation interferes unnecessarily with free enterprise, and freedom and democracy are things that everyone can take for granted. Therefore, in the service of these assumptions and motivations, the book suffers from a glaringly selective presentation of the 'facts'.The text has many problems from the standpoints of content, presentation and point of view, and these problems are too numerous to fully explore here. Although Mr. Moore talks much about exploring the improvement of humanity's lot, virtually every single example of 'improvement' or 'progress' is from the American context, and from this, Mr. Moore would like us to believe that, via extrapolation, the improvements seen in America have also occurred, at about the same level, everywhere else in the world. This alone reveals a level of myopia and intellectual naivete that quite frankly is very unhealthy and dangerous. Mr. Moore would like us to believe that everyone lives like Americans do (or at least yearns to), even when overwhelming evidence shows this clearly not to be the case.The text also employs some very bad intellectual sleights of hand, making the information in the text fall below that of even the minimum academic ethical standard. For example, in each of his 100 trends, operational definitions are not clearly and specifically established, and in some rather disturbing cases, only the data which will establish a clear upward or downward trend is presented, but the full range of data somehow do not find its way into the graph. Undergraduate-level mistakes in statistical analysis, such as presenting data in terms of number of incidences as opposed to rates (per capita) of incidences, comparing one snapshot under one condition in time to another snapshot under completely different conditions, and most important, the failure to adequately disclose underlying causes of phenomena before jumping to conclusions, abound in the text. Finally, if one merely played with the definitions, or simply played with the calculations for the statistics cited, as Mr. Moore has done, one could make the very same conclusions that Mr. Moore makes.In particular, one blurb on Page 2 of the book brings home the misguided message and deeply malicious intellectual trickery of the book. Here, the author notes that according to an article in the Associated Press, which noted that one of the hottest selling grocery items in the year 2000 was gourmet pet food, and that one of the most challenging nutritional problems in America is obesity- not in people but in pets. The author uses this to demonstrate how affluent we Americans have become, and as a proxy, albeit a comical one, of (American) socio-economic improvement. Yet it also hammers home two disturbing and depressing points- a greater concern, matched with an extensive outlay, for pet health in America (even as one in three Americans go without adequate health coverage), and the truly depressing fact that pets in America receive better health care as a group than most human inhabitants of the planet- especially those of the third world. Examples like this do not adequately show 'progress' or 'improvement', and the author uses these and other equally egregious socio-economic snapshots and trends to pooh-pooh the notion that the situation in the world is very bad. Perversely, they demonstrate how grossly out of touch the author and many Americans have become with the state of most non-American humanity.I believe the real title of this book should be: It's Getting Better FOR AMERICANS All The Time, as the biased examples of this book clearly demonstrate. Furthermore, as long as no one asks thorny questions such as: Which Americans? or Is it getting better for Americans on an equal basis? or It Is Getting For Americans, But At Whose Expense?, I expect the author to encounter few if any problems. For those readers having little or no background in basic statistics and no prior knowledge of the various topics in the book, I recommend that they read Damned Lies and Statistics by Joel Best for both clarification and enlightenment. Otherwise, given Mr. Moore's clear intention to distort issues, I fear that many gullible but inquisitive readers will be harmfully misled.In sum, this book will appeal to those who would greatly prefer to have others do their thinking for them, and who need reassurance of their belief that everything is just fine in their little corner of the world. Given that we live in what one man called a Global Village, and given the inter-connectedness of political, social and economic activity in the modern Global Village, that a book like this of such dubious intellectual merit can be taken literally and seriously by many Americans truly boggles the mind.God Help America."},{"Title":"It's Getting Better All the Time: 100 Greatest Trends of the Last 100 years","review":"I am a great Julian Simon / Bj&ouml;rn Lomborg fan, but this book has a limited number of mostly useless diagrams, especially from non-US perspective.

Their rigorous compilation of data on the continued ability of free market economies to create an ever rising surplus for all people is unsurpassed. I read Simon's &quot;State of Humanity&quot; a couple of years ago and it was equally as informative. Alm &amp; Cox's &quot;Myths of the Rich and Poor&quot; also correlates with the data presented in this book.An interesting phenomena occurs when you present this book to die-hard socialists. They continue to disclaim its validity by eg. citing the disparity between CEO compensation and the bottom 25% of the population. In fact they present you with statistics of their own which seemingly refute the data in this book. When you probe and ask them how their statistics were compiled they become evasive and fuzzy, but they continue to rely on them to underpin their position. They engage in the fallacy of inductive logic which consists of reasoning from the particular to the general i.e. if they used the Canadian health care system for a cough and they were satisfied with the results of their medical care then ipso facto such a system is good. In addition it's better than the U.S. system because it's cheaper, etc. They ignore all the other inputs and outputs that any cursory economic study would investigate. It's almost like they would suffer an emotional crisis if they had to accept relity i.e. like the conclusions in this book. Why this is so would be worthy of continued discussion, but the need to denigrate solid evidence seems neccessary in order to retain their sense of self.Emotional trauma, provided by irrefutable evidence contrary to a belief system, seems to erode one's certainty in adhering to a false construct; but results are uneven and take long periods of time to penetrate society. Statistics, such as we have here, are younger than our century, and have only been subject to accurate number crunching coincident with the rise of the main frame computer (in the 60's). The authors should continue to educate the people. A constitutional republic such as ours works best with the input of an educated citizenry. Kudos to Moore and Simon, may he rest in peace."},{"Title":"It's Getting Better All the Time: 100 Greatest Trends of the Last 100 years","review":"There is much excellent information here to gladden the heart of people who are gloomily convinced--as I once was--that the world is going to hell in a handbasket.This book is obviously intended as a reference guide. As such, sometimes the material seems a little shallow. And while very meticulously documented, on occasion the source citations are a little too vague for my tastes. For example, a chart on water pollution trends (on page 189) only cites the &quot;various years&quot; of the Council on Environmental Quality's Annual Report, and only shows numbers for 1972, 1982, and 1992, without showing us clearly whether an actual trend is visible.Despite these minor flaws, this is an excellent reference guide showing the often startlingly positive outlook for humanity on planet earth.

The chattering classes continue to repeat the Marxist slogan that the poor have fallen behind while the idle rich have gotten richer by stealing from the poor. But this rare optimistic book knocks those arguments cold. As a civilization, Americans are healthier, smarter, wealthier, happier, than at any time in America or the world at any point in civilization. There is not such a thing as the so-called &quot;good old days.&quot; Today is the good old days, as is the future. In this book, you will see that by any measurement, the American people have continued to make lasting and important changes. From inventions to wealth to health and education, we have made remarkable progress and should be proud that we have a civilization that has encouraged us to do so. And this book will provide the evidence needed to rebuke the annoying liberal noisemakers such as Michael Moore who continue to look to the welfare-states of Europe as the utopian view of the future.Michael Gordon"},{"Title":"It's Getting Better All the Time: 100 Greatest Trends of the Last 100 years","review":"I like never read so-called \\"nonfiction.\\" It's all fiction, except that what people call fiction is a lot funner. We'd all be better off everyone would admit nonfiction is made up. But this Cato Institution has put out a roller coaster here, even if it pushes itself as nonfiction. Someone lent me this one, or I would've never touched it. Glad I did, because all the stat lists were a total liftoff. My only worry is that these authors might think they're talking about reality, like nonfiction writers usually mistake themselves doing. But that possibility doesn't bother me, I'm not a big worry wart about what authoirs think they're doing, just so I'm entertained. The great fantasy that got me rolling in this book, and I'm a big fan of fantasy, is the idea that reality is something cozy and mama-like, all whispery and gootchy-goo like this big picture these guys here are painting. I'd a bought it it as SF, long as I'm thinking I'm in some other universe, then this story takes me out of reality as long as I'm reading it. But then, like happens with any good fantasy, after being riveted a couple hours, I sit back, and scratchy dull old reality comes back down.

Not this time. I will only surf across this compendium of positive human progress.You must buy the book, absorb it carefully, and present its contents continually to those who don't recognize they live in the golden days of our nation.Golden AgeThe central premise of It's Getting Better All the Time, published in 2001 by the Cato Institute, is that there has been more improvement in the human condition in the past 100 years than in all of the previous centuries combined.That is a difficult premise to accept for those who hear and read the daily news of school shootings, homelessness, AIDS, global warming, declining student test scores, and a widening gap between rich and poor. Yet over the course of the twentieth century, by nearly every measure of the human condition, life has improved dramatically.Be it health, wealth, nutrition, education, speed of transportation and communications, leisure time, the proliferation of computers and the Internet, or gains for women, minorities, and children--these all demonstrate an amazing improvement of the human condition.While much of the rest of the world lags behind the United States, the same trends are nevertheless evident nearly everywhere. And of even greater importance is the fact that freedom is expanding across the globe and tyranny is on the defensive wherever it exists.Woes of YesteryearIf you are not convinced the human condition is improving, the authors call your attention to a picture of life but a century ago. It was an era of tuberculosis, typhoid, sanitariums, child labor, horse manure, candles, Jim Crow laws, 12-hour work days, and premature death. One child in four perished before his or her 14th birthday.While 100 years ago parents lived in very real fear of their children dying, today, the authors point out, middle-income suburban parents live in fear of their child not making the soccer all-star team.A hundred years ago, industrial cities were enveloped in smoke, streets smelled of garbage, and the automobile was correctly hailed as a pro-environment invention that would lead to the reduction of the filth associated with horses. Cancer was not a primary cause of death then because most Americans were doomed by infectious diseases, not living long enough to develop degenerative cancers.Perhaps no fact in this book is more impressive than this: Most Americans who are considered poor today have access to a quality of housing, food, heath care, consumer products, entertainment, communications, and transportation that even the superrich Vanderbilts, Carnegies, and Rockefellers did not enjoy in their day.Numerous AdvancesCoauthors Julian Simon and Stephen Moore believe the three most important developments that made all this possible are electricity, modern drugs, and the microchip. The book chronicles the past 100 years through advances in 14 categories, offering charts and graphs to show every significant advance in these areas:Health: Almost all the major killer diseases before 1900--tuberculosis, typhoid, smallpox, whooping cough, polio, and malaria--have been eradicated in the United States.Nutrition: The price of food is now below 10 percent of family income. After spending thousands of years trying to satisfy man's caloric needs, we're now trying to eat less, for health reasons.Children: Child labor has been eliminated in the developed world, and it is rare that children do not survive to adulthood.Incomes: Real per-capita income in the United States has quadrupled in the past century.Poverty: Poverty, by any measure, is declining rapidly in the United States.Work: Before 1900 most work was physically demanding drudgery, low-paying, and monotonous. Such work is the exception today.Recreation and leisure: Recreation, sports, dining out, and enjoying professional entertainment are central to American life today.Housing: In 1900, less than one in five U.S. homes had running water, flushing toilets, a vacuum cleaner, and gas or electric heat.Transportation, computers, education, environment, natural resources, and the status of women and minorities round out the book's evidence with similar dramatic advances.Individualism vs. StatismThe authors note America got rich earlier and to a greater extent than all other nations because nowhere else has the entrepreneurial spirit been nurtured as it has been here. Government assistance has had little to do with our progress, they observe.While we now have substantial prosperity and large government programs, the government has been a consequence of our economic growth rather than a cause of it.In fact, almost every great tragedy of the twentieth century has been a result of too much government, not too little. Nazism, socialism, communism, Marxism, and apartheid were all simply fancy names for statism, the unreasonable government control over the lives and liberties of citizens. Over 100 million people perished as a result of these tyrannical governments in the twentieth century.Reassuringly, the authors are as optimistic about the future as they are pleased with recent advances. They predict increases in wealth and health, declining prices for natural resources, improvements in agriculture, further reduction in disease, more abundant free markets--and the continuing embarrassment of doomsayers who routinely predict planetary catastrophe.It is a shame Simon, who died in February 1998 just a few days short of his 66th birthday, did not live longer to see more of his optimism come true.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jay Lehr ([...]) is science director for The Heartland Institute."},{"Title":"It's Getting Better All the Time: 100 Greatest Trends of the Last 100 years","review":"Negative and disturbing news sells, but is it the truth?

Mautner memorial lectures)","review":"In the Introduction to the 'Strange Theory of Light and Matter' Feynman tells us that what he likes to talk about is the \\"part of physics that is known, rather than a part that is unknown.\\" And he goes on to give us a thumbnail sketch, a \\"physicist's history of physics,\\" which shows how physicist's, in their quest to describe the world, continually reduce a group of seemingly unrelated phenomenon to a single phenomenon. So heat and sound were found, thanks to Newton, to be reducible to laws of motion, while electricity, magnetism and light were reducible to Maxwell's electromagnetic wave. In this way physicist's explain the world.Here one is almost tempted to say that they proceed much as religion and ideology do. Religion has from the beginning of recorded history been taking phenomenon and feelings, like storms and suffering or aging and despair, and molding them into an internally coherent explanation of all that is and was and will be. They do this by separating the relevant from the incidental, then uncovering the essential by excluding the accidental. They simplify. In similar ways ideologues like the communists take what at one time were discreet incidents and disparate facts (for instance, the poverty of the third world and imperialism) and weave them into a grand general explanation. Is science merely the latest avatar of religion? - Or perhaps it is an ideology without tears?Not so fast! Feynman goes on to show us that attempts to explain the atomic world foundered on the laws of motion. He shows us that the rescue of those shipwrecked on the shoals of classical theory involved the invention of a new, counter-intuitive theory, Quantum Mechanics. He then goes on, while discussing a small portion of that theory, to give us the (deliberately) hilarious and 'absurd' example of how physicists predict how many photons, out of a given number, will be reflected back from a surface. 'Draw little arrows on a piece of paper' and watch the clock, he tells us. And with no explanation as to why this procedure works! Of course, for physics, what matters is that it does work. Physicists have been forced \\"away from making absolute predictions to merely calculating the probability of an event.\\" But where is the essential, the eternal, the necessary?Perhaps this is what Feynman is driving at. Science describes, it doesn't explain why. We should all wonder at that. The great 'philosophical' questions that drive theology and political ideology are beyond the purview of physics. Science doesn't create worlds; nor does it 'interpret' or change them, it simply describes what it finds. (It is technology that changes the world.) Freud saw fit to end one of his books by saying that 'our science is no illusion, but it would be an illusion to believe you can find elsewhere what it does not offer.' But how much truer this is of physics! One is then perhaps not surprised to come away from this little book wondering exactly what the status of philosophy, psychoanalysis, politics and religion would be in a genuinely scientific world.But of course there will never be, given human irrationality, an entirely scientific human culture. This book is a superb introduction to quantum electrodynamics. It's 'experimentalism' and agnosticism towards grand philosophical explanations I found very congenial and convincing. Feynman is an engaging personality and this is an entertaining book. While one doesn't need a degree in physics and math to understand him a lay competence and interest in math and physics is certainly necessary. For those of us still living in a Newtonian world, a dwindling number to be sure, this book will have several surprising moments.

I have studied only QED.My recomendation is that every new and curious mind should read it once.This is an excellent book to know and understand what QED is, what it deals with and how it deals with. But it is very disappointing in the sense that its very lean and thin. This entire book desrves to be an indispenseable first chapter of a bigger book. This books ditches you at the very momment when you have understand the basics and you want to know more ..... you want to know actually how calculations are done ...your mind starts questioning and Feynman becomes quite ...... too teasing !!!!I would like to humbly comment, in general, about the Feynman's books. I feel there are two faces of science which attracts and fascinates bergeoning minds. First is that its ability to pridict ...... even after senselessly lenghthy looking mathematics one finds that still nature behaves the way science predicts. Second is the ELEGANCE that science, as distinct from other subjects, has. How beautifully science maintains the consistency ...... how beautifully it has been formulated ..... how severe are small assumptions ...... and how carefully each small assumption is mentioned in the formulations ...!!! This second phase is where Feynman lacks. Feynman's books failed to impress the new minds with the BRILIANT mathematical ELEGANCE of science !!! He fails to bring out the GRACE of CONSISTENCY !! The lengthy circular line integrals and surface integrals of electrodynamics, the elegant linear algebra quantum theory, the variations in Hamiltonian formultaions .......all these have an intrinsic beauty which Feynman fails to bring forth to new entrants into the field of science.There is a satge in one's educational growth till which one likes to understand how the nature behaves ....how science enables one to predict nature .....I mean things of general curiosity. But finally a stage comes when you want to study science with all its ELEGANCE. There is a stage when you want to admire the beautifull science ..... elegantly decorated and precisely dressed with mind boggling mathematics.Hence, all new comers should definately read QED of Feynman's Lecture .....but togather with that they should also read some formal treatment of science like those by Landau or Sakurai to admire the science with its true colors."},{"Title":"QED: The strange theory of light and matter (Alix G.

Why is it so popular? Four lectures on quantum electrodynamics? Why would anyone, other than a physicist, rave about such a book?Feynman cautions the audience that they may not understand what he will be saying. Not because of technical difficulty, but because they may be unable to believe it, unable to accept what he is saying. &quot;The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it fully agrees with experiment. So I hope you can accept Nature as She is - absurd.&quot;I long had this problem. I wanted to understand why, in addition to how nature works. I wanted some philosophical understanding, some underlying meaning. I have come to accept that the fundamental laws (rules, behavior, whatever) of physics are not intuitive, but are incomprehensible in terms of common sense.To appreciate Feynman's QED lectures, you must have patience, some commitment (its not really difficult), but more than anything else you need a willingness to set aside disbelief and simply listen to a physicist talk about quantum electrodynamics. A willingness to accept that nature refuses to be understood. Analyzed, dissected, mathematically described (in a probabilistic sense), but not fundamentally understood. QED.I am largely unsatisfied by books for laymen on quantum physics, string theory, cosmology, and the like. My background includes some physics and I find that a bit of mathematics is more helpful than a great many analogies, no matter how cleverly constructed. QED should have been disappointing. But I gave it five stars.Feynman did not rely on analogies. He talks physics and experiments. Feynman had a wonderful clarity of thought, an ability to explain advanced physics, and all with a sense of humor. No math symbols, no complex numbers, no matrices, no wave mechanics, no advanced probability analysis - just simple addition of little arrows that shrink and turn.Feynman was unpredictable. He saw the world in unexpected ways. In a footnote he mentions that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is really no longer a necessary construct. &quot;If you can get rid of all the old-fashioned ideas and instead use the ideas that I am explaining in these lectures - adding arrows for all the ways an event can happen - there is no need for an uncertainty principle.&quot; Heisenberg relegated to a footnote!The casual reader may find some short sections a bit strenuous, particularly some of the more involved manipulations of arrows, but stay with it. As Feynman points out in the preface, these lectures represent physics accurately without distortions for simplicity. Nothing would need to be unlearned if you later majored in physics. Think about it. QED may lead you down a path heretofore not taken."},{"Title":"QED: The strange theory of light and matter (Alix G. Mautner memorial lectures)","review":"A book on physics that is entertaining? Hard to believe, but during the reading of this book I not only got a grasp on some of the fundamental concepts of Quantum Electro Dynamics, but thoroughly enjoyed the way it was explained. Feynman is a master teacher. He has the ability to take complex concepts and boil them down so that even a physics dummy can understand them. It is obvious when reading the text how complete Feynman's understanding of the material is. You know how you can read a science book and not really get what the author is trying to explain? Sometimes that comes from your own lack of intelligence, but a lot of times it's because the author wasn't totally clear about what he was writing. In this book, you really get the underlying concepts becasue Feynman's understanding of the subject is so complete. I found myself absorbing some of the QED concepts almost by osmosis.The book is composed of 4 lectures Feynman gave at UCLA in the mid 80's.QED is about the interaction of light and matter. Feynman starts the explanation of QED by dealing with the partial reflection of light onto 2 surfaces of glass, and uses arrow diagrams to make the explanation easy to understand.He uses the arrow diagrams in the other lectures which continue the discussion of QED's attempt to explain the interaction of photons with matter. The last lecture deals with subatomic particles and QED's relationship to the rest of physics.The part of the book I enjoyed most was the 3rd lecture called &quot;Electrons and Their Interactions&quot; which explains how electrons go from point to point in space/time. He gets into the famous &quot;Feynman Diagrams&quot; showing how electrons and photons seem to travel backwards in time, and how photons can go faster or slower than the conventional speed of light. It's fascinating!What's great about these lectures is their clarity and humor. The author doesn't take himself too seriously and as a result the book is a delight to read, as well as being enlightening.Kudo's as well to the editor who distilled the material down to a manageable length of 152 pages.Can a book on Quantum Electro Dynamics be really fun to read?

Feynman was both a great physicist anda great communicator, but the subject is both important andperplexingly obscure. This book is based on the Alex G. MautnerMemorial Lectures given at UCLA.Quantum behavior will matter to the21st century the way the steam engine mattered to the 18th and 19thcenturies, the way the internal combustion engine mattered to thefirst two-thirds of the twentieth century, and the way computers andtransistors have mattered to the last third of the twentieth. Tounderstand Quantum behavior you first have to understand themeasurements and scales involved. One billionth of a meter is a&quot;nanometer.&quot; It is how we measure things at the level ofmolecules and atoms. Quantum behavior is what starts happening innano-scale behavior below about 50 nanometers. The rules of physicssuddenly change at this level, and the way you and I were taught thatthe world works is suddenly replaced by very different rules.AsFeynman said &quot;my main purpose in these lectures is to describe asaccurately as I can the strange theory of light and matter--morespecifically the interaction of light and electrons.&quot; Feynman isclear that the theory works in that it accurately predicts outcomes,but that we do not really understand what is happening or how thoseoutcomes are arrived at. In his words: &quot;What I am going to tellyou about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourthyear of graduate school ... No, you're not going to be able tounderstand it. Why, then, am I going to bother you with all this? Whyare you going to sit here all this time, when you won't be able tounderstand what I am going to say? It is my task to convince you notto turn away because you don't understand it. You see, my physicsstudents don't understand it either. That is because I don'tunderstand it. Nobody does.&quot;Feynman goes on to explain whyquantum behavior is so hard to accept: &quot;I'm going to describe toyou how Nature is--and if you don't like it, that's going to get inthe way of your understanding it. It's a problem that physicists havelearned to deal with. They've learned to realize that whether theylike a theory or they don't like a theory is not the essentialquestion. Rather, it is whether or not the theory gives predictionsthat agree with experiment. It is not a question of whether a theoryis philosophically delightful or easy to understand, or perfectlyreasonable from the point of view of common sense. The theory ofquantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point ofview of common sense. And it agrees fully with the experiment. So Ihope you can accept Nature as She is--absurd.&quot; Despite itsdifficulty and remarkable characteristics Feynman asserts that Quantumelectrodynamics is important to all of life. Consider: &quot;Most ofthe phenomena you are familiar with involve the interaction of lightand electrons--all of chemistry and biology for example. The onlyphenomena that are not covered by this theory are phenomena ofgravitation and nuclear phenomena; everything else is contained inthis theory.&quot;&quot;The more you see how strangely Naturebehaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even thesimplest phenomena actually work&quot; is a Feynman observation thatgoes to the heart of our current situation. In traditional areas ofscience we are making rapid progress and some people think we are evenclose to the end of the scientific era or in a mature state. Yet inmany areas of science we are just beginning to understand thequestions and do not have a clue as to the answers. For example, 80%of the universe is dark matter and we currently know nothing aboutdark matter. Feynman's book is a good introduction to the frontiersthat beckon us to a great age of discovery in the 21stcentury.Consider the possibility that at least at very tiny levelsa kind of time travel can occur. Here is the description of figure 63(p.96) &quot;the scattering of light involves a photon going into anelectron and a photon coming out--not necessarily in that order, asseen in example b. The example in c shows a strange but realpossibility; the electron emits a photon, rushes backwards in time toabsorb a photon, and then continues forward in time.&quot; Rememberthis is a great physicist lecturing a sophisticated general audienceabout the cutting edge of knowledge. There is much in this onedescription to think about. Feynman goes further on this topic:&quot;This phenomenon is general. Every particle in Nature has anamplitude to move backwards in time, and therefore has ananti-particle.&quot;Feynman's argument is that quantum behavior istruly outside the Newtonian principles of classical physics andcontradicts our understanding of the world as we experience it at ourlarge, bulky level. &quot;Throughout these lectures I have delightedin showing you that the price of gaining such an accurate theory hasbeen the erosion of our common sense. We must accept some very bizarrebehavior...light traveling in paths other than a straight line,photons going faster or slower than the conventional speed of light,electrons going backwards in time...That we must do, in order toappreciate what Nature is really doing underneath nearly all thephenomena we see in the world.&quot;This is a challenging but veryimportant book about a topic which will have enormous implications forour century but which remarkably few public minded citizens have paidany attention to.

This is due in part because our universe is so amazing and in part because I feel that what we learn from the natural world tells us many fundamental things about ourselves. My husband is a physicist. When I first met him a whole new world of thought was opened up to me. QED was the first place he sent me to begin my journey into the conceptual study of Quantum Electrodynamics.The author of this little book, the late Richard Feynman, was a Nobel Prize laureate in physics in 1965. He was a member of the team that developed the atom bomb and served on the panel that investigated the space shuttle Challenger disaster. Although one of the world's most brilliant physicists, he was also awell loved professor at Caltech. Neil Bohr would seek him out often because of his unassuming nature and ability to play devil's advocate with any scientific mind of the time. His immersion in the topics of mathematics and physics gave him the clarity in his teaching that could speak to the un-initiated. This book is an edited version of his presentation for the Alix G. Mautner Memorial Lecture series given at UCLA.So, what is so terribly amazing about this particular book? Well, with little or no mathematics and diagrams that walk you through each and every step, Feynman takes you into the world of quantum mechanics where nothing happens as we expect. Time travels whatever way it chooses, particles can be here and there at the same time, or nowhere at all. As a teacher, Feynman does not talk down to his audience, nor develop not-quite-right metaphors to lead the blind.

I reread parts of the book for nearly a month because it was so interesting to me.On page 101, he says that \\"light is really not affected by surfaces\\", when he is explaining how reflection is really absorption and re-emission of photons by electrons within the glass. When reading this, I thought that a highly polished glass surface would probably reflect more light than a rough surface, yet it would seem that in the polished glass, molecules are not different than in the rough glass. So, how do you explain the increased reflectivity when the interior of the glass is the same and only the surface is smoother? I wish he had said more about that.In the last chapter, when he described fundamental forces as being associated with the exchange of particles, such as photons and gluons, he did not give the reader any intuitive understanding of that idea, which was a dissapointment to me.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a physics background and to anyone who wonders about this stuff."},{"Title":"QED: The strange theory of light and matter (Alix G.

Mautner memorial lectures)","review":"Just as the name suggests, this book presents the strange theories of Quantum Electro Dynamics. This theory explains a few things about how light and electrons interact. These interactions can be used to understand better how things in nature occur. The only problem is that this theory is very hard to understand if, indeed, anyone can understand it. The problems starts with asking why, when you shine a monochromatic light at a surface of glass, does some of the light reflect and some go through the glass? The strangeness of it starts to come into the picture when you get different results depending on how thick the piece of glass is. How does the photon decide when it comes to the surface of the glass if it wants to reflect or go through? This professor attempts to answer these sorts of questions and does it in a very entertaining way. You feel as if you are attending a class at college. You also feel like this is one of those professors that one finds entertaining and informative. By the end of the book if you don't understanding everything, at least you have come a little closer to knowing what questions to ask.

Mautner memorial lectures)","review":"Feynmann, one of the physicists who developed the theory of quantum electrodynamics, winning a Nobel Prize for doing so (with 2 others) had a unique skill at presenting the physical essence of a principle, without getting lost in mathematical formalizm. After all, the mathematical description of a concept is only one form of expression of the idea, albeit in precise terms. Feynmann's discussion of QED explains with great power the way that when one examines the action of particles in the real world, the classical deterministic description of the particle and what happens to it proves inaccurate. For instance, when a particle travels between two points, one cannot know its exact location and how it is moving. One can only describe the particle's movement in terms of probabilities. A classical description of the action of the particle would attribute a fixed path to its course. In quantum physics, one describes the probable path. There is a finite, however small, probability that at any given time in the questioned interval the particle may be found in any location in space. It's true path description allows the particle to travel by all possible paths, and the classical path is merely the one which is most probable. Feynmann explains this and related phenomena with compelling logic and power. He writings are a unique and essential explanation of modern quantum analysis. They are readily understood by non-physicist readers, requiring only a willingness to concentrate and open one's mind. This is a remarkable work."},{"Title":"QED: The strange theory of light and matter (Alix G.

Yet, here Feynman admirably succeeds in distilling the essence of QED-quantum electrodynamics-, one of our most fundamental theories of nature, without using any mathematical equations. Comprehending what is presented in this book still requires a fair amount of attention and mental work on the part of the reader, but the reward is understanding something about the fundamental workings of nature that the overwhelming majority of people unfortunately don't and, even worse, are not even aware that they don't.I recommend using this book in conjunction with a set of lectures Feynman gave on this topic, and which are fortunately freely available from the Vega Science trust (Do a search for \\"Feynman Robb lectures\\" to find them).The content is about the same, but whereas the strength of the lectures is that they make the material seem more accessible (due to the brilliance of Feynman as a lecturer), the book is useful for long-term reinforcement.In my opinion, the book and lecture combination should be seriously considered for inclusion into the high school science curriculum. I think the material is not too advanced for that level, and if more people had their basic worldview shaken at that age, it would provide them with at least one profound experience that what they know (from their sensory experience) just ain't so.

This book explains the interaction between light and matter, which is illuminating. If you understand the pun, then you have the brain capacity to understand this book.Richard Feynman possessed some kind of special brand of genius which enabled him to masquerade as a regular guy. He was able to cut to the quick of Nature's mysteries and explain in plain english what he saw there for the benefit of those of us lacking in genius.Feynman freed us from the need to relate to quantum physics by memorizing a set of arcane mathematical expressions, and delivered to us a way of understanding the probabilistic nature of quantum reality by drawing a bunch of little arrows pointing this way and that. His method, known as &quot;Feynman diagrams&quot;, is so simple that it seems almost childlike, yet it works every time.The theory of Quantum ElectoDynamics is the most complete theory that science has in its arsenal. The theory explains 99% of everything we see at the classical level of reality. Feynman was never quite able to tie in the oddities observed in the interaction of nuclei or gravitrons, but reality as we observe it is more or less dictated by the interaction of electrons, and this theory describes that interplay perfectly.Feyman's &quot;sum over histories&quot; explains reality even better than Newton's seemingly incontrovertable laws of Nature, which in actuality, decribe only the end result of the sum over histories. Where Newton described one reality, the one observed by all of us, Feynman described every microscopic reality, each as real as the other, and all culminating in the one macroscopic reality as described by Newton. Feynman described particles moving faster than light, and even backwards in time - all of which is explained in his &quot;strange theory of light and matter&quot;, and all of which is endlessly verifiable in the laboratory.For anyone willing to break out of the Newtonian mindset which humanity has been in for over 300 years, and which is still taught in today's high school science classrooms, this book is a must read. Treat yourself to 150 pages of plain english which will infuse you with wonder for the rest of your days."},{"Title":"QED: The strange theory of light and matter (Alix G.

Among them, many are of very good quality, describing sectors of science with competence and, sometimes, charm. The books by Gamow, for instance, are notable, as are those by Jeremy Bernstein. Then there are books which not only explain physics to you, but give you tools so that you can, by yourself, understand new things. These are very rare. I can think of two. Cosmology, by Harrison, allows you to derive by yourself consequences of the universe expansion by the trick of moving mirrors, a nice, simple and useful tool. But it is restricted to this rather esoteric corner of science. Then there is Feynman's QED. This is unique. By the clever trick of a clock attached to each photon and by the use of it in combination with his breakthrough idea of summing over all paths, he succeeds in extracting not only the specialized phenomena of high energy physics, but magically renews the good old optics of mirrors and refraction. Using his simple rules you can understand light &quot;like a pro&quot;, and even do your own little research projects.

These lectures are meant to give a general audience a taste of the most successful theory in physics, quantum electrodynamics, or QED for short, that he developed independently of two others (Schwinger and Tomonaga), who all shared the Nobel Prize in 1965. Feynman builds up the theory using very simple ideas such as &quot;all we do is draw little arrows on a piece of paper and we get all these answers.&quot; We see how light can be reflected from the center of a mirror, but that it really reflects from all points on a mirror. How can that be, you say? Answer: watch these videos! Feynman moves from light, to electrons, to their interactions in the first three lectures. We even get to see the legendary &quot;Feynman Diagrams&quot; drawn by the master, himself! In the fourth lecture Feynman discusses the problems or difficulties with the theory (always honest, he never quite believed that the theory was completely perfect, even though it gave the right answers. In fact, he said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech that &quot;... we might just be sweeping the difficulties under the rug.&quot;) as well as discussing some of the current (in 1979) theories such as quarks and gluons. These tapes are invaluable for the interested amatuer who wants to learn the basics of the theory which describes all of everyday experience except for gravity, or for the physics student to find out what it is that you are really calculating with those messy equations, and how it really goes."},{"Title":"QED: The strange theory of light and matter (Alix G. Mautner memorial lectures)","review":"Richard Feynman, along with Schwinger and Tomonaga, won Nobel prizes in the 1960's for their development of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this book, Feynman attempts to bring this esoteric field down to the layman's level and succeeds as usual. The chapters in the book are taken from lectures he presented to a largely nonscientific audience, but the material is not dumbed down. Of course, many of the details are left out since only years of study can provide a true understanding of the theory, but Feynman presents his lectures in such a way that only a reasonable amount of thought is needed to appreciate the basics of QED.\\"The Strange Theory of Light and Matter\\" is an entirely appropriate subtitle to a book that attempts to explain the theory behind phenomena that escape our everyday experience and intuition. QED is arguably the most successful scientific theory in existence. Its predictions have correlated extraordinarily well with experiment although \\"prediction\\" in the QED sense is not what we are generally used to. The quantum world is inherently probabilistic. There are certain things we just cannot \\"know.\\" We cannot predict which photons will reflect of a glass surface, but with QED, we can at least accurately calculate the percentage of photons that do reflect. That's just one of the results of QED that Feynman attempts to explain, and he does so in a very straightforward fashion.Feynman never insults the intelligence of his audience by pretending that the basics of QED are beyond its grasp, but instead repeatedly insists that no one really understands QED, but that should not prevent anyone from appreciating some of its results. With this attitude, Feynman explains the basics of partial reflection, particle interactions, and the discoveries of new particles, and he does all this through numerous figures and analogies rather than mathematical equations.Richard Feynman was not your ordinary physicist. He was a physicist's physicist and a great teacher (read James Gleick's bio of Feynman called Genius). His teaching abilities are in full display in this book as he is able to bring an incredibly strange theory down to the average reader's level. I highly recommend this book. It will tax your thinking abilities but will never insult them."},{"Title":"QED: The strange theory of light and matter (Alix G. Mautner memorial lectures)","review":"This is great book.

Mautner memorial lectures)","review":"In introductory physics courses, whether in high school or college, one tends to be exposed to some of the rudiments of electromagnetism. Often it seems overly complex or badly organized: while all of classical electromagnetism can be put under the header of Maxwell's equations, the student learns that there are separate equations for resistance, capacitance, magnetic and electric fields in matter as opposed to vacuum, moving electric fields and static, and what is all this business about fields, anyway? The student is told of a world where electrons do indeed collide, the speed of light can slow in some media, and electric and magnetic fields are two different things.In QED (quantum electrodynamics, a theory that was proposed independently by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomanga, and which earned the Nobel Prize for all three in 1965) none of these mysteries exist. &quot;Fields&quot; don't act differently in matter, and electrons *don't* collide. The speed of light does not slow, and magnetic and electric fields are two aspects of the same relativistic effect (this is known generally to students above the freshman level, but unfortunately is either skimmed over or is untouched by an introductory course). How is all this made possible? Why, by simply understanding what electromagnetism really is, on the most fundamental level: the interactions between electrons, mediated by photons they pass between one another, emit or absorb, or pass back and forth between themselves and the nucleus. Indeed, all of electromagnetism can be generalized to tiny particles emitting and absorbing packets of light --- and this simplicity of thought, this generalization, is what led many people back then and now (including myself) to consider Richard Feynman one of the greatest minds physics has ever known.This book is better if one has taken an introductory physics course in high school or elsewhere, but it is not necessary to have any prior physics or higher level math background. One just needs to have a good imagination to picture interactions on such a tiny and observationally unknowable scale."},{"Title":"QED: The strange theory of light and matter (Alix G.

Using primarily spatial concepts, visualizations, and diagrams rather than advanced math, Feynman clearly illustrates and explains many of the fundamental aspects of QED in a way that the non-specialist can grasp.

Now, if you're ignorant of physics, you're probably still thinking, \\"That says a whole lot.

Over three quarters (75%, if you prefer--ooh, I can do math!) of this book explains movements and interactions of electrons and photons expressed as probabilities. The last section discusses a variation of QED, quantum chromodynamics (i.e. quarks). Unlike some abstruse conjectures (most notably, string theory), quantum electrodynamics can be and has been experimentally verified. In fact, it is the most accurate theory ever devised! This does not mean that QED is totally compliant with common sense (fortunately; physics addicts often find common sense to be rather dull--and incorrect!). The reader learns to accept that light does not always travel in straight paths, that light reflects from all parts of a mirror, and that electrons can travel backward in time. Richard Feynman, who (along with Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger) was awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize for his work on this theory, elucidates QED so that even those who have never before studied physics can understand it. (To be more accurate, they can understand *how* QED works; Feynman admits that no one, himself included, truly understands *why* QED works.) If you already are familiar with the theory, you are likely to become bored with this book. On the other hand, I'm not sure that this book is the best for physics neophytes, since it is specific in explaining this one given area (even skipping the historical background present in most popular accounts of physics). You might want to first obtain more general knowledge of modern physics. If you find optics interesting, definitely read this book.

A Brief History, Elegant Universe, etc. all gloss over the topic. But don't fool yourself. Even though Feynman is a great teacher, this is not easy stuff. If you hope to really grasp what Prof. Feynman is saying you are going to have to really think about it. I remember reading one page over and over again for an hour until I grasped one concept. But it is definitely worth it in the end. I believe that anyone of above average intelligence (which I believe most people who read this sort of book are) should be able to fully grasp the ideas presented in this book.

John Emms takes us through all the different variations making decisions at key junctures about what to play as black. Below, the criticism of his choice of b6 versus the rubinstein variation is not quite correct. He does gloss over other options that black can play, but that is done only to save the reader time when they are studying. Emms did have reservations at first when he was thinking about recommending b6, but he says those disappeared when he realized that Viktor Korchnoi, Michael Adams, and Garry Kasparov play b6 against the rubinstein.The strategy for both sides is explained thoroughly at the beginning of each chapter and the beginning of the book. There are also many examples from games at the beginning of each chapter. A very good effort from Emms."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Nimzo-Indian","review":"Many GM:s have expressed that the author of 'Easy Guide to the Nimzo-Indian' John Emms is a real expert on the Nimzo. He presents a very sound repertoire for black.No strange lines. He prefers lines where Nimzowitsh Ideas are prefered. With other words..the lines where black controls the center with pieces rather than pawns. For Example the b6 variation after 0-0 in the capablancavariation. The 5..Ne4 in the Rubinstein fianchetto variation and the 4..b6 variation after 4.Nf3-the flexible variation.This will learn us to get the the real Nimzo-spirit/knowledge. He gives a good strategical introduction before the theoretical section of every variation.The only drawback of the book as I view it is that it is too thin! But it follows the title 'Guide'.....so. I think the book is very good to build your nimzo-defence on. I hope that GM Emms as a very respected nimzo expert will wright more books on the nimzo. A book which also would include a lot of games which he annotates."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Nimzo-Indian","review":"John Emms, co-winner of the 1997 British Championship plays the Nimzo-Indian himself and has attempted to write a 'road map' for us lesser fry. He only partly succeeded. The games are mostly modern - good enough. The diagrams are clear - OK. The notes are opinionated at times - no complaints here; I like a guy who can stand up for himself. Best of all he gives us a quiz at the back to see if we were paying attention - good stuff! But ... the quiz could have been longer; the recommended reply for Black vs. e3 is ... b6 only. There are many other valid tries but Emms glosses over them, and even admits that he had reservations about ... b6 while writing his book ,,,hmmmm.. And we are subjected to some tired replays of famous games including Botwinnik-Capablanca, AVRO '38 and Johner-Niemzowitsch, Dresden '26. Both fine games to be sure, but published many times before.

Its biggest accomplishment, however, is in the very act of showing how sometimes we don't see what's under our eyes for a sort of mental laziness.Russell forces us to move away from this laziness and reconsider what we take for granted about ourselves, and does so with his enjoyable style. He seems to possess the rare skill of finding the minimum amount of words and concepts needed to explain (and solve) the problem clearly and accurately. He will never forget to define precisely all the terms needed in the discussion, or to question the limits of the premises in order to understand the scope of the conclusion.In each chapter he considers a facet of what we call mind and explores it both from the point of introspection and of external analysis of observable behavior. Introspection gives use informations impossible to obtain with other methods, and it is what gives meaning to the problem of mind in the first place, but it has the intrinsic problem of an instrument trying to measure itself. So Russell keeps on correcting this \\"view from the inside\\" and the delusions it can create with the stick of behaviourism and objective observation.On a less technical side, I highly appreciate the intellectual honesty of someone who can freely use the words \\"contrary to what I once stated\\".The only minus I can think of is that after one has understood the method of analysis employed he can probably predict how it will be used by the author to investigate the remaining items of his enquiry. While I was reading the second half of the book I often found myself anticipating his reasoning, and thinking that those last chapters could have been thinner. However the author's highly readable prose makes this a very small problem, and I suggest this book to everyone interested in the subject (anyone should be!)[A NOTE ABOUT BOOK READABILITY: Amazon merged on the same page the reviews for the paperback and the ebook, so please notice that the review below which warns you about the unreadable format of the book refers ONLY to the kindle version.

Today we can follow in real time the activity of the brain and nervous system for any mental activity, or motor activity as for that. So a great number of pages discussing the difference between a sensation, purely at the level of the contact of some sensorial organ with an outside stimulus, and an image which is a mental representation of what the stimuli are bringing in, or of some mnemic, in other words remembered or recollected, representation in the mind can clearly be solved. Thinking of something or seeing something are very similar but different, just as doing something and seeing someone doing something are very similar but not exactly the same thanks to mirror neurons. And we can \\"see\\" the brain working today.In the same way he spends a tremendous amount of time demonstrating the existence of the mind, of a specific mental level of brain activity. But today that is no longer something to be discussed in such length because thanks to the tremendous progress of medical imagery we know that the brain can work without any outside stimulus, on a stimulus that comes directly from inside, thought, recollection, imagination and so on. But Buddhism is more advanced on the subject than that because they consider that there are six senses in man: the five sensorial senses we know that receive the stimuli from outside and the mind that processes these stimulated sensations to analyze them, recognize them, classify them, identify them, etc, but also, because it is a meta-sense, the possibility to do the same with abstract notions that cannot be at the origin of a physical sensorial stimulus, and of course all other mental or brain element that activates the brain, because the brain can work on its own like an autonomous or semi-autonomous organ (dreams, abstract or artistic activities, etc.).He thus would have been able to come to a clearer notion of knowledge, something that is acquired and accumulated by a subject within some conditions and a context, most of the time collective. But strangely enough Russell neglects, if not rejects, the subject as an essential entity. The learner, the speaker, the hearer, the individual that receives the stimuli through his/her senses and then processes them, the individual that acquires some knowledge through a threshold of the acquisition of knowledge that is his or her own with motivation(s), cognitive strategies and cognitive styles, with the desire to learn or the refusal to learn. These mental dimensions are all motivated by the context of the subject and his own experience, and his experiential history.That's the word that is missing essentially: experience.If we consider the individual in his experience of the world in which he has five physical senses and the mind, a meta-sense in the brain, that receives experiential stimuli all the time in a situation where he has to learn to become autonomous when a new born and independent when autonomous, if we take the individual in that context he is not an abstract subject but he is an experiencer. If we taker language he is a hearer or a speaker, eventually a writer but when Russell brings together hearing, speaking writing or reading, there is something wrong in his vision of language. Writing and reading are the results of a late invention in the phylogeny of language in humanity, and a late learning in children, and has little to do with oral language. We do not speak what we write first, but we speak first and we eventually write what we have spoken or what we are thinking with our mental voice.He would have then enriched his vision with that set of concepts he does not use. Matter the way it is defined by physics is a construct but that does not in anyway permit anyone to say that matter is a mental imaginary entity. Matter is what is outside us and it does not need to be seen, heard, touched or whatever to exist. We can only experience this material world through our senses in a situation of extreme need and feebleness for several years. There is no escaping that. And it is this extreme inferiority that forces humanity as a whole and each child to communicate, hence to learn a language, hence to learn a lot of things and increase their mental powers. Then the rest is social and no longer individual. If the new-born was to be an absolutely individual being it would not survive twelve hours. That social dimension of the mind is not taken into account properly, neither phylogenetically for the human species with the emergence of modern man and homo sapiens, not psychogenetically for each new-born.\\"All psychic phenomena are built up out of sensations and images alone.\\" That's a good conclusion but tremendously short of the real situation. The very first experience of a new-born and even of a foetus over 24 weeks are going to be engraved in the brain and mind of that new-born and will build all his attitudes, motivations or de-motivations, learning experiences or learning refusals during his whole life. Then sensations and the mental representations a person may have in his mind going back to the first three to five years of his/her life are a lot more than just plain sensations, mnemic sensations, images, mnemic images, or whatever. They are most of the time unconscious and embedded in the brain at a very physical level, even in the architectures of the dendrites of the neurons that have grown along with this experience.I will not comment on what he says on language. He had not read de Saussure, that's obvious but today we are far beyond his very nave definition of the word as if Semitic languages, isolating languages and agglutinative, synthetic or syntactically analytical languages could have the same definition of a word, which are in fact roots in Semitic languages, frozen categorized parts of speech (very badly called like that) in isolating languages, and fully syntactic words in all other languages with different levels of realization of the syntax on the word (agglutinative) or around the word (the others). Paradigmatic and syntagmatic dimensions are essential for the various basic elements of our articulated languages, an other word, articulation, that is never used. Our languages have three articulations and we cannot economize on these facts.An important set of lectures though more for the historical approach of the :mind in out western society. We must also keep in mind that many languages do not have a word equivalent to \\"mind\\" in Europe and the West because \\"mind\\" is typically English and other languages have given some Christian or religious values to the words they may use to designate the physical and psychological dimension of the brain's functioning.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Analysis of Mind, The","review":"Why is it that page numbers are so often left off when a book is converted to electronic format?

It includes such classics as the article by Zona and Lane (of the LAPD threat management unit) on the typology of stalking. As in many areas of active research, the book is already somewhat dated. Because stalking laws had only been recently passed at the time the papers were written, the discussion of stalking laws is limited mostly to discussing some of the cases that prompted the laws. Similarly, because there were relatively few documented cases at the time, the discussion of stalking statistics is quite preliminary. There are many more thorough recent studies (See, for example, the excellent NIJ research by Tjaden and Thoennes.) The primary strength of the book is its comprehensive selection of early papers. I would highly recommend it for a student in the field who should be familiar with this work. The book is NOT meant to be a sourcebook for case management. In particular, there are no specifics on threat assessment and only a single case study of intervention techniques. For people who work with stalkers or stalking cases, I would strongly recommend the &quot;The Gift of Fear&quot; by Gavin de Becker, who authored the MOSAIC system. Books on psychopathology (such as &quot;Without Conscience: the Disturbing World of Psychopaths Among Us&quot;) are also excellent background."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Stalking: Clinical and Forensic Perspectives","review":"The mixed reviews so far are split between victims wanting something that reflects their experience and academics wanting the most up-to-date research findings. This book is not really to aid victims as much as it is to bolster the understanding of those who might be trying to serve their needs and assess their level of danger. It is academic in tone and that is off-putting to some. But these articles were designed for presentation at the regular stalking conference in Los Angeles so the tone fits the venue. I found it very informative and helpful in threat assessment, understanding different types of stalkers and what works to deter them. Victims can best use the information designed to help psychologically deter stalkers by robbing them of their pay-off--attention. It also explains that intermittent response is most likely to INCREASE stalking activity--as in slot machine payoffs."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Stalking: Clinical and Forensic Perspectives","review":"Great intro to stalking behavior and the signs, symptoms, and preventive measures one can take.

This is wacko academia at its worst: loud talking and unsubstantiated fantasy on the same level as palmistry or phrenology."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Stalking: Clinical and Forensic Perspectives","review":"I am a licensed psychotherapist with a personal and professional interest in 'multiple stalking' cases, in which a perpetrator organizes other individuals, likely strangers to the victim, to stalk and harass a feared or hated target individual, often over the internet.This is a basic, beginning book, written in 1998 and way behind in filling the need, considering the proliferation of actual crimes originating on the internet especially those in which a single website recruits or incites multiple individuals, usually strangers, as stalkers against one individual. In addition, unfortunately, this well-meaning but limited book has likely set back law enforcement help for victims of multiple-stalker, internet-originating crimes by years:In particular, the chapter on 'false victimization' is unnecessary and could well have been left out as it gives inexperienced, overburdened or uncaring law enforcement personnel, as they read the chapter about a variety of cases which at first sound like legitimate stalking cases but turn out to be false alarms, rationale to superimpose them upon all pleas to law enforcement for help, and justification to dismiss out of hand legitimate cases as illegitimate -- without investigation.Other examples of little or no cyberstalking training (in the LAPD; there is no cyberstalking section though the law now mandates it): A lone law enforcement individual manning the phone at LAPD's 'cyberstalking' section has said, 'cyberstalking is threatening e-mails -- period!'(2001).(This misapprehension is not discredited in Meloy's book.)Another LAPD detective, a woman, said, 'Just don't go on line', and when she heard about skin-burning chemicals inserted in the victim's newspapers, 'Just stop taking the newspaper'. Another detective, when hearing about a rationally-described but complicated case of internet-originated stalking and harassment insisted that the victim go into a psychiatric facility for a three-day hold in order to 'determine what is going on' -- this is without the first attempt at interview or investigation. Other detectives, more restrained, have explained that they need 'proof' before even beginning an investigation and gathering proof,leaving the victim in a helpless, catch-22 situation (and, being put off by the multiple-stalker nature of the crime as described refused to look at the evidence at hand).There are now many published accounts of individuals who have been targeted by people who want them dead or distracted (or, in some cases, discredited, as victims are often disbelieved when there are no witnesses and the harassment takes forms which leave little in the way of evidence)and who use the internet to accomplish such a crime without their risking being an actual part of it. One was of a woman who, working for Housing and Urban Development, had tried to integrate an all-white neighborhood. A white-supremicist set up a website and put her and her 18-year old daughter's personal information on it, inciting others to go after them. They had to move from house to house, state to state; each time the website updated their new, 'secret' information. (Finally, HUD sued this operator on the woman's behalf and won; it is unclear if he has stopped his mischief.) Another is of an editor of a progressive Jewish publication which has criticized Israel for being too hard on the Palestinians; he had death threats and had his address, phones, family names, published on a radical fundamentalist Israeli website, inciting strangers to make frequent death threats. Another victim, a grown woman, who confronted her paranoid and psychopathic father with the fact of her childhood sexual abuse by him later found herself a target of unknown people for years before finding out her father, who was afraid without reason of being incarcerated was behind it; she was forced to move from house to house, ending up incarcerated inside her own home due to the types of 'non-provable', 'high-tech' harassment techniques used by her father's cohorts (paid, or recruited over the internet)and cut off from other members of her family by her father's making sure everyone knew about his previously respected daughter's 'delusions of persecution'. --In this case, virtually every technique used, when spoken about, did sound like the delusions of a paranoid schizophrenic; such discrediting was the point of the crime, though the facts in this case were true.(Psychotherapists, take heed.)Meloy doesn't mention multiple stalkers in his book, in fact, denigrates such stories by default and by being too vague in describing the differences between false and real cases (investigators 'had the feeling' the case was false), doing nothing to prevent law enforcement, with little more in the way of studies to go on, from concluding that more often than not a given case is 'self-harm' or simply a lie.Psychotherapists: Many or most psychotherapists also have no choice, not hearing or knowing about the increasing multiple stalking cases (and being themselves too shocked at such stories and in denial -- as the society was about child abuse, wife-beating and one-person stalking for decades before acknowledging the seriousness and actuality of these crimes; and as we all were about the reality of terrorist threats to our nation though there was plenty of evidence for years apparently that these threats were real) they leap to the conclusion that their client is delusional. In fact, to be fair, most multiple-stalking cases are burgeoning exponentially, at the same rate as the internet, and all of this is new. (As Meloy, to his credit, attests, and he gives sound reasons why a person, who might not have been a criminal before the advent of the internet, might resort to deadly and terrorizing tactics when he thinks the internet will allow him impunity. p. 12)There are now two cyberstalking laws in California (written after the book was written); one convicted a man (named Delapenta) who had set up a website in the name of a woman he had been turned down by for a date. He had published her name, address, phone, and ways to bypass her security system on this site; he said (as if he was she) 'she' wanted to be raped and to ignore any calls for help she might make -- that this was just part of 'her' game. The young woman was terrified at the calls and visits by strange men and remained so for at least a year after the perpetrator was caught (by her father spending weeks searching on line at first and then pretending to be a website visitor, and by two men who came to her door admitting what was going on; not by any police investigation).There are many such stories which have been published, which make use of personal identity information on the internet, including photographs (in one known case, brazenly taken head-on of the victim by strangers with long-distance lenses in food stores, concerts, in an empty hotel lobby after a conference, across a children's playground of herself and her grandchild -- the stunned victim found that the photographers drove away in cars which had no license plates), to recruit and evoke stranger-stalkers to target one individual. Some sites might be 'dead pool' sites, which include gambling on the person's death date --this is an effective come-on as, unlike 'hate sites', 'players' have the impetus of winning money or earning it through individual assaults or 'attacks'. These may be like a computer game, but in which a real person has been chosen (likely by a known perpetrator, maybe a family member -- like the father who was afraid without cause that he, himself, would become incarcerated or abandoned if his abuse of his daugher came to light)to be the target in real life. Some of the sites may require illicitly shared software in order to 'play' and the website may not be findable by ordinary search techniques. A person playing this 'game' might get points for making one or more assaults of some kind on the victim, terrorizing her/him and possibly hastening his/her death by suicide or homicide. There was one such report (1997) of a Dungeons and Dragons game, originating on the internet but played out on the street, which resulted in the suicides of three terrified teenagers.Clearly a new book needs to be written, and soon, incorporating all the now-known cases of multiple (stranger)stalkers elicited on the internet targeting a single individual as well as the continued gap in law enforcement between what needs to be known about how to investigate these cases (sophisticated cyber-training and sections in police departments devoted to such crimes) and how victims are being treated today. Likely legistatures need to vote money toward these sections and not just make new cybercrime laws."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Stalking: Clinical and Forensic Perspectives","review":"Meloy's book provides a thorough analysis of stalking from the top researchers and practitioners in the field.

In a field that is often over-run with &quot;pop-psychology&quot; and &quot;true crime&quot; novels, this books provides a truely academic resource for persons who research stalking or work in the threat assessment field.

In addition, unfortunately, this well-meaning but limited book has likely set back law enforcement help for victims of multiple-stalker, internet-originating crimes by years:In particular, the chapter on 'false victimization' is unnecessary and could well have been left out as it gives inexperienced, overburdened or uncaring law enforcement personnel, as they read the chapter about a variety of cases which at first sound like legitimate stalking cases but turn out to be false alarms, rationale to superimpose them upon all pleas to law enforcement for help, and justification to dismiss out of hand legitimate cases as illegitimate -- without investigation.Other examples of little or no cyberstalking training (in the LAPD; there is no cyberstalking section though the law now mandates it): A lone law enforcement individual manning the phone at LAPD's 'cyberstalking' section has said, 'cyberstalking is threatening e-mails -- period!' (2001)(This misapprehension is not discredited in Meloy's book.)Another LAPD detective, a woman, said, 'Just don't go on line' and when she heard about skin-burning chemicals inserted in the victim's newspapers, 'Just stop taking the newspaper'. Another detective, when hearing about a rationally-described but complicated case of internet-originated stalking and harassment insisted that the victim go into a psychiatric facility for a three-day hold in order to 'determine what is going on' -- this is without the first attempt at interview or investigation. Other detectives, more restrained, have explained that they need 'proof' before even beginning an investigation and gathering proof,leaving the victim in a helpless, catch-22 situation (and, being put off by the multiple-stalker nature of the crime as described refused to look at the evidence at hand).

At first I wasn't going to buy the book but, after speaking with my painting professor, who has been collecting Vuillard books for over 30 years, state that this is THE most comprehensive book of Vuillard's work and probably has more information and work than all his other Vuillard books combined, well, that clenched it and I had to get the book. I am very, very glad I did."},{"Title":"Edouard Vuillard","review":"Vuillard has always attracted less attention than Bonnard and long been regarded as interesting but rather limited and restricted in his interests and subject matter, in short an 'intimiste'.This strikingly well produced book in which the colour illustrations are among the best I have ever seen makes it possible to reconsider the artist quite thoroughly and demonstrates convincingly that he covered a far wider range of subjects and ideas than has hitherto been generally supposed. There is much in here that even those who have seen previous Vuillard exhibitions will find new.My one complaint is the enormous size and weight of the book which certainly helps with the reproductions but makes it difficult to read the extremely useful text which carries (successfully) the argument for reconsideration. Be it noted that the reproductions are of such high quality that they recreate the feel of Vuillard's surfaces which are a great pleasure.One of the finest art books I have ever seen and a major contribution."},{"Title":"Edouard Vuillard","review":"The career of this French painter and photographer spanned the first four decades of the 20th century and produced a wealth of works.

This book is beautiful and inspiring -- Glover takes a traditional quilting style and completely transforms it. The pictures are great, the background text is interesting, and the patterns are definitely executable (though they're low on details and expect quilting experience). One word of caution -- this is not an intro to quilting or to piecing Log Cabin squares or to color theory, though she is obviously masterful in all three. Use it as inspiration, not as a project blueprint, especially if you are new to quilting."},{"Title":"A New Look at Log Cabin Quilts: Design a Scene Block by Block Plus 9 Easy-to-Follow Projects","review":"Log Cabin blocks are so versatile. This book introduces the reader to exciting ways of thinking outside the square. Production of animals, scenes and paletes of colour are examined and open the mind to so many possibilities. The block does not constrict you to sqaures, rather explores the sizes and shapes of the block, and the fabric strips along with the internal arrangement of colour to produce amazing effects.

After I ordered it, I finally found a website that showed the patterns that were included in the book. I was disappointed at the choices of what the patterns covered. There was nothing wrong with those patterns. They just weren't scenes that I would have chosen as wall hangings in my home. You may love them. So I was no longer looking so forward to the arrival of that book. But when I got it, I had the wonderful surprise that yes, it had finished patterns that weren't exactly for me, but half the book is devoted to how to make any kind of landscape scenes of any kind for yourself!

And the best part about it is, they are still simple, DOable log cabins and courthouse steps that anyone can master in an afternoon.I am currently working on a half-size version of Glover's \\"Moms and Babes\\". This is a landscape -- yes! a whole landscape -- of sheep and lambs in a meadow with forested mountains in the background. No kidding! Not only is it coming together beautifully but she teaches her method for breaking large figural designs down into log cabin elements. That means I'll be able to plot out my own sun on the horizon to balance out the design I've bifurcated.Seriously, BUY THIS BOOK! Even if you never sew one of her designs you NEED to know about the potential that lovely, homey, easy-to-do, versatile log cabin blocks have that you never even dreamed about.

I plan to take the guide with us for unbiased reference on our adventure."},{"Title":"Frommer's Seattle 2007","review":"I'm a Seattle mostly-native (been here for 20 years) and picked up this book so that my guests from couchsurfing.com might be able to use it to get around the city. Unfortunately, it hasn't been very useful for them because the vast majority of the stuff listed in the book is tourist traps. It might be a useful guide for an 40-50 year old plus person who likes chain restaurants, stereotypical tourist experiences, or for someone who's travelling with a family. However, if you're even remotely interested in visiting places where locals hang out, having experiences which don't cost an arm and a leg, seeing sights which you can see for free outside the confines of a tour bus, or eating at restaurants which are operated by locals for locals, I don't consider this guide very useful. A high percentage of the places it covers are downtown, but I don't know any local people of any age who hang out downtown unless they are there for work. Like any city I've ever visited, most of the interesting sights/restaurants/etc. are outside of the commercial/office downtown area.I picked up a few other guides too... the most comparable is the Lonely Planet guide. I found it to be worlds better to the point where I would recommend it to almost anyone other than my grandma over the Frommer's.

Side trips from Seattle (includes the San Juan Islands and whale watching, Port Townsend, Victoria B.C., Olympic National Park, Mt.Ranier, Ferry excursions, etc. etc. etc.)When I am planning a vacation I like to spend a good amount of time in the months before doing research so that I am well prepared, not rushed, and feel like I am seeing and doing all the most exciting things, staying in and eating at all the extraordinary places. Staying away from things that might be offensive or unsafe. We watched the travel channel shows on Seattle, and I did massive amoutns of online research on travel advisor sites. The book...well, it's like they've been there done that and you'll benefit from their experience. And you can look up travel advisories for all their suggestions before you go, plus have a handly little travel guide to constantly consult on your trip.Of course the locals know all the best places to go, and all the great little non-touristy out-of-the-way little places to eat that feature the abundance of all the local chefies... and if you have friends or family there they will probably already have an entertainment plan for you, but I ran many of the book's suggestions past our daughter, a recent transplant to the area, to get the \\"locals\\" perspective and most of the suggested top things to see and do were also on her list. The area is so huge that unless you have a plan for everyday to group area attractions together you can spend more time in the car driving here and there than actually seeing and doing.

I would recommend this book for a novice or experienced researcher."},{"Title":"Online Roots: How to Discover Your Family's History and Heritage With the Power of the Internet","review":"Regular readers of my reviews (here and elsewhere) will know that I cast a chary eye on books that purport to introduce the reader to the miracle of \\"Internet genealogy.\\" I've read and reviewed dozens of such titles from the viewpoint of a researcher of more than thirty years' experience (beginning in the days of spiral notebooks and 3x5 cards) who is also a thoroughly wired computer geek and a heavy user of the Internet. I have long maintained that online research is simply the (sometimes) more convenient continuance by other means of traditional, tried and true methods. There is no \\"royal road to genealogy,\\" no universal database from which you can immediately download your entire lineage back to Adam. Most of the books I've seen fall into two categories: Introductions to traditional genealogy with a thin icing of information on genealogical software and Internet how-to, and \\"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Computers and the Internet\\"-type volumes that include specific genealogical applications as an afterthought. There are a few, like Elizabeth Powell Crowe's *Genealogy Online: Researching Your Roots* (1998), Matt Helm's *Genealogy Online for Dummies* (1998), and Pamela Hahn's *The Unofficial Guide to Online Genealogy* (2001), which actually are quite useful and are worth reading (though all three are inevitably becoming dated), but these are very much the exception. The rest are simply exercises in marketing.Pam Porter is a Certified Genealogical Records Specialist, a very experienced author and lecturer who has edited the APG QUARTERLY and presently serves on the FGS Board of Trustees. Amy Crow, a Certified Genealogist, also is well-known as an author and speaker, has served on the boards of several national organizations, and chairs First Families of Ohio. (She also is the overall editor for this series.) And the acknowledgments section lists many other names that are immediately recognizable. Their stated target audience includes (1) those new to genealogy but seasoned computerists, (2) those experienced in family research but novices online, and (3) those new to both. In other words, almost everyone. But it's encouraging to note that the third paragraph includes the explicit warning, \\"No, it's not all online yet.\\" Yes, field trips to courthouses and libraries and your local Family History Center are still necessary. But more and more information is indeed being made available online everyday, especially by government agencies for whom online public access is a great money-saver in terms of staff time. The authors point out, too, that much of what you'll find online, while not necessarily an answer to a specific relationship question, provides easily accessible contextual information -- county histories, details of migration patterns in previously unexplored states, the locations of railroad corporate archives, and similar data to help you to profitably focus your research. But \\"you won't be able to construct your entire family history on the Web.\\" Planning your online research is not that different from planning a library or courthouse visit -- it's still a matter of defining goals, identifying which facts you need to uncover, finding the sources for them, analyzing the results, and recording and evaluating what you're learned - but now you're using search engines and \\"pathfinder\\" sites instead of (or in addition to) card catalogs and document indexes. When you do get ready to make a courthouse visit, the Web will assure you that you've identified the right one, and often will tell you whether they're likely to have the class of records you need, and for the right time period. Moreover, you can save on gas and stretch your research budget, and you can carry on your research on Sundays or in the middle of the night if you care to. Their recommended \\"Internet Research Log\\" is remarkably similar to the classic courthouse log we all use (or should). One of the best uses of the Internet, in my own experience, has been in locating other researchers with intersecting interests, something which was very time-consuming and very hit-or-miss in the old days. The chapters on \\"Finding People in the Modern Era\\" and \\"Sharing with Others\\" provide excellent guidance on carrying out such a quest as well as turning up those long-lost distant cousins your grandfather told you about. The U.S. census (and also, now, those in the UK) is largely available online these days -- the actual images, not just printed transcripts or extracts -- and much of that now is accompanied by searchable every-name indexes that far outstrip the old Soundex and Miracode files. Naturalization records and federal land purchase records are now coming rapidly online. So are local property records. And back runs of newspapers. And older military records and unit histories. And there's hardly a library anymore without an online-accessible catalog, which is a boon to Interlibrary Loan users. And yet, while outlining these exciting advances and interspersing the discussion with frequent screen shots from useful websites, the authors keep hammering on the important point: The essentials of research haven't really changed! You still have to think and analyze and evaluate! Although any book on such a volatile subject will begin to be out of date almost as soon as it's published, I have to say this is one of the best treatments I have seen."},{"Title":"Online Roots: How to Discover Your Family's History and Heritage With the Power of the Internet","review":"I have to admit this book was a bit overwhelming for someone trying to get a handle on geneology, and just focusing on certain of his lineage without too many frills. This is not a criticism, however, since this book is supposed to be a reference book more than anything else, and the author is trying and succeeding in giving us as much information as she can. I did read it from cover to cover to get the lay of the land, and found it well-written, thorough, and careful in its exposition of the subject. It was recommended by the more general Geneology 101, and was a good follow-up. This book took 101 a step further in showing us how to take max advantage of the net and save some foot steps.It was interesting to me that the author pursued so much detail about so much of her extended family, such as great-great uncles, and third cousins once-removed. I also was intrigued by her effort to get supporting information about the areas her forbears lived in, the geographical properties, the commerce going on there, the character and feel of the area, etc. It is more than I would want to go after, at least just starting; though it would be fun to have some of this background.The biggest tips are to sign-up for a paid online service like ancestry.com, and to join a geneological society, even if only an online bulletin board set-up. Indeed, all roads seemed to end at ancestry.com as I found out. I would start out on a free website sited in the book, looking for something specific, and would be led to ancestor.com, with its notice of a 14-day free trial. Now that I've read Geneology 101 and Online Roots, I'll probably take advantage of that offer.She also strongly recommended looking for work someone else has already done on your family tree. There are sites where you can get this, and again it looks like ancestry.com is the biggest. She also recommended free tutorial websites before getting started, and that might have been the best advice of all.I believe I'm ready to start my journey and I'll update this review when I see how it goes."},{"Title":"Online Roots: How to Discover Your Family's History and Heritage With the Power of the Internet","review":"Since I am new to the field of genealogy I purchased several books starting with the Researchers Guide to American Genealogy. In order to do more research using my computer several more books were purchased. It was not until I purchased \\"On line Roots\\" that I found the one book that helped me the most and could have saved me $$ had I purchased it sooner.I would recommend this book to anyone. It might be of value to people who have been working on genealogies for some time. I think it's worth checking out to see if it might assist you."},{"Title":"Online Roots: How to Discover Your Family's History and Heritage With the Power of the Internet","review":"Online Roots by Pamela Boyer Porter, and Amy Johnson Crow is the companion book to Genealogy 101 also published by the National Genealogical Society (NGS). This is a must have book. Like the 101 book this is packed full of more resources than you can even process in one sitting or read. The first chapters are a repeat of some basics like interviewing your oldest living relatives and record their stories and info. Then gather all documents and records around your home and immediate family. Then compile your tree and gather the vital documents.Now enter the internet. The internet or web is a vast window into so many areas of research that can help your find ancestor's names and possibly their port of entry and country of origin for the emigrant ancestors. There are many chapters that help you flesh out the names and dates. This book reminds you that each of those names is a person with a life that deserves to be remembered. They had a job, family, successes and failures. So with chapters like Wading Deeper, Visiting the Courthouse, Finding clues to Military service and discovering Ancestors at work and worship, you find different avenues you never thought of to put flesh on the bones of your pedigree. Read the history of the area they are from and discover why they moved there or left. Read about the jobs or booms in the area and get a better understanding of the life your ancestor lived. Maybe you will find court papers from a trial or divorce. Maybe you will locate land deeds or bills of sale for items in a town. Each thing may give a clue to finding the next generation or even clarifying a mystery in the family lore.This was definitely a great book to read through for a novice like myself to start planning, but I can see this book will also become a companion and reference book as I climb my own family tree. As I take each branch I will use this book to ensure I flesh out as many details as I can before skipping to the next. I think this tool will help ensure that I pass on a full, interesting and informative family history and not just a list of names and dates to my kin now and unborn."},{"Title":"The Able Gardener: Overcoming Barriers of Age & Physical Limitations","review":"An excellent guide to the basics, Yeomans' \\"The Able Gardener\\" caters to gardeners with physical limitations.

It did make sense to me, but I know I'm going to read it again and keep it close to me for further insight. It did touch my soul, and made Green Politics deeper, more genuine and sincere than I thought.I wasn't sure Green Politics was for me, although I've been an Independent since Bill Clinton. Spretnak answered all the questions I had in a way that addressed all my concerns and made sense to me. For that, I will be eternally grateful."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Dimension of Green Politics","review":"This is another work by Charlene Spretnak, author of numerous books on Green ideology. Spretnak is one of the major ideologues of the Mystical Deep Ecology movement, which seeks to restore humanity to the old ways of goddess worship. Spretnak focuses on Ecofeminism, which posits a return to worship of female deities such as Gaia, or the &quot;Mother Earth&quot; goddess, and a society where women run the show. I know it sounds crazy, and it is, but this book is at least better then Spretnak's, &quot;Lost Goddesses of Early Greece&quot;, which I also reviewed for Amazon.com. At least in this book we get an articulation of the philosophy behind the madness.Spretnak trots out her same old tired arguments; mankind and its patriarchal society have subdued both nature and women, and has created unnatural roles for everyone to try and fulfill. Violence against women come from these forced roles. If society would only embrace the old &quot;matrifocal&quot; (read: women in charge) ways, we'd all be better off. Spretnak also makes some arguments that the Judeo-Christian religious structure is acting against nature, and that it should acknowledge its pagan foundations and work towards preserving nature.The most interesting aspect of this book was Spretnak's examination of spirituality, hence the title of the book. She believes that society would be better off if everyday, people would engage in spiritual exercises and then try and live up to them the rest of the day. Spretnak says that once a week people would attend little meetings where kindness and love would be discussed. I'm amazed she doesn't mention somebody bringing a guitar to the meeting so everyone could break into song while they're holding hands. Another aspect of this spirituality is what Spretnak calls, &quot;body parables&quot;. These parables occur when a person gets a sense of being one with the harmonic forces of the universe. She believes that childbirth and post-orgasmic sensations help women attain this oneness. She talks of the feeling of borders being crossed or broken down. This is the way it should be, Spretnak says, because boundaries are just arbitrary and relative anyway. Really. I guess she is right. Who needs boundaries on their behavior. If it feels good, just do it. No wonder our society is in such a mess.I read this book after reading Kenn Kassman's, &quot;Envisioning Ecotopia&quot;, which looked at the Green movement in some depth. Spretnak was used as source material for this book, so I wanted to get a closer look at the belly of the beast, so to speak. I found this book to be a sick fraud and unhealthy for society. It is only interesting as a look at what makes the far, far left tick.

The original material was excellent of course, just as I remember it."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"For those who have read \\"Knight Life,\\" \\"One Knight Only\\" will definitely come as something of a surprise. It's a much more serious novel for perhaps much more serious times. That's not to say that there isn't still much of the same sort of humor that readers have seen in \\"Knight Life\\" and other Peter David stories, but on the whole, this is a much more weighty book.I'll admit, it took me a while to get used to the more serious tone of this story, but once I did, it turned out to really be pretty good. In the original \\"Knight Life,\\" Arthur Penn became mayor of New York. In this story, he's since moved up in the political arena --- way up --- and has now become President of the United States. It's been quite a journey and there have been losses along the way too --- Merlin, for one, turned to stone by Miss Basil, whom he was no longer able to control. Arthur is also now faced with the growing threat of top terrorist leader Arnim Sandoval, who will soon make things personal. But all of this may be nothing compared to the very legendary individual that Arthur will soon be facing.If you liked \\"Knight Life,\\" I'd say give \\"One Knight Only\\" a try. It may not quite match the amazing standard of writing set by Peter David in that first story, but it's still good."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"Personally I found this sequel to be a far cry from the enthralling tale that was Knight Life. The narrative jumps around and it seems that David tries to hard to incorporate several other mythological literature heroes into the tale.The result is a storyline that doesn't flow and has no clear objective. I found myself struggling just to finish the book.Definitely a disappointment from the witty tales we are used to from this author."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"I enjoyed the first book,(Knight Life) and was eager to read this one. It was a definite disappointment. I kept looking for more story after it had stopped- I can't say finished,because \\"finish\\" implies an ending and a resolution and neither of these were included in the book I read. Did Mr. David just get tired and quit writing? Did the publisher leave out some of the book? I don't know, but I'm VERY glad I borrowed it from the library before buying it."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"One Knight Only is the second novel in the King Arthur series, following Knight Life. In the previous volume, Arthur Pendragon has foiled the plotting of Morgan Le Fay, has become the Mayor of New York City, and has married the current incarnation of Guinevere. Life is good, but circumstances soon change.In this novel, Arthur has moved up the political ladder to become President of the United States. Now he has gained another mortal enemy in a powerful terrorist, Merlin is transformed into a statue of stone (never irritate a basilisk), and an assassin has shot Gwen in the head. She is dying slowly and Arthur is far beyond distraught. Then Percival brings news of a possible way to cure Gwen.Hidden in the Skeleton Keys offshore of Peru is a fabulous place ruled by an immortal High King. Percy suspects that the island is one of the forms of the Holy Grail. If they can get Gwen to the island so that she can drink from the Grail, she will be cured of her wound.This novel brings together the famous king of the Britons with someone even more legendary: Gilgamesh, the original knight errant. It is a tale of immortality, loyalty, power, and compassion. In a way, it addresses the problems of terrorism and sworn enemies.Arthur finds it hard to adapt his ancient principles to the demands of the presidency, almost running afoul of the Peter Principle, but pulling through with a little help from his friends. As usual, his very much out of date viewpoint shows some attributes of modern society in an unusual way, but he manages to adapt and learn and the country is the better for it.In some respects, this novel is not as good as his first novel (in either the original or revised form). Some of the freshness and glamour has worn off the plot, but there are still some very funny one-liners and situations as Arthur confronts the illogical and irrational in current affairs.Highly recommended for David fans and anyone else who would enjoy a story combining tales of the country bumpkin coming to town with elements of the return of the king."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"In Knight Life, Peter David gave us funny, action-packed fantasy surrounding Arthur, the Once and Future King, who has come back to life and is making a bid to become mayor of New York. In the long-awaited sequel, One Knight Only, Arthur has advanced to the presidency -- but this is no light-hearted yarn.One Knight Only is a much grimmer book than its predecessor. That's not to say it lacks humor, but it's much subtler and less likely to have you laughing out loud as you read. Instead, you'll find yourself riveted to the page as the ultimate fantasy hero confronts the ultimate real-world evil."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"Legends never die they just wait to be reborn in another time and place. King Arthur the Pendragon slept in a secret cave for over a millennium until he was needed again and Merlin woke him from his enchanted slumber. Arthur was running for Mayor of New York when he met his reincarnated wife and remarried her. When terrorists blow up whole blocks of New York City, Arthur and Gwen were right in the middle of the rescue efforts and their heroics captured the heart of America.Arthur ran for president as an independent and won but during his term he lost Merlin who was turned into a stone statue by a Basilisk. Arthur and Gwen carried out the war on terrorism until Gwen was shot by an assassin's bullet leading to Arthur resigning the presidency. With Percival, the last Immortal Knight, he travels to Pus Island, which is presided over by Gilgamesh. There they hope to find the Holy Grail, which is Gwen's only hope of survival, but first they must battle enemies both human and immortal.ONE KNIGHT ONLY is a twenty-first century rendition of the Arthurian legend and the once and Future Kind loses none of his majesty and valor in a modern setting. Gilgamesh, who is two-thirds god and one third human, is the perfect opponent for the Pendragon since they are both imbued with magic. Peter David has written a fantasy novel that incorporates modern day terrorism into the Arthurian legend.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"In \\"One Knight Only\\" Arthur Penn (the King Arthur modernized) once again must go on a quest for the Holy Grail to save the live of his wife Gwen (King Arthur's queen reincarnated).Slightly less humorous and a few shades darker than the first installment in David's trilogy, Arthur faces the legendary Gilgamesh in an effort to capture the Holy Grail. David obviously has researched his legendary characters, but those less versed in world mythology may be left slightly in the dark.My major problem with this novel was the use of italics passages for what I felt unapparent reasons. It disrupts the story and changes the tense of the story. All in all, though, it's worth a read, and I will be purchasing the third book in the series."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"I don't think anything is worse in the literary realm than committing to a series when you know you're not enjoying it.

I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"I found this book and the entire series very entertaining.The whole concept is intriging.Touches on secret societies and religion.Action, drama, comedy all in one book."},{"Title":"One Knight Only (Knight Life)","review":"Arthur: \\"If I have need of you, I shall summon you...how? Through mystic incantation? A crystal ball of some kind you will give me?\\"Basiliskos: \\"Arthur...don't be an .... This is the twenty-first century... Contact me in that manner.\\"\\"One Knight Only\\" is the recently published sequel to \\"Knight Life\\", Peter David's very first novel. In \\"Knight Life\\" Peter constructed a tale in which Arthur, having returned to life to run for mayor of modern-day New York City, must not only deal with modern politics in order to reclaim his mantle as a leader, but with a beautiful woman named Gwen who looks impossibly like the queen he loved 1500 years ago, a backwards-aged Merlin, and old enemies from his past that will do anything to destroy his political future. In \\"One Knight Only\\", we see Arthur as President of the United States, dealing with terrorism, assassination attempts, the loss of loved ones, conniving journalists looking for a scoop, and a mysterious, powerful King who holds a powerful weapon that Arthur desperately needs.I will say that I found it jarring that Peter suddenly jumped ahead to the middle of Arthur's Presidency without making this material into a novel of its own to tell us how Arthur did this, instead relying on flashbacks and exposition, but I suppose he felt he covered that type of election story with the first novel, and didn't want to rehash himself. We find out that the U.S., having recently signed a treaty with a country named Trans-Sabal (which will be familiar to readers of Peter David's stint on Marvel Comics' \\"X-Factor\\"), has been dealing with the terrorism of a man named Arnim Sandoval, and after a vicious assassination attempt strikes home at Arthur's White House, Arthur, without Merlin or Percival at his side to advise him, must not only deal with the tragedy of the act, but with a country convinced that Trans-Sabal was behind the act, and clamoring for blood.It is here that Peter uses Arthur's response as the President to terrorism on U.S. soil as a way of exploring what should be done when a President has a personal stake in going after a dangerous terrorist, and one wonders just how much of what he puts in here he put because it just made a good story, and how much of it is his own commentary on what he thinks about the terrorism policy of the current real-life occupant of the Oval Office. Arthur does seem to take a greater back seat to other characters in the story compared with the first novel, not necessarily because he got less page time, but more because he seems more reactive than pro-active in the story, with most of his actions being responses to attacks, bargains, or blackmails by other characters. Nonetheless, the story is entertaining and faithful to not only the source material as the last novel was, but also to other stories in ancient mythology, which those familiar with such stories will enjoy. Miss Basil is given an expanded role in this novel, as is Percival, and Percival's own quest, which leads him into a confrontation with an arrogant and terrifyingly powerful enemy, is brought together with the Arthur storyline in a gigantic climax that will send shockwaves ...literally.At 373 pages, it's only 30 pages longer than \\"Knight Life\\", and Peter expertly weaves drama, ancient fantasy, political philosophy and his trademark humor (which only rarely becomes annoyingly contrived in the book) into a very entertaining fantasy tale. I did find the ending a tad bit abrupt, leaving an important question unanswered about one of the main characters, and Peter David's statement that a third book is not a definite thing made me wonder if this point slipped his mind, but it was still an entertaining read, and hopefully there will be a third book that answers it. Bottom line, if you like Peter David, and you liked \\"Knight Life,\\" go pick up \\"One Knight Only.\\""},{"Title":"The Oxford History of the American West","review":"Great reference book for high school/college educators who teach, or are a student of the American West."},{"Title":"The Oxford History of the American West","review":"This book has been a trusted overview source for my own research.

His secondary purpose, which is based on and is necessary for achieving the first goal, is to discuss the general history of the Near East-Israel's neighbors.At the outset, Grabbe does not fail to mention the scarcity, and on some accounts, the uncertainty of sources that pertain to some of the periods he addresses, particularly the Persian and Hellenistic (2,3, 111). Says Grabbe, &quot;Any history of the Persian Empire must acknowledge that the sources are few, often biased, and leave out large periods of time&quot; (119). This is especially true of the history of Judea during this particular time frame. Before one attempts to study this history, it is necessary to understand that Palestine's geographical location put her in the middle of a hot bed of geopolitical turmoil. It is also important to understand the concept or theological importance of being &quot;in the land,&quot; or as Grabbe puts it, the concept of &quot;remnant&quot; (143). These two factors have always played a dominant role in Jewish history. Beginning a history of Judea during the initial stages of the Persian Empire provides for one of the most intriguing studies. Conditions in Judea at this time were most interesting on the social level. This was a precarious time for the Jews and the Jewish state. That there were internal socioeconomic problems is seen in the fifth chapter of Nehemiah. Again, this was related to the issue of land. Grabbe points out that the internal struggles are clearly alluded to by the lack of productivity between the arrival of the first wave of Jews around 539/38 BC and the time of Nehemiah's reform (93). Why was the city still in such a terrible state?For those &quot;returning to the land&quot; and those already &quot;in the land,&quot; the post-Exilic period would pose many unforeseen problems. Grabbe paints a good picture by pointing out the awkwardness between those who remained &quot;in the land&quot; after 586 BC and those who returned following the decree of Cyrus. Those who remained comprised the bulk of the population, consisting primarily of the lower classes. They would have had the advantage of procuring and working the land (possibly large estates) vacated by the upper classes, which made up the primary contingency for transportation to Babylon (120,121). Those left behind were not necessarily enthusiastic to see the owners return. Likewise, those who came home did not expect to find their ancestral property occupied. &quot;Land ownership&quot; became a prominent issue (24). Economy in Judea was primarily based on farming, and what trade did exist was for immediate local consumption. Although Grabbe does not state this, it is probable that much of the merchant class either remained in the flourishing cities east of the Euphrates, having built up a successful reputation, or moved elsewhere. Others state that there would have been no substantial market in the ruins of Judea. However, it is clear from Nehemiah that &quot;goldsmiths and merchants&quot; were a part of the Jewish corpus that helped rebuild the city (Neh 3:32).When discussing the social reform of Nehemiah, I think Grabbe highlights the major focus of the book. Restoration was important, especially the rebuilding of the central religious establishment. The Jews were very aware of the circumstances that led to the seventy-year exile. They most certainly contemplated this with the laying of each new brick. How would they prevent past mistakes from recurring? How would they remain pure and separate from the polluted world around them? Born from this are such topics as the supposed &quot;sectarianism&quot; (103,111) or &quot;exclusivist&quot; social temperament (608,609) that was so prominent in Jewish society. This helps explain the rise of the different social movements, sects and parties such as the Maccabean revolts, Hasidim, Pharisees, Essenes, zealots and the sacarii. Many of these groups grew out of the concept of &quot;socio-religious purity.&quot; Their aim was to maintain not only Jewish independence, but also a theocratic tradition or superiority, kept unadulterated from the outside world. This most certainly contributed to the internal social climate during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. It is unnecessary and perhaps historically irresponsible to categorize all of Judea's problems as solely religious in nature. For example, Grabbe points out that not all so-called &quot;Judaizers&quot; (orthodox) were opposed to every aspect of Hellenistic culture (169). Many of the problems during the Oniad-Tobiad crises were rooted in the political sphere. However, one must ask, &quot;What was the primary spark that ignited the Maccabean uprising?&quot; It certainly was not a revolt against Hellenism as such, but was due to the religious oppression from the Seleucids (268). Eventually the revolt evolved into a fight for independence, in the hopes of improving the socioeconomic conditions in Judea.This separatist attitude of the Jews later caused anti-Jewish sentiment on the part of the Greeks and Romans. The anti-Semitism that emerged during the Hellenistic-Roman periods was fostered under Hasmonean rule, for it was then that a major Judaizing or proselytizing campaign was carried out among the surrounding peoples, especially the Itureans and Idumeans. To the Greeks and Romans, the Jews demanded religious tolerance but denied it to others (411). It must be stressed that it was not uncommon to explain socioeconomic conditions in religious language (122). Apocalytpic became a popular style of writing and messianism characterized general social expectations. It is little wonder that the first major building project during the administration of Herod the Great was a new and grandiose Temple center. Although Grabbe's book is in no way a theological treatise on the Second Temple period, he does allude to Israel's spiritual condition on several occasions, and never fails to tie this in with the overall evaluation of the period. Grabbe's two volume series is a valuable resource for anyone's Intertestimental history library."},{"Title":"EMOTIONALLY DURABLE DESIGN","review":"The message of this book is a good one.

In this case, that book is Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain -- an American classic lately turned controversial due to the language Twain uses to portray slave ownership in mid-1800's U.S. society.The protagonist of Huckleberry Fiend is Paul McDonald -- free-lance journalist, aspiring novelist, and newly-minted half home-owner. Paul lives in the downstairs flat of the house he just bought, while the upstairs flat is inhabited by co-owner and lady love Sardis Kincannon. Sardis and Paul juggle romance with freedom by buying a house together yet living separately, not even exchanging keys.Paul's friend Booker, a well-to-do burglar with Daddy issues, winds up with a burgled copy of a manuscript that may very well be a hand-written first draft of Huckleberry Finn. But the very day after Booker steals the manuscript, its burgled owner is found dead. Coincidence? Booker fears not, and hires Paul to find out who rightfully owns the papers, and who wants them so much he or she will murder to acquire them.Huckleberry Fiend quotes from Twain's novel as well as provides a wealth of information about Twain himself (Samuel Clemens) and the fascinating subculture of book collectors and Mark Twain aficionados.In the course of his investigation, Paul will meet up with eccentric Mark Twain collectors Pamela Temby, a romance writer of a certain age; Herb Wolf, film producer with a predisposition towards violence and a gourmet appetite; Rick Debay, antiquarian bookstore owner who keeps impecunious literary author Jenny Swensen on staff to impress his clients; and Tom Sawyer, yes Tom Sawyer -- a man who has his name legally changed from Tom Sayers to Tom Sawyer and then converts his home to a Mark Twain museum where he lovingly recreates full-size tableaux from Huckleberry Finn. Along the way, Paul will also re-acquaint himself with Twain's masterpiece and navigate the perilous waters of romance with Sardis.Halfway through reading the book, I said to my husband, \\"As soon as I finish this, I want to re-read Huckleberry Finn.\\" That's the mark of a good literary mystery!

In about 150 pages, the editor collected some of the wittiest remarks Russell has ever made. They sould be read bearing in mind Russel's own advice: &quot;I sould not wish to be thought in earnest only when I am solemn&quot;. Indeed, some of the funniest quotes in this book are also the deepest ones. Add to that the ramarkable eloquence and clarity of Russell's writings (he won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1950), and you obtain a real treasure.The contents of Russell's Best cover subjects as religion, ethics, politics and sex. Many of the views expressed in this book are obvious nowadays, but they were considered outrageous filth in conservative circles at the time of writing. Russell was a humanist and a pacifist, and he even spent some time in jail for that.This book is a good opportunity for people without any training in philosophy to get acquainted with the views of a great thinker.

The structure is too close to &quot;Queenie&quot;, the plot is too contrived, and the stars are quite tiresome over too many pages.

The story begins in Hollywood, where following Leigh's Oscar winning performance in \\"Gone with the Wind\\", the two lovers are appearing together in a financially disastrous tour of the US, in a series of Shakespeare's plays. The first sign of Felicia's mental fragility appears when she has a nervous breakdown, is hospitalised in a private sanitarium and the bills have to be paid by their agent, Hollywood sleaze, Marty Quick. This puts them in his debt for years and even after the start of WW2 when they have returned to London, he follows them to show his complete control over what they can perform. It's a very sexy book , peopled by over the top characters in whom the readers will totally believe (and perhaps even recognise).

The stile is similar to &quot;Aircraft of The Luftwaffe Fighter Aces&quot;, from Bernd Barbas's, made only over pictures and practically without technical text. Noteworthy is the initial section, with 10 (ten) WWII original color pictures, from the author and other sources. A small four pages introduction summarizes the action and operation of the 109 from Spain to Battle of Britain. Of course, because that, the book cover only the versions until the &quot;Emil&quot; (Bf 109E). The photo collection includes a rare image of the first 109 sent to Spain (the V-4) for evaluation, piloted by Hannes Trautloft. The pictures, most in close-ups, are an excellent reference for modelers. As this book is part of a collection, which covers the Luftwaffe action over all fronts, I recommend the purchase of all of them. (Note: Although all these qualities, I ranked this book only 3 stars because it is edited based only in photographs, without any other technical information. As just an image bank, it could be, perhaps, a five star one)."},{"Title":"Women's Rites","review":"I was absolutely transposed reading this book.

Series minor)","review":"A real classic in which Greenberg tries to examine the couple Marked-Unmarked in languages, hence in linguistics, a book we cannot ignore. This couple of concepts are fundamental and basic in and for phonology and they were actually invented for phonology by Jakobson among others. After analyzing them in that context, Greenberg tries to transfer them to grammar and lexicon, and the attempt is interesting but probably not the best thing to do. It would have been a lot more constructive to analyze the real universals of both grammar and lexicon. The fundamental rule is that the unmarked category is more frequent, and he reverses it into one criterion to know an unmarked category is to look for the more frequent one. That seems to work very well for phonology though in his fourth chapter he pays lip service to the major difference between phonology on one side and grammar-lexicon on the other side : \\"the sound meaning relation [...] is absent in the former and present in the latter.\\" (p. 63)It is surprising that does not derail his attempt because it is a fundamental parameter in genetic linguistics, and Greenberg remains one master in that field: any resemblance or similitude has no genetic value if it does not associate both the form and the meaning. This goes back to de Saussure and was vastly amplified by Meillet. It is also in full contradiction with what he himself states page 68: \\"such highly infrequent formation must follow analogically other parts of the system while only a fairly frequent form can preserve irregularities.\\" The system, so dear to Meillet for example, in grammar and lexicon is seen by Greenberg himself as a regulating instance that eliminates highly infrequent forms when opposed to highly frequent ones.I am now going to make a few remarks on particular points. His frequency hierarchy Singular-Plural/Plural-Dual is bizarre because it does not take into account the phylogeny of number that started from a collective singular containing plurality, then extracted smaller and smaller meaningful groups, the dual being the most famous one because of the two hands, feet and other organs of the same type and the extension of this physiological dual to shoes, gloves, and even oxen. \\"Children\\" is not a dual but is a typical extracted collective plural that survives today. Then when the unit is reached the plural is invented as an exterior dimension by multiplication. His hierarchy then does not correspond to a logic of any sort and cannot explain why that dual can survive even in our languages.When he deals with personal pronouns he does not take into account the second person because in English it is the same word in the singular and the plural. But how can he compare the first person to all the third persons, singular or plural, when it is obvious that first and second persons are linked together in the very communicative act: the speaker and the listener, the emitter and the receiver, etc? His statistics that give a vast dominance to the third person singular or plural are unrealistic.Dealing with adjective couples like \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\", he says: \\"there is as far as is known to me, no language which lacks a separate term for \\"good\\" and expresses it normally by \\"not-bad\\".\\" The first language to which I think is Pali where for example there are four negative nouns: \\"vajja\\" (wrong belief), \\"mobha\\" (attachment), \\"dosa\\" (ill will, hatred), and \\"moha\\" (delusion) with the four positive terms built with the use of the privative prefix /a-/: \\"avajja\\" (right belief), \\"alobha\\" (generosity), \\"adosa\\" (goodwill, loving kindness), \\"amoha\\" (wisdom). And we could think of American that invented the negative adjective for a natural, hence positive state: \\"un-circumcised\\".What he says about the masculine agreement of adjectives attributed to both masculine and feminine nouns is maybe right in many languages (like Spanish that he quotes) but is wrong in French. The French could say: \\"j'ai achet&eacute; une robe et un manteau blancs\\" [literal: I have bought a (feminine) dress (feminine) and a (masculine) coat (masculine) white (masculine plural)] but the French would say: \\"j'ai achet&eacute; un manteau et une robe blanches\\" where the adjective is plural and feminine because \\"robe\\" is just before it. I am pretty sure there are many other languages that would consider agreement as more complex than what Greenberg says.He finally comes to a remark that is the admission his whole parallel between phonology and grammar-lexicon is questionable: \\"Thus in phonology diachronic process explains frequency, while in grammar, frequency explains diachronic process.\\" I am far from sure this generalization is warranted.His last chapter on kinship terms based only on frequency forgets simply that this set of words directly reflect the social organization of the family in the clan, the tribe and the society. In fact it is a set of words that reflect the level of development of the whole procreative and reproductive survival instinct of the species, the clan and the individual. That cannot be reduced to a few frequency statistics and if in Bantu languages there is a special term for the maternal uncle, it is because in the Bantu family the authority over the children is not the father but the mother's brother, at least in the traditional family. Nelson Mandela says a lot about this particular family structure. An important classic but that has to be taken with a good sense of criticism.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"},{"Title":"Legal Education Malpractice","review":"All law students, future and present, must read this book.

Taschen's collection of Escher's work is remarkably sparse on editorializing and allows the works to do what they have always done best: draw the viewer into the magical and hypnotic realm of M.C. Escher. The prints are extremely crisp and thoughtfully arranged, unlike other collections that throw works together in a hodge-podge fashion.No other artist of the 20th century has had such wide approval and acclaim as M.C. Escher, and this slim volume perfectly expresses why that is so without resorting to pages upon pages of discussions on deconstruction, reality vs. illusion or image vs. icon, and all the other blah-blah-blah that you'll find in other collections.

His best and most characteristic works, including \\"Depth\\" (1955), \\"Stars\\" (1948), and (naturally), \\"Other World\\" (1946) are highly imaginative, creating a fantastic and indescribable dream-universe all their own, one which must ultimately be experienced in order to be fully appreciated."},{"Title":"Every Seventeen Minutes the Crowd Goes Crazy!","review":"I was actually in a production of this one-act play. In my opinion it is a fabulous work. From the author of award winning play, &quot;The effect of gamma rays on man in the moon marigolds&quot; comes this haunting, contemporary play. The parents of eight children run off, abandoning their kids. Each child is equally disturbed, one girl develops anorexia, another begins hearing voices in her head, one boy refuses to admit the parents aren't coming back, and all of the others develop problems as well. This play runs about 40 minutes long, and in that time provokes thought and emotion. The author, Paul Zindel weaves allusions to Greek tragic plays into this modern work and does a truly excellent job! Every actor out there should read this play or see it performed. Not only is it a great modern play, but it is helpful to any actor looking for an interesting monologue. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bhupen Khakhar (Katha trailblazer series)","review":"The late Bhupen Khakhar was, in my opinion, one of the great artists of the final years of 20th Century. In Timothy Hyman's overview of his life and career, it states that although Khakhar made no money from his play, MAUJILA MANILAL, he wrote and produced it because he felt he had to. I really didn't expect Khakhar to be much of a writer. (I've read Picasso's attempt at playwriting.) I was really surprised and delighted by the play, despite parts of it being incomprehensible without a glossary [more on that later]. The play shows the same zany sensibility that animates Khakhar's artwork. Khakhar also has a sense of dramatic construction that is almost unknown among novice playwrights. (Surely he had written other plays before that I just don't know about.) MAUJILA MANILAL is a comedy about a middle-aged bachelor who seduces two married women, although the protagonist is the husband of one of the women. There is an off-the-wall sense of humor combined with a spiritual sensibility and a rich sense of irony. I'd love to see the play produced, but the translation (by Bini Srinivasan) still needs a great deal of work. Also included in the volume are four of Khakhar's short stories, which deal mostly with the lives of the Indian petit bourgeois. I found the stories really interesting. Maganbhai's Glue (translated by Naushil Mehta) is a really funny comedy with a rather provocative twist at the end. Pages From a Diary (translated by Ganesh Devy) is interesting in its depiction of an unspoken homosexual courtship. Both Vadki (translated by Naushil Mehta) and Phoren Soap (translated by Ganesh Devy and Naushil Mehta) deal with the effects of a mundane object upon a married couple and a community. All of the stories have a Chekhovian sense of irony. This book is well worth having, if for nothing else, the amusing black-and-white illustrations by Khakhar. The only really first rate translation was Phoren Soap. There is a lot of awkwardness in the other stories and the play. A glossary of untranslatable terms would have been very helpful. Otherwise, an American can only guess at the meaning of sentences like: \\"The achmani was sparkling clean and the vadki was full of sheera.\\" I give Khakhar 5 stars; I give the translations 2 stars. Nonetheless, this is a must-have for Khakhar fans."},{"Title":"The African Dream: Visions of Love and Sorrow : The Art of John Muafangejo","review":"The Art of John Muafangego,Visions of Love and Sorrow: celebrates the compassion and skill of an unique artist.

At age 5 I was owned by a huge rusty red Collie - Macintosh, in my teens I was owned by a stunning Sable and White Collie - Piney Branch Lindsay Lad, and currently I am owned by a striking, pirate-like tri-color Collie - Captain Jack Sparrow. As a child, I read many of the Terhune books, fell in love with his enchanting writing style which created imagery reminiscent of a Thomas Kincaid painting. Aside from those facts, I am a completely unbiased reviewer of this wonderful book. Needless to say I was inspired to capture the not so dissimilar adventures, personalities, mischief and family love of this wonderful breed when I wrote the novel \\"Jack: The Christmas Collie\\".Lad: A Dog is no mere dog. Through the eyes of Terhune or anyone who really takes time to understand their canine, especially Collies, we discover that Lad truly has a Soul. He is the most noble of the many Terhune Collies. He is the champion, the alpha dog, the canine master and protector of The Place. Terhune describes The Place as essentially a Disney World for Collies; simply utopic. The book begins with the oddly one-sided love affair between Lad and Lady in the chapter \\"The Mate\\" While Terhune portrays himself as the Master of The Place and through Lad's eyes, lives on a pedestal, and is supreme law of the land, Terhune also puts Lad and to a lesser degree, the other canines on a pedestal so that we can have the opportunity through Terhunes keen insight into his \\"chums\\" to see how truly magnificent in character and companionship these dogs are. Throughout the chapters and stories, Terhune gives play to several of his other Collies including Wolf, but clearly, the centerpiece of the book is Lad. He was simply the most magnificent and favored of them all. Once the finish this book, you cannot help but be moved by what you will perceive through Terhunes eyes which also allow us the readers to perceive often through Lad's eyes. Terhune considered himself a hack of a writer, but I am convinced that comment should be considered a typo and maybe he really meant that he had a \\"knack\\" as a writer. An old rule of thumb is to write about that which you know. Well, Mr. Terhune certainly knew about Collies and learned about them and through his wonderful works we may glimpse a peek into what he knew.I heartily recommend this book and Terune's others.Kevin BrettAuthor: \\"Jack: The Christmas Collie\\"Jack: The Christmas Collie"},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"My mother got this book for me when I was about 13, many years ago.

He was a delightful dog and I showed him in obedience, obtaining a C.D. degree at American Kennel Club shows. He was gentle natured, loving, willing to please. Years after he died, when we lived in Phoenix, AZ, with very hot summers, my husand and I purchased a Doberman Pinscher, because of their short coat and because we had seen several of them do well in obedience. While the dispostions of Collies and Dobermans are very different, we also have loved our Dobermans and have owned several of them.

I am very thankful for the day I found this book, and it will always be a very special one."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"Collies have shared this world with humans for at least a thousand years; in the Heimskringla, published around 1235, one of the 11th century Norwegian kings is so impressed with the herding ability of one he finds in Ireland that he brings it home in his ship. (Today, we associate them more with Scotland than Ireland).This herding dog comes in 3 sizes and \\"rough\\" (long haired) and \\"smooth\\" (short haired) versions. The rough and smooth, I imagine, are the same in other characteristics, but the full size, Border, and miniature (Shetland sheepdog) have completely different \\"personalities\\", and it's the full size collie that is featured in literature.The first full length book I ever read, at age 8, wasLassie Come-Home, and in adolescence I discovered the even older books by Albert Payson Terhune, dating from the time of World War I. Over time, I lived with three different collies, and one other dog, in real life - one collie was mine, the other two were my late sister's. Mr. Terhune knows a great deal about them, and I am quite sure his books are authentic renditions of what really happened in those far off days a century ago when Lad lived. In every person's life, there should be a special dog to love that person. For Mr. Terhune, it was Lad; for me, it was Samson, the second collie we had.Compared to other dogs, collies are intelligent. Compared to humans, of course, they are rather stupid. But, they have ways of perceiving things that we don't. If a collie likes you, be assured, you're a good person. If he or she doesn't like you, you should worry about getting your life in order. How do they know? They just know. I fed and walked them, but they were not fooled: they knew my mother was the best person in the family and they adored her suitably, always greeting her first when we came home and curling up around her feet whenever she was in one place long enough (a great inconvenience for her, which she bore with long-suffering fortitude). Collies love children and tolerate most people; most of them are useless as watchdogs as a result. They have a powerful herding instinct; by contrast, the hunting instinct in most dogs has been practically bred out of them. Put one in an open outdoor space with several other animals (or children) and the dog will automatically round them up, whether it has been taught to herd or not.Getting back to Mr. Terhune's book about Lad, it is a collection of short stories that I bought for my own children and reread myself after last seeing it as an adolescent. My favorite as a grownup is the dog show at Madison Square Garden, where the American Kennel Club (AKC) made the error of hiring as a judge a crabbed old Scotsman, Angus McGilead, who knew everything about collies but was not an \\"organization man\\". Ignoring the breed standards, which even in his time preferred an overly long snout and small eyes, a source of inbreeding and health problems in collies to this day, McGilead gave Lad first prize in the beginner's class, and then after discovering that one of the other handlers was cheating, Lad ended up as Best of Breed. The AKC fired the judge immediately. The bureaucratic infighting aspect is invisible to a child reading this story, but adds interest for an adult.A minor objection to the book is that it's written for a much more literate audience than today's children; mine were unable to read it without help because of the sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structure. Books about pets are not common today, and they are not generally meant for adults. The Lad stories are suitable for children, but not as accessible as they could be. Whether that's because they were written for adults, or because today's educational system has been dumbed down so far that children are unable to read things their grandparents could have handled easily at the same age, I prefer not to speculate.The edition I got from Amazon was a facsimile of the original with large, legible print that, were it not for its grown-up diction, would be perfect for children. I recommend this book, with slight reservations, for children in the age group from 8 to 12, as well as for adults who want to remember that One Special Dog that, in Terhune's words, graced their own lives for \\"a pitiful handful of years.\\""},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"One of my all time favorite authors!

Needless to say I was inspired to capture the not so dissimilar adventures, personalities, mischief and family love of this wonderful breed when I wrote the novel \\"Jack: The Christmas Collie\\".Lad: A Dog is no mere dog. Through the eyes of Terhune or anyone who really takes time to understand their canine, especially Collies, we discover that Lad truly has a Soul. He is the most noble of the many Terhune Collies. He is the champion, the alpha dog, the canine master and protector of The Place. Terhune describes The Place as essentially a Disney World for Collies; simply utopic. The book begins with the oddly one-sided love affair between Lad and Lady in the chapter \\"The Mate\\" While Terhune portrays himself as the Master of The Place and through Lad's eyes, lives on a pedestal, and is supreme law of the land, Terhune also puts Lad and to a lesser degree, the other canines on a pedestal so that we can have the opportunity through Terhunes keen insight into his \\"chums\\" to see how truly magnificent in character and companionship these dogs are. Throughout the chapters and stories, Terhune gives play to several of his other Collies including Wolf, but clearly, the centerpiece of the book is Lad. He was simply the most magnificent and favored of them all. Once the finish this book, you cannot help but be moved by what you will perceive through Terhunes eyes which also allow us the readers to perceive often through Lad's eyes. Terhune considered himself a hack of a writer, but I am convinced that comment should be considered a typo and maybe he really meant that he had a \\"knack\\" as a writer. An old rule of thumb is to write about that which you know. Well, Mr. Terhune certainly knew about Collies and learned about them and through his wonderful works we may glimpse a peek into what he knew.I heartily recommend this book and Terune's others.Kevin BrettAuthor: \\"Jack: The Christmas Collie\\"Jack: The Christmas Collie"},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"Before my review, you have to understand where I'm coming from.

Terhune's book series was based on the very real Sunnybank Lad, \\"a thoroughbred in body and soul.\\"I also found Terhune's books very satisfying reading and couldn't get enough of them or of Thomas Hinkle's horse stories."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"This book is composed of twelve short stories first published in magazines and loosely based on the life of a real-life rough collie named Lad, who lives on The Place with The Master and the Mistress and leads a heroic and adventuresome life. I enjoyed reading the book. Some instances of smoking occur, and the words hell, damn, and God are occasionally used not necessarily as curse words but in ways that some people would not like. Otherwise, there is nothing objectionable, and most folks will consider it a good set of dog stories."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read to my children and they really liked it.Lisa Cohoe"},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"I generally hate clich&eacute;s like \\"kids of all ages,\\" but it just really suits this book. I first discovered Albert Payson Terhune and Lad in seventh grade, much to the chagrin of our school librarian. She had to eventually temporarily ban me from checking the book out any further so that other kids could read it. In those days I did not realize I was reading about a long dead author and the most famous of his dogs, nor did I realize that the stories actually were taking place in the early part of the 20th century.None of that mattered to me then (or now for the matter). I was drawn into the world of Lad and Terhune every time I opened those pages. Eventually, I managed to read most of his works and came to truly admire Terhune's writing, even though I have since read that he considered himself to be a hack.It's now many years later, and there is still magic in these books for me. I have several of the books waiting for the day my very young daughters (a two year old and a four year old) are ready to read books that don't have pictures on every page. In fact, I've got a backlog of books I want to share with them, but I'm willing to bet we start with Lad.If your children have any interest in animals in general or dogs in particular, you must get this book, and all of Terhune's other works if you can find them, for your children. Sure, the language may be a lttile strange at times, but your child will still love this book all the same."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"The best dog book ever written. A simple but striking story of fidelity between a man and his dog. Originally a tribute to Lad and the many other dogs who shared Terhune's estate, it is now a tribute to the ethical reality of Lad's life.You can still visit a portion of the Terhune estate in Wayne, New Jersey. The Place (house)is gone, but the grounds remain. You will see Lad's grave marker, along with the grave markers of many other dogs made famous in Terhune's books. You can visit the shore of the lake and stroll the grounds. You can feel Lad's eerie presence as he lives over and over again the stories from the pages of Terhune's books. Or perhaps he is still there. Look -- is that ..."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"Albert Payson Terhune was always quick to disparage the quality of his own writing. He considered himself a hack writer and his humility was deep and genuine.Mr. Terhune, however, grossly underestimated himself. As &quot;Lad: A Dog&quot; shows, his genius was in his ability to make his readers care deeply about his subjects. &quot;The Place&quot; becomes your home, and Lad your beloved hero.This book is not to be missed. It is thoroughly entertaining, and packed with selflessness and the purest of love.&quot;The Place&quot;, by the way, is now &quot;Terhune Memorial Park&quot;, and is a wonderful place to visit, with the dogs' graves still intact there."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"This was the first book I read by Albert Payson Terhune - after which I was on a quest for all the others I could find. I was a kid then. Now, a LONG time later,I recently picked up Lad: A Dog once more and it wasn't like picking up other things from the past - I was drawn into it, completely. I wish I hadn't stayed away so long! It is good to come back to The Place. It doesn't feel like reading a \\"kid's book\\". This is for everyone, all ages, there's sweetness, there's action, too. And so many things to think about. There was only one Lad, but I think all our dogs have qualities we may be overlooking. Mr. Terhune had wonderful insights about dogs and only wanted us to appreciate them more. These are shining, exceptional books, and Lad : A Dog is definitely the one to start with if you haven't read these works yet."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"Tense, touching, wonderfully told.

Now an adult, I still read it on a regular basis, and am addicted to Terhune's adventurous and beautifully written stories about his heroic collie dogs. If you love dogs, trust me, you will adore this book! Lad, the main character in the novel has to face danger and foes in every chapter, and displays to his master and mistress his loyalty and devotion to them. Even someone who is not into dogs will give this masterpiece a rightful place on their bookshelf. Five stars is not a high enough rating!

This was in 1950. The book, in reality a collection of short stories about a wonderful dog named Lad, are loosly connected. This book had quite an impact on me and has stuck with me throughout the years. Reading this, and other Terhune works, always brings the young boy out in me. I guess being a life long animal lover, particularly dogs, helps, but being a life long lover of books certainly does not hurt either. Yes, the language and syntax is indeed from another era, but for me this is a plus as I enjoy this sort of thing. Yes, there are some sad parts to this work, as in other Terhune books, but then that is sort of like life, isn't it? I cannot imagine an animal lover not enjoying these books. Perhaps here are some, but I doubt it. I am very glad this work is still in print as we would be much poorer without it. So many of our old stories are being lost now, it is nice to see that some of them are surviving. Highly recommend this one for both young and old. This is an excellent one to either read to your child or start your child in his or her interest in reading."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"This is one of those stories that draws you in, creates vivid pictures in your mind, and stays with you forever. We read this book 7 years ago, and I still think of it often. I can't wait till our sons are old enough to read it.I don't think I can really do any justice to writing about Lad, or the story. The writing is wonderful, the characters are engaging, and the dog is the most memorable dog I've ever read about. The end is very sad, so be prepared for that."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"I read this as a young boy (probably around 10) in the 1960's, as part of a children's book club (I also loved 'Three against the Wilderness' and 'Coral Island'). Until I got to the end of this book I hadn't realised that Lad was born over 100 years ago (1902), so the footnote at the end describing Lad's death was quite a shock, even though I couldn't really expect Lad to live to over 500 in doggy years. It's a testament to the quality of this book that it has never been out of print since being first published in 1919.I'm sure the stories are embellished a bit for story-telling, but the simple tales ring true. In each chapter, Lad has a separate adventure and generally emerges a hero. One can't help thinking that a certain fictional collie called Lassie, \`the world's most famous dog' who was created in 1938, was rather inspired by the real Lad. Because the stories in Lad a dog were originally serialised in magazines, they do tend to repeat a bit (not unlike the routine of dog-owning really, so that's OK). Terhune, Lad's owner, was a full time wealthy person, who bred collies for fun, and Lad was his first and favourite. This book is a celebration of Lad's life, and being a 'true' simple story it reads well. It is a reasonably easy read for older pre-teen kids and above (Amazon states 6 and above). The book chapter titles are: His Mate, \\"Quiet\\", A Miracle or Two, His Little Son, For a Bit of Ribbon, Lost!, The Throwback, The Gold Hat, Speaking of Utility, The Killer, Wolf, In The Day of Battle, Afterword. The book has aged well, probably as it is set in the timeless countryside, and descriptions of life there aren't dissimilar to that of our family's rural village life today. Do read the Amazon review by the way, it's quite good.You can still visit Lad's grave at Terhune's 'Sunnybank', although as he was buried at 'his favourite spot', his tombstone is laying in mud now. It reads \\"Lad 'Thoroughbred In Body and Soul' 1902-1918\\". It's in Wayne, New Jersey, if you're passing. Sadly Terhune's house was demolished in 1969, although a memorial park was set up around Lads grave (see math.ttu.edu/~wlewis/terhune.html).The success of this book led to a series of books, but I only ever read this excellent one. From anecdotes by the likes of literary giant James Thurber, I get the impression that Terhune was more than a little anti-social, but this book is about his dog Lad. Plus collie dogs, and his second wife mentioned in these stories, were his passion. So a must for doggy fans, which probably just about includes every boy on the planet. It's also nice to know that rough collie descendents of Terhune's dogs from \\"Sunnybank Kennels\\" live on today."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"As long as you can ignore the bigotry of the author (he was a rich, white aristocrat of the pre WWI variety, so he was a snob and a bigot), his writing about the nobility of dogs, his ability to make them live in your mind is still unsurpassed.

Undisputed king over al the Little People on The Place (in the North Jersey hinterlands) Lad is the darling of his MIstress and the pride of his Master for 15 years. His beneficent reign will be remembered as a Golden Age by his human deities.This purebred collie proves heroic, both in and out of the dog show ring.One of several dogs whose breeding was rewarded with ribbons and cups, Lad met many challenges with courage and ingenuity during his respectedtenure at The Place: he saves his Mistress and later his son, Wolf, from drowning in the lake; he saves a child from a snake; he protects The Place from more than one burglar and identifies another; he faces an enraged bull among his exploits--as recorded faithfully by the author.Able to retrace incidents in accurate detail from signs in both earth and fur, the Master even chronicled events which he himself had not witnessed.

Whether it is protecting the mistress and the master or going to a dog show to do his supreme best. But now in the beginning of the the book you learn how a dog should act and you also learn what happens to the dog if he does not act the way they should and I don't like the punishment they got. But in the end Lad is the favorite dog on the block.My favorite part was when the girl dog Lady has 3 puppies. But the sad part that pulled my heart was when 2 of them die. But a scruffy rambunctious one stays and Lad the father and Lady the mother have a handful to take care of. This little tike got the perfect name wolf.

Although he was popular and wealthy during his lifetime, not a typical &quot;starving artist&quot;, he managed to make the places and characters in his stories absolutely come alive. It is not an easy thing to enable millions of people to know a place or a character fully and even more difficult to make them beloved. Terhune wrote of &quot;The Place&quot; and &quot;Lad&quot; so that his readers felt they had visited the Pompton Lakes, NJ home and met the hero-dog.This book has been continuously in print since it arrived on bookshelves in 1918. By the time readers met Lad, he had been dead for more than a year. But he truly lives on in Terhune's writing. Although Terhune may have believed himself a hack, it takes an artist to breathe life into a story and make it real.This book should not be missed by anyone, especially children, who will learn much from the virtues of Lad and will gain a very special friend for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"are now legion, as they say. But Terhune was the first person to make them worthwhile to read! I recently came across Albert Payson Terhune's oeuvre, Sunnybank, and Lad, etc. while preparing to purchase a collie for our home. Although we did not eventually get the 'dog of our dreams,' all of my hopes and aspirations, which had been fueled by watching \\"Lassie\\" almost fifty years ago, were codified, given life, and made literate in the many books by Mr. Terhune.His way of writing, (though repetitive in terms and phrases from book to book- a relatively minor point, for the writing is evocative, even if repetitive) is nevertheless easily on a par with many 'good' modern authors today, and is therefore of more merit, than perhaps when they were first written!As Chronicles of history (the era when cars were first being mass-produced & made available by the 'monthly payment with interest scheme,' so burdensome to modern life) when gentlemanly conduct and lady-like manners were not 'chauvinistic,' all of Terhune's books would make a very nice study of American mores and morals of the 1910-1930's era, especially for boys aged 9-12. Where he [Terhune] shines most evocatively, is in giving that sense of awe and wonder, as one looks with love and affection on a dog that many consider the noblest examplar of the breed as a whole!What was also pleasant to read, is the honest way in which Terhune describes how literate, intelligent, and societally well-to-do [white] folks looked upon the world, their neighbors, the rise of crime as a mobile menace with the advent of said motorcar (and thus, Terhune makes an eloquent 'apologia' for limiting, rather than expanding[!] mass transportation from inner city to outer suburbs in modern metropolises!) with a frankness that is woefully missing today. In short, when needed, Terhune, like almost all men of his era, is willing to 'call a spade a spade.' Some might call his use of terms for some of the less seemly characters he portrays, 'racially insensitive,' but that is only because we have been brainwashed into thinking civility and crassness are interchangeable cogs on a multicultural wheel!I, for one, found this utter frankness of Terhune and his overt masculinity (in his descriptions of events and persons) a breath of fresh air- especially after the 'Illegal Alien May First walkout of 2006,' Hurricane Katrina and the Superbowl, the Million Man March, and all the other 'minority grandstanding' one has to endure in this \\"PC\\" mad era. Terhune's evocation of an era that should come again reveal that civility, proper manners, respect for property, life, and livestock on a working farm or kennel, are things that any child (or adult!) could/should take a lesson from. Along with Knight's \\"Lassie-come-home,' these books (in their original issue, and not in modern reprints, which clearly would be 'santized' for 'modern dumbed-down readers') are now prize possessions in my antiquarian bookcase. I will return to them every year, (and read them to my children, whom I homeschool!) to read of a lifestyle, a culture, that once defined what it is to be free, noble, and American. IF I could put it into the fewest words possible, I would say Terhune writes of: Man, dog, and nature. If one could sum up Terhune, these three qualities shine through resplendently in all of his works. I can honestly say, that, for a work of fiction, I am a better man for reading them."},{"Title":"Lad: a dog,","review":"I loved this book very much, and even still read my favorite chapters if I have nothing to do.

Lad is truly a special dog, as you will see when you read it.

Beyond Appearance: A New Look at Adolescent Girls. If you haven't been in their (adolescent mothers') shoes, but you have the social conscience and sense of social justice to want to help these kids, these three works are, in my view, indispensible reading.

J.S. Fletcher was a prolific author who wrote to a formula, but he made the formula quite palatable: there's a smart, young man thrown into a mystery; a spunky, beautiful young woman; police who are capable yet like the help of the smart young man; and villains who are mostly driven by greed, but nothing psychologically disturbing. If you like English Country murders from the Golden Age, this should be enjoyable.Ebook version from Resurrected Press is very well done and clean."},{"Title":"Ravensdene court,","review":"What a wild tale! Yet it starts so quietly. A scholarly young man invited to a manor house on a remote Northumbrian coast to put in order a venerable old library.Middlebrook is an unlikely hero for a blood-soaked plot. He's bookish, peace-loving and hardly knows one end of a revolver from another. Yet he's destined to protect a charming young woman from pirates and assassins -- and be intimately involved in the solution of deep mysteries.Two brothers are murdered at the same time hundreds of miles apart. Meanwhile ancient monastic objects of great value have gone missing from a bank. Are the crimes related? A clever detective appears on the scene to investigate. But many amateurs are also involved in solving the mysteries -- nervous old Mr. Raven, proprietor of Ravensdene Court; his nineteen-year-old niece; a cranky octogenarian numismatist; the local doctor; his ingenious Chinese servant; and Middlebrook, expert on ancient books and documents. This is detecting as a team sport!There are dramatic scenes on land and sea that rival any modern thriller. At the same time there are Gothic touches -- an isolated manor house, decaying graveyards, a ruined church, ancient manuscripts.I liked Miss Raven. She's athletic for a genteel heroine -- plays golf, never flags on long walks through gloomy forests, and shows no fear in the face of danger. And Wing, the doctor's factotum, is a charmer. Wing makes wonderful plum cake, is a crack shot and a bit of a philosopher.This is a Golden Age mystery published in 1922. J. S. Fletcher, a best-selling author in his day, wrote historical novels as well as mysteries. His fascination with bygone eras enriches this book.I loved every minute of Ravensdene Court. The Resurrected Press edition offers a short but insightful introduction and a very readable format."},{"Title":"Ravensdene court,","review":"I rate this one four stars. All in all a pretty good tale, and well told, unfortunately, the ending was a little hard to believe. Along the way however, the story takes off with lots of the twist and turns that mark the J. S. Fletcher brand. Plot and character development are up to the usual standard, with enough plot twists and interesting characters to propel the narrative along at a steady pace. The only real issue I have with this particular story, and the reason I didn't rate it five stars, is that I have the sneaking suspicion that Fletcher wrote this story as he went along and never had the ending in hand until he had to deliver the manuscript to the publisher. It is as if he started out writing a truly great and intriguing mystery and along the way suddenly discovered he had a deadline. The first 75% or so of the novel is first rate, well plotted and the story really drags you in. It's when things get towards the ending that you begin to notice that the pace has accelerated, the plot begins covering vast distances quickly, and the scenes change abruptly, with little or no segue between them, and you begin to suspect that the writer has simply run out of story.As an earlier reviewer pointed out in another review on another book, if you want to look at the public domain novels available for this author, search on J. S. Fletcher public domain."},{"Title":"Ravensdene court,","review":"This book was great for having by my bedside. It has a good story but nothing that will keep you up at night. That's a plus for me.

The familiar tale is especially poignant in the hands of Geoffrey Douglas as he recounts a true story.Christian Prince, a white 19-year-old Yale student born to privilege and promise, was shot in the heart as he returned home from a party. Son of a prominent lawyer in Washington, Christian grew up among the clipped shrubs and servant tended homes of Chevy Chase, Maryland. Four generations of his family attended Yale; skiing vacations were routine. An all-American athlete, Christian was also an honor roll student.Duncan Fleming, an underprivileged black 16-year-old with a history of minor infractions was accused of the crime. Dunc's mileu was the ghetto, streets where weapons, drugs and violence were the norm. He saw his first killing at ten years of age, joined a gang at 13, and walked with a limp from a bullet through both legs.Through the author's research we are privy to conversations with the families and friends of both boys, as well as vivid descriptions of their lives. This book merits our attention, although it offers few answers and no panaceas. It is a well crafted segment of 20th century social history.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"This book is an indispensible classic for anybody interested in Greek religion. I was considering following up Prof. Harrison's weighty tome by writing the sequel: \\"Avgolemeno to the Study of Greek Soup Making,\\" but I couldn't find an interested publisher, for some reason.*Note: \\"Avgolemeno\\" is a well-known Greek, lemon-flavored soup."},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"Indispensable, for anyone interested in archaic rite, comparative religion, or ancient Greek culture.Reading and studying Jane Harrison's Prolegomena was such a pleasure. Her brilliance and wide knowledge shines on every page! Even today (Professor Harrison died of leukemia in 1928) modern scholars and intellectuals such as Walter Burkert and Camille Paglia continue to draw on her magnificent work. There are particular passages -- on ecstasy and asceticism, for example -- of such beauty that they seem to transcend scholarship and border on the divine. Her work is so thorough one begins to understand the weight of a great and complex society which myth itself only brushes. Her other works, including Themis and the dazzlingly concise Epilogemena also enlighten and inspire, but Prolegomena is the place to start."},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"Although published in the early 1900s and outdated in certain areas, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion is still an essential read for anyone interested in Greek Religion. Perhaps the best description of the book would be to call it the Greek Golden Bough.In this classic work, Harrison sought to uncover the primitive substratum of Greek religion, so rather than focusing on theOlympian deities, she spends the better part of the book discussing ghosts, 'demons', and the chthonic deities. The religious landscape that she illuminates is therefore nothing like the cheery and rational world of the Olympians. The dark, the creepy and the uncanny tend to predominate.The book is very well-written, and the author's fascination with her material is infectious. I found it so powerful a reading experience that I can only describe Prolegomena in terms of a kind of anthropological prose poetry. Although its ostensible topic is a rather specialized and obscure field of enquiry, one comes away from the book with a feeling of having gained a deeper insight into that most general of topics, the human condition.I have to agree with the other reviewer who emphasizes that this is not a book for those completely unfamiliar with ancient Greek religion. Moreover, parts of it might be frustrating and tedious for readers without knowledge of the ancient Greek language, since Harrison is constantly engaged in the elucidiation and discussion of Greek religious terminology.All in all, an unforgettable book that, unlike most academic studies, is a piece of great literature."},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"This is no easy reading, and it is not for people totally without basic knowledge. Harrison, a great scholar who wrote in the 20s, won't tell you who Athena is- you should have a basic idea in order to enjoy the complex stories about her and all the Olympian deities! We didn't get the background told at school, only the stage when belief in the Gods was actually dead, preserved only as a cultural phenomenon. Harrison will tell you about the time when belief was ALIVE. If you want to know about the ceremonies, the secret rites, the hidden names, the shift of power from goddess to god... and in all this in a factual, reliable manner- then this is the book you should read!"},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"Jane Ellen Harrison was a ground breaking scholar in the field of mythology--she was one of a group of what was called the \\"Cambridge Ritualists\\" who believed that contrary to prior belief that myths arose from rituals rather than rituals from myths.Her primary thesis in Prolegomena is that the religion of the Greeks and Romans has been only selectively reported in order to support a vision of rational, highly civilized people as the progenitors of western thought. Scholarship of the 19th century was founded on the notion that \\"the integrity of Western Civilization depends upon the exceptionality of the Greeks\\" (p. xx). This vision was developed by the Romantic movement to support a superior intellectual foundation to western civilization that emerged from the Greek and Romans.Harrison argues that in fulfilling this desire to have exalted ancestors, the true religion of the Greeks has been overlooked. Her scholarship is focused on what has not been noticed-her conclusion is that the Olympian gods of Homer are the final product of centuries of evolution from a more primitive collection of chthonic deities or forces.Harrison is more interested in the earlier forms of religion--the underworld beings that were placated to prevent evil. She is a master at examining greek texts and art to delineate these ancient deities. As Harrison says: \\"Great things in literature, Greek plays for example, I most enjoy when behind their bright splendours I see moving darker and older shapes\\"This book can be utilized as a reference to understand certain Greek myths more easily--or read it straight through to get a more thorough understanding of the world of Greek mysticism!!"},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"I was searching for an answer to the mystery that was in the Greek Mysteries. Harrison provides the answers. Prolegomena provides a very detailed account of the Mysteries that are rooted in worship of the the Chthonic (Earth) Gods that preceded the Olympian deities. The reading level of this book is probably the most difficult I have ever experienced in a book that I am reading purely for pleasure. You must have a burning interest in the field of ancient Greek religion to be able to appreciate this book for the great work it is.Jaime Gomez"},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"Although partly out-of-date, Jane Harrison's analysis of 'neglected' aspects of Greek religion proves these aspects to be 'essential'. By dissecting rites, ceremonies, festivities and mysteries, she exposes the real obsessions of the Ancient Greek (Plato included). Instead of being 'possessed by a set of conceptions based on Periclean Athens', she shows astonishingly that Ancient Greece was still a totally irrational, savage and primitive society, dominated by ignorance and fear. Her picture is far more gloomy than the rosy one drawn by other scholars, who imposed their own language on ancient societies ('We should not monotheize').In Ancient Greece, there was no 'civil' law. Law was essentially magic and in the first place a curse. People thought that they could injure their enemies by curse tablets, swathed figures ... In Plato's 'Laws', people who injured other citizens by magic had to die.Ignorance and fear concerning the souls of the death, sprites, ghosts and demons were a fertile ground for theology (better: demonology). Evil spirits reflected the population's own savage, cruel and irrational passions and relations. (Porphyry: 'No Greek sacrifice of a camel or an elephant').The Greek believed that evil was a physical infection that could be transferred on animals and human beings. The latter could be sacrificed in order to purify the rest of the population. One is astonished to learn that human sacrifices still took place in the 5th century BC. 'Pharmakoi' were kept and fed at the public expense in order to be slaughtered in rites of Aversion (riddance of evil spirits).Winds were believed to be ghosts who had to be placated by sacrifices. The latter (humans were better than animals) took also place for mandic reasons.In Greek theology, there were 'no gods at all', only conceptions of the human mind. Theology's formulary was 'panta rei'.New gods developed out of heroes or crystallized out of a gentler form of ghost or were imported from other regions. One of the new gods was Dionysos coming from Thrace. He was the god of all growing things and of physical intoxication. His double was the god of spiritual intoxication: Orpheus (Orphism). The latter Mystery had a profound influence on Plato and his theory of the immortality of the soul (essentialism).The author's analysis of the Eleusian Mysteries and Orphism are interesting but partly out-of-date, because new sources of information were discovered after the publication of her book.For Eleusis I recommend G. Meautis's 'The Mysteries of Eleusis', and for Orphism, W. Guthrie's 'Orpheus and Greek Religion'.This book contains excellent graphic material, which is magisterially analyzed by the author.Harrison's book is still a must for all those interested in Ancient Greece. It is the work of a superb free mind."},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"The most accessible aspect of Greek religion, which any basic education on the Greeks reveals, is the Olympian pantheon and the tales of gods and goddesses as passed down through literature. This book opens up a much deeper and more obscure subject for study: the ritual practices and how they underlie and provide explanations for what otherwise would appear to be rather fanciful stories. It certainly gets into the thickets in places, and there are many arcane references, but the material coheres in a very interesting way and rewards the curious reader.The author begins by explaining that there were two forms of ritual: the Olympian, which was service to the gods in the form of sacrifices through a communion or social gathering, and the chthonic, which involved gloomy, nighttime proceedings of riddance or purification. It was this last form of ritual, the gloomy kind, that provided the underlying basis for the ancient Greek festivals and opened the way for a more profound religious impulse, that of Dionysus and Orpheus. Purification here was meant as a physical riddance of evil influences from spirits, especially of the dead, resulting from a blood feud or some violent action provoking vengence. A example of the ritual was the expulsion of the pharmakos (human scapegoat) at the Thargelia harvest festival.Dionysus represented a return to nature and was associated with the harvest, particularly of grapes, and was the god of wine and intoxication. He was depicted at Delphi as having opposite characteristics to Apollo, as being concerned with the emotions rather than reason. A number of wild, unrestrained mythic beings such as Satyrs and Maenads were considered his attendants. The author suggests that besides the wild, uncontrolled revelries and excess that resulted from his worship, there was a life-promoting aspect that involved inspiration - where the Maenads became Muses - and also the \\"sacramental mystery of life and nutrition.\\" The religious impulse of Dionysus that grew out of the experience of intoxication and inspiration was the mystical notion of becoming one with god.It appears that the Orphic movement was based on a real man named Orpheus and that he was a prophet and a teacher, who especially used music - playing the lyre - to soothe and refine the wild beast of nature and to lead humankind along spiritual paths. The Orphics refined the religious impulse of Dionysus of mystical union and established a ritual of mystery practices. The underlying theme, the one especially adopted by the Orphics and also the Pythagoreans, harkened back to the urge of the ancients for purification, for riddance of evil spirits contaminating the physical world. In Plato, this purification was extended beyond the physical to the psychological, and involved discernment and cleansing the soul of defilements through self-knowledge.I first obtained this book with the intent of using it as a reference, but soon became immersed enough to read it through to the end. I found it to be an awesome work of scholarship that in a general sense opened my eyes to the depths of Greek mythology and the difficulties of interpretation. I don't know how much fresh material has been added since this book was last updated in the 1920s, but to my mind this is bedrock stuff."},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","review":"What a pleasure to read this literature; a toure-de-force on the subject.

Whether Sophia Blossom will turn out in subsequent installments to be more than she appears remains to be seen.This book makes no pretense of being anything other than entertainment. The dialogue is snappy and silly and lots of fun, the mystery sufficiently convoluted and the pacing adequate to keep the reader engaged. No one wallows in despair or self-analysis, and the characters are as quirky as this kind of fiction requires.The main drawback of the work is that it definitely would have benefited from the services of a competent editor. Various misspellings and grammar stumbles aside, the plot gapes in several places. A partial explanation of one such--the question of how our hero and his intrepid assistant managed to masquerade as grad students--does arise later but not in a way that is satisfactory. It certainly doesn't speak well of James Hilton's talent for subterfuge.This series has considerable potential, as Mr. McAleer has a deft hand with the kind of dialogue that makes it work. His characters are amusing, and his economical writing style doesn't bog the reader down.

(Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (DK Readers: Level 2 (Prebound))","review":"Predator insects star in the Eyewitness Reader Book, Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! by Jennifer Dussling. Following in the style of other Dorling Kindersley Eyewitness books, Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! overflows with clear, eye-catching, color photographs. The cover photograph may attract reluctant readers with its graphic photograph detailing a preying mantis chomping its teeth into a captured fly. Readers enter a world of extremely magnified, floating insect photographs on white backgrounds. The images depict insects attacking each other or standing alone.Accompanying text discusses the insect pictured in the stilted, easy language of a level two reader. Plainly labeled as a level two book, Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! fits into the popular genre of Reading Level Books. Although the author has extensive writing experience with leveled readers, the subject of the text jumps from page to page without good transitions and creates a hard-to-follow jumble of words-which potentially creates a difficult reading environment for the intended reading audience of children just beginning to read alone. Informational boxes scattered throughout the pages add additional tidbits on insect behavior-also adding additional confusion. Due to the discordant text, the book would be better used as a picture book where children read a caption here and there.As a leveled reader, the book includes a note for parents which explains the leveled reader system and recommends the book for children just beginning to read (between ages 3-8). As an eyewitness reader, Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! follows the leveled reader guidelines for level two: approximately 700 words; 70% pictures and 30% text. Sure to be popular due to the graphic cover and leveled reader status, the book would be a satisfactory addition to larger collections but should be skipped for smaller collections since better leveled readers already exist."},{"Title":"Bugs!

I was quite excited and sometimes amazed by the clarity of presentation by the authors in the initial chapters which talks about life and its purpose, understanding and having your own &quot;identity&quot; and also about the side-effects of deep-rooted negative childhood habbits (unfinished business) which some people tend to carry along in their life unknowingly. The techniques to identify your strengths and small steps to be carried out to overcome the negative qualities are somewhat old but polished with new terminologies and jargons.But I noticed a strange discontinuity in the authors presentation, when they jump into a new concept, so called &quot;Quantum Decision Making (QDM)&quot;. The authors does not give good insight into QDM nor establish the relationship between the initial chapters and QDM. Hence overall we are introduced in lots new terms but without clear purpose and reasoning. The case studies of their approach has been clearly separated from the actual text, which was helpful to maintain the continuity in the discussion.I would been happy or atleast understood the QDM concept better if a limited version of a CD or small visual guide was accompanied with this book. Because of this most of the latter part of the book goes over the head, when the authors talk about &quot;icons&quot;, &quot;multicolored 3D visualization&quot; .. etc. Interesting/Useful initial chapters but poor second part."},{"Title":"The Inner Edge : Effective Spirituality in Your Life and Work","review":"Over the past 40 years I have read a bookshelf full of books offering guidance on how to feel more fulfilled, be more effective in working within organizations, etc., etc. Of the many books I have read on such topics, The Inner Edge is unique in assembling and organizing, in one book, the essential elements of what one needs to \\"have his or her act together\\" in a way that provides the reader a practical and systematic guide to make the most of who you are and deal more effectively with those around you - in family, social, and work settings.The Inner Edge can be used in several ways including helping you figure out what to do with the rest of your life, and providing you with a practical and complete 10-20 minute daily routine to help you make each day as fulfilling and productive as possible.This book helps us realize that we all have, and can tap into, inner spiritual strengths using our intuitive powers; but that to be freed up to access these inner strengths we first need to do three things...recognize and deal with (what the authors call) \\"unfinished business\\", take an insightful and honest look at who we are, and then set boundaries and priorities on the demands placed by others and ourselves on our time and energy.Furthermore, The Inner Edge does more than help us in understanding these things; it is also a \\"how to\\" book. And in that regard the authors' use of \\"guided visualizations\\", particularly in helping us tap into our inner spirituality, makes The Inner Edge stand out.While the book should be helpful to people in various stages in their lives, I think it is particularly valuable to people of any age going through a personal or job related transition; young people getting started in their careers, and people who will soon be leaving the traditional work place and are trying to deal with what to do with the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"The Inner Edge : Effective Spirituality in Your Life and Work","review":"I am a Management Psychologist and have worked for most of my career as a consultant to the senior management of corporations.

In a year filled with corporate greed and mismanagement, this book redefines what should be truly important in the world of business, and how to be successful and ethical at the same time. To have the Dalai Lama endorse it only reasserts the importance of the themes which resonate here. Ethics and spirituality do have a place in the business world, and if they can be successfully incorporated in the capitalist system, the world itself may become a better place. I especially liked the chapter on unfinished business, because it is often that which keeps us from developing into truly aware, healthy individuals.

It is, as stated at the front of the book, \\"an authentic reproduction of the text as printed by the original publisher,\\" and may come as a surprise to some since the printing in 1880 was not what it is today. At first I found the font to be a minor annoyance, but soon entered into the spirit of the thing. Henry James wrote the book in real time looking back at the time of Hawthorne forty years before, (which would be 169 years back from today) but it seems when reading it as if he had written it yesterday.I felt several emotions both towards Hawthorne and James. In parts James was patronizing, such as when he discusses Hawthorne's Notes, in \\"Early Manhood\\" Ch.2. \\"He appears to have read a good deal; and that he must have been familiar with the sources of good English, we see from his charming, expressive, slightly self-conscious, cultivated, but not too cultivated style.\\" This was after he had scornfully criticized passages in which Hawthorne had written about a dog he had seen chasing its tail and about \\"the aromatic odor of peat smoke in the sunny autumnal air.\\" This led me to believe that James was not always as objective in his critique as he intended to be. It showed especially in the last chapter where Henry James vents his displeasure to such a degree over the publication of \\"Septimius Felton,\\" professing to know what Hawthorne would or would not have wanted after his death, that he sees it ONLY from his point of view. Hawthorne was a romantic, Henry James more of a realist, so certain things grated on James' nerves, such as for instance, \\"The Elixir of Life.\\" James found it preposterous, \\"Indeed, this whole matter of elixirs and potions belongs to the fairy tale period of taste, and the idea of a young man enabling himself to live forever by concocting and imbibing a magic drought has the misfortune of not appealing to our sense of reality, or even to our sympathy. That should have read, \`my sense of reality, or even to my sympathy' since it was purely his view, and others including his family and the publisher had a different opinion.Henry James takes great care to impress upon us how much he admires Hawthorne, referring to him several times as a genius, but the two men were very different. Henry James seems to have enjoyed walking among people, Hawthorne was more of a recluse. James stands back mostly in an objective way to assess this shy sensitive man, but sometimes as I said, in a patronizing way. Perhaps it was that Hawthorne was woven from such fine thread, the finest silk, that he hid behind his shyness to keep himself aloof. His musings could be read as self-pity, he had not been discovered early enough, he never had enough money, some men would be bitter, Hawthorne licked his wounds. Hawthorne seemed to bear the weight of the sins of his forefather like a nail sticking up in his boot, but it was the very irritant which gave him the stimulus for his amazing creativity.A very thought provoking book, highly recommended"},{"Title":"Hawthorne;","review":"James says of his book on Hawthorne that it is not a biography but rather a critical essay. Edmund Wilson says of it that it is still one of the finest literary biographies ever done on an American writer. As William Howells in his somewhat chiding but appreciative review said of it James is perhaps a bit harsh on his 'native ground'. James makes mock of Thoreau and does not have the kindest words for Emerson. The book contains the famous passage of 'Nos' in which James lists all the elements of a country which make it suited to produce the highest culture. He notes that America is without 'sovereign' without castles, without courts, and without Ascot and Epsom. The implication is that there has not been enough history in America ( until that is James time when the 'Civil War' changes everything) to produce the highest form of Literature.Yet James has great appreciation for the singular genius of Hawthorne. He considers him to be the greatest imaginative writer that America had produced. He too is appreciative of the character of Hawthorne about which he has extremely kind words.James in a sense indirectly in this work written by the way for a British publisher and audience is defining and defending his own absconding to Europe for the greatest part of his literary life. Here perhaps Howells criticism of him touches not on the wisdom of that decision but of that snobbish failure to recognize that the ordinary hurly- burly of American daily life, could become as it already had in the great work of Whitman Melville Thoreau Emerson subject of great Literature.In any case reading this work one comes into contact again with the masterful voice and style of James, whose long sentences rich in perception and fine moral distinction prove to kind of refined literary delight that his master Hawthorne too exemplified."},{"Title":"Tunguska Fireball","review":"I thought that the Tunguska event had been solved a number of years ago. It is clear from this book that it is not. The author has done a commendable job of presenting the history of the Tunguska devastation in 1908 and of the work that has been done since then in trying to identify what caused it. Theories abound, from the plausible, i.e., a comet or asteroid, to the absurd, e.g., an alien spaceship. This author writes extremely well and weaves a most intriguing yarn - at times funny, at times tongue-in-cheek, mostly serious but always absolutely fascinating. This is a great book that is impossible to put down. I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in whodunits or scientific mysteries."},{"Title":"Tunguska Fireball","review":"In the early morning of June 30, 1908, a fireball flew across the Siberian sky and exploded in a 15 megaton blast that flattened 2,150 acres of Siberian forest. In the years that followed, scientists correlated atmospheric pressure readings, reports of unusually bright sunsets and \\"night glows\\" in the skies over northern Europe, recordings of seismic waves, and eyewitness accounts, concluding that the cause was probably a stony asteroid that entered the earth's atmosphere and broke up explosively 8 kilometers above the Earth at 7:14 am local time.Verma's story doesn't end there, of course, or \\"The Tunguska Fireball\\" would be a fairly short book. As it is, Verma uses the Tunguska event to embark on an entertaining discussion of how scientists came to understand what had probably happened in the skies over Siberia. The investigations into this remote area were difficult and the findings yielded many interesting theories, ranging from fairly plausible ideas about the arrival of a stony asteroid or comet, to more exotic hypotheses involving black holes, antimatter, mirror matter, volcanoes, ball lightning, and \\"geometeors,\\" to really bizarre notions about crippled alien spaceships, laser beams from other planets and death rays secretly invented by Nikola Tesla (really). The Tunguska event offers a great excuse to digress among a number of interesting ideas, although I confess that I find Verma's explanations of the underlying science to be a tad murky at times.When the dust settles (so to speak), I'll place my bets on the stony asteroid theory, with a sentimental vote for the killer comet--the other hypotheses seem to require too much special pleading to be a compelling way to think about the event, at least based on the information we have in hand today. That said, the most sobering revelation in Verma's book is his report of the \\"mini-Tunguska\\" event of September 24, 2002. A US satellite spotted an object that entered the earth's atmosphere, but lost it as it fell below 30 kilometers; a few moments later, another satellite reported a fireball exploding in the cloudy skies above Siberia. The explosion flattened 100 square kilometers of forest with the energy of a small atomic bomb, but no one witnessed the fireball and, as far as we know, no one was killed or injured. The story would have been very different if the object, whatever it was, had exploded above a populated area.Verma's books makes entertaining and sobering reading. \\"The Tunguska Fireball\\" will make you wonder how many more objects are floating around in the void with Earth's name on them."},{"Title":"Tunguska Fireball","review":"This is great as a quick review of the theories behind the fireball mystery. The author discusses comet and asteroids, black holes, crashed UFO's and volcanism, all of which have been implicated in the blast. Unfortunately there is no attempt to explore the matter much beyond this, and little description of the initial event. Still looking for the final work on this one."},{"Title":"Tunguska Fireball","review":"\\"At 7.14 a.m. on 30 June 1908 a huge fireball exploded in the Siberian sky. A thousand times the force of the Hiroshima bomb, it flattened an area of remote Tunguska forest bigger than Greater London, forming a mushroom cloud that almost reached into space. Six hundred kilometres away, the Trans-Siberian Express rattled wildly on its newly built tracks. Tremors registered in distant St. Petersburg, and the unusually bright night skies seen across England over the next few nights prompted letters to The Times.\\"So writes Surendra Verma in the introduction to The Tunguska Fireball: Solving One of the Great Mysteries of the 20th Century. I first learned of the Tunguska explosion in a TV program many years ago and have found it fascinating to research.This book analyzes possible causes for the explosion, and includes photos taken of the vast destruction, including the odd occurrence of both flattened forests as well as forests of tree trunks standing as bare as telephone poles. Something catastrophic happened in Siberia, yet over a century later, we still don't know what burned through the morning sky.The two main theories are that a comet disintegrated in the atmosphere or an asteroid exploded about eight kilometres above the Earth. No impact crater has been found so there is a lack of extraterrestrial physical evidence. The author spends a good portion analyzing these theories and the scientific talk gets quite techy and over-my-head at times. The tech talk is countered by the oddball theories that always abound whenever a scientific mystery remains unsolved; one chapter is entitled \\"Opening the X-Files\\" wherein Verma devotes a fair share to crazy talk about exploding alien spaceships, Tesla's death ray and aliens beaming lasers at us.Verma bored me with his scientific talk, but I suppose such talk is necessary in order to explain the physics behind certain theories. I read and reread these passages in an attempt to understand them, yet since I do not have a background in astronomy or physics in many cases I just had to read what he wrote, accept it, and move on. (I like to understand everything I read before I go further ahead, yet in some books, especially with fiction, I can't always do this.) Verma's mock trial in the final \\"Whodunit?\\" chapter, where he weighs all the theories with witty lawyerly defences, was just plain annoying.I liked the bibliography and sources for further reading, and will be sure to check out the scientific and academic web sites on the Tunguska explosion."},{"Title":"Tunguska Fireball","review":"The scientific community is very much like organised religion in one very disquieting way;it thrives on conformity,and does not like or appreciate individuality in any way shape or form...In writing about the still unexplained devastation that took place in russia onjune 30th 1908 Surendra Verma presents every possible viewpoint that has been put forth since that event,however the author makes no bones about the fact that conformist scientific theory is much preferred to non scientific \\"speculation\\".Science begins with speculation,with \\"why\\",and \\"what if\\",and builds from there..Alas the scientific community,having learned much from the structure of organised religion(and all of it bad) then decides upon one answer and carves it in stone..Despite any other advances in knowledge and/or any future \\"Why\\" and \\"What if\\" notions,however reasonable or logical,the existing scientific model remains in place,usually until the majority within the scientific community say otherwise,but if they do not it does not matter that thier model may be flawed,it will remain in place..In writing about the sudden devastating incident at Tunguska,in Siberia,in 1908,Verma first goes through the \\"most likely\\" scientificly accepted models in order to explain the catastrophe;A comet,A meteroite,a\\"black hole\\",ect,showing the possibilities,the way in which the scientific community has accepted some and rejected others based mainly,it would seem on consensus rather than on any solid factual evidence...Later in the book Verma addresses the more\\"speculative\\" notions,such as ETs,and the like,but in a more scornful tone,as if any answer to the Tunguska mystery that does not conform to current scientific\\"truths\\" cannot possibly have any real merit...This then is where Verma's book suffers,for as stated earlier,even Verma concedes that as yet there is no real explaination as to what did cause the \\"fireball\\" at Tunguska,and,therefore,all possibilities,however unorthodox scientificly ought to have equal merit.Interesting reading but weakened greatly by Verma's scientificly conformist bent."},{"Title":"Tunguska Fireball","review":"the first two-thirds of this book is well written. mr. verma offers a variety of theories on the tunguska incident. the book is well researched from a scientific point of view. where the book falls apart for me, is in the alternative theory section which he labels x-files. here mr. verma ridicules and basically insults any ufo type of explanation. to know where mr. verma is coming from, he gives the history of roswell in a page and a half, concluding it was a weather balloon with dummies. clearly, in my opinion, mr. verma threw the baby, bathwater and tub out in his research. and as anyone should know, debunkers of any theory use ridicule first. so, if you are a right-winged conservative, scientific purist, this book is for you, and should be on your shelf. if you're looking for a book that objectively looks at all theories in a balanced, well-respected manner, skip this book. mr. verma has his biased agenda and presents it well. the tunguska topic is interesting and i look forward to reading more interesting books on it."},{"Title":"Get Well Soon Book, The","review":"This is a cute little book aimed at the youngest of readers, featuring fun, vibrant, color illustrations with short captions. The message of the book is that doctors make everything better when you get hurt or sick. I know how much I hated going to the doctor when I was a little, and I know it would have taken more than a cute book to make me less anxious about heading off to the clinic without a fight, but The Get Well Soon Book by Kes Gray and Mary McQuillan might have made me feel a little better about my situation. These pages are filled with different animals who have suffered injuries of some sort or another - a mole who burrowed right into a brick wall, a dragon who burned herself with a sneeze, a turtle who got stepped on by an elephant, a hamster who got his whiskers caught in his wheel, etc. None of them look very happy, which is perfectly understandable. After a trip to the doctor, though, they're all frolicking around in no time, their pain or sickness gone and forgotten. The Get Well Soon Book is a short book, but any child should get a kick out of the wonderful illustrations - and it just might help a sick or injured child feel a little better for awhile."},{"Title":"Get Well Soon Book, The","review":"Get Well Soon Book is absolutely hilarious, sparkling and original, and zany.

It goes into Sequences and Series, Functions and Continuity, Differentiation, Integrations etc (see \\"contents\\" for more detail).The author of this book explicitly says that a prior knowledge on Calculus is expected before reading this book and he really means it. If you did your Calculus I (limit and derivative), Calculus II (integration), and Calculus III (multivariable) a year or two ago, you need to go review at least the topics that are covered in this book. Remember all the convergence/ divergence (Comparison Test, Limit Comparison Test, Ratio Test, Root Test, Lebeniz Test, P-test etc) tests that you did in Calculus II (?) The author manages to squeeze them all in 5 pages or so.The major drawback of this book (for me) is lack of exercise. There are very few sections which have more than 10 problems, most have 6 or less. Here is a detailed data:chapter 1 has 6 sections but only 24 problemschapter 2 has 7 sections but only 44 problemschapter 3 has 7 sections but only 37 problemschapter 4 has 5 sections but only 17 problemschapter 5 has 7 sections but only 27 problemschapter 6 has 3 sections but only 19 problemschapter 7 has 3 sections but only 19 problemschapter 8 has 2 sections but only 1 problemchapter 9 has 3 sections but only 1 problemthankfully solutions to all these problems are available in the back of the book. These solutions are worked out well enough.Another drawback of the book is that it does not inspire you. In most mathematics book (or any other course book for that matter) each chapter begins with a little bit of history, real life application or something that helps connect to the student. This book barely does that. Usually, the section starts with a theorem, followed by a proof or two, and finally two three examples.Overall imo this book is more of a \\"study guide\\" than a textbook itself. The publisher say this book can be used for self study as well as course textbook. I will admit that this is an easy self study book but i would get a more detailed textbook to tag along with this, just in case."},{"Title":"Real Analysis (Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series)","review":"This is an introductory text of real analysis and it is kind of British Style (in term of the way they proved the theorems).

The formatting is strange, the theorems and definitions are buried in the text with no delineation whatsoever. There are typos throughout the book, sometimes in the middle of proofs, making the proofs even more difficult to follow.The lack of exercises and examples are a little frustrating, as well, though this is typical of higher level math texts. I understand that the purpose of this book is to make analysis more accessible for undergraduates, but I feel that this book made the material more difficult than other, more advanced texts. Analysis is a challenging enough subject, and I feel that this book only exacerbates that.My personal recommendation to anybody starting an analysis course, undergrad or grad is Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin. It's more advanced but far more thorough and illustrative in its proofs."},{"Title":"145 Things to Be When You Grow Up (Career Guides)","review":"I just got a copy of this book and it's phenominal! greay layout, easy to read, quick reference. definitely a must-have for every school, guidance counselor, head-hunter and EVERY high-school student.

IN THE HEART OF THE WIND is a heart rending psychological drama revealing that cruelty and injustice have no limits in the quest for power--sometimes even within families.Gabe and Annie James have a wonderful, loving life together. Married for two years, Annie knows little of Gabe's past, and is sometimes surprised at the jobs he chooses, which don't seem to live up to the expectations set by a college degree. Although Gabe's secretive about his past, Annie hasn't asked a lot of questions; that is, until now. While doing the laundry, Annie finds a news clipping about the death of a policeman in Florida. Later, she finds a trunk filled with such clippings and such paraphernalia as a policeman would own.Iowa winters can be brutal, especially for a southern boy. Despite the frigid temperatures and piles of snow, Gabe was happy living with Annie. But there were times when his silence, preoccupation and nightmares frightened Annie. Nevertheless, the whole town loved Gabe, so when he was suddenly kidnapped from his home, an illegal act witnessed by neighbors, the town rallied to his rescue. Even when they learn of Gabe's past and his mobster family, the townsfolk never gave up their relentless pursuit to find Gabe.Gabe James is really James Gabriel Tremayne, son of mobster Liam Tremayne, a man whose quest for power leads to kidnapping and torturing his own son. Gabe was the only child of four that didn't conform to Liam's expectations. Unwanted since his conception, the young Gabe had only wanted his father's time and affection. What he got was inconceivable abuse. And now the abuse has committed him to a mental institution, ordered shock therapy and plastic surgery, and promised to never set him free. Further, Liam promises harm to Annie if Gabe attempts escape.IN THE HEART OF THE WIND provides psychological drama guaranteed to satisfy the appetite of the most demanding thriller fan. Previous fans of Ms. Boyette-Compo will relish this familiar, exciting voice while new fans will quickly find themselves addicted.

In an age where the desire to \\"leave the rat race\\" is an impossible dream due to the confines of internal and external turmoil, when combined with the pressures to \\"get ahead\\" financially so a better quality of life can presumably be achieved...the result is a complete breakdown of moral, ethical, spiritual and personal awareness.Mr. Babineaux's philosophy is that of learning to listen to the voice within (the Creator) and disregarding the enticement of the what we think we want to be or need in order to be \\"prosperous\\"; the Imposter. It's like being in a comfort zone that attracts all of the good things in life we are looking for. For those us who are able to consciously slip ourselves in and out of this zone, this book affirms that we \\"get it\\".For those of us who are not able to do so, this book explains how to find that comfort zone...and once we're there, how to let go and let yourself partner with the spiritual and natural forces that surround us to build up and attract inner peace and inner wealth.For the record, I am 37 years old and consider myself to be fabulously wealthy by Mr. Babineaux's standards. I want my husband to read this book NOW. He's 41 and embroiled in the inner-struggle of \\"I'm over 40 and I STILL haven't made something of myself. I'm a worthless nobody....\\" He chases what he thinks is a chance at prosperity (i.e. \\"I hope this opportunity takes off and I can earn a lot of money to get myself out of the black whole called debt\\"...) and then is crushed when it eludes him.I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels the same way my husband does, or if you have been effected by recent tragic events, illness or career/life frustration and stagnation.Mr. Babineaux is right. Find the peaceful comfort zone within and let everything else around you that brings material prosperity come to you like a moth to the flame."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I suppose we have to see Maturin and Aubrey as representing two sides of O'Brian's own way of looking at the world - not his personality: I don't think writing leads to so crude a self-identification as that. If that's so, then it makes sense to me of the darker, less committed feeling of the last two books. The death of the author's wife after so many years of close and happy marriage is bound to have affected the way he looks at the world, and it would have been surprising if these last two books were not elegaiac and downcast, full of loss and a kind of depression. I find that thought comforting in an odd way. The books up to The Hundred Days were so nearly perfect, so engrossing, that I was taken aback by 100 Days, which seemed at first so much less persuasive. I've just finished 'Blue' and although not up to the strength of the earlier books - how could it be? - it seemed to have taken a deep breath and begun to look around again at how things are. I too thought it was supposed to be the last. If it is, then Patrick O'Brian has played his last sly trick on his readers. But it doesn't read like it. They're not real people; but an author has to have some sense of resolution in his or her head, or the act of creation remains incomplete.

The main plot is excellant. Aubry and Maturin are indeed engaged in another worthy task envolving personal relationships, seamanship, politics and South American revolutions. The flow of the novel is great and it comes to a logical conclusion leaving us anticipating the obvious next novel where newly frocked Adm. Aubry hoists his flag and goes forth. Obryan is falling into the trench so many novelists fall into however as he assumes much knowledge on the part of his readers. He skips over many opportunities to develop many subplots and details that made his earlier novels such a delite to read and reread. Who can forget the exquisite revenge of Maturin in not only killing by dissecting his enemies; the dissertations of Maturing on women and other things. I'm not doing well at this and in thinking I'm doing the same thing as Obryan; describing the bones but the meat is thin. Charlie Cox"},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Unless there is an unpublished manuscript hidden away somewhere, this is the last book written by Patrick O'Brian who recently passed away, and fittingly the last of the saga of Jack Aubrey. The Jack Aubrey character was based on Lord Cochrane (See \\"the Autobiography of a Seaman\\" by Admiral Lord Cochrane, republished in 2000). While the early books in the Jack Aubrey series were quite good, the quality deteriorated in the later books (where he was no longer taking plot material from Cochrane's autobiography), and the author lost all sense of time, trying to cram too many novels into a three year period from 1812-1815. He then invented various assignments to keep Aubrey at sea, instead of going back (like C. S. Forester did with Hornblower) to fill in Aubrey's early career. I skipped many of the later books. The present tale would have been quite good by itself, but the author rambles and digresses excessively. He also seems to change location in the middle of sentences, and skips forward leaving the reader wondering what happened in the intervening time interval. The later part of the novel, when Aubrey arrives in Chile, gets back into historical context, and the novel seems to be set in 1819 and following years - Charles Tyng, in his autobiography \\"Before the Wind,\\" relates his experiences in Chile during that time period, mentioning Lord Cochran and the presence of a British frigate. Bernard Cornwell's novel, \\"Sharpe's Devil\\" (copyright 1992) also covers the action in Chile. The present novel is OK for those O'Brien fans who want the final episode on Jack Aubrey, but it is not exactly a book which holds your attention."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I have read,and bought all of the series. I was disappointed, when comparing with the others in the series. Much time is spent in describing minute details, but when it comes to action, such as the battle at the taking of the shore installation, it is all condensed into a few paragraphs. It is as if including the battle was an afterthought. Because it is a continuation of the series, it is worth reading, but is disappointing."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Immerse yourself once again in the seafaring adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin as they roam the almost unexplored oceans of the early 17th century, and participate in the bittersweet \\"liberation\\" of Chile. The 85 year-old O'Brian's flawless dialogue and meticulous attention to detail makes this book -- like the rest of the series -- a historical tour de force. Unfortunately after 20 previous books, Aubrey and Maturin have few surprises left, and hundreds of pages filled with the impenetrable politics and minutia of daily naval life may be as stupefying as Dr. Maturin's regular doses of laudanum and hellebore for readers unaware that a great naval battle invariably lurks in the closing pages. O'Brian addicts will welcome another chance to visit their favorite characters, but people new to O'Brian should visit the earlier, fresher books of the series -- say \\"The Far Side Of The World.\\"-- Auralgo"},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Three years ago I picked up a hardcover copy of this book in a bargain bin at a local booksellers , not realizing that this was book #20 in a 20 book series. Although I enjoyed it , I wasn't really able to get into the story line very well , since the author had the habit of making clever asides referring to actions in previous novels. Now 3 years later I find that I have read 16 in the series. They must be addictive!In this novel , which is set shortly after the triumph of the allies over Napoleon at Waterloo , Jack Aubrey and his particular friend , Stephen Maturin find themselves on the way to Chile under secret orders to assist the Republican rebels in their efforts to break away from Spanish rule , locally enforced by the Viceroy of Peru. The dear old \\"Surprise\\" has been converted to a hydrographical survey vessel to provide thinly veiled cover to the mission.As a cast of characters , we are sadly missing Barrett Bonden , but have a new young face in the person of Horatio Hanson , the bastard son of the Duke of Clarence (heir to the British throne). We are given a brief glimpse of Bernardo O'Higgins , commonly accepted as the liberator of Chile.Upon arrival in Chile , Jack Aubrey sets about building and training the nucleus of a new and independent Chilean navy , a daunting task. The action line is centered about the intervention of the Spanish Viceroy of Peru , and the Peruvian navy's 50 gun ship. Aubrey boldly devises a plan to neutralize the Peruvians , and basically succeeds in his mission.In the line of personal involvements , Aubrey seems very morose and rather out of his usual sorts throughout the tale. Later , this is identified as \\"flag sickness\\" , or worry about being \\"yellowed\\". On the other hand , Maturin seeks the hand of the lovely Africa based naturalist Christine Wood. And in this vein , the novel leaves the reader hanging as to the outcome.The unfinished 21st novel is due for publication later this year ; I am hopeful that we are able to at least see where the outcome of this fine series was intended. As a final sidebar--I suggest that the reader also consider reading \\"Sharpe's Devil\\" by Bernard Cornwell as a parallel to this book.Even tho' this was not my favorite book in the series (Desolation Island or Treason's Harbor are the best) , I liked it well enough to rate it 4 stars. I suggest what several other reviewers have also stated : that one should really read the series from the start.In that manner , they flow together more seamlessly.Recommend."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"While certainly not a bad book, Blue at the mizzen is not one of the most interesting in the Aubrey/Maturin series. There is not a lot of action or tension in our hero's adventures in South America. Jack Aubrey is increasingly distant, and we get the majority of the story from Maturin. Even so, Maturin's espionage activities are somewhat less than gripping. I've heard rumors that this is the last book in the series, but there are a ton of things left unresolved, and I find It hard to believe that O'Brian would end the series this way."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Patrick O'brien has left this world.

The goal, as it has been for the last several books, is to help Chile gains its independence from Spain. On the personal side, Stephen Maturin is reconsidering marriage while Jack Aubrey dreams of finally becoming an Admiral. But as readers of this series are well aware, just because one of these books heads off in a particular direction is no guarantee it will ever reach any given destination.I finished \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" a week before the death of author Patrick O'Brian, having spent the entire summer reading the Aubrey/Maturin series from start to finish. There was speculation when the book was published that it might make the end of this most remarkable series because of O'Brian's failing health. However, the author was apparently well into his next novel when he passed away.In hindsight it is certainly remarkable that \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" will be the final book in the series. The series does indeed a high water mark of a sort and I must express my wish that O'Brian had picked a different title in regards to that particular point. The novel begins with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, which is also significant, for Jack Aubrey is very much a creature of the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. Although Aubrey and his particular friend Stephen Maturin had never been in the forefront of the war effort, it was against that larger backdrop that O'Brian set his novels. Whatever adventures lay ahead, they would most surely have been of a different cut of cloth. Consequently, while I will miss the novels that would have been followed this one, I am satisfied that there is a completeness to the epic.To underscore this idea I ask you to read the final chapter of this novel and to recognize the inherent rightness in the final words of Jack Aubrey upon the printed page.Final Note: While I give this particular novel 4 Stars the entire series. Remember: YOU MUST READ THESE NOVELS IN ORDER.

If O'Brien had lived to finish it properly, I'd of course have bought Book 21.

Nor can we expect to read the like of O'Brian again, as his generation will be the last to possess the combination of erudition, intellectual curiousity and a psychic link to the past that formed the life of his novels.Read O'Brian as an antidote to the values of the present. Read O'Brian to realize that there was a time in the recent past when, for many people, friendship, honor, love, learning, loyalty and courage were present in everyday life, and when expediency was not always the best policy.Read O'Brian for what is surely one of the greatest sustained efforts in literature, for 20 volumes that together form a novel that in style, lanuage and subject matter, could have been published contemporaneously with Dickens - and is yet timeless."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"The end of a great book always produces a letdown for me so it was a double whammy to realize as I turned the last page of Blue at the Mizzen that it was book-match-series.

Even before the news broke, though, I had come to accept this as the last in the series.This book isn't perfect. It sometimes panders to my reverie for the series at its height.It also, though, provides us with an incomplete, compromised, very human close to things. Maturin isn't happy, though he lives in expectation of happiness. Aubrey is older, and if he's wiser he's also not as bright a flame, so to speak, as he once was.O'Brian might have described a conversation between Cello and Violin, ending with a muttered irresolute harmony as the daylight through the stern windows faded to grey.

It was a good adventure story, but much of the time I was lost as to why such and such a thing was done, or who this or that person was. I'm sure having read the books in order would help greatly, and I imagine some day I will do that. At the moment, though, this book doesn't come close to Forrester for characterization, detail, and true nautical enjoyment. There is too much skipping of key points, few sensible transitions, and a giant question left unanswered at the end of the book.

If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I went to see Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World mainly because I liked Russell Crowe in his Gladiator role and Napoleonic naval warfare is the subject I find interesting.Be warned, these books are not simple reads or written in a way most would be familiar with. What makes them so great also makes them difficult and can turn a lot of people off of them. O'Brian uses language from the day not only among the characters, but in his narration as well. This creates, I my opinion, absolute immersion because one is forced to always read the language used in that period.Another difficulty is the strongly pervasive use of naval jargon. Many people, myself included, have begun reading the series and turned towards the rear for a glossary of the terms O'Brian uses throughout his books. You can turn and look, but you will not find one. The only clue you will get is a small picture of a ship at the beginning of every book that lists which sails are which. That's it, a small picture as a guide and you are immediately transported to the beginning of the nineteenth century.My advice is that if you like to read, you need to check these books out. You will not understand a lot of what you read for a while but it only gets easier as you go. By comparison, Milton's Paradise Lost or Dante's Inferno are much harder to get accustomed to than this series. Interestingly enough, as time passes you will begin to comprehend almost as a foreign speaker begins to understand a language when surrounded by it for long enough. On my second time through, I am reading it with a fluency achieved by many months of nightly readings in the recent past.More than anything else, these books are about a friendship. The complex and sometimes strained relationship between the two primary characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, serve as the foundation upon which all other plot points are laid. Maturin, the small, well educated, scientific and rather unattractive physician is as perfect a foil as I have encountered in literature. His presence amplifies Jack's clear role as the tall, blond, strong and dumb-except-in-naval-matters hero. Although polar opposites in many ways, their one similarity (love of music) binds them together in the unlikeliest of friendships.As I have lengthily stated, this series is driven by the characters and specifically by the two main ones Jack and Stephen. By series end, one almost feels like they are a part of this relationship. You can almost feel the heave of the ship beneath your feet as you sit in Jack's cabin strumming along on the latest Bocherini piece with he and Stephen. It is this intimacy and immersion that makes these books so great. Every turn of events is meaningful because it feels not as if it is befalling a mere character in a novel, but rather, one of your closest friends. Any who are curious should certainly give these books a try. You'll find yourself totally immersed in no time, or black's the white of my eye."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Until the very last couple of pages in this twentieth and last volume of the Aubrey-Maturin saga, I was unsure of the implications of the book's title.

With the Napoleonic wars ended, the captain of the SURPRISE has had to go to revolutionary Chile to find ways of continuing to build his reputation, this time in the development of the infant republic's navy. There is a fine ship-to-ship action against a much larger Spanish vessel, and all the usual trials and tribulations of beating around the Horn. Moreover, the recently widowed Dr. Maturin has a much larger part this time even than usual, in his slightly odd pursuit of Christine Wood, widow of the governor of Sierra Leone and a noted naturalist in her own right. A mid-life crisis? We don't know how all that will turn out, unfortunately. It's sad that there will be no more installments to the story, but this is a reasonably satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Appreciation of novels -- like music, movies, and just about every thing else -- is ultimately a subjective experience. I have loved the Jack Aubrey-Stephen Maturin novels for many years, reading (and re-reading) each new entry in the series with interest. &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; may possibly be the last novel in the series, if what Patrick O'Brian said a few years ago is true. I hope that is not the case but if it is, then &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; would serve well enough as the end. I won't spoil the plot for anyone, but I will say that it advances the stories of the two central characters to new levels. I don't claim that &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; is the finest book in the series, but I found it solidly satisfying, with a good number of the typical small scenes of delight which characterize the O'Brian novels. If there is little music in this book compared to previous novels in the series, there is compensation to be found in the revival of Stephen Maturin's spirits after the sorrowful events of &quot;The Hundred Days.&quot; A new character of considerable charm and appeal makes an appearance amidst the expected familiar faces. I don't know whether I would recommend &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; to someone not familiar with the Aubrey-Maturin books (those people I tell to start at the beginning with &quot;Master and Commander&quot;), but I do think that any fan of the series -- even those disappointed with the gloomy atmosphere &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; -- will enjoy this new book."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I deeply loved what is now the last book in the series.

The scene in the desert listening to lions was O'Brian's voice, pure and sweet. The rest was cloudy. I advised friends -don't waste your money.Blue at the Mizzen (an Adm of the Blue broad flag flying at the mizzen - a squadron commander -as opposed to a &quot;Yellow Adm &quot; a passed over reject) is a saga worth buying. The sweet digressions are closely edited and battle scenes longer - this book sounds more like Alexander Kent than O'Brian.From the wretched Hundred Days, a glow remains in the hearth. At his worst - and this certainly isn't - O'Brian is miles ahead of the competition.The grief over a lost friend and (a little bit) a wife gets a mention here - response to the astonished reaction to the blaise reaction in the previous book?I hope this is the last, before the embers die out completely.

In the final pages we finally learn about Jack's career move --though the answer is given away by the book's title-- and this is something he has fretted over for several books now. But many other plot threads remain hanging, most notably that of Stephen's marital status. The previous book involved the sudden, unexpected and unmourned deaths of several key characters, and this one leaves a dozen or two other secondary characters wholly unfinished. It feels as though the elderly O'Brian had meant to write another book or two to bring Aubrey and Maturin back to England for the final denouement, but perhaps his energy failed him.In any case, this is another excellent story. With Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo, the \\"Surprise\\" must refit after suffering damage in a collision before making her way on her long-delayed voyage to Chile. The action and intrigue in Portugal and Chile are wonderful. As always, Stephen Maturin's wry humor, brought out by the author's sublime prose, leaves the reader smiling.

Picking up where The 100 Days left off, the pair cross the ocean, engage in middle-aged derring-do, and save the day for the twentieth time, with a spot of unexpected romance thrown in. As always the historical references are accurate; the minor failures of plot in this latest episode are easily overlooked. After all, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin are men like no others in modern fiction; they fight, love, drink, indulge in excesses, mourn, spy, and get away with the loot better than anyone. They're a pair of upright Harry Flashmans, ready to rescue the damsel, make off with the gold, and free the oppressed colonials from their decadent rulers. Hornblower never had it this good."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"_Blue at the Mizzen_ is a bit of a departure from the style of many of the other Aubrey-Maturin books, in that much of it is written in Maturin's hand via letters to England. (The reasoning behind this to be explained below.) This works, giving a detail and depth to a character whose rich inner-life has largely been absent, his role as intelligence officer, physician, scientist and erstwhile companion and confidant to Aubrey overshadowing his personal proclivities.The Napoloeonic Wars endedThe Hundred Days (Vol. Book 19) (Aubrey/Maturin Novels)Aubrey, like many RN post-captains, faces the liklihood of becoming a \\"yellow admiral\\" - a promotion to flag-officer rank without a ship or squadron to command, effectively ending one's naval career. To forestall this, Maturin and Aubrey take _Suprise_ to Chile, ostensibly on a hydrographical voyage, in reality to help Chile win its independence from Spain. En route, O'Brian tantalizes readers with two new developments: a new midshipman, Horatio Hanson (the bastard of the Duke of Clarence, Prince William) and a budding romance between Lady Jenny Morris (the widow of Lord Morris, ambassador in Sierra Leone) and Maturin (himself a widower). It is frustrating that these plot points will not be more fully developed.The voyage south moves at a fast clip, and the narration of _Suprise_ on station is also brief, most of the story focusing on Maturin and Hanson - some readers will be disappointed by this, I found it a refreshing departure from the detailed \\"watch on watch\\" description of daily life at sea, and allowed me to get a better sense of Maturin as an emotional being. The single naval engagement Aubrey is involved in is also summative, and which I wish more detail was given; however, it wasn't so much a disappointment to deduct a star in my rating.Finishing _Blue at the Mizzen_ is somewhat bitter-sweet, it being the last complete novel in the series. I look forward to21: The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey (Vol. Book 21) (Aubrey/Maturin Novels), but I sense it will be ultimately unsatisfying, the mannuscript unfinished. That I won't see how things will develop between Lady Morris and Maturin and what will happen with young Hanson is similarly disappointing. However, every voyage must end, shipmates going their separate ways, the sea-stories to be regaled and revisited at some later date - and so it is with Aubrey and Maturin. As I've written on most reviews of the series, I highly recommend the books: no one writes nautical fiction like O'Brian, and very few write any sub-genre of fiction like him. Having faced foul weather, stood on the quarter-deck and in the gun-room in countless engagements, and crossed the line several times, I feel a closeness to the characters O'Brian so vividly created. Its been a wonderful, wholly enjoyable experience and one that I encourage any lover of good writing to find for themselves why there is such a passionate and loyal following to these books."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Patrick O'Brians Royal Navy is alive and well in Blue At The Mizzen.I read it as a preface to his final partial novel.

Either due to the aging of the author or of the characters (or perhaps of both), the thrill of living in their world is almost gone by the last couple of books; just a wisp of its former self.The late, great Patrick O'Brien was an immensely talented author. Most of his series crackles with historically accurate naval action that firmly pulls you into a long-ago time and place, a fascinating and intricate world that is totally gone. But even more importantly, his deep and nuanced characterizations made you really care about the people in the story, making the \\"lulls\\" between actions some of the most entertaining parts. Who could forget Jack's radiant joy at receiving his first command, or Stephen complaining, \\"Jack, you have debauched my sloth!\\", among dozens and dozens of other examples of wit and character that made a potentially dry topic come fully to life.In \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\", however, much of the joy of life and character and language and action that made so many readers love these books has faded to gray. The plot revolves around political and military maneuverings in Chile as Britain tries to quietly help the Spanish colony become independent. (This is no spoiler, as Jack and Stephen have been trying to make it over there for most of the last two books.) But neither of our main characters seem to give a fig about their mission. As a consequence, neither does the reader. That would be acceptable if the characters interacted and developed as they did throughout much of the series, but here they do neither. Jack is distant and morose, and Stephen spends his time pining for his new (and frankly unrealistic) love interest and riding aimlessly across the harsh local landscape, with little sign of their warm friendship to be seen.The characters are approaching middle age by this point, so it's unreasonable to expect them to behave as they did when the series began. They've been through too many victories and defeats and tragedies (both professionally and personally) to be the same people. But while forty year-olds don't generally grow and evolve at the same speed as younger men, they do change. O'Brien hints that perhaps now, when Jack and Stephen's long-held goals are finally within reach (raising a pennant) or already achieved (helping to defeat Napoleon), they might have started to realize that the journey was the thing after all, and that perhaps other goals are preferable now - a mid-life crisis, as it were. That seems to be a reasonable path for continuing the development of these wonderful characters, but O'Brien chose not to take it, and they're left as wooden caricatures of themselves.Their supporting cast doesn't help much. Inexplicably absent are many of their usual shipmates (Pullings, Mowett, Babbington, etc.), which is odd since it is mentioned more than once that sailors are desperate for work now that peace has come. And where is Jack's son Sam? When last they were in South America, he was quick to visit. Here, nobody seems to remember that he exists. Poor Rev. Martin, last spoken of when he sailed back for England many books ago, again doesn't even get a mention, much less a return appearance.Yes, a few newer characters are around, but they never take on much life. Dr. Jacob seems to be a more worldly replacement for Martin but never comes across as anything more than a 2-dimensional medical/intelligence aid to Stephen. Poll Skillings and Horatio Hansen have potential, but they aren't given much to do.Let me repeat, I absolutely love this series. The books flow from one to the next and have been called a single (20-volume!) historical novel, and the best I've ever read. I have read them all from beginning to end more than once and will certainly read them again. However, there's no getting around the fact that this last chapter is a disappointment.Near the end of the book, Aubrey receives a packet of letters from Sophie and tears up because he misses his family so much. It would have been much more satisfying, for both dear Jack and myself, if he would have been allowed to stop mucking around in South America and instead sail home to strike soundings in the channel of old England at last."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Coming to the end of \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" and in so doing finishing the 20-volume Aubrey-Maturin series felt like a tragedy--like losing a close friend. I held off for about a year, occasionally casting aside lesser books by others writers because O'Brian's mastery had spoiled me, then I could stand it no longer: I had to start re-reading the whole series again from the beginning, delighting again in Jack and Stephen being young men with many years of adventure ahead. The series is in my opinion the greatest work of historical fiction ever written and I foresee journeying through it a third and, yes, perhaps even a fourth time at some point in my life.Samuel Hawley[...]"},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Patrick O'Brian's \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" is the twentieth and final book in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series. The Aubrey-Maturin books are quite simply the best fiction I've ever read. I enjoy them so much that I find it difficult to read any other fiction now.Although there are twenty (completed) Aubrey-Maturin novels, in a sense they are one long, unending story. O'Brian tells the story of an unlikely pair of friends in early 19th century Britain: a hard-charging Royal Navy captain and an Irish physician and naturalist (and British spy). Both are devoted, for different reasons, to the fight against Napoleonic France. Captain Jack Aubrey and Doctor Stephen Maturin are dedicated friends, and the interplay between this unlikely pair is ranges from deep philosophical discussions to intended and unintended humor.But what really makes these novels is Patrick O'Brian's writing style. Through his words, he paints wonderful pictures and creates real characters in brilliant narratives; which is good, because Aubrey and many of his exploits are based on real-life adventures during the Napoleonic Wars.\\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" is set just after peace finally settled in Europe after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. After time spent at Gibraltar and in England, Aubrey and Maturin head to South America to help the Chilean independence movement. In the usual understated O'Brian style, he focuses much more on the people involved than the action at sea. After intrigue ashore and at sea, the book - and the series - end on the uplifting note that Aubrey can fly the blue flag of a rear admiral from his ship. The series ends there (because of O'Brian's death) , but the characters will live forever."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I have read (and re-read) as well as listened to Patrick Tull's narrations of all the previous 19 volumes in the series and still find excitement, drama, and humor that makes me laugh out loud or say Huzzay! However this book was a great disppointment. It lacked the full involvement of many characters, the humor and the light-hearted exchanges between Aubrey and Maturin. Too much was conveyed through Stephen's over long letters to Christine. Without the war, the battle scenes were boring. I'm sorry to say that after skipping through page after page I finally put the book down and can't bring myself to finish it. But I still gave it 3 stars - O'Brian is the best writer of historical fiction to date and the first 19 novels will always be my favorites. I would love to see PBS do these stories in a television series."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"While I have not read this group of books myself, I can tell you that my husband and son devoured these books and were left wanting more after completing the final book - Blue at the Mizzen.

The best of them can easily earn 8.745 stars, and the poorest better than 6. &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; is a solid reflective work, yet with flaws. The plot is inconsistent, and full of holes. Vast assumptions are made. Without having read the previous Aubrey/Maturin books, it would be a difficult read.Yet, a less than excellent O'Brian is still head and shoulders above anything else in this genre. On Amazon's 5 star system, I would give it a 6.73. Let's hope that O'Brian has a magnum opus to conclude the series."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I don't know about this one--many of the earlier chapters felt to me as if someone listed all the O'Brian quirks and twists of language and then trotted out the characters and pasted them in here and there. It did not truly sing of Patrick O'Brian. I was disappointed that while Maturin seemingly narrates throughout the book, his usual curmudgeonly and unkempt personality rarely showed. It was &quot;Stephen Lite&quot;, especially considering losing Diana and dealing with a very distant Jack.(No matter how tired a contrivance it was, I always enjoyed Jack's roaring bad puns, red face and passion for puddings!) The last few books have been less engaging, too, but I heard O'Brian's voice much less in Blue at the Mizzen than in any of them. I realize the trials of age may dim that creativity we have come to expect. I faithfully finished the book (it improved later). I wish Mr. O'Brian well."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Book number 20 in the series.

We struck up a friendly conversation when I noticed he was reading an Aubrey-Maturin novel. \\"Oh yes, I love them.\\" he said, \\"But I've got only two more to go. And when I finish, I don't know what I'll do.\\" I knew exactly what he meant; at least back then we could look ahead to the indefatigable Patrick O'Brian's ongoing output.But now we're done for. I read \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" two weeks after the sad news of O'Brian's death. As I closed in on the ending, the lump in my throat had nothing to do with the resolution of the plot. And it wasn't really for the drying-up of this amazing flow of dialog and description. Like all great literature, the books will be there forever, to be re-read with pleasure and recommended to friends and family. No, it was for poor Jack and Stephen. Because by now I know well how long it takes to sail around the Horn and I could tell by the number of pages remaining that the tale would end-with the usual flurry of action-but that the two particular friends would still be standing out to sea, far from England. Like Capt. Cook, the great navigator the stories owe so much too, Aubrey and Maturin are triumphant and ever hopeful, but their bones can never rest at home.If you are a reader of the series, there is no question that you are going to read this book. The only worry is the details. Buy now, or wait for the paperback edition? I say, go for it. And be assured that O'Brian went out at the top of his form. \\"The Hundred Days\\" seemed hackneyed and tired, but \\"Blue at the Mizzen\\" has all the dialog, the detail and intrigue, all the warmth of the best of the series. It isn't quite the masterpiece some of the earlier books were, but that's just because the characterizations are so familiar that it can't stand on its own. I definitely wouldn't recommend a reader new to the series begin here.It starts in the Mediterranean, returns to England by way of Madeira, and then sails for South America to do some urgent meddling in Chilean politics at the behest of Sir Joseph Banks. Along the way, we get familiar notes from Jack and Stephen and a set of bit characters, deftly drawn, and that glorious sense of being contained in a little world on the great ocean. Finally, we get to Chile and find things are quite muddled. It will take all of Maturin's cunning and all of Aubrey's dash to sort the matter out, which of course they do. But then it ends. And, if you're like me, you'll sit for awhile and think of all the times you've been transported by Jack and Stephen-and all the Surprises. You can go back, but you can't go on. It's a fine thing, but a sad thing."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"About five years ago I was introduced to the Aubrey/Maturin novels of Patrick O'Brian. I first read The Wine Dark Sea, and then I returned to the beginning of the series and promptly read all of the books in the series.In recent years, I have eagerly awaited the release of new books in the series. And, Blue at the Mizzen was worth the wait.The Aubrey and Maturin characters have evolved as individuals, as they have aged and had other experiences in life. Unlike most of the earlier books in the series, Blue at the Mizzen features Dr. Maturin to a greater degree than the brooding Capt. Aubrey whose concern over his future makes him more remote to both Maturin and to the reader. After O'Brian killed off Dr. Maturin's wife in The Hundred Days, Dr. Maturin surprisingly develops a romantic interest in a fellow naturalist, Christine Wood. Their romantic episode is odd, but given Maturin's character, that is not really surprising.As usual, a lot happens in this book, but as in the other books, O'Brian often unleashes the action in a understated or offhanded way. Events happen with little or no warning or with minimal discussion. The intelligence activities involving the Republic of Chile are not as clearly described, for example, as Maturin's South American intelligence activities in The Wine Dark Sea. As with other books in the series, the action sometimes is secondary to the activities on the ship, the relationships of the main and minor characters, and Maturin's focus on the birds and beasts that they encounter. Even so, Blue on the Mizzen was an enjoyable book that held my interest.How does it compare with the other books in the series? Good question. Personally, I liked it better than The Yellow Admiral, which spent too much time on shore. Unlike other reader reviewers, however, I equally enjoyed both The Hundred Days and Blue at the Mizzen. The early books are wonderful, but even these later books are very good.For someone who has read any of the Aubrey/Maturin novels, I would not suggest that you start with Blue at the Mizzen. Instead, the O'Brian novice should start with the earliest books in the series. For someone who has read the other Aubrey/Maturin novels, Blue at the Mizzen should be a &quot;must read&quot; book. It is the last one in the series due to O'Brian's recent death. If O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin formula is aging by book #20 in the series, it is still a fine formula that still works in #20. Blue at the Mizzen is a worthy end to the series."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Interested reader,If you are reading these reviews, chances are good you are wondering what all this stuff about Patrick O'Brian and the &quot;Aubrey/Maturin&quot; series is about. Wonder no longer.&quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; represents the last volume of what is overall a rich, wonderful collection of literature. While I've read the disappointment that some have had with the last few books in the series, I respectfully offer the view of a reader who feels touched forever by the author's hand and grateful for having read this series in the first place.Once you read &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; chances are excellent you will adopt Aubrey and Maturin to be among your favorite characters of all time. Who could not chuckle when Stephen Maturin tries yet again trying to come aboard the ship without falling overboard? Who could not envision Killick's severe expressions when Aubrey gets grease on his number one uniform, or become anxious whenever Aubrey sets foot upon land? Who could not feel the loss of a shipmate sent over the side? It is sad to note that we finally see Aubrey make his flag as we get the news that Mr. O'Brian has made his number.I believe that &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; and all the other books in the series need to be looked at by the prospective reader in total. If you have never read from this series, start with &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; and I will guarantee that if you like this first volume and continue through the series, you will be touched by a truly masterful hand."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I wasn't a great fan of the predecessor to this book (The Hundred Days) as it seemed that a lot of life had been sucked out of the series. I then re-read the set from Master and Commander to Blue at The Mizzen.While the books have changed somewhat, in that they have become less descriptive of the interrelationships between the characters, this is understandable. As Aubrey gets more senior (here for much of the time he is an acting Commodore with a small squadron) the books have to describe a much bigger naval and political picture. O'Brian excels at this.Unfortunately this means we lose some of the &quot;small ship&quot; feeling, and many of the best characters from earlier in the series are left out. Isn't this a function of life - not only Aubrey and Maturin's but also most readers? As we move on in the world relationships change and we interact with different people. In addition O'Brian would have difficulty in weaving in many old characters and maintaining the sense of historical accuracy that is important to his books (this is however not a justification for Aubrey's lack of response to Bonden's death in the previous book).Read the whole series from book one and then enjoy this and its predecessor (The Hundred Days). Both books then fall into much better context.Keep it up Mr O'Brian - you are doing an excellent job. I fervently hope that the unanswered questions surrounding Stephen and Christine Wood (as well as where Aubrey goes from here) mean that we can hope for one more (and preferably more than one) book and a couple of large fleet actions!"},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I don't know whether I would recommend &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; to someone unfamiliar with Patrick O'Brian's excellent series of nautical novels about Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin because, I believe, much of the pleasure to be derived in reading the book comes from our acquaintance with the main characters from previous novels. But I would have no hesititation at all at recommending it to any Aubrey-Maturin fan. A significant number of readers (not including me) of the previous book in the series, &quot;The Hundred Days&quot;, were disappointed in the somber tone of that novel -- an atmosphere fully justified, in my opinion, by the central subject matter. Those readers need not fear a repetition in &quot;Blue at the Mizzen.&quot; Stephen Maturin has recovered his interest in the natural world and is once again a fully engaged participant in the events around him. It has been said that this novel might be the final volume in the series (I hope not) but if it is, then the series will end on a high note. The book is full of typical O'Brian touches of elegantly described scenes and subtle characterizations. If it is not quite the equal of &quot;Post Captain&quot; or &quot;Desolation Island&quot; (but what is?) there is still much in &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; to make longtime fans of the series smile with satisfaction. And if it is not the final volume, then I shall look forward with great pleasure to the next book."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Although Blue at the Mizzen is readable on its own, it is perhaps an injustice to it to do so. The book, as with any one of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels, is merely chapter 20 in what is trully an epic. Each volume/chapter is integral; there is not a single weak link in the tale. It was thus with great sadness that I read of Mr. O'Brian's recent death; Blue at the Mizzen is the final chapter.Things could be worse. Mr O'Brian, intentionally or no, has brought the resolution of many long-standing issues to his characters, though these resolutions also promise new beginings which the reader will now have to make up on his (her) own. Blue at the Mizzen is the type of novel Mr O'Brian's vast readership have come to expect: tragedy ballanced keenly with triumph, exploration of world and soul, the peculiar gains we find in loss, and the losses we face in victory. Blue at the Mizzen is a must read for anyone who has read the epic till this point. Others will still find it enjoyable, but are strongly suggested to start with volume/chapter one: Master and Commander."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"So seemingly effortless, yet so rich in every phrase --- O'Brian is again at the top of his form; not just the tale he tells, but also the way he throws off ideas, characters, and plot with brief phrases that sing together so sweetly. It's a rare fine wine, enjoyed best by those who have developed a taste for it in the first twenty volumnes. Aubrey has aged, and has grown more silent, more brooding, the aging man of action losing some of his physical prowess, his ambition, but with habits of courage so deeply ingrained; Maturin the aging philosophe, brought to life not only by his spirited study of the natural world but also by the discovery of his aging heart's new trilling at the thought of Ms Woods. God, this stuff is great!"},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Patrick O'Brien once described the Napoleonic Wars as &quot;the Troy tales&quot; of the British people, playing as central a role in the national myth as the Trojan wars did for the ancient Greeks. His incomparable series, based on the vicissitudes of the professional career of Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy, who rises from humble Lieutenant to Admiral (with one reduction to the ranks and a court martial and public disgrace along the way), has become a cult among his many admirers.There are three main reasons for this. First, the naval lore and action are quite as good and compelling as the battles of C S Foresters's Horatio Hornblower. Second, these are real novels, more than rattling good action yarns, with complex characters, credible women (Diana Villiers is a grand creation) and a genuine historical sense of life ashore that reveal O'Brien's admiration for Jane Austen. Above all, the series is given life and depth and tension by the heart of the books, the friendship between Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the half-Irish, half-Catalan, who is naturalist, physician, musician and spy.At times, the reader is lost in the world of Charles Darwin and the voyage of 'The Beagle' as Maturin delights in the flora and fauna that come the way of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, the Antarctic, the South Pacific and the Newfoundland Banks. At times, one is lost in a world of culinary history, or of secret intelligence, or primitive surgery. The French enemies are drawn with intelligent sympathy, and the American naval adversaries treated with proper respect.To embark upon the long voyage of this marvellous series is to plunge into a compelling and enchanting world. I have bought half a dozen copies of the first book of the series, 'Master and Commander', to lure choice friends into this sweet obsession of O'Brien's world. My own favourite remains 'The Mauritius Command', but I know that once I begin it, I shall have to recommence the pleasure of re-reading the series. Life is too short not to surrender to the indulgence, again and again."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Even though I believe that the Aubrey-Maturin series is one of the great works of prose fiction of the 20th century, the latest (and 20th) book in the series, Blue at the Mizzen, is a disappointment. Indeed the last few books in the series (starting with the Wine-Dark Sea, have gotten progressively weaker, but even they have always had many compelling pages. The great humor, the exciting naval action, the lovely historical feel, but above all the wonderful language and psychological acuity are missing here. The female characters are, no surprise, mere plot devices. (Both Sophie and Clarissa barely figure, and the smart and beautiful Mrs. Wood, who Maturin falls for, makes little sense as a character.) But the subordinate characters in general lack interest, even the prominently featured midshipman Hansen, the bastard son of the Duke of Clarence. The local color in early 19th century Chile seems washed out, insubstantial. Worst of all, the two principals are presented pro forma, as if O'Brian is just tired of them. While there is a satisfying (finally) move up to Admiral for Aubrey, the story (with no more Napoleonic foes, and no more money worries) has run out of gas. Is this the last of the novels? Aubrey-Maturin fans will be disappointed that we have lost track of Pullings, Babbington, Mowett, and Martin completely-what happened to them? Where oh where is to Aubrey's illegitimate son, Sam Panda, last seen in nesrby Peru-and why do Jack's thoughts never run to him? This is, of course, a must-read for Aubrey-Maturin fans, but compared to the invigorating, full-blooded novels in the series, this one reads like the weak, lukewarm tea that Jack and Stephen so detest."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Regretably Amazon only offers 5 stars. All of O'Brian's work hit 5 stars without breathing hard. Unfortunately this series is winding down, and it shows. Poor and careless editing, and careless ploting are beginning to show. If some of O'Brian's early works can reach 11 or 12 stars (on the Amazon scale) &quot;Blue&quot; only hits about 6 or 7. Having said that, a weak O'Brian is head and shoulders above anyone else's best. He is clearly in a league of his own."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Aubrey and Maturin at sea once again in the beloved ship, Surprise. Aubrey seeks his Admiral's Flag and Maturin, endless new species, a Chilean political embroglio, and, a new wife.As always, a fascinating and addictive read; this is a true credit to the series."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"I'm reviewing, here, the entirety of O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series, because I consider it to be essentially one novel.The first, and most astonishing, strength of this series is in its characterization. Not only are the contrasting, yet inseparable, friends Jack and Stephen believable, appealing, vividly human characters, but they change realistically through time. To the reader, they appear as \\"real\\" people with \\"real\\" lives, perhaps more so than some of the the flesh and blood ephemera around us. The secondary characters, too, shine -- Killick is priceless.Research, of course, is O'Brian's other great strength. It's not only the ships, about which he seems to know everything. There's no aspect of the period -- food, dialect, religion, music -- in which he does not seem to be well versed. And he conveys this information to the reader in interesting ways, rather than encumbering the text with massive info-dumps.One often overlooked bright spot in this series is its humor. Too often historical fiction has a self-consciously grim quality. O'Brian can be grim -- crushingly depressing, in fact --but... \\"Swiving Monachorum\\".Action and battles are not, strangely, this series' strongest point. When we get them, they're great, but too often they are skipped over or told in a distant third-person viewpoint. But the worst here is still very good indeed.I would recommend reading all of these, in order, starting with the first one, right away, as soon as you possibly can. It's true that The Hundred Days marks a low point -- I agree with the reviewers who cite O'Brian's loss of his wife as the reason -- but Blue at the Mizzen, under which I've posted this review, marks a triumphant return of the author's powers."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"This final novel from Mr. O'Brian surpasses recent favorites of mine such as &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; and &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, and stands alone as my best-loved historical fiction novel. &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot; brings history to life as only the best novels of this fascinating genre can, the characters are vividly drawn and the setting and action are portrayed with striking authenticity. But it's the humanity and candor of those brilliant characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, that make these novels so superb. These novels will be read and admired a century from now, you owe it to yourself to read them all."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Thanks to the late Patrick O'Brian for wrapping up the series on an up note. I grew as a mariner with each book in this series from a landlubber to...maybe a ships boy. Patrick O'Brian brought this incredible era of honor, corruption and raw bravery to life for me with this historically accurate series. Now that I'm reading the memoirs of the Admiral that Jack Aubrey is based on, I'm finding that much of the action in these books really happened as Mr. O'Brian tells it."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"Unlike Forrester O'Brian has really done his homework. His books are really informative.Forrerster follows the straight Tory ticket and O'Brian, does not.Of course the Hornblower series started in the thirties when England still had an empire. The Aubrey/Mathurin series on the other hand started in 1969 when England had lost its empire and democracy had become respectable.This is one of the later volumes and not as good as the first."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"As are the others, in this series of 21, a very well written book, interesting storyline, and melds well with the others. Too bad &#34;21&#34; wasn't more complete!"},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"My husband started reading the series but did not have the complete set.

It would have been nice to follow further adventures of his rise - alas it is not to be."},{"Title":"Blue At the Mizzen (aubrey/maturin series)","review":"This book is a fitting close to a masterful series. It is one of the most poignant of the series, written when O'Brian must have felt his powers waning, but only in the sense that like its predecessor it is slightly more hurried than the earlier books. And yet his powers of creative writing are still strong in this book; which evokes a strong sense of living at a time of change at the end of the long Napoleonic wars.Jack Aubrey, Captain Jack Aubrey, is a man fearful of being passed over for promotion to admiral now that the long Napoleonic wars are at last over, and however we may feel that his life would in any event be a full one, O'Brian makes us feel for him in the way that we would for a friend. Equally, Stephen Maturin, Jack's friend and companion over 20-odd novels, is on the cusp of change, pursuing in hope of marriage with changing hopes a young widow (delightfully drawn).Jack and Stephen are in the full flow of life, probably only in their late forties, when we leave them. O'Brian closes the series with affection.If you are fresh to Patrick O'Brian do not start with his book, but with Master and Commander."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"An interesting and easy read. I wouldn't put it in the category of one of the great reads in my life, but it was alright. I liked the fact that you followed a character throughout her life and the reality of that life. Not all ups or downs, but a combination that we can all relate to. This was the first Carol Sheilds novel I have read and while I was expecting a little more from someone with such a great reputation, I would read her works again."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I have to agree with the reader who expressed astonishment at the awarding of the Pulitzer to this novel. I did find it to be evocatively written, and enjoyed the decription of the central character, Daisy, in part by how she thinks that others perceive her. Nevertheless, I failed to find Daisy at all compelling. I evaluate the quality of a book by how much it resonates with me after I've done reading it. After I finished &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot;, it completely disappeared, leaving only a faint sense of disappointment."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"At times, this was an enjoyable, very interesting journey through one woman's life, through each decade of the 1900s. At others, it becomes a little odd, with the tangents about some of the other family members and distant relatives. The writing style switches narrators and tenses quite often, until at the final pages there was a reference made in the first person by a narrator whose name I did not even know. It's never a confusing book, just sometimes frustrating. Overall, the journey through the lives of the characters is special and I did not feel the lesser for having read it."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book was so well written. I thought the method of organizing it around important events in Daisy's life was ingenious. I never found it to be boring."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries is a depressing story of a woman whose mother dies at her birth, her first husband dies on their honeymoon and loses the job she finds joy in doing. These experiences makes her a lonely and emotionless. What is really interesting about the novel is the contrast between the two symbols 'flower' and 'stone'. Here is a woman who is named after a delicate flower, full of life and the 'stone' has no emotions. She has no feelings whatsoever for her husband, father, or children. She wants to desire but doesn't know what to desire for or what she is allowed to. Carol Shields also included some pictures in the book as well as recipes and letters. These help the reader understand the novel more and really get into the story."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I chose Stone Diaries as a book review for our readers club and although I knew it was very popular did not have a clue regarding the story line. When I read the physical description of Daisy's mother &amp; father then compared it with the picture I was perplexed as neither the description or ages was close and in fact the woman in the picture looked like the mother of the young man. Of course by the time I learned this book is considered a fictious biography (what's that?) I had lost the flow of the story. The pictures of the grandchildren I understand are the author's children. A preface or introduction would have been most helpful. I am presently at Daisy's bridal shower. The reviews on the web are for the most part certainly complementary and for this reason I will continue reading Stone Diaries, with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Tediously written, incredibly boring tale of a woman of no particular interest to whom virtually nothing happens. Godawful."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Unbelievably beautiful account of the history of one woman's life. Do not miss this one!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"to truly understand the way this book is written the way it is, one must look at the art of life writing, autobiography and biography. There are multiple narratives all from different points of view on Daisy Goodwill, but as you read on you realize that the story is not about Daisy but about how people saw Daisy. We only get snippets of what she really was like as a person through other people's words, but not her own pieces of writing and college papers. As a woman, she had achieved a lot but was yet very passive and misunderstood as a whole, and also had a childlike side to her that made it hard for people to \\"read\\" her, which is the case with this book. When I first read the book I was totally confused by it and bored but at the second read I grew to love it. I love the way everything is described and well written, like about her garden and cuyler's monument and successful stone carving business and creativity. The characters really have their own personalities that make them distinctive from one another, but there are also characters in the book that are not very likeable. I defintely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"OK, I'm teach literature, so I'm not your average reader, but Stone Diaries ranks in my top five for modern women's fiction. Be patient with this novel; Shields rewards her readers with terrific insights and humor, and her breadth of knowledge and wisdom is astonishing. I've read it just once, but it remains in prominent place on my overloaded shelves so I can get back to it soon. The other four of my favorite 20th century novels about women: Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway; Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God; Drabble's Peppered Moth or Seven Sisters; and Atwood's Cat's Eye."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This well-written novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1995. It is a well-written story about an inter-generational family, centered around a woman who distances herself from her core impulses and desires in order to be socially appropriate.The story is peopled by many eccentrics such as a man who creates a tower sculpture of limestone to commemorate his dead wife. Each piece of limestone has tiny sculpted pieces on it. This same man then builds a scale model pyramid in his backyard.While superficially warm and eccentric, the book's characters are somehow distant and guarded. I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This highly praised Pulitzer Prize winning novel centers focuses on the daily life of an as-it- were ordinary woman. But the extraordinary is present in her life from the very moment of her birth in which her mother died. The story is a multi- generational one and focuses on the inner feelings of the characters especially the women. There is a dramatic difference between the male characters and the female characters in regard to their intimate lives. But there is sympathetic relation to both male and female characters.The book has been praised for its sharp and insightful language.While sensing these positive qualities I felt a certain absence of 'lift' of a kind of intense joy in reading that I have when involved in books I feel to be of the most inspirational kind.Good, but not great."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Simple acceptance of the \\"norm\\" is sometimes the bull-eye's mark to our own untimely demise, if not physically, than definitely psychologically. And such is the outright example of Daisy Stone Goodwill in The Stone Diaries, a literary work of human inventiveness that cannot fully be criticized, because the author used a somewhat unacknowledged and palling aspect of social history. So, in truth, the main character of The Stone Diaries is not totally Daisy Stone Goodwill but rather the background of her times, the pre-Eisenhower era and beyond. Two stories are being told, and one character is the sole representative of a whole generation. That fact alone makes the work rather weighty in its numerous messages, and there are many. Yet, the character of Daisy is severely stunted, a kind of souffle that never fully rises, despite all the signs of promise, for it is either lack of courage to break away or it is fatalistic acceptance of her lot or both. She is a woman hindered by the molding cast of her period, a Stepford housefrau who fights not be catagorized as such, especially after she is widowed from Barker and slowly evolves into the dearly beloved Mrs. Green Thumb, the garden columnist for the local paper, The Recorder. But that alone is her peak, her fifteen minutes of fame, and it all becomes downhill after that, which for me, does not seem humanly realistic and true. Human dynamics is very interesting, and The Stone Diaries just does not go deeper enough. What is offered is just a thin veneer of a historical truth, and Carol Shields only scratched the surface to something that could have made the book such a promising work of fiction. There is a seething undertone of anger and bitterness, clearly manifested when Daisy, though unspoken, states: \\"I am not at peace.\\" Genuine human resiliency and the elemental consistency of self-use in place time and manner is not fully approcahed but is only gawked at from afar. And she can not take responsibility for that, for her own path, for it is her family's fault and her times. Obligation, dutifulness, repression and nothing more. The characters turn into unsympathetic, carping weaklngs who live up to a false image, an untruth and not what is burning within themselves. The only congruity throughout the novel is its unrealistic flatness of characters and environment. The Stone Diaries is a literary practice in the art of overkill."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I am not exactly sure how to write an accurate description of what this book is or how it is written. But I AM sure that I liked it.This is the story of Daisy Goodwill Hoad Flett. From before her birth to after her death, we get to know her- or I should say- know ABOUT her- primarily through the eyes of other people. As a reader, you'll often be privvy to conversations of which Daisy was a part, but never read her dialogue.While the style of writing is disjointed, it is never distracting. You'll read letters, narratives, newspaper articles, and even see pictures.The mysterious thing about this \\"biography\\" is that it is difficult to tell who the biographer is. My guess is that it is Daisy- almost as though she has disassociated from her body and views her life entirely in the third person (except for a few isolated moments when she refers to herself in the first person). This does not make complete sense, though, because there are descriptions of some events which she could not know about. But at the same time, it could be Daisy's imagination.Imagination or not, I truly enjoyed reading the story of Daisy and her environment. It is a quick read that, while unconventional, is worth giving a chance."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I liked this book, although I thought it was a little disjointed the way it kept jumping back and forth between narrators (is it Daisy who is writing or someone else?). However, it was pretty depressing. I'm not sure if I would recommend it to anyone else just because I didn't leave with a feeling that I had learned anything or been made better by reading it. It just seemed dreary and depressing.

I've read a few of the book reviews, many of which I agree with completely (the positive reviews, that is), but I just wanted to add an enthusiastic recommendation of the recorded book. I've never heard Alyss Bresnahan read before--I've since discovered she's read mostly children's books--but I'll be looking for anything she does in the future. She would certainly rank in the top three readers I've ever encountered. The perfect voice for Daisy's story. I keep looking for excuses to drive so I can listen some more."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I have no intention of being sexist when I say this, but this is a woman's book. Simply put, it tells the complete life story of a woman entirely from a woman's point of view. However basic I have made it sound, I do want to impress upon you that I was taken by its style nonetheless. It changes and matures with the main character until in the end as Daisy is growing senile, the writing becomes obscure. Her death is told in an 'obituary' format of sorts. I loved this idea. Even though I am not a woman, it helped me get into the character's head and 'live' her life just as she experienced it. Good writing. Worth a Pulitzer prize..? What else was written that year? I'll have to check."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"It was technically well written, but the narrative is annoying. I wanted more dialogue. A lot of things were left unexplained. And when they were finaly explained, it was too late. Like Barker, you dont even find out how he died until Alice's theory in 'Sorrow'(chapter 7), when he actually died somewhere between Chapter 5 and 6. Carol Shields didnt give the reader enough information or detail when you want or need to know it. Instead, she waits until it doesnt matter any more. It didnt take me away from the world, books should grab your imagination, and take you away to another place or time. It would have been better if the book was written from Daisy's perspective, not how she thought other people perceived her. From the title, you would expect it to be like an actual diary, instead it is a bunch of thoughts on paper, about and from any random character. It wasnt a complete waist of time, but its not a book I would recomend anyone read in the near future, or that I will ever read again."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is a well-written novel with great imagery and intersting characters.

I begged the pages for more, but found mostly boring descriptions that lacked imagination and were evidence enough to know that she had never seen nor contemplated the surroundings she portrayed.

I was perplexed over the photos and family tree (thanks to the other reviewers who confirmed all that was fiction). I was sad about the overall commentary on Daisy's life - why? As a Christian I am sad to think that this is how people feel about their lives. I don't see a point to life unless there's something more and Christianity is mentioned at various times (along with many other topics) with no depth and certainly not understanding. The only hope to life as I see it is through faith in Jesus and belief in what He said - that there is more to life than this life and what we do here has a point and purpose - Daisy's life has no point, other than to just carry on and keep going. I could go on and on, but I'll spare you. When I read a great book, I feel a real disappointment when it is over. When I finished this I was just RELIEVED it was over - I had had enough of the pointlessness and futility of life. I don't think I should have to have a reader's guide to understand a book - I've read a zillion books in my day and when I read a great book I've got all kind of thoughts on what was in it.

The plot and characters were all very boring. The author switches back and forth in time, causing confusion to the reader. The author switches tenses; also confusing. Even for that time period the characters names were all stupid except Daisy. There was very little dialogue and much dull, overblown narration.

Oh yeah, I guess if you're a fat, boring, and pretentious chick, then maybe you should add Stone Diaries to your library. This book is a waste of paper."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Carol Shields is a magnificent writer who fully deserves every prize she has garnered, and many that have not been invented yet. Stone Diaries was as gripping and finely crafted as everything she has touched. Not a shallow read, but one that endures. I adore this author, and cannot fathom the one stars here. I would have given it six stars or one hundred, but five will suffice."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book starts out as a page turner, but then I found myself turning some pages without completely reading each one. I had to force myself to finish the last few chapters. The first third had a lot of potential, but the story lost it's flair after Daisy gets married for the second time. Skip this one."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"A North American woman's life is chronicled and given meaning by the beautiful gift of Carol Shields written prose. The collection of family and friends that fill Daisy Flett's life allow us to understand her rich identity. Although this book is extremely well-written I still find SWANN and the REPUBLIC OF LOVE to be more enjoyable. Carol Shields fills her writing with things she worries may become of non-permanence such as writing letters and even the existence of plants and juxtapotizes them with what has been here forever in the form of stone and death. She even has Daisy talking from the grave at the end of the book. Ah,well.....life and death are the ultimate physical realities and to be truly human we must learn how to do both."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries is one of the best novels I have read. It is a novel about one woman's struggle throughout her childhood, marriage, remarriage, and old age to understand her destiny. At her birth, Daisy Goodwill's mother dies and she is adapted by her father's neighbours as he leaves her, too depressed and heart-broken to except his daughter that reminds him of his wife's death. Daisy Goodwill tries to cope being alone, without her parents and their love to support her and as a result, her life becomes emotionless. Carol Shields has written more than just a novel, more of a historical view on women in the 20th century and how their lives revolved around its changes and progress."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"THE STONE DIARIES is a captivating odyssey through the life of Daisy Goodwill. While the characters may be underdeveloped and overused, it still remains as a thouroughly enjoyable read. It is filled with unexpected bits of humor that delight and mysteriously seduce the audience. One example of this is an excerpt from a conversation that Mrs. Hoad has with Daisy before her marriage to Mrs. Hoad's son, Harold Hoad. &quot;Harold always takes Grape-Nuts for breakfast. A question of digestion and general health. I feel I should make myself clear on this point. I'm speaking of b.m.'s. Bowel movements.&quot; The novel can become a tad tiring at times and the point of view can become strewed. A reader may anticipate that Daisy holds the main point-of-view, but many other character's point-of view come in at various random points in the novel. The novel spans the lifetime of Daisy, so a particular incident cannot occur without the author inserting a long history of something that may have happened fifty years earlier. This contributes to the &quot;wholeness&quot; of the story, but it is somewhat of a hassle. Another interesting quote comes from the end of Daisy's life. &quot;When we say a thing or an event is real, never mind how suspect it sounds, we honor it. But when a thing is made up-regardless of how true and just ut seems-we turn up our noses. That's the age we live in. The documentary age. As if we can nevern never get enough facts. We put on the television set and what we hear is the life cycles of birds.&quot; This is a bit of truth that a reader may find in this novel that can give some perspective on life. Overall, this novel is definetely worth reading. It provides a real sense of history. Life was going on in an everyday sense even when major events were happing around the world. It is enjoyable, fascinating, and very well written."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I have heard so much about this novel, and started it with great expectations. The fact that it was a award winner in such an aclaimed competition ensured that I would like it. I was disapointed. The most acurate way to describe this novel, is that of having both good points and bad. Something that confused me immensly whislt endevouring to read this book was whether it fell upon biography or fiction. The photographs and tree lead me believe that it was infact a real family, yet I was told later it was not. I was constantly wanting a climax to the novel, something that would grasp and return my interest in what had so far been a tedious and dull book. It never came. It was the story of, a life. A typical life. We know of it, we can relate to it, so why must we read it? I felt, that while this may attract some readers, it bored the hell out of me. Well written, true to life, sure, but dead dull."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I think the lesson that I took with me from this novel was the idea that our choices in life shape and define who we are but that our social environment sometimes structures and limits our options. What is it like to be an ordinary woman in Canada in the 20th century? There is no single tale but in The Stone Diaries we see the shape of one woman's life as she is born, marries, is widowed, re-marries, has children, and then discovers a career!, and then loses the career, ages, and dies. For anyone who can't picture what the next 5 years of their life will look like, this book suggests take an even broader look. What would your autobiography say? What choices did you make and what didn't you even try?"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I think this is one of the most amazing books ever created, but I find that reviews, both positive and negative (not just those here, but everywhere) tend to miss what I see as the core of the book. Yes, it is incredibly well-written, yes, we see the events of a woman's life unfold, certainly, very little happens, and the narrative shifts in puzzling ways between characters, points of view, and style. But that is precisely the point: what Carol Shields does that is so revolutionary is overturn the very concept of what 'biography' or 'autobiography' mean.We associate those genres with great minds, significant historical figures; we expect the minute description of a human life to be about someone extraordinary, either because of what they did or because of the insight with which they thought. But what about a 'biography'/'autobiography' of a completely ordinary woman, one to whom nothing particularly exciting happens in her life and, though not unintelligent, certainly not a great mind? Is such a book even possible? Carol Shields answers yes, but what happens is that we learn who Daisy is not so much by her own life in and of itself, or by her thoughts, as by those of the people around her. Daisy does not think very much about herself; she is not self-analytical in the way we would expect an autobiographer to be, and thus rather than a straightforward diary the book combines first and third-person narrative. In fact, most of the other characters in the book are more interesting than Daisy is herself, and we see her not so much as a striking character in her own right but as one person in a flow of many. The stories of all of these characters, brought together into the story of 'Daisy', convey a rich survey of human emotion and experience. One leaves the book not completely sure of who Daisy herself is--which raises the questions, what does it take for a person to be a definable entity, and what makes human life meaningful? Are people only worthy of attention if we can point to something distinctive about them, and is a book only worth reading if it focuses on such a person? Some would answer yes, and I would certainly not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an exciting story or a unified narrative. Yet to my mind the book as a whole is deeply compelling both as an example of purely good writing and, more significantly, as a study of what it means to analyze and present human personality."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book does reflect the inability to define one's life in an autobiography. We drift around the years, doing one insignificant thing, and then another. It all adds up to a life that is meaningful to ourselves and our families...but to everyone else it is mundane. The mundane can be interesting, because we all have these experiences. We can relate to them.This book bothers me because the mundane is recorded, we experience Daisy's life, but there is no heart. Despite the drudgery of our lives, they mean something to us. These events should have more heart and color. They feel as if they are being told from the point of view of a fly on a wall. The reader doesn't experience the emotions of the characters. The entire novel feels as if it is being told by a participant that has no emotional attachment to anything that has happened. The effect is rather boring."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I love quirky characters and this story started out with some real doozies!! I was intrigued and suspected I'd like this book, but it got better. Then it got worse. But such is life.This fictional story is \\"written by\\" Daisy in a very unemotional manner, as if she were dead and simply reporting the facts of her life. But that doesn't mean it was a boring narration, nor do I feel that the narrator was particularly unsatisfied with her life.The author jumps decades, changes writing style (letters, 1st person, 3rd person, other characters narrating, etc.) and this kept me interested! My favorite chapter was when Daisy became depressed and many people in her life tried to analyze what was causing her depression. Of course they each had their own self-centered perception that gave great insight into their pshyche!Unfortunately, the next chapter took a nose dive. Her father-in-law alive at the age of 115? Her circumstance in going to the Island where he lived? Just by coincident, staying in the hotel next door to his nursing home? I don't know why this gifted author went so wacky in this chapter. There wasn't really a point in Daisy meeting her father-in-law. I just don't get it.The final chapter was sad, but what else can you expect from a chapter titled \\"Death?\\"I enjoyed this book, in spite of one major dip - but that wouldn't stop me from recommening it to any reader who enjoys subtleties, beautiful writing and quirky characters. But stay away if you're addicted to dramatic plot development or happy endings!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book came highly recommended to me, so I was a little concerned when I didn't feel it warranted the same merit. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this book was the most boring they had ever read. I've read slower, quieter books before and quite enjoyed them. However, this book was beyond slow. I didn't make it past the first three chapters, and I must say that if a book doesn't grab me in the slightest way within the first 120 pages, then it is not worth my time."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"In many ways, Daisy Goodwill Flett lived an ordinary life. She went to school, had two great girlfriends, got married, raised a family, retired to Florida as a widower, and died after a long illness at a convalescence home. Many things occurred during Daisy's life which make you realize that every life contains extraordinary chapters that are not shared with the outside world. In Daisy's case, her own children never knew that she had been married prior to marrying their father, and that her husband died by falling drunk off a balcony during their honeymoon.The first chapter of this book is narrated by Daisy. The rest are narrated in the third person, and chronicle events rather than feelings. This was intentional; the author focused on life's events rather than feelings. By doing so, we never get a clear sense of Daisy's personality. This sense of disconnection from Daisy's thoughts is furthered by the absence of a photograph of Daisy, even while there are photos of Daisy's children, friends, husbands and grandchildren.So who is Daisy? Daisy is defined by what happens to her, rather than what she is like as a person...as we all are. Daisy's mother died in childbirth. Daisy's father built a monument as tribute to her mother. Daisy's husband died on their honeymoon. Daisy became Ms. Green Thumb, the author of a newspaper column on gardening. We are told who Daisy is through a collection of letters, diary entries, and opinions by others, but not by Daisy herself.Only on her deathbed do we get a true sense of what Daisy thinks. The author seems to be saying that once we are forced to stop and sit still, and quit occupying our time with the mundane details of daily life, we finally allow ourselves to contemplate our own selves. Near Daisy's death we finally learn how Daisy has ached her whole life for a family, how akward she felt with even her second husband, the supposed love of her life.This was an extremely creative literary effort by the author. It really made me consider how much time we waste, and how little we know about the ones we truly love. We truly define ourselves and others by actions, rather than personalities, ideas, or feelings. The sense of disconnection between Daisy and the reader, however, would not induce me to read this novel again. It is what people believe and feel that makes them interesting characters. Like her children, readers never really know Daisy."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I have recently been devouring books on the subway during my commute every morning. Even the slowest books have caught and held my attention in that slightly surreal vacuum of time. As a result, I cannot speak to the complaint of so many reviewers: the dullness/slowness of the book. Truth be told, when reading during my commute, I rarely reflect on what I am reading, it is almost more like the book enters me. My reflecting came after I was finished, while I was reading the reviews here. And time and again, what fascinated me about the reviews was how the one star reviews seemed to catch the essence of the book for me. Nothing happened, reader after reader complained. I kept waiting, they say, but nothing happened. I didn't really get to know the charachters, they mentioned. These complaints about the book catch the emptiness of Daisy's life. She kept waiting, but nothing really happened. She never was able to grasp the core of who she was and neither could anyone else. And so she fealt alone. If I had read The Stone Diaries at a different time or place, I too might have been bored to tears. I remember the book Possession just about killed me. But I am so glad that I managed to avoid the boredom because the reward of The Stone Diaries was great. There was no life lesson. There was no climax. There was just the stylistically creative telling of a life. The Stone Diaries reminded me of how little we really know of those we love, and perhaps, how little most of us really know about ourselves when the frames that we normally stuff our life stories into are removed."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Using fictional family trees Carol Shields fully develops characters so real and rich that, with the help of some old photos, her tale belies itself as a biography. Convincingly real, the characters are born, live and die with time pulling at one's heartstrings, causing laughter to erupt from oneself and keeping one's eyes glued to the page for each event that could happen in daily life, expected and unexpected. Shield writes with a flowing stream of consciousness that parallels the flow of daily life. The sentences and paragraphs connect in such a way as to the minutes and hours of each day. The Stone Diaries is an easy read, so fluid and unpretentious. Following the life of one woman Carol Shields is able to form the settings, the time and the histories around her character in a seamless fashion. A good book for a sunny day, a train ride to a special place or in a favorite chair by the fireplace. Not an extraordinary book, just a solid fictional story with good feeling and a constant flow of intertwined stories around the life of one, interesting woman."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book spans the life of Daisy Goodwill, from her birth in Manitoba to her journey with her father to Indiana, throughout her years as a wife, mother, and widow. The novel opens dramatically with her birth in 1905, continuing with her childhood in 1916, her first marriage in 1927, then to raising her children in 1947, and to her career as a columnist from 1955-1964, and then to retirement in 1977. The family tree, photos, and letters add to the realism and the book feels biographical.Daisy is an ordinary woman, but she has a story worth telling. Her story is about the human condition and life's meanings. Shields writes with wit, intelligent, and great insight, weaving Daisy's simple life into a great tale about women and life's deeper meanings. You are left wanting more when the novel is done. Shields has captured the life of a woman who seems so complicated, and yet when read against the culture she lived in and with the insight we are given, she is complicated beyond being able to completely be sure we've got her character down."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries touched me so deeply that it is now my favorite book. It takes the life story of an &quot;ordinary&quot; woman and demonstrates the universality of us all as well as showing the uniqueness of our experiences. It touches on family and how well they know, or think they know, each other. To me, this book showed how precious each and every person is and how truly remarkable an ordinary life can be."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"What does it mean to be a woman?Shields explores this question in her book The Stone Diaries. The answer is complex, simple, enlightening, ignorant, thoughtful, thoughtless. We ultimately find that there is no simple answer. We love our roles as women, and we also despise sometimes the social burdens placed upon us.Life is sometimes very profound. And sometimes it is very meaningless. Very seldom does the narration of our lives, however, reflect the importance - or even accuracy - of who we really are.Does this make our lives any less signicant? Or perhaps there is significance in how we interpret our life, and how we struggle to make our life meaningful. Whether if falls short of what we consider the ideal, in the end, we learn, that the whole of our lives is the sum of its many, many parts.I give this book only 4 stars, because I have read Shield's other book Unless, which far surpasses this one. There were times when I was not quite sure where the book was going, and after a while I became irritated with the main character. And yet, I knowingly recognize this as a mirror reflection of how I perceive my own life.Very well done."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Carol Shields's stated goal in writing this book is to reveal commonplace \\"snapshots\\" from an ordinary life. Her particular interest is the \\"forgotten\\" North American woman whose \\"only\\" mark left on the world is felt by the immediate family members and friends who surround her in life. This book is about our grandmothers and our great-aunts, and it seeks both to rescue, in fictional form, such exemplary lives and to examine how the way a person remembers her own life is very different from the way others remember her.Presented in a form of a family album, complete with a genealogy and faux photographs of its characters, the book spans the twentieth century and chronicles the bizarre birth, mostly typical life, and quiet death of Daisy Goodwill Flett. Each decade is represented by a theme (for example, \\"work\\"--in this case, her career as a newspaper writer) or an unforgettable episode (the never-discussed event that made Daisy a widow the first time).Likewise, each chapter features a different style; for example, the chapter on Daisy's job is entirely epistolary, and the segment on Daisy's \\"mid-life crisis\\" is composed of speculations by her family and friends as to what caused the meltdown. Throughout, there are hints of the bizarre, some of which may--or may not--have been distorted through the prism of memory. Of course, that's true of any life: some incidents assume undue importance, major events are forgotten, and other events are embroidered beyond recognition.There's no doubt that \\"The Stone Diaries\\" is a bravura performance, and Shields is an observant and careful writer. I enjoyed the book immensely while I read it six weeks ago and I was surprisingly saddened at the end, yet I find myself struck by how little of it I remember now. Not unpredictably, what I do recall are the book's more fantastic elements (which some readers have aptly described as magic realism): the macabre birth scene, her father's obsession with building bizarre monuments out of stone, the father-in-law who lives to be the oldest man in England. But the bulk of Daisy's life is, well, a little too ordinary. Intentionally or not, then, Shields may have underscored why such folks are often overlooked--because their lives often have infinitely more meaning and importance for friends and relatives than for strangers and readers."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"From her tumultuous birth and the tragedy that accompanied it, Daisy Goodwill's life is told through these pages. From her childhood to her school life, to adulthood, Shields tells Daisy's story. At times the reader wonders where this is all going, and halfway through I was wondering if I was still going to finish. In the second half of the book events of happiness and cruel fate intertwine, and it feels very real. There were no tidy resolutions, especially when the inevitable creeping of old age brings forth new realities. The last several chapters of this book stayed with me for a long time, and made this one of the better books I have read in some time."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Written as an autobiography of Daisy Goodwill Flett, whose mother's death at the moment of Daisy's birth makes for the most gripping opening scene I've ever read, The Stone Diaries is superb from beginning to end. Just read those 20 or so pages, and you'll be hooked for the rest of the book.Carol Shields won the Pulitzer for this novel, a creative and highly original style of narrative that many others have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate. Stone Diaries wanders all the way through Daisy's rather extraordinary life, both her on-the-surface role as daughter, wife, and mother as well as her rich and vividly-described inner life. When you reluctantly come to the end, you'll probably sit back as I did, stare into space, and just sigh, \\"Wow...\\""},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The life of a woman, plain on the surface, complicated and layered underneath. The stages of Daisy Goodwill's life, the colorful characters in her life, and the reactions of those around Daisy make this more than a simple diary of one's life. It's filled with unexpected surprises and overwhelming heartache, as life usually is, and is quite funny at times also. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I just love Carol Shields, and this one did not disapppoint. It is a part of the world I know little of. I just loved the semi autobiographical tone, enhanced by the photos (even though I know it's fiction).The birth scene was wonderful, and reminded me of stories I imagine of my own ancestors in the Australian bush.Shields is a terrific writer, for those who like &quot;good literature&quot; but need an eclectic diet."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Every fiction writer must play the role of God. However most writers are subtle about it, silently leading the reader to his own (but also the writer's) conclusion. There is no subtlety in Miss Shields. She hits you over the head with her overly analytical philosophy, and even on some of the most mundane things. Her characters never flushed out as real, but rather paper dolls to look at. I will soon forget I ever read Stone Diaries, but I will never forget Miss Shields."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Carol Shields has written a book that is all of a piece; the book itself, held in the reader's hand, becomes a kind of artifact. The writing is never flashy, never self-promoting. The chapters of a woman's life go by in the way a life goes by, sometimes frozen in the darkest moments, plodding slowly in childhood, lost in the blur of duty and daily ritual in adulthood, and unbelievably irretrievable in old age. The premise of the book is so simple, and yet I have never read anything like it. An autobiography that is not. Wonderful."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"What a boring awful book. It stoned me into boredom. I hated it so much I wanted to cry. Can anyone really understand how this book won the PULITZER? Mother of all that is good, who was the final jury on awarding this book the PEW LIT ZER!!!? Is it possible to retract? I recommend Shields' novel _Swann_, which is a real testament to her prosaic nature and gift of storytelling. But oh man, this book SUCKED!! I only thank God that I bought it at a used store. Small miracles."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I don't mind complex, experimental books; I don't even particularly mind rather pretentious books.

There never was a worse book written. Never.&quot; During those dark times, you gullibly believe that. Then, turn around and there it is!!! A puff of smoke! Magic! Something comes along that's even worse. Such was the case with this novel. Boring, inexcusably long, overly complex, vulgar. To be very eloquent: BAD. Just plain BAD. BAD BOOK. BAD. Um, I didn't like it in case my point wasn't clear. (I'm a traitor to my country!)"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I liked the unique writing style Ms. Shields has used. I've never read anything like it. At various chapters of the book she switched from 1st person then to third; told the story by way of letters; and also told the story by describing each character's perceptions. Somehow, all these writing techniques flowed together nicely. Unfortunately, Daisy's life wasn't all that interesting. And because the chapters were divided by the different milestones of Daisy's life, I never felt as if I got to know any of the multitudes of characters on a level where I could emphathize/sympathize/ or even like them. Parts of the story were painfully slow, especially at the end where Ms. Shields chose to wax philosophical (zzzzzz). Okay, already. I get it. Daisy was quite a gal, too bad about her mum.Also, there were too many rock anaologies. To the point where it seemed forced. Ms. Shields is too good of a writer for that crap.I think it would have helped if the novel had more of a story to it and instead of all the well-written (but tedious) prose, how about some dialogue? How about some meat to the story?"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book was written in an unusual way. The beginning drew you into it and the ending chapters were great as you can relate to the characters in it and the sickness, death and feelings that are going on, but I felt that the in between chapters were somewhat repetitive. Each character repeated events that we already knew so I found it a bit wordy , repetitive and annoying. It's a book I would never have read if the library book group didn't assign it for our October meeting. I am glad that I read it. I'd give it a B- or C for a rating."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Readers react to this book across the spectrum; a consensus is elusive!Count me in the camp who loved it and believe its Pulitzer Prize well-deserved.Carol Shields was a gifted novelist who crafted art out of the most mundane of plots, and made this faux-biographical ordinary life a page-turner. The novel plays with storytelling style, voice, narrative form, and tone, arranged in themes that skip across time in Daisy Stone Goodwill's long and varied life.In The Stone Diaries, Shields creates characters as dimensional and idiosyncratic as real people, illuminates the inner life of the protagonist through all life stages, explores the tenuous balance of forming and maintaining relationships in a world where we are each ultimately unknowable to one another, and examines how we navigate the events of our life with what little power and free will we have while accepting (with a mixture of fury and resignation) the twists and turns of circumstance that are thrust upon us.The novel is a study of the Big Picture and innerspace, a reflection on our small moment in time, the acuteness of consciousness, the process of aging, and the ultimate realization that we are all special, unique mediocrities."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I picked up this well worn book at a used book sale somewhere, liking the summary on the back and curious about the Pulitzer Prize winning. I just finished the last page and walked away with a deep sense of loss and a tad bit of depression. Here is a story (beautifully presented) of a woman who never exactly felt she had found her place in the world although at different periods of her life she came close. She became what would be viewed by many standards as a successful mother, a moderately successful wife (of course debatable), a gardener deluxe, an enjoyed columnist, a cherished friend, and loved grandmother and aunt. And yet, she always felt from beginning to the end, through every phase of her life, the echo of being utterly alone in this world. Maybe to really \\"get\\" this book, you need to have passed through many of the phases of life. Those phases like separate rooms of a house, standing for childhood (with Clementine then father), young adulthood (Beans and Fraidy - college then Hoad), marriage/rearing children (Barker), middleage settling (column writing - feeling \\"worthy\\"?), then an unsettling (depression and where have I really been and where am I going?), then the slippery slide into loss of health and clear mindedness. And to never have heard the words \\"I love you, Daisy.\\" (Shudder) Maybe this isn't just the story of a woman living a rather unremarkable life, but the story of each one of us, just with different life events and responses. It's a book that will stick with me, maybe a bit too close for comfort."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"My initial interest in this novel was its Pulitzer Prize winning status. The family tree in the beginning of the novel motivated me to read the first page (I'm working on a family tree of my relatives as of this writing). The first page led me to the next and each page thereafter held my attention. Although the story never took off for me in a suspenseful or dramatic way, Shields managed to keep me interested in Daisy's life until the very end.Born from a Stone, into a life supported by stone, and ultimately returned to stone; so is the life of Daisy Goodwill Flett. From birth to death, Daisy lives the expected life of a North American woman during the first half of the twentieth century. The boldest decision Daisy makes in the novel is the decision to marry the man who acted as her uncle while she was being raised by the man and his mother. Now that's the kind of family dirt that could be the theme for a trashy daytime talk shows but Shields folds it into the story without much fan fare and with little shock effect (not unlike Daisy's life). For most of Daisy's life, events sort of happen to her and although her response to many of life's challenges are heroic in some aspects, she generally tends to live a life flat lined by responsibility for or to others until the death of her husband turns into an opportunity for her to start anew. Daisy's life as a working woman from 1955 to 1964 is the most vibrant and creatively rendered aspect of the novel. The author uses a series of letters to Daisy from various people to not only advance the story nine years but also to depict what life can be like when you are fully engaged with what brings you joy. When your life feels purposeful.The lesson that I take away from Daisy's life is to be careful not to let life happen to you like an accident. It's important to try to exert some influence where you can or the everyday omission of influence can form a life of regrets that are only recognizable in death. \\"The Stone Diaries\\" is an immensely introspective examination of the cycles of life. Even though the lives of the characters are without much spark or excitement, they are portrayed in a way that compels you to take notice and to care. Whether it's the superb writing, the sublime story or the subdued pace, the novel works well and was a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I just finished this book at noon today. It is my first Carol Shields book and I'll definitely read others. I was enthralled from the first to the last. I am stumped by other readers who found it boring or with under-developed characters. Never did I find it even close to that. I am 61 and my mother is 85 and in good health. As I neared the end, I began to see my mother in a different light. I think she probably has thoughts, as Daisy did, that possibly her life was very limited. To this day, she has never lived outside the town in California where she was born. I see her from a new perspective now; I'll be more patient with her repetitive comments,her obsessive interest in herself. I'm off to find another Shields book!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I bought this book after browsing the first page.Its writing style immediately appealed to me.Her use of language carries you forward on a crest with frequent dips of shattering insight.I loved the book's depiction of an individual's whole life and the choices she makes.Its a searingly honest portrait of one womans life and for me most telling of all were the final chapters on old age when the character's lack of self development becomes crushingly clear to her."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I so loved this book that I am reading it for, I think, the third time! Carol Shields has an unbelievable style of writing, which is gripping and smooth and easy to read, but intellectually stimulating and thought provoking. Most lives don't have amazing things happen in them, but wouldn't it be terribly sad if our lives weren't interesting in the ordinary, everyday things that happen to us? Daisy is an example of how an ordinary life can be extraordinary in its simpleness, and I can't wait to read the rest of Carol Shield's books."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I was disappointed in The Stone Diaries--especially after a really good start to the story (Daisy's birth and the descriptions of Mercy). I am a voracious reader and have a degree in English Lit. Although I thought that The Stone Diaries was well written, technically, and it was a readable story, it was forgettable. I finished the book last week, and the other day I was trying to remember what book I had just finished, and for the life of me, I couldn't remember. It's not the sad or mundane life of Daisy that left me unaffected...I think it was the difficulty to relate to the characters and the author's failure to make them sympathetic.I like historical novels with fact mixed with fiction. However, with the Stone Diaries, I was uncertain whether Daisy was a real person, and I was baffled by the photos.I will not run out and read any more of Carol Shields' books. I like to read novels that will make me look at life differently and help me to understand people better. The Stone Diaries was okay, but I can't imagine how it won the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Curiously, I have just been reading two books -- Russell Banks'THE DARLINGand Kazuo Ishiguro'sNEVER LET ME GO-- about clearly extraordinary women, whose stories nonetheless make one acutely aware of the preciousness of ordinary things in the lives of the rest of us that do not get written about. Conversely, Daisy Goodwill Flett, the protagonist in Carol Shields' THE STONE DIARIES, is just such an ordinary woman, but the wonder of this Pulitzer Prize book is to make one realize the extraordinary beauty and interest simply inherent in life itself.Seen from the outside, Daisy might be glimpsed, categorized, and dismissed as the mere occupant of one of a conventional sequence of roles: motherless child, young wife, busy mother, grieving widow . . . all the way to blue-haired Florida retiree. Indeed, Shields structures the book in chapters, ten or eleven years apart, with titles such as \\"Marriage\\", \\"Motherhood\\", and \\"Work\\", each of which presents just such a snapshot. The events in between are sometimes implied, sometimes left out altogether, but seldom narrated in detail. Nonetheless, Daisy's path between one milestone and another is not always predictable: after spending her early childhood as a virtual orphan, for example, she suddenly re-acquires a father at age 11; the marriage which is the subject of the chapter of the same name is quite a different from the one that gives rise to \\"Motherhood\\" almost two decades later.Other people also play a part in Daisy's life; sometimes they are even pulled in as narrators, offering a different view than she could see of herself. Shields is as sensitive to the surprising trajectories of many of these other lives as she is to Daisy's own. Her father Cuyler, for example, passes through several metamorphoses, first through religious conversion and later through business success, and Daisy's life is affected in consequence. Barker, her second husband, and Alice, her elder daughter, are each shown in many different phases of their lives, and always with sympathy and understanding. Shields' ability to see beyond the surface is shown right from the first pages, with her portrait of Daisy's mother, Mercy, a grossly overweight and woefully naive woman, who nonetheless brings glowing love to the heart of her almost inarticulate husband Cuyler. Characters who are dismissed at the time by everybody around them, such as the old Jewish peddler who finds Mercy on her kitchen floor dying in childbirth, or the teenage cyclist who inadvertently knocks down and kills Daisy's adopted mother, also change during the course of the book and find their own success.And then there is Carol Shields the author herself. At first, she seems to be virtually invisible. The writing is simple and direct, almost artless; one can hardly speak of an authorial voice or style. Indeed, there are many voices and many styles, ranging from straight narrative to letters, news clippings, testimonials from friends, even shopping lists and recipes. This seems hardly an autobiography, let alone a novel -- more like a family scrapbook. There are even eight pages of family photographs, placed exactly two-thirds of the way through the book, a master-stroke that brings the reader up short. For wait a minute, isn't this a work of fiction? One realizes that one has completely bought into the lives of Daisy and her family as a fictional entity, worked out with numerous ramifications, but living solely within the pages of the book. There is no sense that this is a thinly-disguised autobiography of the author, or even a memoir of some beloved relative. And yet these pictures must have come from somewhere. These people have stories of their own, relationships of their own, but they are not necessarily the stories and relationships that Shields draws around them. Besides expanding and brilliantly illuminating the truism that every picture tells a story, Shields also appears to be saying that truth (whatever that is) may lie neither in the outward appearance nor in the biographical facts, but in the way we choose to construct and retell the stories of our own lives.At the end of the book, when Alice is sitting beside her dying mother in a Florida nursing home, we have two simultaneous perspectives on Daisy's life. Neither is untrue, but neither is complete. The same pictures, the same facts, could have been interpreted with different meanings. At the end, we are left with various trivial inventories, familiar to anybody who has tidied away a parent's belongings after her death. Certainly her existence cannot be comprehended by a mere roster of addresses or a forgotten to-do list. And yet there is a real life behind even these, the life of a warm, breathing, limited, courageous, confused, loving, and ultimately lovable human being."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book took me a while to read as I was never really drawn in or enticed to keep reading it. Nonetheless I read on, enjoying the fine writing, and still certain that a climactic end was in store. Well it never really came, yet something more rewarding occurred that caught me by suprise. Upon finishing the book, I sat,closed my eyes, and relished in the thoughts this book provoked in me. Thoughts about life, its meaning, its purpose, how to approach it, thoughts of family, of friendships, of births and deaths, of work, of retirement, of illness, and of my own death. I was quite saddened by the book. The family and friends of Daisy knew so little about her really. She became, to them (and to me), this old lady who repeated herself, and led a self-denied life of wife and mother. How sad and I will never let that happen to me is what I thought. However, Daisy,herself, it seemed, never really thought much about what she might of missed, or what more life could have given her. She reminded me so much of my own grandmothers, who never really thought too much about what they didn't have. They didn't ponder on life's mysteries or their discontentments. They merely lived, not worrying about such trivialities, but rather took one thing at a time and took life at its face value. I believe that many younger generations today, as Daisy's family did, see this as a weakness, a meaningless life that never attained self-actualization. I'm not so sure about this. Who was really unhappier? Daisy or her children? Who seemed more content? Daisy or her ever divorcing, job-changing, scattered children? Very thought provoking. Read it and learn something about yourself,about life."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The protagonist is sappy. She cannot make a clean decision and when she does you no longer care. The writing was too experimental. It was hard to follow and awkward. The story is completely uninteresting. The title &quot;Stone Diary&quot; would've been better because it is essentially the lifestory of a rock. A woman who is boring, writing that is dull and gray, and hard to get through."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Admittedly, my interest ebbed and waned throughout this read. Just as I thought I \\"got\\" what the author intended, a new narrator would intervene and I'd be forced to revaluate the story. This, ironically, was the tension that kept me reading when I felt either lost or frustrated. I was determined to understand what Shield's was saying.Unlike many other reviewers here, the final two chapters were where I experienced my eureka (intended or otherwise by the author); where I found the story absolutely profound. Close to her death, Daisy finally considers the iconic female role-model she appears to be to others (that of wife-mother-God-fearing-martyr), the role that society has always rewarded her for---rewards that have come in words of praise----however condescending, and with financial comforts. But what was the cost? Threatened, now, with death, those rewards seem empty, unfulfilling, unmerited, and sometimes commically inane.On her death bed, she's self-aware enough to question her possible cowardice in accepting this role, this willingness of hers to let social mores and the vagaries of life sweep her along----self aware enough to indulge the few profound moments she's experienced, yet she still tempers her joy with habitual apology for putting her own needs first. This inner conflict between the woman everyone thinks she is and approves of, and the half-formed free spirit who struggles for a voice which would more aptly describe her (regardless of the age of her body), makes this novel Prize worthy.So yes, I FINALLY get why this is a breakthough feminist portrait. Shield's seems to be saying that women of Daisy's generation weren't OBLIVIOUS to their gilded cage at all, they were absolutely able to recognize both the benefits of the cage and its confines. They felt some pride in living up to the expectations of society, despite it's cheap rewards, even while they were capable of stepping outside of themselves and dreaming of greater things.The icing on the cake? Shield's structure. She allows various narrative voices to intervene to explain Daisy, to judge her, to praise her, to often jovially condescend to her shortcomings. Looking back, The Stone Diaries begins as a classic story of the heroine---born under exceptional circumstances (the author's promise of an exceptional life to come), but Shield's then breaks the rules and narrates a very unremarkable, unfulfilled, typical perhaps of its day, frustrated life.I am so glad I hunkered down and finished what I thought would turn out to be a real dissapointment."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book gives one an incredible insight into the human psyche. Existencial questions are asked and looked upon from various standpoints. I enjoyed this book almost as much as &quot;Indipendent people&quot; by Halldor Laxness! Now I have ordered all the other books by Carol Shields. She certainly is a skilled and wise author."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The book arrived as described. There was some problem with the book arriving on time, however the company made it right with me - so I am pleased."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Besides a three family/ three generational 1890s-1990s mid-amer-Canad. story, author Shields exposes you to lived experiences distorted and then remembered in later telling to make the case for false knowledge affecting those childrens lives.Yes Mercy, Catherine, Daisy, Magnus, Cuyler, Barker all are mismatched. Passion is not love. C.Shields tells a story of ordinary lives without any heroics ........that I found a page-turner. So, I think highly of this novel. If a male reader as I am, then this is a good insight into why some relationships fail-thru the eyes of a woman. Likey what was so 100 yrs. ago is still so today ...... even though male-female roles are more flexible now."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Please read this book. Every minute you spend reading this book will open your mind and heart into a real family, with and without warts. This book is simply perfect."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"It is strange how people can come across an author that writes in such an amazing way. I had never really heard of Carol Shields, and then I had to do a project in a class at school on a famous Canadian author, and she is the one that I randomly picked. After the project, I was curious as to what her books were like, and this is the one that I choose.It is a great book! It tells the life story of the main character, as if she was writing her autobiography. In this book, the author captures exactly what it was like for a woman growing up in todays, and the past, society. It is one of those books that can really show you that no one is perfect, and I am sure that a lot of people can relate to some of the problems that are overcome in this book. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"A book has to be really terrible for me not to finish it and I did get through it...barely. The writing was creative, but the story was just too nowhere and just strange for me. I didn't care about any of the characters...even Daisy. Not enough story, but a creative telling nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I've read this book twice in the past several years and enjoyed it the second time as much as the first. It records the life and thoughts of a fairly ordinary person from her (unusual) birth to her death.I loved the way the mood and the characters themselves change as the story proceeds. (Daisy's father is a gem.)Carol Shields' writing reminds me of Jane Hamilton's although the story lacks the drama and crises in Hamilton's."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is a fantastic book. For people who relate to theverities of life, this is it. The travails of DaisyGoodwill Flett and her family's generations is unfailinglyriveting. The opening scene is her birth, the closingscene her death. The interspersing of letters betweencharacters is endearing. The very citation of chaptertitles indicates our intimacy with this woman.A really good read."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"American writer Carol Shields (1935-2003) makes her point very clear in her award winning \\"The Stone Diaries\\". An ordinary live is not that ordinary when you look it in a microscope and when you give room for the others to comment this live. However much her novel is a good achievement, at some parts she makes a way to clear what she wants to prove -- these are the moments when the book loses it lyricism and becomes too preachy.\\"The Stone Diaries\\" is the mock-autobiography of Daisy Stone Goodwill, a woman whose mother dies giving birth and she is brought up by a neighbor and this neighbor's oldest son -- who, years later will become Daisy's second husband. Telling that is not a spoiler, since this marriage -- and all others -- can be figured out prior to start reading the novel in the family tree displayed in the first pages of the book.By this family tree, any attentive reader can realize all the connections that will come in Daisy's and her relative's lives. On the one hand this diagram helps the reading, but on the other it is a lot of anticipation that is never matched by the narrative. We can discover that Daisy's son Warren marries three times, but we don't know anything about their marriages or divorces. The point for each reader is how much he/she cares to learn about the other characters if not Daisy.Since it is a so-called biography the focus is Daisy herself, therefore the other conflicts and characters aren't exploited in a very deep way. Most biographies we find hare thick, and since Shields accepted to play the game, she should have gone deeper in Daisy's life and times. Many things are briefly touched upon, when they could have been exploited for pages and pages.The alternation between narrative in first and third person is a curious device. It could be the charm of the novel, but sometimes the narrator switching only makes the narrative to loose its focus. It is curious that the first chapter in the only one entirely narrated in the first person and deals with facts that Daisy neither was there to know, nor could remember. That is the thin red line between fact and fiction in the protagonist's life. Since she is telling what she saw she is a biased narrator and all the portraits can't be claimed as realistic and fair. This is not a defect of the novel, just an option the writer made.While Shields tries to bring up the magic and beauty of a common -- why not say ordinary life -- she succeeds in many levels. Her prose is beautiful most of the time as well. Her book is great in the moments the writer is not trying to hard, but on the other hand when she wants to be too lyric and to touch the magic realism she overdoes her prose and sits on the fence between magic and grotesque."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book is one of the most boring books I've ever read. There are enough ramblings for Mars and back. Carol Shields is a very good writer, but the underlying pretensions makes the book just another romantic potboiler. If you're interested in books about generations of families, read Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"It wasn't the best book in the world and it wasn't the worst, but it kept my attention as a book on tape while I filed papers at work. The one thing I didn't understand was that at the begining of the book, Daisy was speaking in first person. After that, the narrator refered to Daisy in 3rd person.

It was one of the most complete presentations of a life that I've found in fiction. Daisy Goodwill is approached/presented from a variety of points of view, including a look at her trousseau, a rummage through a trunk of accumulated belongings, and a presentation of &quot;theories&quot; offered by friends and family to explain her behavior at certain periods of her life.

Everyone has ups and downs in their life, but not everyone experiences something extremely dramatic. One of the themes in Daisy Goodwill's story is that we ALL have a story to tell about our lives, even if we didn't become a hero in the world's eyes. This book is definitely one that is not too intense or difficult to understand, so if you'd like to relax with a touching story about life, give The Stone Diaries some consideration!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"At first I had trouble navigating this book, having just finished Angela's Ashes, a work that leaves you with the author's breath still warm in your ear. The Stone Diaries by contrast seemed distant, as if I were looking through the wrong end of the binoculars. My final sense is of an impressive piece of craftmanship, one that experiments with voice and perspective in a big way, which employs symbolism, irony and characterization in workmanlike fashion. As for that first impression--distance--it plays out the theme of knowing the self and others. The writer took a lot of risks here and for the most part, they pay off. It's nice to see risk-taking in an era of what Tom Wolfe once termed &quot;anesthetic&quot; fiction."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"While I understand why people who loved this book did love it, I admit that I closed the book feeling sort of puzzled. I knew exactly what I was getting into, and did not expect a heart-stopping pageturned, but I did expect a narrator who had some understand of her own life. The author continually reminds you that Daisy does not understand, and does not consider herself to be in control of, her own life, and I found this puzzling and mildly depressing. However, it was also thought-provoking to realize that I felt I could see Daisy much more clearly through the eyes of the other characters than through her own insight, which perhaps is the author's whole point. I would recommend this as an interesting, mull-it-over kind of book, but I didn't find it uplifting, except perhaps as a cautionary tale: it made me more resolved to be in charge of, and aware of, my own life. Maybe that's not such a small thing."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries is a book that seemed wonderfully well-written and engrossing at first.

Everwondered who she really is, or who she was before she metyour dad? The Stone Diaries is a magnificent foray intofour generations of families spawned by the union of MercyStone--a quiet, heavy woman who, abandoned at birth, wouldnot live to name her only child--and Cuyler Goodwill, a youngquarry laborer who discovers in Mercy a love so profoundthat his life is touched forever.Cuyler and Mercy's daughter, Daisy Goodwill, becomes thefocus of author Carol Shield's intense probe into therelationships between mothers and daughters, husbands andwives, friends and relatives. Shields' seamless transitionsbetween narrators--and between time, reality and the inexplicablemusings of the mind--subtly give us permission to considerthese relationships from our own perspective, and, in sodoing, to bring this extended family to life.In The Stone Diaries, Carol Shields has revealed a level ofcomfort with the written word that is all too rare in today'sfiction. Her treatment of life's rewards as well as itsinjustices does not stop short of a full, honest examinationof the truth. We aren't told of Cuyler's heart attack;instead, our limbs stiffen and freeze with his. We don'twatch Daisy's husband love her; rather, we feel both theweight of his body and the depth of her unspoken despair.I closed The Stone Diaries today with a sigh. I wondered what my mother must have beenlike before there was me. What does she still want out oflife? Does she know what she means to me? Perhaps...perhaps I ought to ask."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is a fictitious autobiography of Daisy Stone Goodwill, born at the beginning of the 20th century and living until the late 90's. I really must be becoming terribly thick as I can't (except for the fluid writing style) think why this book would win a Pulitzer Prize (1995) The lady in question went through her rather ordinary life, raising children, coping with a marriage which, like most, had its ups and downs, and generally just taking one day at a time, one event at a time, without questioning or wondering if that's all there is. I know that when I'm starting to find a book tedious, I tend to rush through it..perhaps that was my mistake, but why linger when nothing's happening..life's too short!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"From the moment that I stepped inside the world in this book, I could understand why it received the Pulitzer prize. I stepped right into Mercy Goodwell's kitchen and couldn't wait for her Malvern pudding to be done so that I could try it. I wanted to be one of the tourists looking at the tower that newly wed Cuyley Goodwill built to memorialize his wife. I wanted to touch the intricately and lovingly carved pictures and words on the stones of the tower.THE STONE DIARIES is the story of the life of Daisy Goodwill. The first chapter is told in first-person in Daisy's own words. But the rest of the story (although told in third-person) seems to be written by her as well. Every person in the life of Daisy Goodwell is three-dimensional; you can almost reach out and touch them. Daisy, however, is the very person that she dreads becoming -- a person remembered for what happened TO her rather than WHO she is. The explanation would go something like this: \\"Daisy Goodwell? You remember her. Don't you? She's the one who's mother didn't know she was pregnant and died in childbirth. And her first husband was tragically killed on their honeymoon.\\" Upon finishing the book, you feel that you know ABOUT Daisy, but you really don't seem to know HER. The author has been so kind as to supply black and white photographs of all the other characters in the book. But where's Daisy? Is she the person on the front cover?You can tell from the table of contents that this is going to be the story of the life -- from birth to death -- of Daisy Goodwell. Carol Shields shows her genius, however, by making the main character disappear from her own life story! And that Is the plot: the life of Daisy Goodwell and her absence therein. I read this book over the course of one day. It was extremely satisfying. I look forward to reading more books by this author."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"If read as a typical novel telling the story of the life of Daisy Goodwill from the perspective of all of the interesting things that happened to her, the reader is bound to be disappointed; after all, Daisy was pretty disappointed too. But that is the point; Daisy's life happens to her rather than she creating it. In telling us Daisy's story, Shields has told us much about ourselves and makes a strong argument for changing how we live.No, this isn't written as a conventional novel and can't be read as one. Much of the time it is not even clear who is talking and the picture of Daisy's life we get is unclear as though seen through gauze with a few holes in it. Personally, I thought the experiment worked but even more, I loved the trip even if it was very disturbing."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"What on earth were the Pulitzer prize folks thinking?

There was nothing to grab your attention, no good beginning, climax, ending. However, this author has a way with words that kept me reading...it wasn't the story that kept my interest, it was her words.

It was difficult to understand the Pulitzer Prize, especially compared to other winners. It tells the life of an ordinary woman (a strong woman, but not special), and is written well enough to be read with pleasure and without stumbling, but there is nothing to it.

It provokes some reflective thinking on relationships and the meaning of life.Sometimes it makes one think that life is like a series of boxes. We close one box of our lives and open an entirerly new one and continue on until the last box. Some boxes contain happiness and some do not.Did we get a chance to choose that box? How was it delegated to us with either misery or delight? Could we have avoided the painful box and chosen another if we had been more diligent in our actions and choices? From her birth to her death, Daisy Goodwell struggled to understand her journey through life.Some of us think we exert some control but I doubt if Daisy felt she had any control and she merely accepted her fate."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"It seems strange to be discovering a Pulitzer Prizewinning writer, born five years before me, only seven years after her death. But I'm glad I did. Daisy Goodwill's birth and childhood, in a quarry-town in western Canada, are respectively singular and meager. A fatal accident on her honeymoon saves her from what promises to be a disasterous first marriage, while her second marriage is both fated and fortunate. Once comfortably lodged in the upper middle class, she has a not-too-eventful midlife, which Shields's varied sylistic approaches keep consistently interesting. Daisy's last years, however, are both typical and grim.I can't help surmising that Daisy bears some relationship to Shields's own mother, but in any case after a rocky start she lives a life not uncommon for middle class women born at the beginning of the 20th century, when women worked only if they had to. Daisy's most fulfilling decade was when she wrote a weekly garden column for the Bloomington, Indiana newspaper under the name of \\"Mrs. Green Thumb.\\" The recogniton she received for her expertise as a gardener gave her a sense of self-worth that otherwise eluded her. She was from hard-working stock, and needed meaningful work to feel fulfilled.The author has set herself the task of showing how extraordinary an \\"ordinary\\" woman of her mother's generation could be, but she does not abandon her heroine at some suitable climax, but continues onward to old age and death, which are a distinct anti-climax, as Daisy subsides in the nursing home into memories and regrets about missed opportunities and roads not taken. One lesson I take from this ending is how much better off Shields's generation of women is in comparison to her mother's. Like Shields herself, Daisy's oldest child, Alice, is a successful academic and writer,though not necessarily any happier than her mother.I wish I could find and include the summary of my own mother's life that I wrote at the time of her death at 101 years of age. She was born two years before Daisy, but into more fortunate circumstances as the daughter of a lawyer, and she earned a Master's degree at MIT, worked all her life as a teacher, public health official, and once again an elementary school teacher, the work she excelled at and loved the best. She married a man she considered brilliant and handsome, put him through college and graduate school, had one child (she wanted two) lived abroad several times in Europe and Mexico, was a serious amateur painter a dozen of whose canvasses are still hanging in the assisted living establishment to which she moved from her apartment at the age of ninty-three, and was still happy to be alive at 101, going for the longevity record.She had more fulfillment in her life than Daisy Goodwill, but she had a good head-start, and was considerably more energetic and self-reliant. So much depends on the start we get in life - not only the externals of sufficient income and a solid family upbringing, but also the inner story of who loves us and who we love, and how these loves are expressed. Despite the dire circumstances into which Daisy was born, she found people to love and care for her, a husband who adored her, three healthy children, material security in her adult life, and some, if not enough, fulfilling work. She deserved a better memorial than her distracted children, preoccupied with their own troubles, were able to provide. Perhaps Shields already knew that she was fighting cancer when she wrote this bitter ending. I think Daisy - or anyone - deserves better. But that may be exactly the author's point."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Daisy Goodwill didn't begin her life in the best of circumstances. As she was born her mother was dying, not even having realized she'd been pregnant until she was about to give birth. The theme of unawareness runs throughout Carol Shields' award-winning novel as she shows us scenes from Daisy's long life. Throughout the novel, Daisy is analyzed by family, friends, and Daisy herself as she tries to come to terms with events and understand the woman she's become.What I loved most about this book was Shields' intricate structure and her superb use of language. The first part of the story is told in present tense from multiple viewpoints, and one of them is Daisy's just before her birth; a strategy that worked well. The change from present to third tense distanced me from characters, though, and especially Daisy, but I think this was the author's purpose.THE STONE DIARIES' back cover describes this as \\"a truly sensuous novel...\\" Not in my opinion, but then \\"sensuous\\" is open to interpretation. Shields chose to portray the more mundane aspects of Daisy's life while leaving the big events--romance, marriage, and the birth of her children--in the background. I wish I could have read about some of the larger events because, though I truly enjoyed the novel, I didn't really know Daisy and others that well. In many respects, though, Daisy had the same issue which, as I mentioned, is pretty much the point."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Carol Shields was awarded both the O.C. (Officer of the Order of Canada) and the C.C. (Companion of the Order of Canada) before her death. Despite being born an American citizen, she lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Victoria, British Columbia in the Dominion known as Canada. I love Canada and this book is a wonderful legacy of a great writer and author who brought alive characters like Daisy, Cuyler, Mercy, Mrs. Flett, Barker, and others without so much flash. They are quite ordinary characters in an ordinary story but the storytelling is extraordinary because the author really allows us to become enthralled with Daisy's life in Canada and in America. It's an easy book once you get into it and you feel like these characters are very real. There is a family tree and pictures in the copies that I have."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"A very able, deft, sensitive writer, whose substance kind of peters out as the book progresses. The first section -- birth, background, mother's death -- is brilliant, outstanding, but there's a gradual decline thereafter as the book chases for meaning. One reviewer describes Shields as having begun as a miniaturist, and her impact doesn't quite hold together as the canvas grows. But the book is well worth reading, if only for that beginning."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is supposedly the life story of Daisy Stone Goodwill, a fictional character stretching on from her birth to her death, more then 80 years later. Daisy is a fictional character but this detail is forgotten as the story unfolds due to the richness of minor details describing her life.I am not sure however that in the end, I really know Daisy. I mean, I do know all about her life, how many kids, where she lived and what she did but I am not sure I know what she really thought. Did she love her kids? Her husband? What did she think of them and of her function in their lives? Of her life?In a way this story reminds me of the way we talk about other people. We give out all the information there is about other people and make out our own theories, but do we really know them? One of my favorite parts of the story therefore was the part where close people are trying to theorize why Daisy is in a bad mood. They each have a theory, which can tell you more about them and their place in the world, and somehow with all the theories you reach your own conclusions about Daisy. But you never get the real truth from Daisy herself (or maybe there isn't one truth?).The book is not an easy read. The writing is special and beautiful and the writer moves through different writing styles. It is both the problem and the quality of this writing that it sometimes goes into excessive details. It is truly the writing that is the essence of this book and not necessarily the story itself.When I first started to read this book (I read it for quite a while. This is not a book I could read in &quot;one sitting&quot;) I felt that I would never be able to go past the first chapter. It was so long and so very detailed! It took me a while to really get into this book and surprisingly I was more interested in Daisy's old age period. I wanted to know how she anticipated death or what she thought about the nearing end but I am not sure I got all the answers, just that she stayed loyal to herself and to her efforts, those that she had all her life, to be sweet and not to trouble anyone. .Daisy is no great person - not in her eyes and not in the writer or readers eyes. This is why I found this story interesting. She is just like the reader, having an everyday life, very close to your own. Someone you can really identify with. The book brings on many philosophical questions and thoughts - such as are we all victims of the circumstances? How can we control our lives? When I think about Daisy's life I think that the one decision she really made for herself in whom she shaped her own destiny was when she decided to go to the trip to Canada.However, was that really her choice? It seemed somehow like something very predictable. It is scary to think that this says something about our own life too... and how predictable they are.Bottom line: this is not a book I will read again. Its power was mainly the beauty of the writing and the thoughts it evokes. However you are left with a sad feeling of waste - long life passes on without really leaving a mark."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"How can one define a life lived? If we had a chance to have our life story written, and then told through the eyes of those who were closest to us, what would they say about us, and more interestingly, how accurate would they be in truly understanding the inner nuances that make each of us tick?In &quot;The Stone Diaries,&quot; Carol Shields attempts to chronicle the life of Daisy Goodwill. It is a life first told through the eyes of Daisy, and then through the eyes of those who presumably knew her best: her friends, children and relatives.What is extraordinary about this book, is that one can look at a life lived in so many ways. Was Daisy Goodwill's life uneventful, lacking the excitement and freedom of her more worldly friends? Or was it a full, rich life? Only the reader can make this determination. But what is fascinating about &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; is how the determination of the value of Daisy's life is so different, depending on the perspective that is taken. How much do we really know those people who we love the most? How well do we really know each other? I found this book to be a fascinating read, particularly for women who are living their life in full; however unfascinating and uneventful that may seem."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Carol Shields The Stone Diaries [Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award 1995] is the story of Daisy Stone Goodwill, a Canadian woman whose mother died in childbirth, was raised by her neighbor's relatives, was widowed twice (the first time on her honeymoon), raised children, worked in a job she loved until she was fired, moved to Florida, and died. Daisy is, in one sense, an absolutely &quot;ordinary&quot; woman, who lives much of her life in the shadow of men. I think that it was for this reason, and the fact that she ends her life separated from her children, that my wife (and other women I know who have read this book) found the novel very depressing. I was not so struck. What came across to me was Daisy's resilience in the face of very difficult circumstances, finding some satisfaction on the world's terms. Undeniably, Daisy was not a &quot;success&quot; as we now view women's lives. However, she formed some successful relationships, and always seemed to put the pieces together to move from one part of her life to the next. The best example of this for me was her Florida bridge group, &quot;The Flowers&quot; (Daisy, Lilly, Myrtle and Glad), who became her final community after she was long widowed, and her childhood friends dead. One can regret that life has brought her to this final community, a circle of old widows in a retirement home, or note how Daisy stays on her feet and moving, from one chapter of life to the end.One cannot read The Stone Diaries without being struck by the style -- or rather styles -- in which it is written. While clearly fiction, Shields gives the appearance of journalism by including photographs purporting to be of the various characters. The photographs give one pause -- am I reading a novel trying to be non-fiction, or a fictionalized &quot;real life&quot; biography? Shields also changes style, form, and voice as she goes from chapter to chapter. For example, the chapter captioned &quot;work&quot; takes the form of a series of letters by and about Daisy's work as a newspaper writer. There is no &quot;narrator&quot; or chronicler; the story is told by one letter following the next. The chapter &quot;Sorrow&quot; takes the form of first-person opinions, by various persons in Daisy's life, as to why she is depressed. Again, Shields has no omniscient narrator. Other chapters are told by the more conventional, omniscient third-person narrator.I found this a wonderful book, and recommend it highly. My wife, Carol, disagrees: &quot;I wouldn't say that this is a &quot;bad&quot; book and not worth reading. It just seems to capture in a very stark way the extreme ordinariness of the lives of so many women. Admittedly, not all women are destined to great things, but somehow, even the most mundane of us--provided we have a jot of self awareness--hope (and pray) that our lives have some deeper meaning and that somehow our being alive has made a positive difference. Upon reflection, may be that's what this book is about. But I can't say that I finished it with the impression that the life of Daisy Stone was really that important in the grand scheme of things. For a reader whose life isn't really any more exciting than Daisy's--that was a frightening and frankly unpleasant conclusion.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"It's sad when it takes the death of an author to bring her work to my attention. Carol Shields recent passing, and the accolades by some of my favorite authors about her writing inspired me to select one book of hers to read. Fortunately, I picked the Stone Diaries, and simply could not put it down until the last memorable word.Shields picks the most unlikely person to feature in a fictional book, Daisy Stone, whose life is mundane if not predictable. After an incredible birth and beginning, we travel with her through different years of her life, somewhat seemingly picked randomly. As we read each chapter, and witness the unveiling of her life, we begin to appreciate and realize that Daisy's life isn't extraordinary, but plain and common.What is extraordinary is that Shields chooses to give a character like Daisy this incredible voice. Underrepresented in literature, women like these exist, they exist yesterday and will exist tomorrow. Sure, they have moments of brightness in their lives, in which we see in Daisy, but it never goes over the top.What amazed me about this book was Shields extremely fluid writing style allows you to flow through this story as if it were unfolding before your very eyes. She allows different characters to pick up the story line, and share their viewpoints. Sometimes we hear Daisy, sometimes we hear a third person narrator. Sometimes we aren't even privy to who is speaking. Shields takes amazing leaps in her writing, trusting her reader to make those connections.I'm saddened by the loss of Carol Shields, but gladdened to know that she's left gifts of literature to discover. In the meantime, if you want a broad, amazing story, pick up Stone Diaries."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Several years ago, one of my professors recommended that I read The Stone Diaries. I finally got around to reading it last summer. From the first page, I was struck by the beautiful, evocative, almost tangible writing. Carol Shields creates distinct images with her words--I can still see Mercy in her kitchen the day Daisy was born. But the true beauty of the novel is its exploration of the role of the fiction writer. Carol Shields' novel, with its combination of autobiographical and fictive elements, becomes an important study of the way any fiction writer writes. Every writer uses elements of her or his own life, yet every writer also uses &quot;artistic license&quot; in order to add depth and continuity to the story--even the person writing an autobiography. Like Joseph Conrad in Heart of Darkness, Carol Shields, by relating Daisy's &quot;autobiography&quot; from birth to death, is forcing us to look at the role of the story-teller. Although Daisy is present at all the events in the novel, she isn't witness to them in the way the author describes the scenes. But Daisy possesses an imagination, and, like a writer, she creates these moments. Really, she is rewriting her life, much like any successful fiction author rewrites a life into a book. And are these fictive elements any less important than the autobiographical elements? When The Stone Diaries is declared an autobiography, readers want truth, veracity, realism. But the life Daisy imagines for herself is as real as any &quot;true&quot; life she would relate to the audience. An exploration of the whole of a person's life--birth to death, hard facts to imagined ones--The Stone Diaries is by far the most stunning book I have read this year. If you would like to read a beautiful display of the process of the written word and the process of one's life, read this book."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Just because a book has won a Pulitzer (like this one) is no guarantee that I'll like it. In fact, I often steer clear of books that have won major awards; it seems that they rarely live up to the hype.The Stone Diaries is an exception. THis book is worth reading just to experience Shields' prose style. Her voice is like no one else's: incredibly self-assured and intelligent without ever seeming pretentious. She uses words many writers have probably never even heard of (keep your dictionary handy) while managing to keep her work lively and readable.This is &quot;experimental&quot; fiction (another thing I usually avoid, but again, The Stone Diaries is an exception). At first, the novel seems to have a conventional plot, but as you read, you'll find your expectations are constantly subverted-- one of the great pleasures of this book. In the end, you'll find the book has challenged more than your views about fiction. You may find yourself questioning much deeper beliefs, perhaps asking, along with the protagonist, Daisy Goodwill: &quot;What is the story of a life?&quot;.Like all great novels, this one deals in existential topics. What is life really about? Why are we here? What does an individual life --that seemingly random sequence of events-- really amount to? And, like the masterpiece it is, this book will disturb your mind with questions, without offering easy answers.If you're looking for a quick read at the airport or the beauty salon, this is not the book for you. But if you appreciate exquisite writing that makes you ponder deeper truths, try the Stone Diaries."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I made a huge mistake when I was reading this novel. I dismissed it because of the simple vernacular Shields employed. After all, it is a diary about a very ordinary woman who tells her story in a very structured manner: Birth, Marriage, Love, Sorrow etc..Daisy Goodwill lived a life demarcated by these significant events. Given a chance to tell her story, most women would adopt this familiar structure. The punchline that Shields is able to deliver so unobtrusively is that in hindsight, all these women, like the wonderful Daisy, will wonder whether she had existed at all, to have touched earth, and transform it beyond her very mortal and very chronologically ordered life.Half-way through this novel, I started to recognise Shields' cunning brilliance. She has created this intricate fictional biography that includes photos of the fictional characters (some she lifted from her real family, with permission). Despite these details, Daisy seems to have disappeared from the narrative, even though she is officially the narrator. Much of what we know about Daisy are from newspaper clippings (announcements of marriage, deaths), letters of correspondence or perspectives given by her children and close friends, but Daisy, she never truly fades as we wondered whether she existed at all. Daisy is an intangible woman who is trying to make herself real by telling her story but is defeated at the end. Shields' brilliance as a writer is that she is able to occlude the narrator from us while we are reading her life story.All through it, I had assumed that Daisy Goodwill's autobiography was called Stone Diaries because her mother was called Mercy Stone. There is a section in the novel that tells the building of a monument, a memorial built in grief for a beloved, that is made up of stones, but without any cement. It is created to rest upon itself and to hold itself together without adhesion. This is a monument of Daisy's life - built from fragments but with structural and emotional gaps in the narrative. We are never really privy of Daisy's inner life, this character does not adhere to our memories as she never really comes to life.I read this novel when my grandmother fell into a deep depression. She went to bed and relinquished herself to sorrow. She reminded me of Daisy's section on sorrow. I realised then that I didn't really know my grandmother and that the source of her sadness will only be speculation to us. Finally, I wondered whether she felt like Daisy and so many women of her generation (and even mine) - that she has disappeared from her own life, her own story. Perhaps that is why she is grieving.I recommend this novel because it is a fantastic study in writing. We often get fooled by aesthetic. That is, to write a critically acclaimed novel, one must have an epic scope and a mastery of poetry. Misconceptions! Shields is a fine example of how to say something profound by articulating it with simplicity. She is a philosopher-writer, an everywoman, and my admiration of her writing grows with every novel."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is the best contemporary novel that I have read in years. Many of those who indicate here that they did not enjoy The Stone Diaries are critical of what they perceive as the author's failure to thoroughly explore the protagonist's character and the greater meaning behind her life and death. To the contrary, the brilliance of this novel lies precisely in Shields' insistence on telling the truest story she can imagine, a story unencumbered by traditional literary devices such as fate and redemption, a story of the unsatisfying life of a most devastatingly unremarkable woman. With stunning detail and profoundly emotional deliberation, Shields delves into a very basic yet disturbingly unsatisfying aspect of human experience: that often in life, love goes unfelt or unexpressed, meaning is elusive and resolution is not achieved."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Carol Shields does an excellent job of unlocking the mind, heart, and soul of the female with her book \\"The Stone Diaries.\\" I believe that every woman will be able to relate to a character in the novel at least once. Shields focuses on the milestones of life (birth, childhood, love, marriage, motherhood, and death) and dissects them wonderfully.In an amazingly accurate portrayal of the culture of the mid to late 1900s, Carol Shields takes you on an incredible journey of the life of Daisy Goodwill Flett, even allowing us the luxury of seeing her through the eyes of not only herself, but those around her. Her heartbreaking birth, contemporary childhood, tragic love life, typical \\"retirement,\\" and uncertain death takes you on a constant roller coaster ride. It keeps you reading to see exactly how the next part of her life will unfold.A truly believable story line and plot, complete with a family tree and pictures, made me very aware of the Stone legacy. I had to remind myself it was actually fiction. It successfully travels through four generations of women, each strugling with their own image, children, husbands, and life, facing obstacles of that time. It is a complete family history, and true to it's name, a \\"diary\\" following Mercy Stone Goodwill, her daughter (Daisy Goodwill Flett), granddaughters (Joan and Anne), and even the birth of her great grandchildren.Although, I will admit that there are certain parts of the book that are questionable (like her adventures with Fraidy and Beans), ironic (such as her entire love life), and just plain laughable (the Flower Girls, for example), it was a good read overall. Something that must have taken time, patience, thought, and insight on the part of the author. I recommend it to anyone wanting to take a look inside a woman."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries by Carol Shields Vintage Books 1993Carol Shields has won several prizes for this book including the Governors General's Award for Fiction in 1993. This beautifully written story follows Daisy Goodwill throughout her life, her birth, her marriages, her death. It is a simple story but filled with wonderful characters who lead complex but mostly unfulfilled lives. Daisy's mother dies within minutes of her birth and while this fact is never faced directly by Daisy, it seems to be an essential aspect of her longing for fulfillment. Each member of the four generations of Daisy's family is treated with compassion and sensitivity. Even her spiteful and miserly father-in-law, Magnus Flett, manages to redeem himself by living to be115 years old and memorizing the whole of Jayne Ayre.Men do not come of well in this story but then neither do the women. A major theme throughout the story is the conflict between interior life and exterior life. The often rich interior life is never quite matched by reality and prevents any real happiness from bursting through the plodding heavy duty of their lives. In the end, sorting through Daisy's possessions we see the inconsequential nature of most of what we bring with us.The book is filled with beautiful language and striking images. I enjoyed the book immensely."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"If one were to rate this book for its imaginative usages of stone-based imagery, metaphors, similes, and geography, this book would be clearly a five-star effort. If a reader is looking for an imaginative variety of writing styles all in one book, this is also a five-star effort, using wonderfully easy phrases. On the other hand, if you want to feel deeply connected to a story and its characters, this may not the book for you.The book's format is a pseudo-biography of a Canadian woman told through a series of vignettes about her life. These start with her birth in 1905, continue with her childhood in 1916, describe her first marriage in 1927, falling in love at 31 in 1936, raising her children in 1947, pursuing a career as a gardening columnist from 1955-1964, experiencing a set-back in 1965, living into retirement in 1977, having health reversals in 1985, and eventually passing on. The book comes equipped with a family tree and family photographs to complete the biographical feel.You can think of this book also like a series of short stories. In fact, many will enjoy the book more that way than as a fictionalized biography. For example, the birth is very compelling. The section about her writing career is quite amusing and fun to read as you follow through a series of letters.As much as I loved the stone references, to me they turned the book into self-satire so much at times that it created too much emotional distance from the book. If the references had been cut back by about 60 percent, I think they would have been brilliant. As it was, I was looking for one such reference on every page (almost like Where's Waldo?) and would break out into giggles when I found the next one even if the material was supposed to be sad.Toward the book's end, the references abated but the story still didn't move me. Perhaps it was just that the writer's craft was so well done that its sparkling jewels outshone the content of the story by too wide a margin. There was a similar gap between the story (often far-fetched well beyond kidding around) and the characters, with the story being more interesting than the characters. Even though you often get internal dialogue, the book remains like something that you are watching from a disinterested distance rather than living within and feeling connected to.My great grandmother, Edith Foster, was a lot like Daisy, and also was born in rural, central Canada. She lived until I was about 19, and I well remember her stories about life on the plains of Canada and immigrating to the United States. The Stone Diaries, even with its exaggerated elements, seemed pale compared to the real challenges of those days . . . which this book often omits.The best part of Daisy's development as a character is the evolution of her confusion of fact and fantasy. At several points, you will feel like you can no longer trust your own mind and have a good sense of what that situation must be like. Nicely done!After you enjoy the aspects of The Stone Diaries that appeal to you, I suggest that you assemble a brief autobiography that you can share with your children and grandchildren. They will probably enjoy the kinds of details this book focuses on, because they will reflect on their own origins in compelling ways.See the past and present clearly!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is a beautifully written book.

The protagonist in this novel is also an omnipotent narrator which makes for an intriguing storytelling when used consistently but the early mix of first person and third person gets muddied in the middle.There's a documentarian quality to the novel which I thoroughly enjoyed but there's a serious lack of extrapolation in the characters that Shields has created. There was a certain kind of mediocrity in these peoples' lives disguised and dressed up to be moderately individualistic.This book was a disappointment. I prefer characters that are more flawed, more complex, and not so polished with a moralistic rag. &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; offered up some of these elements but it was as though Shields didn't want to trouble the reader with chewable characterization but instead how these characters &quot;suffer&quot; through their tedious &quot;lives.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Modern 20th-century fiction hosts an array of unforgettable characters. The Stone Diaries cannot be included in the list, unfortunately. The novel never succeeds in infusing any life into the protagonist, Daily Goodwill Flett, a woman with an unlucky birth and whose final unspoken words are: \\"I am not in peace.\\" This novel did not merit the Pulitzer prize for literature in 1995. Sadly, it lacks mojo. I imagine that the judges were either desperate for a winner that year or half-asleep when they cast their votes after a heavy, carbohydrate-laden lunch.Stone imagery is tritely overworked throughout the narrative. Daisy's portrait, in fact, resembles that of a small gray stone of no particular distinction -- the type of stone one might throw into a still pond just to see the ripples, if nothing else. Is she notable or memorable in any way? She is about as interesting as a frozen Canadian prairie. And yet the author, Carol Shields, devoted 269 fruitless pages in an attempt to convince herself that Daisy's life was worth telling, and she leaves no stone unturned. This sad narrative begins with the moment Daisy's grossly obese and ignorant mother, Mercy Stone (hint, hint - heavy) Goodwill, discovers that she is in the midst of childbirth (!) while making a Malvern pudding in a hot Manitoba kitchen. (The book even needs a long introduction by Penelope Lively --whoever she is -- who feels obliged to inform the reader that there is significance in the references to hot kitchens interspersed throughout the story. I have yet to find anything symbolic about a hot kitchen other than the old adage: \\"If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.\\") And Mercy Stone Goodwill gets out of the kitchen and out of the story mercifully and melodramatically. She dies in childbirth as a result of eclampsia, a serious disorder that results in convulsions and coma; yet, prior to her sudden death, she displays no pathological symptoms other than obesity, a desire to keep a neat house, and a propensity for calorie-laden pastries. After making a bloody mess of things, she ruins her husband's dinner, the Malvern pudding, and leaves Daisy motherless.For the next 28 pages, the reader must tread through Daisy's uneventful and uninteresting childhood. The infant is taken under the wings of a benevolent neighbor, Clarentine Flett, who has witnessed the disturbing birth and who shortly afterwards leaves her husband because he refuses to give her money for a tooth extraction (a reason that should have been included in Paul Simon's old song, \\"Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover\\". Clarentine's farewell note is imaginative: \\"Good-bye\\".) Clarentine flees with the child to Winnipeg to live with her boring botanist professor son, Barker Flett, whose only thrill in life is his collection of lady-slippers. Barker discovers his sap rising in a Nabokovian way once Daisy reaches the tender age of eleven. Daisy, however, is definitely no Lolita.But hold tight. More boredom is yet to come. The reader must also wade through Daisy's unfortunate first marriage to a drunken spouse who falls out of a window on their honeymoon even before the marriage is consummated, leaving Daisy in a pickle. So she and Barker Flett hitch up in a quasi-incestuous snicker of a way and then have a family of two girls and one boy. At this point, if the reader is old enough, he or she may recall the 50s sitcoms, \\"Leave It to Beaver\\", and \\"Father Knows Best\\" in which the fictional TV mothers spent a lot of time in a \\"hot kitchen\\" cooking up clever and creative meals, like hamburgers and hotdogs. Daisy, however, goes for jellied veal (yum!) and wonders why her husband and children do not ask for seconds. Maybe it's because Barker is still obsessed with his lady-slippers? (Penelope, how symbolic is that?) Is it because the oldest anglophile daughter, Alice, is busy thinking up British-sharp insults to hurl (like stones?) at every Canadian member of the family? And the son -- maybe he's intent on picking at his pimples and has lost his appetite because the jellied veal reminds him that he may undesirable, too?This leads the reader into nine long, long years of painfully detailed botanical descriptions of flowers and gardens when Daisy takes on a local newspaper columnist role as \\"Mrs. Green Thumb\\". And at this point, we, the readers, know that Daisy has at last found her forte, her voice, her function. Perhaps it's because her boring husband, Barker, has bitten the dust, which affords Daisy an opportunity to get her mojo on with lyrical floral descriptions. She wins the admiration and respect of her readers, but OMG, are we ever in for it when a scoundrel at the newspaper takes over her job, leaving her helplessly unemployed. Daisy sinks into the darkest and deepest of menopausal depressions, becoming comatose, unresponsive to stimuli, and desperately in need of electro-shock therapy, which was, after all, popular in her day. In fact, electro-shock therapy may have been a more creative story line for Carol Shields to have followed than the one she selected. I can easily envision Daisy in the role of Olivia DeHavilland in the 40s flick, \\"Snakepit\\", in which she is shocked out of her depression, sings a moving \\"Going Home\\" song (to the tune of Dvorjak's New World Symphony), and reinvents herself as a much-needed new character in a different plot and different novel.Nevertheless, we must follow Daisy tirelessly in her dotage and decline. She sells the house in Winnipeg (who wouldn't?) and moves to sunny Florida. In this light-drenched backdrop, she gets her groove on with plastic purses, bridge games, and predictable bluish perms. She even does a mean thing (Imagine that, Daisy being mean) on a fake plant in the foyer of her condo building. Then -- yes before you know it, Daisy is an invalid. Her physical infirmities are played upon for another good 20 - 30 pages. Finally, thank God, Daisy passes on. Shields, never one to give up a character quickly, tosses like a frisbee random tidbits and trinkets that have comprised Daisy's insignificant, unloving, stone cold life, including recipes and insipid conversational exchanges among family members. These conversations reveal underlying relief that the uncomplaining millstone around their necks is finally gone (sigh). One of her daughter remarks: \\"She let life happen to her.\\" Fine. But passive characters do not pique the average reader's interest.Daisy is one character in modern fiction that I was actually HAPPY to see die. There is not even a flicker of anything beyond the commonplace and ordinary in her life. God knows, if she had only burned her bra in the 60s or stayed stoned for a brief historical moment in the 70s, we could have appreciated the fact that she was at least breaking out of a predictable mold in which she conforms to every societal norm in the book. Must 269 pages be devoted to such a bland personality? Please, Carol Shields. I know you're dead, too, but was this novel a satire?????? If not, are we really to take all this overwritten drivel seriously?"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I cannot for the life of me understand how this book won any prize, much less the Pulitzer. The only redeeming quality I found were words that made you want to eat them with a spoon. But, sorry, I need more substance in my diet."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Most of us were disappointed and left unmoved by this novel. There was no poetry in the language, no excitement, no happiness, nothing admirable in the characters. Only two of us in the book club said that \\"Stone Diaries\\" was intended to examine a life, and then tell the reader that this ordinariness was valuable; that like Daisy's, there are millions of ordinary lives that are not appreciated. There were mainly two ratings: either a 2 or a 4.5 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is an engrossing story of the life of an ordinary woman from birth to death. The book succeeds very well on that level, but the author's over-ambitious use of many techniques is clumsy and flawed to the point that the flaws interfered with my full enjoyment of the story. The narrator of the book is the main character, but the viewpoint shifts between first and third person frequently, in the middle of sections, and without apparent rhyme or reason. When in the third person, the tense also changes between past and present apparently randomly. Some of the most important transitions in the lives of the main characters occur &quot;off-stage&quot; and therefore seem unmotivated. One character changes from a reticent small-town stonecutter to an outgoing succefful businessman and another recovers from a major depression with no explanation, leaving the reader wonder wonder how? and why? The narrator was present during both transitions and would know what happened. Some of Shields' techniques are more effective. For example, Daisy is called by various names during the course of her life, reflecting her various roles. This leaves the reader wondering &quot;Who is Daisy?&quot;, which is just what the author intended. I enjoyed the book, but I wonder why it won so many prizes.."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Who is Carol Shields and why is she not writing more?!! Although somewhat disjointed because of the book's diary structure, this book is an absolute masterpiece of storytelling, well-deserving of the Pulitzer. I could easily read this book 3 or 4 times and enjoy it each time"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I have from time to time had friends who are aspiring to be great writers give me stories of their's to read. A common flaw with these works is that they often don't really have a story in mind, but are seeking to impress the reader with their wonderful sentences and elaborate metaphors.Stone Diaries seems to be an homage to that kind of writing. It is very clever and artsy, but very little of interest really goes on. Personally, I find the book over-written, and the style tedious.I also found that the writing style served to deaden any emotional impact the story might be trying to have. For example, when Mercy is found dead in the kitchen, the narrative rambles on about how the napkins were folded, or some such similar trivia. It's almost as if Sheilds were trying to prevent people from feeling involved in the book, or perhaps that the reader is supposed to stand at a distance and admire the artistry.I guess this style appeals to some people. I would say that you should be able to tell if you are going to like it or not after about 3 pages."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The author, Carol Shields, is undoubtedly a fine author. After all, she won the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critic's Award. When a writer like that doesn't grab you, you're tempted to wonder if you have no taste as a reader. I really wanted to love this book. But as the pages turned, I found myself almost checking off a literary list: Is there a plot? Sort of. Is this well written? Yes. Does the writer have a good vocabulary? Yes, she is extremely articulate. Is the story truly about life? Yes.Just the same, like some of the other readers, I found myself laboring through the chapters, I began pushing myself to pick the book up and read on. Something was not right here. I am still not exactly certain why I could not complete the volume. I did notice partway through that I did not truly care about the characters. I wonder why not? What could I have loved about any of them, including Mercy, Cuyler, Mrs. Flett, or Daisy? Now I wonder if they ever really cared deeply about each other? Whatever makes one keep reading to learn more about sympathetic characters was missing for me. I'm sorry."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I picked up this \\"ladies novel\\" after my wife read it. I became so engrossed with the characters and their lives that I had could not believe it was just a novel. The beauty of this book is in its simplicity - just a beautiful story about life in the early days of the 20th Century. At one point, the author uses a unique approach in telling the story by allowing us to read a series of letters written over a period of years that was just fascinating. I loved her technique and can't wait to read more of her works."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This novel was a fictional autobiography. The subject, Daisy, tells in vivid detail about her life -- from birth to death. Her life (and those of almost everyone around her) was interesting indeed. You grow to love this character throughout the book.I was very sorry for the book to end. I wanted to keep on knowing Daisy. Excellent (but you already knew that because it won the Pulitzer Prize)!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"It was technically well written, but the narrative is annoying. I wanted more dialogue. A lot of things were left unexplained. And when they were finaly explained, it was too late. Like Barker, you dont even find out how he died until Alice's theory in 'Sorrow'(chapter 7), when he actually died somewhere between Chapter 5 and 6. Carol Shields didnt give the reader enough information or detail when you want or need to know it. Instead, she waits until it doesnt matter any more. It didnt take me away from the world, books should grab your imagination, and take you away to another place or time. It would have been better if the book was written from Daisy's perspective, not how she thought other people perceived her. From the title, you would expect it to be like an actual diary, instead it is a bunch of thoughts on paper, about and from any random character. It wasnt a complete waist of time, but its not a book I would recomend anyone read in the near future, or that I will ever read again."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever read. The characters were lifeless and the family was so boring that why write about them.I could write more interesting things about my family."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries is a Pulitzer Prize Winner by Carol Shields and about a narrator Daisy Goodwill Flett and all the people she meets during her life. I thought, at frist, all the problems I have with this novel are do to this book being a tramma narrative. That is because Daisy seems to avoid talking about anything important in her life, how she feels about not having a mother since she died in childbirth, how she glosses over her father's death and her second husband Barker Flett's death, how Barker Flett was her father figure for her first 11 years but ends up marrying him and their courtship from her point of view, how she feels about him is almost literally nonexistant in chapter 4 where is all takes palce. I thought these events are too traumatic for Daisy to write about. Still, there is not enough here to keep the reader interested. A novel can come together in the end and explain all this avoidance, but if nothing exciting or interesting happens to the main characters in-between, then the reader won't reach the end. That is what I felt with this novel. So much of what is interesting is skipped over, avoided for so long, that I cannot be clear as to what this novel is about as in a dust jacket summary sense. If I wasn't reading this for a class I would have quit somewhere in the second chapter."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"to truly understand the way this book is written the way it is, one must look at the art of life writing, autobiography and biography. There are multiple narratives all from different points of view on Daisy Goodwill, but as you read on you realize that the story is not about Daisy but about how people saw Daisy. We only get snippets of what she really was like as a person through other people's words, but not her own pieces of writing and college papers. As a woman, she had achieved a lot but was yet very passive and misunderstood as a whole, and also had a childlike side to her that made it hard for people to \\"read\\" her, which is the case with this book. When I first read the book I was totally confused by it and bored but at the second read I grew to love it. I love the way everything is described and well written, like about her garden and cuyler's monument and successful stone carving business and creativity. The characters really have their own personalities that make them distinctive from one another, but there are also characters in the book that are not very likeable. I defintely recommend it cause the plot is not a linear one but one that jumps around everywhere and it is like a challenging mind puzzle for the reader to figure out the holes in the story and that in turn builds the anticipation of what happens one scene after the other"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I liked the way the story was told, multiple points of view, I learned about a group of people of whom I knew little to nothing.

However, the Introduction was WAY TOO LONG! You could follow the American way of life for women from the turn of the 20th Century up to I think the 1980s? I mean she was an average person, living an average life. The only surprise for me was that while she was a \\"senior\\" in Florida at the end of her life, she went to seek closure in the Orkney Isles........... That was an interesting touch.

Daisy is born to a mother who dies within minutes of giving birth. The death of her mother causes her to feel untethered her entire life because she has lost the endearing and everlasting love of a mother. Daisy grows up and goes through the motions of life but is consciously aware that her life is missing something.The Stone Diaries is a fictional autobiography of Daisy Goodwill. Daisy represents every woman as they travel through the inevitable periods of life. Beautifully and creatively written, Daisy's story is told by people who knew her.Can you ever really know someone?Do you know yourself completely?By the time we get to the end of our long life we have changed and lived multiple lives. Five years or an important event becomes a mere hiccup in our lives. We change, we grow, we move, we love, we hate and we die. Life goes on with or without us.Shields has created an original novel in style and subject. Told from multiple perspectives and writing styles, each period in Daisy's life is interesting and important to understanding the whole person. The Stone Diaries won the Pulitzer Prize in 1995 and it is deserving. The ending of the book is poignant and sad, like the ending of a life. The Stone Diaries is a clear cut example of fiction mirroring life and a monument to self."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"A poignant brilliantly told story of one woman's life lived. This story reflects the reality of most people's lives. This will go down as one of my favorite pieces of literature ever. The book literally left me sobbing, so powerful is the storytelling."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Daisy Goodwill's story is that of a conventional life, marked by some rather unusual events. The narration vacillates between first- and third-person, but the voice is mainly Daisy's, beginning with her obese mother's death in bearing Daisy in 1905 in rural Manitoba. Daisy's stonecutter father hands the infant off to a neighbor woman, Clarentine Flett, who leaves her husband to live with her grown son Barker, a botany professor. When Mrs. Flett dies suddenly, Barker is left in somewhat of a pickle. Since it would be unseemly for him to remain the guardian of a 12-year-old girl, Daisy's father Cuyler comes to collect her on his way to a better job in Bloomington, Indiana. His success there enables Daisy to marry a rich ne'er-do-well, but, alas, he jumps/falls from their hotel window during the honeymoon without ever consummating the marriage. (Homosexuality is assumed but never mentioned.) Daisy is now somewhat of a pariah as far as her marital prospects and decides to make a long trip, partly precipitated by her father's remarrying. The most anticipated stop in her journey is a visit to \\"Uncle\\" Barker, at least 20 years her senior, with whom she has kept a steady, though uninformative, correspondence. The book covers Daisy's entire life and is sort of a faux biography, complete with family tree and photos, the more recent of which are actually the author's children. I found these touches to be sort of playful on the author's part. As Daisy later goes on sort of a genealogical quest, I was bewildered that she never manifests any curiosity about her mother. As with real lives, some secrets are revealed along the way, and some remain buried when the one who harbors them dies."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The book was very descriptive. I could visualize each character and their clothing. There were a couple of holes I thought. I am glad that I read it once."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I'm not sure really what to think of this book. The description makes it sound like it is told from Daisy's point of view, but really it is not. It almost like an outsider wrote it that knew everything about Daisy. While I liked the book, I felt next to nothing for Daisy herself. I found those surrounding her to be far more interesting. They gave the story life. Thankfully you get a few clips of the story told from varying viewpoints. I got the most from the letters, etc that are throughout the story. I kept hoping the Daisy would eventually find something to tie her to this world. Most people I think go through life trying to make their mark, something that says they were here long after they're gone. With Daisy it was like she knew she would never been remembered, so why try. She even felt her children and grandchildren would eventually forget about her. She was content to just exist for the moment. It was not depressing, I just felt sorry for her. Still, not a bad story."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I loved this book!!

When I read the physical description of Daisy's mother &amp; father then compared it with the picture I was perplexed as neither the description or ages was close and in fact the woman in the picture looked like the mother of the young man. Of course by the time I learned this book is considered a fictious biography (what's that?) I had lost the flow of the story. The pictures of the grandchildren I understand are the author's children. A preface or introduction would have been most helpful. I am presently at Daisy's bridal shower. The reviews on the web are for the most part certainly complementary and for this reason I will continue reading Stone Diaries, with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"There is a lot to say abou this book. For the most part, I thought it possessed a wonderful description of the life of Daisy Goodwill Flett. Although there were times when it did not hold my full attention, and I felt it could have easily been made clearer and more interesting, the book was excellent. Towards the end, though, I began to get bored and uninterested. Oh well, read it and see what you think! It definitely deserves your time, especially if you are a compassionate person.

I must say that I kept waiting for some dramatic event to happen and I was kind of dissapointed when it didn't.

But then it started delving into her life, and that's when it began to get boring! Daisy did absolutely NOTHING interesting. About the most interesting thing that happened to her was her first husband dying. If she had actually had a great love with her second husband, as I expected by the chapter entitled \\"Love\\", there might have been some redeeming qualities, but that was not the case.I was left itching to know more about other characters, Magnus Flett, \\"Fraidy\\" Hoyt, and Maria (Cuyler Goodwill's second wife) in particular, but the only thing that caught my eye about Daisy was her dying thoughts about her life, or lack of it. Then came the chapter entitled \\"Death\\", which was a hodge-podge of senseless blather, and at that point I realized that nothing would make this a GOOD book, but at least I could claim that I finished it."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Rarely have I found a book's characters to be so dull.

I read it during every spare moment I had. But I kept asking myself the same question -- why am I so compelled to read this book? The main characters are dullards who don't appear to have much of an emotional life. It is basically the story of someone living their unremarkable life on auto-pilot.So why couldn't I put the book down? I have several theories:1. The writing is very rich and engaging. The prose is excellent. The author takes you down several different paths to tell one story. I always found the visit with these emotionally flat characters to be an interesting journey nonetheless.2. I wanted to find out what was going to happen at the end. I wondered if the main characters might have an apocalyptic emotional experience sometime during their lives.3. It was interesting reading about lives, lifestyles, social mores, etc. during various times in the last century. The descriptions of sexual feelings and behaviors was well told. I compared their lifestyles to my own and thought how lucky I am to live in my generation.4. Back to the writing. I felt that the author really got me into the heads of these characters, to the extent that she wanted to. I felt that I wasn't so much an observer in their lives, I was a participant with them. I was living their lives with them, from their own perspective, even dying with the main character.5. Now that I think of it, my mood was kind of down while reading this book. Maybe I just wanted to hurry up and finish the book so I could return to my own life.You would like this book if you enjoy historical fiction. Like to get into the heads of your characters. Love good writing. Are experiencing a transition in your lifes journey. If you are a woman-wife-mother, you might more closely relate to this book."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"As others have said, this is the life story of an ordinary woman: Daisy Goodwill Flett. Her birth, childhood, marriages, children and Florida retirement. Nothing spectacular there, but it is exactly this quiet normality which is the most interesting part of the book.Daisy's mother grew up in an orphanage, where all the children with untraceable parents were given the surname &quot;Stone&quot;. This is where the book's title comes from. Daisy, like her mother, is an orphan of sorts - but in an emotional sense. She feels somehow disconnected from the events in her life and the people she knows. As the book tells us,&quot; 'Moving right along' is what she murmurs to herself these days - on her way to Hairworks for her weekly shampoo and set, on her way to the post office or her doctor's appointment or downstairs to the club room for her daily round of bridge. Moving right along, and along, and along. The way she's done all her life. Numbly. Without thinking.&quot;Hence, Daisy reveal little about herself in this &quot;autobiography&quot;, except that she struggles to find any meaning to her life. She never expresses her thoughts on what happens to her, nor why she makes certain decisions. This role is left to her family and friends, who populate the book with bursts of feeling. Each of them spills forth how they feel about people, decisions they've made, their dreams, their actions. They all mention Daisy and her life, but assign their own meaning to it, distorted by how her actions affect them.The peripheral characters all seem to have vibrant lives - although nothing extraordinary happens to them either, they &quot;feel&quot; alive. The contrast underlines how the main character feels somehow lacking and &quot;left out&quot; of her own life.Having said that, the book is not depressing at all. It was well written, I loved the peripheral characters, and if anything, it left me thinking. At the end I wondered - how many others go through life feeling it simply wash over them, thinking there should be more to it, but never finding out what?This is a &quot;quiet&quot; autobiography, not prone to overwhelming action, but it is worthwhile nonetheless. The only gripe I had was that I found the photos didn't really match with the characters - it was obvious they had been randomly assembled from other sources to &quot;fit&quot; the descriptions ( according to the reading guide anyway). But still, give it your time and you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I couldn't get into this book for several chapters ~~ it just wouldn't hold my interest since it was so mauldin in the beginning. Once I got through Daisy's childhood, the reading became more diverse and more imaginative, very rich in detail of the inner life of a woman growing up in the early and mid Twentieth Century.It is a beautifully written novel ~~ and Daisy is a character richly drawn ~~ but the book just didn't capture my interest like other novels did. However, I don't regret picking this novel up to read. I've heard so much about it and was glad to know that there are still good books out there. It's a book to share with family and friends ~~ and perhaps good for a discussion around the suppertable.12-29-03"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"What a unique format - an fictionalized autobiography all the way down to &quot;family&quot; photos included! That part really impressed me. The story was interesting and grabbed me from the start - I like the way the author broke the book up into parts of life, i.e. &quot;Birth&quot;, &quot;Marriage&quot;, etc and the reader was able to figure out what happened to the missing years in between based on what was happening to Daisy in the current chapter. I would recommend this book and am looking forward to reading some of Ms. Shields' other books."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Shields explores feelings you've never verbalized, describes locations you know in your heart, even if you've never seen them. She manages to capture several renditions of the same event -- with clarity. She explores the characters changing perceptions as they grow, or, as in some cases, regress. I found it difficult to put the book down."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries by Carol Shields is one of those rare books that causes the reader to stop and grasp the totality of life. Daisy Goodwill does not lead an extraordinary life. She lives the life of most women, one of simply doing the best she can with the circumstances presented to her. The reader learns about certain key time periods in Daisy's life, and none of the time frames are examined minutely. Shields has managed to capture the essence of a life by creating a novel based on bits and pieces that would actually appear in a diary. We meet most of the tangential characters that form the circle of Daisy's life, though few of are developed fully. As time passes in the life of any person, there are few memories that stand out clearly, and these are the ones filled with either pain or complete happiness. I applaud this novel for its unique style, and I believe the author succeeded in her goal of presenting a life that spans nearly a century."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Carol Shield's book, \\"The Stone Diaries,\\" was disappointing. Though Ms. Shields' prose slides easily off the tongue, and at times inserts itself into the reader's subconscious, the book's protagonist - Daisy Goodwill - is uninteresting and unexplored. Basically, Ms. Shield fumbles at narrative and plot.It seems that Ms. Shields attempted to write a book in the strain of Virginia Woolf's, \\"The Waves,\\" or - more extreme - Faulkner's \\"Absolom, Absolom!\\" These works also use a barrage of singsong or poetic prose to worm directly into the reader's brain, producing the eerie feeling that we have a link to characters' thoughts. And, at the best of times, but only with supporting characters, Ms. Shields manages to do this.For some reason, however, Ms. Shields decided to describe the protagonist by depicting everything around her, letting us discern her main character by only her outline, only the blank space left over in an otherwise bright, colorful canvas. This does not work. Instead of caring or involving ourselves with Daisy Goodwill, we are never left with an impression of who she was. We are left with blank space."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The first book I read by Carol Shields was \\"Larry's Party\\" which announced it was by the author of \\"The Stone Diaries\\", so I set off to hunt that book down, especially when I learned it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I eventually located a Large Print edition, so don't know if the problems I had with this book were due to the discomfort a normally sighted person has in reading Large Print, or with the way the story was written. I suspect it was the latter.I remember reading in \\"how to write\\" books that you must choose your viewpoint and stick to it. Carol Shields bravely decided to flout that advice and instead changed her viewpoint from first to third person with dizzying abandon, making me realise the \\"how to\\" people are probably right. From the opening scene of Daisy Stone Goodwill's birth being told in the first person by the neonate, (how could she possibly know what her mother went through, since the mother died in unassisted childbirth?) I knew reading this book would present a challenge. Was I willing to accept it? Well, based on its prize-winning reception and my enjoyment of \\"Larry's Party\\", I pushed on.This book is the tale of Daisy Goodwill's life - from her unusual and unfortunate birth, through her adolescence, marriage, motherhood and old age. I'm not sure if she is a real person - the copy of the book I read contained many photographs of various people, purported to be children, grandchildren, friends, her parents, husband, etc., but none were of Daisy. It was full of information about masonry, letters, lists, recipes, and from her career as a gardening columnist, lots of gardening advice, but somehow, for me it lacked substance. I came out of it thinking, Okay, this woman had an eventful entry into the world, had a nice little family and had an interesting time with her gardening ... so? I might have been more satisfied had it claimed to be a biography (or autobiography), but a novel? Or maybe I completely missed the point. What did the Pulitzer Prize judges see that I missed?However, above all this is Carol Shield's beautifully descriptive writing, whatever the viewpoint, and that counts for much. And for the fact that my copy of the book announced it was by the author of \\"The Republic of Love\\". A much more satisfying book.I would give this 5 out of 10, but can only give it 2 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is the worst book I have attempted to read in months! The first 100 pages or so I thought showed promise, but then shortly after, I did not care a bit about the characters! I gritted my teeth and tried to keep reading, but I just couldn't do it. I guess I just don't like these &quot;written for a women's bookclub&quot; books."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"What on earth were the Pulitzer prize folks thinking? There surely were better books written in 1995! Our book club had a tough time getting through this one - in fact some did not finish it. This is an incredibly mundane book about a bunch of dull, humdrum nobodys! I get the &quot;honor&quot; of writing our book review each month and usually have no difficulty finding the right words to describe the experience. However, I find I am too much of a lady to say those words for this book experience on a public website! THE END!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book is in fact written very much as a journal or diary, which would naturally include the real, human gaps of time for recordings in its volume. Even though it's mostly comprehensive in the lifeline of Daisy (Stone) Goodwill Flett, the coverage of her children's lives (her own offspring, grandchildren as well as those of her cousins), her friends' lives, her parents' lives fill the pages, only some of their information was integral to progress the story. I didn't feel compelled to want to know how anyone fares; there is no suspense or real intrigue. I enjoyed the gardening and botanical references since that is among my own hobbies."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I don't know about you, but I am certain no one will every write a biography of my life. It's quite simple: nothing much ever happened to me worth writing about. And so it is with most folks. Yet when we pick up The Stone Diaries we read a fictional autobiography of a very ordinary woman that starts when Daisy Stone is comfortably in the womb, and finishes with her obituary. Daisy tells her tale in the third person, and uses documents, letters, and the commentary of others to flesh out the story of her unexceptional life...We really never get to know Daisy well. Her thoughts and emotions, her joys and sorrows lie hidden. Even when she becomes clinically depressed we never get any closer to her mind. To avoid sentimentality she frequently uses letters and the interview-like comments of others to tell the story. She is intelligent and educated, but what was that worth in the first half of the 20th century? Not much. She marries for security, dutifully raises her children, and, without joy, makes herself available in bed. She shows happiness when given a column to write in a newspaper, and that is perhaps her life's triumph.So what do we make of all of this? It is easy to see that born 40 years later Daisy would probably have been quite the achiever. She was born in 1905, however, and Carol Shields does a splendid job of presenting a person who was born, served time on the planet, and then departed, her mark being that she left three children who had more opportunities to develop their talents.This is a novel that may captivate many readers -after all it did win a Pulitzer Prize- or it may leave some dissatisfied. I found the book to be well written, and intriguing, yet Daisy was just too distant for me. You should read it, though. It's a modern classic."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I think I'll pass on any more &quot;pulitzer&quot; books if this is indicative of what they value. Well-written, but extremely hard to follow, which I don't mind if it's interesting reading. But, sadly, it wasn't and I only got half way through the book (with great difficulty) before giving up. Luckily I borrowed it from the library, so no money lost!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"While it had its moments, and is an easy, quick and somewhat engaging read, \\"Stone Diaries\\" makes me wonder if the Pulitzer prize committee is comprised of a bunch of boring old bitties. Surely there are many, many more profound, better written books out there deserving of an award. The thing that really annoyed me was why to confuse the reader with a non-fiction facade, i.e. phoney(?) photos. How much was real and how much was fiction? This much the reader deserves to know. No explanation given anywhere. That aside, Shields does try to make the ordinary extraordinary (with the exceptions of the few really extraordinary events in the novel, like giving birth, unaware the mother-to-be was pregnant, and then dying). The story of four generations, with the protagonist present from the first chapter, when she is born, to the end, when she dies, takes you from the stone quaries of Canada, to Chicago, back to Canada, then to Florida, the living graveyard for seniors (with a trip to the Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland somewhere inbetween). Some of the information was interesting, drawing awareness to such things as the life of a stone quary cutter, which I would never even think about had I not read this book. I did like the way Sheilds conveys the time periods, giving a vivid look at how behaviors and fashions change. I'm not one for overly descriptive prose, I say, get to the plot. Shields is guilty of this in only a few places, where one can quickly skim and not miss the point. I would recommend this for those who enjoy quick, entertaining reads. I don't think new light is shed on the subject of life and death, though the author succeeds in bringing the readers awareness to their own mortality."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I borrowed this book from the library expecting a wonderful story that gives meaning to the lives of ordinary women. It's a Pulitzer Prize winner. It's on university reading lists all across the U.S.Shields dressed up the mundane in pretentious words with ambiguous meanings, while just barely skimming the surface of the crucial turning points in the story. She never bothers with the whos, whats, whens, wheres, and whys for the conflicts that impact the characters' lives. She left huge, gaping holes in her character's lives - especially the main character, Ms. Daisy Goodwill Flett. We catch small, distorted glimpses of a variety of characters, each with their own lives venturing into territories that the reader never explores because Shields never bothered to answer the questions that arose.It was a let-down, after all the great reviews I read about this book, to find that it was a tedious read. In the beginning, I continued reading only because I wondered where Shields was going with the plot. At the end, I read on only because I hate leaving a book unfinished."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I read it because I had to for our book club, but if it weren't for that I would have stopped after 20 minutes. It's tedious. I did slog through the whole thing and it reminded me of having to sit next to someone very talkative and very boring for five hours on an unwelcome train trip. Ugh."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"WARNING: SPOILERSAn excellent read for character development. Shields exhibits great talent in developing characters, including how they can dramatically -- with or seemingly without basis -- evolve over time. I absolutely adored Daisy's mother (first chapter) and was (empathetically) disappointed that Daisy would never know her as well as the dear reader would.The storyline itself started exciting and full of potential, but -- probably like most ordinary lives -- fizzled out midway and especially after the \\"Mrs. Greenthumb\\" chapter, perhaps illustrating how the default of \\"ordinariness\\" happens to so many due to one's circumstances, era, and choices. Despite Daisy's education (good for a woman of that era) and chance to start over in her 20s/30s with freedom and some money, she makes non-passionate and safe choices that commit her to an uneventful life.Shields' story overwhelmingly summarizes \\"normalness\\" and \\"ordinariness\\" in 20th century America. I particularly enjoyed the kinds of everyday observations that are trivial yet make up memories in our lives (e.g., that crack in the bedroom ceiling that has just always been there and we see every morning and night -- until we one day get up and do something about it; whatever happens to the ring placed in the \\"time capsule\\" and why does no one in the family make the move to take care of passing along important family keepsakes?; the cheap decor and construction of cheezy Florida retirement homes). Funny how these ordinary things make up the bulk of our lives, moreso than the big accomplishments.That said, the book has enough twists (the manner/timing of death of Daisy's first husband) and coincidences (the discovery of the ancient Magnus Flett in the nursing home; the dignity and role of the outcast \\"old Jew\\" who saved newborn Daisy and mysteriously placed the coin on her forehead) to keep one surprised and entertained. Until the dreary demise, that is. A tale of warning to young women everywhere not to waste their opportunities!On a final note: I did not care for the \\"fake photos\\" that made up the family tree. Some things are better left up to the reader's vivid imagination."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"With respect to the Pulitzer Prize, one cannot deny that Carol Shield's writing is elegant and highly readable. The story, however, of Daisy Goodwill was not very interesting to me. A fan of historical fiction, it had a true ring to time and place, but I wanted more.Born under extraordinary circumstances to a woman who died in childbirth and either didn't know she was pregnant or simply kept her pregnancy a secret inside her obese body, I felt the story started out with great potential. It's just that the narrator, going in an out of first person, is all over the place with the timeline and it never picked up a sustainable pace compelling me to read on-even after 100 pages.Highly disappointing."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book seems to be primarily about the impossibility of writing a definitive autobiography or, for that matter, a definitive biography. It also raises questions as to the certainty offered by what could naively be taken as objective facts, in the context of biography or history, such as the photographs reproduced in the text (W.G.Sebald uses the same device in his works). Self-consciously, it corporates many forms of writing too, including letters, reviews, first and third person narratives - there are links here to so-called Menippean satires or 'anatomies', to use Northrop Frye's term, the point being that the book might well harbour ambitions to comment on larger issues than the mere lives of its characters - as a guess, possibly the relationship between Canada and the USA; I say 'guess' as I am unsure whether any of such ambition is fulfilled.*Perhaps it's worth mentioning how this book came to my attention. A chance meeting with a Professor of Literature saw her recommend this as &quot;possibly the best novel ever written about women&quot;, and Shields cited as her favourite living writer alongside Alice Munro - both these writers are Canadians, as was the good Professor, so I took all this with the proverbial salty grain. Still, it was hard not to sneak a look.*My biggest surprise was that I found very little insight into the inner lives of women. The protagonist, and possible narrator, Daisy, is not revealing of her inner life; indeed, she is quite opaque; alluding to what I've said above, I think we are meant to see her largely through the eyes of others, or, perhaps, through the distorted lens of hindsight - yet this vantage is all too distant for any intimate revelations. The male characters fared little better. Of course, this might all be quite deliberate: I wondered if the very title, 'The Stone Diaries', refers to the author's embodied view of humanity in general, that is, that people are 'stony', with cold relations to each other the norm, and interiors unavailable for view, save through being crushed. In any case, this was not, ultimately, a warm book in my experience.*The tone of the book changes as it progresses. The early chapters are most distant in time and most distant in tone. As the present day approaches, the tone begins to breathe with life, ironically, as it happens, as the subject matter deals more with illness and, finally, with death. Again, this seems a calculated ploy on the author's part, and no doubt relates to the underlying concerns with the uncertainty of putatively objective history.*The writing style itself is serviceable, with some felicities of expression, but with an overall inclination to the self-effacing, if not the outright pedestrian. It might be fairer to say that a delight in wordplay is not the author's preoccupation.*In sum, I think this is a much more 'theoretic' work than is implied in general reviews. As such, some of its apparent weaknesses are actually serving to illustrate more abstract concerns. Taken purely as a story, however, 'The Stone Diaries' seems wanting in empathy and insight, and taken in terms of sheer literary bravura it also seems a little tired."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries is a beautiful novel, rich, satisfying, well-written and thought-provoking. It's a pseudo-autobiography of sorts, narrated omniciently, telling the life story of Daisy Goodwill Flett, a woman born in 1905. It's a cleverly told tale, not experimental really, just a bit different. Every once in a while Daisy intrudes as an active narrator, but for the most part the narrator separates herself from actually having lived the story. Daisy leads an ordinary life, full of both good and bad times, she marries, has children, grows older, nothing special or unique really, yet the story of her life, the way it is told to us, is special, is unique. Reading the novel is almost like flipping through a family photo album--stories begin, lead back into the past, come back to the present--yet, the narrative voice is so strong and clear in the novel, that you won't ever lose your way. This is a wonderful novel. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This one knocked me off my feet. I was new to the work of Carold Shields and was SO pleasantly surprised by her charm and talent. This is a wonderful story that makes you realize that great fiction really does exsist. I recomend this one to all my friends who are looking for a deep, powerful and great story that has substance. It's a wonderful time and you'll be happy with your accomplishment. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This was an interesting book. The writing was in depth and well written. This is a story of Daisy from the time of birth to her death. The thing I liked about this book was it was written not only from Daisy's perception, but from the people around her's perception. How she touched each of their lives, what kind of an impact she made on the world, and how the circumstances of her life impacted her. It makes me think of when I die, the things I'll have wished for, the impact I may have had, and if I'm really ready to die. The author does a fascinating job of weaving the characters in and out of Daisy's life.The thing that made this a 3 star only was it didn't \\"engage\\" me, I like being entertained, and this book was thought provoking, well written but not entertaining."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The first hundred-fifty pages of this novel rank among the finest writing I have ever encountered. I was swept inside this rich story of a young Canadian girl's life and early adulthood as it unfolded among rock quarries and wild prairies nearly a hundred years ago. Shields is certainly a writer of poetical prose and her sentence structure is both eloquent and admirable. I was held attentively to the pages as I trailed along from the plains of Canada, to Indiana, Ottawa, and finally to the American south. The characters are intricately incarnated here with vibrant personalities that propel the story onward.I wish I could go on drizzling praise onto this book, but the disappointing fact is, after those initial few score pages, the story disintegrates (except for a few good moments here and there) and I rapidly lost all but the barest interest. And then there was the dismal, altogether too realistic saga of the main character's long death in a Florida nursing home. That I really did not need to linger on quite so long.This is, then, ultimately an uneven novel, that reaches great heights and also drags tediously through uninteresting and unnecessary happenings, before losing itself altogether in rather grim and depressing hospital scenes. No novel is perfect, but at its start this one gives the reader false hope that it just might come close."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I enjoyed this book. I thought it was well-written. I enjoyed the more experimental chapters the most. The section on Daisy's depression in particular was amazing.What really got me though was the reading group guide. It showed me just how little of this book I had understood. I recommend looking at the guide after reading the book because the questions it raised really deepened my understanding of the book. Plus, I never would have noticed that Cuyler was taller than Mercy in the photograph on my own!For people looking for a book with an exciting plot, this is not the book for you. For those who enjoy exploring the sometimes mundane and trivial, this is a gem of a book.I am woman. Hear me whisper."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is more feedback to a review that said Daisy's life was &quot;not interesting.&quot; On the contrary, I found this book to be a celebration of a so-called &quot;ordinary&quot; life. The point is that everyone's life is unique and interesting. Of course, it also helps that Carol Shields' writing is so evocative and beautiful. In other, less capable hands, Daisy's story would have been boring. And, to continue the point, I was also struck (when I finished this book) that it doesn't have a &quot;strong&quot; plot in the conventional sense--yet it IS so compelling."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"And I can't understanding those who seemed almost afraid of what they seem to see as the ordinariness of Daisy's life. I thought it was page-turner --I neglected my own house work, exercise class and garden to read it until my eyes got tired. The characters were interesting -- especially the old father-in-law. I especially liked the way the characters experienced sudden changes that sent them in entirely new directions. This book doesn't provide easy, pop-psychology explanations for human behavior and emotions. I like that very much. It was extremely well-written too. Creative, &quot;literary&quot;, but not limited to an arty audience."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"5 writing -- 4 story lineFollowing 85 years of a character can be worthy material when the life includes great accomplishments regarding great character. But, this successful Pulitzer-prize winning novel greets success by discussing the not extraordinary aspects of a standard life.Immersed in the pre-WW I life of subservient woman's life catering to husband's needs, almost-orphaned protagonist Daisy Goodwill must confront some of the demons of her father's and her past. Like too many children of her generation, she is a child whose labor killed her mother. Only photographs and few stories can tell her about the mother she never knew.Soon thereafter, a neighbor lifts her from the man-only household as everyone (according to the women) knew that only women could raise children. Men then were genetically incapable of performing child rearing. And, the delivery of Daisy to the new home was not light and easy. Her father allowed it, but the new mother left her husband to live with others in another town where no relatives (of Daisy) resided.Going through various gaps of her life in warp speed, we learn about the pivotal times - for better or worse. First, we witness her aborted marriage to a man of wealth while honeymooning in England. Thereafter marrying a horticultural genius who, by most accounts, was her \\"almost\\" step brother - his mother is the person who raised her in their household. Such subplot followsMuch Ado about Nothingor modern day'sClueless.Mothering three children, Daisy's life moves on cruise control until more deaths leave her emotions and self in their wake. And, that leads to the novel's greatest literary form: having separate diary accounts by each of the children as well as friends explain the mental health demise of Daisy who followed the path of depression to nervous breakdown. And, these accounts follow the great depiction delivered by Daisy on this event - much hammered out gibberish, which is probably how many who have been afflicted with such illness recount their moment of lapse.Ultimately, the book jumps about with triumphant journalistic feats followed by losing her job to a man. In fact, Daisy - the kept and pampered woman of the 1927 marriage to her first husband - ends up living as a two-time widow within the woman's movement of the 1970's. Maybe earlier she knew, but it is then that she asserts that husbands are really for security in case she or others like her are incapable of making money or surviving in what we call the cold cruel world.The prose of this author, more than the story, earned the Pulitzer. This is well above average writing discussing an average story. Lifting the book's flat plot with spiked uses of colorful language and insight, this book deserves all of the praise it has received, as well as it will undoubtedly receive in the future."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This was my first experience reading Carol Shields, and while I found her use of language quite poetic and insightful, and her characterizations interesting and believeable, I came away from the book somewhat disappointed because I felt I hadn't really gotten to know Daisy Goodwill Flett in an &quot;intimate&quot; way. Although I see her as the main character, she was elusive, perhaps because she was something of a bystander in her own life. Then again, given the period in which she lived, that is probably not too surprising. Perhaps I missed some vital element of emotional depth in Daisy, but others who read the book with me in a book club had similar feelings. While Ms. Shields is certainly gifted with language and the art of story-telling, I wouldn't personally consider this a Pulitzer-worthy book, although I would still recommend it as a worthy read. Like other readers, I was also surprised by the use of photographs in the book, and had to double-check that it was actually a work of fiction. It was particularly interesting that there was no photo of the shadowy Daisy!"},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I was not very interested in the story until about halfway through. For a few chapters it was funny, then it lost my interest again quickly. It jumps around and seems to be written from many different points of view. Could have been much more captivating."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly - it uses a delightful tone of voice that makes you take joy in the ordinariness and simplicity of life: of a garden, of a life-long craft. It is a splendidly crafted book in which Carol Shields shines as a writer.Shields says many things about life, society, and fulfillment in the process, but in the end, this story is simply about the life of an ordinary woman."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This book was interesting because Ms.Shields prose is intelligent and compelling reading.She also violates about every rule that your typical creative writing teacher preaches.That is very refreshing.Her best book was Swann."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"This is a well-written novel with great imagery and intersting characters. However, the technique that Shields used to abolish characters was instant and unprofessional. All of the characters killed during the novel experienced their demise instantly as if Shields was desperate to discontinue them in the story line."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The lives of the characters were simple but the way this book was written made all the difference. The reader is the &quot;witness&quot; to the events and the way she writes (sometimes in 1st and sometimes in 3rd person) made it all the more interesting. Some reviewers think this book was boring and I totally disagree. I loved it and will read another of hers just for the style of writing."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"The Stone Diaries is a well written novel which explores the many events that take place in the lives of women and the effect it has on others around them. Daisy Goodwill Flett is a mother, a daughter, a wife, a lover, a cultivator, a woman, a Flower. This novel, which has a habit of avoiding deep descriptions of this and other characters, gives insight into what it means to be a woman; the ups and downs and the joys and depressions of it. With its vast range of diverse women, the novel will severely TRY to keep you entertained. This may be because of the fact that no two women in the novel are the same. The characters vary from Daisy's mother, Mercy Stone Goodwill, a quiet, shy woman who is raised in an orphanage, with the high point of her life being a housewife, to Clarentine Flett (Mercy's neighbour ), a friendly woman with the courage to leave her husband in a time where such an act was unexpected from women. Another character would be Daisy herself, a calm, strong, confident young woman. She lives quite an eventful life, yet as she reflects over it towards the end of her life, she realizes it wasn't all that it could have been. This was a disappointment, since there is absolutely no indication that Daisy may be unhappy or unfulfilled by the way her life is, but seems to enjoy and accept the way things are going. This made me feel somewhat cheated, since it seems I never really got to know her. I guess you can't expect to know the characters much, since they hardly know much about themselves, in terms of what they're feeling, what they want and so on. One would think that after following these women throughout their lives to their deaths, you would know them in great detail, but that isn't the case. Shields has this way of only allowing the reader to know the characters to a certain extent. This is unfortunate, since it disables the readers from allowing themselves to identify with or feel empathy for any of them. If you look past the misconception of the characters, the plot is quite interesting. It is unique the way it follows through on the life events of the main character. We are there when Daisy enters the world and shadow her through childhood, marriage, love, motherhood, sorrow, illness and then, sadly, death. Daisy's life certainly challenges how we perceive a woman's life to be. It could quite easily have been a great book with a few minor changes, but overall, it was worth the time."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"Carol Shields displays her talent as a great writer in her novel, The Stone Diaries. This remarkable tale of Daisy Goodwill entrances the reader. The trials and tribulations Daisy experiences throughout her life are illustrated with such detailed accuracy that one may forget that The Stone Diaries is a work of fiction. I'll admit that I almost did. Separating each section of Daisy's life into a chapter, Shields guides us through all of Daisy's experiences from the miracle of her birth to the tragedy of her death. I found it very difficult to tear myself away from this novel for the most part - it can be very captivating. Every novel, however, does have its weak areas. I found the conclusion to be unsatisfying and confusing. It was unclear as to what happens to Daisy at the time of her death. The final chapter is very vague and left me with one thought... &quot;huh?&quot; Though the final chapter dampened my excitement over The Stone Diaries, I still believe this is a novel that everyone should experience. It gives insight into the world of conscience and thought, and Shields' ability to do this is not something to be ignored."},{"Title":"The Stone Diaries","review":"I thought the pictures in the middle were confusing and un-nessecary to the story.

All in all, it just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Who Speaks for the Trees?","review":"John Tettemer's \\"Who Speaks for the Trees\\" is a book that once started, I could not put down. It is an easy read and made all the more interesting by the format. The story of this remarkable man is told in alternating chapters devoted to his personal life and his professional life. I believe this book has wide appeal. It would be of great interest to any civil engineer and should be a \\"must read\\" for anyone involved in environmental engineering. At the same time, it would grab the attention of anyone who enjoys a fascinating true story about a unique man.This book chronicles John's journey from his early childhood growing up in the beautiful mountains of Santa Monica with his family - a story in and of itself. It details his struggles as a young man with limited resources to advance his education, his great love for his wife Susan and their four children, his successful 25-year career with the LA County Flood Control District prior to opening John M. Tettemer and Associates, Ltd. in 1978. The book closes with a description of his personal walk down the path of self-discovery through varied and often unconventional avenues.It is a courageous story when you view the enormous efforts put forth by this man to gain inner peace through greater knowledge and understanding of his person and the world about him. John's ability to see the possibility of immense change and shifts in views and behavior is remarkable. His desire and need to grow emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually is admirable and rare in men of this generation."},{"Title":"Who Speaks for the Trees?","review":"Like all of us, John Tettemer is a man of many sides. Few of us have exposed them for all to see. In Who Speaks for the Trees Tettemer lays open the lifetime adventure of a boy raised in a hilltop paradise above Hollywood among the trees, the animals, and a unique family assemblage. With meticulous recall, he describes \\"hinges\\", or turning points, in his life. Discoveries about his parentage, loss of loved ones, falling in love, having to work, getting an education, getting a job, raising a family: we all go through these steps, but you're never prepared for the next \\"hinge\\" in Tettemer's life. Few life stories are as engaging as this one or as beautifully and lovingly written.Tettemer pioneered bold innovations in what for most people would have been unlikely fields of opportunity. As a young engineer in a large Los Angeles County public works agency, he captured the attention of top management and was allowed to bring about implementation of project management and control procedures which saved millions of dollars in time saved and inflation costs in design and construction of flood control projects.At a point in the organization's history when the cost of operation and maintenance of dams, channels, debris basins, and storm drains was becoming excessive and, worse, out of management control, Tettemer developed a maintenance management system. Uniform maintenance standards and a maintenance scheduling system assured reliable facility performance while providing management control of costs.Before leaving public service, Tettemer conceived the notion of construction solutions which were \\"softer\\" than the traditional concrete rivers through downtown Los Angeles. As a result, projects were developed to suit the environment of the neighborhood, with natural values of trees and vegetation and continuation of live streams.Later on, after leaving County employment to form his own consulting firm Tettemer gained a reputation as a consensus builder who could bring together contending factions in many long-standing and complicated environmental/water resource/land development conflicts. He has left behind smiling faces in California, Texas, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and elsewhere. He is recognized as a pioneer in creation of riparian wetlands, water quality wetlands, and the natural river management concept.These are some of the \\"engineering\\" highlights of the Tettemer story. What the engineering world did not know was the private side of John Tettemer. His personal story of his amazing mother, his two \\"fathers\\", Susan, the love of his life, his children, and his lifelong quest for understanding of \\"what's it all about\\" make for the most interesting true story you're going to find. He has the gift of sensitivity to nature in all its aspects and has learned to refresh his spirit in the outdoors and with the help of kindred spiritual scholars. The most private and personal parts of the book are the retracing of his steps through his own thought processes and the insights gained through contacts with learned healers.You will find this a spellbinding trip through one man's life history and his inner being."},{"Title":"Who Speaks for the Trees?","review":"An adventure, several love stories, a textbook on environmental issues, a revealing story about nature and the Mother She is, and a man's spiritual journey from a boyhood in her embrace to adulthood as one of her caretakers.

Whether you're an environmentalist or not, this is a story of a unique life and the man who lives it.

He discusses the necessity of finding innovative ways of solving problems within a bureaucracy and offers meaningful insights into how this can be achieved.\\"Who Speaks for the Trees\\" is also the story of a man's journey through time and a spiritual awakening as he learns to understand his persnal relationship to all of life. It is profound, insightful, and heart warming autobiography. It is a book you will not want to put down. I recommend it highly as a must read."},{"Title":"Who Speaks for the Trees?","review":"&#65279;This is a big book and I read all 539 pages in two days.

Mr. Tettemer is not afraid to share his \\"underbelly\\" and the book includes his experiences with vulnerability as well as with strength and courage.\\"Who Speaks for the Trees\\" is heartfelt and describes a moving story of one-man's life and his many loves: Love for his family and his work, love of nature, and love for himself and the mysterious processes of life.In a sincere and genuine manner, this book describes John Tettemer's journey, reflecting his life, appreciation for the wonders of nature, and his dedication and devotion to all that he has touched.I enjoyed reading this book. I felt like I was a traveler with the author on his spiritual journey. I was touched by the simple sharing of his heart and I especially enjoyed the descriptions of his vision from above, looking at solutions, rather than viewing life at the problem level, breaking problems down into workable steps (keys), then having the courage to implement the steps, one at a time.There were little things written about in this book that also touched me, one being when the author described taking a peaceful break from life to treat himself to an ice cream cone. I could just taste the ice cream, feel the sun pouring down and the gentle breeze blowing. The author knows how to enjoy and appreciate the simple things in life, as well as tackle the complicated and not so simple things in life. Since reading this book, there have been a few days where I have taken time off my work, as an ice cream cone called my name. Ahh, a little peaceful break from the not so simple.I enjoyed this book and recommend it thoroughly. I will read this book more than once. Thank you, John Tettemer, for sharing pieces of yourself with us."},{"Title":"Stone Soup An Old Tale","review":"This book is the same one I remember as a child and I was glad to get a nice clean and new copy of it.

Heck if I am going to read I should get a few books that I will enjoy reading over and over, right? Well, unexpectedly my 4 year old son actually enjoys this book as well, and he asks me to read it all on his own. I highly recommend it and it kind of brings up a topic that I think can be hard to bring up with children this age, that sometimes you need to tell someone what it is you need and its ok to ask for help. It also goes over a creative way to ask for help....I really love this story."},{"Title":"Stone Soup An Old Tale","review":"This is a really good story about 3 strangers who come into a community.

Well, that same day, the soldiers get an idea. Why! stone soup of course!The message that this book sends is that even though you think that some people are bad, you should always try to see whats on the inside of them, not the outside.

These days the classic tale of how to make stone soup has been told in a myriad of different tellings and versions. But if you harken back a little to Marci Brown's 1947 concoction, you see clearly that the story can be a little more sardonic than its alternate versions. In this tale, villagers are tricked out of their greed and fear into sharing and enjoying life with their neighbors. And it's all thanks to a soup that doesn't even exist.Three soldiers make their way home from an unnamed war in an unnamed country. Passing a village, the men ask the townspeople for some food and warm beds. Unsurprisingly, the peasants (who, one presumes, have been violently scared into this state of distrust through years of misuse at the hands of soldiers such as these) feign a lack of food or room for the men. Thinking on their feet, the soldiers proclaim that there is nothing for it then but to make stone soup. The astonished town watches and aids the men in their task, providing them with a huge soup cauldron, water, and whatever ingredients the soldiers casually mention. By the end of the evening everyone sits down to a hearty meal and after a good night of carousing the men are given the best beds in town. \\"And fancy, made from stones!\\"The soldiers in this tale are jovial fellows, just as comfortable fooling foolish peasants into acts of selflessness as they are dancing with pretty maids and drinking. That so much joy can come simply from sharing with your fellow man is a moral insinuated from the tale, rather than explicitly spelled out to the reader. Brown's accompanying illustrations encompass roughly four colors; red, black, white, and grey. Though a subtle palette, the figures readily express all the emotions, fears, and energy of the people and their soldier guests. I was charmed by the final throwaway line in the book, written below the peasants as they wave goodbye to the three men. \\"Such men don't grow on every bush\\". You could say the same for this book."},{"Title":"Stone Soup An Old Tale","review":"I remember several stories that I loved very much as a child. One of them is the story of \\"Stone Soup\\". I saw it on the Captain Kangaroo television show--- the Captain read the story and the illustrations were shown page by page. I was delighted and spellbound. Everyone knows that you don't give anything away. To do so would be very foolish. Yet, in this story the people do give food away! And in the end, everyone shares in a feast because each one provided one small part of the meal. This is very moving to me. And a lesson that shapes my life every day. Thank you Marcia Brown for your retelling of this timeless tale, and to Bob Keeshan, the Captain, for bringing me this joyful tale. Larry Host, Sacramento, California, July 22, 2006"},{"Title":"Stone Soup An Old Tale","review":"This children's book, based on an old French folk tale, is about three soldiers who try to convince a small village to provide them with some food. The villagers say they are too poor and can't. The soldiers then reply that they will make stone soup out of stones and water and are able to trick the villagers into having a village-wide feast. Yeats had a one-act play roughly based on this folk tale as well.

THESE are the classic illustrations most of us grew up with. THESE are the soldiers and the peasants we read about. THIS is the story I'm keeping for my nieces. The telling isn't too clever, or too silly, or too watered-down, or too grown-up. The illustrations are neither too slick or too consciously old-fashioned.

But, the peasants are none too friendly and try their best to hide their food and make excuses of how not to help them. The soldiers have the idea of making stone soup, and soon the whole village is involved and having fun. Before they know it, everyone is sharing food and a huge feast is served, plus the soldiers get a good night's rest. Children will love this exciting book full of laughter and fun.The best aspect of this book for the younger reader is the fact that they will be able to easily follow along with the story and even predict what will happen next. This will enable them to even retell the story over and over to others, giving them good practice to becoming a seasoned reader. This is also important because children need to have positive experiences being a part of a reading community. They will love sharing stories they know with others and having others share stories with them.The illustrations in the book are simple, but yet delightful. They only use a few colors and are not incredibly detailed, but children will love watching the story play out before their eyes. They will be able to look at the pictures and describe what the characters are doing, and even predict what they will do next. The emotions that the soldiers and the villagers are experiencing can easily be seen through the pictures, and children will love seeing such distinct expressions on their faces.Overall, this is a book that has no doubt been handed down over many generations, and children of today will still love and enjoy hearing and reading it. It is a delightful narrative that will provoke a love for a good story."},{"Title":"Stone Soup An Old Tale","review":"Hi, (...) This is a good book to buy.

By the second day of using the book and CD tutorial, I was on the 5th chapter and had a very good working knowledge of creating my own multimedia presentation. The steps in this book are very easy to understand, as they are numbered and bolded. Then there is a description which explains what you are doing. The pictures are very helpful too and it is not necessary to memorize where everything is located in the toolbars. (There are about three screen shots on a two page spread, which makes it easy to follow the steps and find the tools). The CD tutorial is unique and first allows you to play the finished version of what that chapter will teach you, so you see exactly what you are going to create.

D7D is not only informative and definitive, it's also an engaging read. D7 Authorized is not very engaging, incredibly simplistic and not exactly error-free.

Sure, it tries to explain a few things along the way, but for the most part, you just follow directions, and do the tutorials.I learned a whole lot more about how to use Director and Lingo from Director 7 Demystified. It explained things in clear terms, and taught you how to USE the program, instead of just telling you what to do next for the tutorial. Demystified is also a vast reference for Director and Lingo, whereas once you go through the tutorials in this book, you will probably never come back to it.If you are trying to learn Director, I would definitely go with Director 7 Demystified."},{"Title":"Director 7 and Lingo Authorized (2nd Edition)","review":"I give only one star because I allready got the Director 6 and Lingo Authorized (good one).

The approach of this book is a step by step tutorial. I find it useful as a newbie. However after I finished all the exercise, I still have lots of unanswer questions. For example, how to use the Shockwave Multiusers server, and how to make more complex design with lingo, etc. I then read the official manuals, documentation and Director 7 Demystified. They do answer some of my questions. I find the latter book can give me a more solid foundation of Director than this one.I think Director 7 and Lingo Authorized is good for beginners who know nothing about this application. The step by step tutorials does help me to feel and to remember all the basic functions. This is an okay book. However for those who want to go deeper into it as well as lingo, you ought to read Director 7 Demystified too since it has a bigger section on lingo script. Macromedia is famous for its support and learning site. The official documentation is also a very good source to learn, esp. their manual on the shockwave multiusers server. I cannot find much information on this server in most Director books."},{"Title":"Director 7 and Lingo Authorized (2nd Edition)","review":"As Being new to director this book was relly well set out.

However, i did like the book, it did a good job of coddling the reader through the beginning phase of using this program. I just feel a little unhappy that what with the size of this book, and cost, it didnpt impart more in the way of useful information beyond the basics.

It guides anybody to multimedia skill building-up, providing for both visual learners (those who need to see the pop-up menus) and those who learn by conceptualizing. So, it adapts to your way of learning besides monitoring every step you take during the process. It tells you how long you should accomplish the tasks, when you are going to learn some other features involved in a lesson and it even tells you when to save. That would be the kind of father I'd like to have.As a Teacher of English as a Foreign Language and a real beginner learner, I sincerely advise this book to those who teach too, even if they already know everything about Director 6 and 7. This book shows computing teachers how people learn and how teachers should teach.The CD-ROM is great and essential for the development of the course. Although I can not open the Director7 movies in Director 6, all the files are fully available and you can accomplish the projects by following what the book says: import file from the CD-ROM and do it accordingly to the instructions. Both CD and book require no improvisation for learning since everything is very well planned and put up togheter.Well, in a nutshell, this a TEN-STAR book for both experienced Macromedia teachers and Director 6/7 wannabes.

In this novel he tells the story without a principal character, as the novel is about the history of the bridge from its beginnings to its tragic end. And while it might sound boring, the story is rich in secundary characters whose lives develop and end around the brigde, who suffer and rejoyce on its body made of stone.Mr Andric skillfully combines the real historical facts with fictional characters, showing brutal images of Turkish rule on the Balkans, as well as love stories and choices that are difficult to understand in today's society which is not used to sacrificing everything for an idea or just pride.After reading this novel, a foreigner will be better equipped for a travel to the Balkans, and maybe even able to understand its people a little bit more."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"What immediately strikes a reader is that this is an old-fashioned kind of modern novel, with an omniscient author describing a broad sweep of social history. The location happens to be a town on the border of Bosnia and Serbia, but there's a universality of theme despite the specifics of geography, cultures, politics, and historical events. Andric seems to be saying that life has been like this for human societies everywhere. We come in all manner of dispositions into this world, and this is the way we grow up, flourish, grow old, and interact with each other, making us both individuals and members of a community.The book, covering the centuries between the building of a bridge in the 1500s to its destruction during WWI, is a tapestry of short stories, some sad, some joyful, some romantic, some humorous, some ironic, some tragic. Each character is vividly described, as are the changing times and the shifting political fortunes that have their effect on the town and its citizens. First part of the Ottoman Empire, then the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Visegrad (the author's hometown) remains home to Muslims, Christians, and Jews, living together in relative peace as long as decisions in far-off capitols leave them undisturbed. The tone of the book, however, especially its ending, reflects the time in which it was written - the years of WWII when Andric's life as a diplomat was suspended and his country was occupied by German armies.The final scene portrays a devastation and a total disruption of the town's continuity, while holding out a humanistic hope that life continues untouched elsewhere. Readers who are inheritors of age-old rivalries and keepers of memories of Balkan atrocities may no doubt take exception to the particular slant of this telling of history, finding in it glaring examples of bias. But the Nobel Prize Committee that chose Andric for its Literature Prize saw the novel correctly for what it is to the rest of the world, a story about the endurance of humans in the face of human folly."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"This lesser-knows European masterpiece is a type of memoir about a bridge and those who live near it. It is originally constructed at the request of a Vezir to unite East and West, a purpose that later proves unfortunately beneficial when Austria crosses it to occupy then-Serbia. The bridge becomes a point of pride for the residents of Vishegrad and is portrayed as many things- peacemaker, everlasting testament to national strength, as well as a transitory phenomenon that has a birth and death like anything else. People drift throughout the book with no central character save the village elder, Alihodja, a voice of reason who could symbolize the sensibilities of archaic tradition in the midst of war and modernity.The political overtones and symbolism of the bridge are apparent, but this book is also full of very perceptive scenes of human behavior. People are happy, sad, drunk, duplicitous, shallow and deep, foolish and wise, and always written with a smooth accessibility that keeps the book consistently entertaining. It is also a fascinating book; I caught myself pausing frequently while reading it to pause at a simple description of the bridge under the moon, or the desolate town streets at midnight, or the nuanced characterization of a villain, and wanted to live in the small town of Vishegrad for years. Broadly exotic yet intimate, this is a rare and wonderful book."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"The masterpiece that won the author a Noble prize for fiction. If he was Russian, his name would follow in the same breath as Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky, and he'd barely need introducing. But the literary landscape doesn't always offer the same kind of literary stage to all its masters. Some of them are almost buried in the wreckage of European history. At the epicentre of the Continent's eruptions, Andric set out an epic (this word so often overstated, here is an understatement), on the crossroads between divisive Christianity and relentless Islam, modern Imperial powers and those that began to dissolve after hundreds of years of desperate control. Written in Belgrade, during the worst of the Nazi bombing, demolishing the city as the author wrote, Andric looks back across the histories that have been written across his home-land. A substantial book that does not drag with weighty history or become mired in tearful sentimentality; does not proclaim battle inspiring philosophies or declaim political war cries. Andric finds his focus on an elegant bridge spanning a coursing river, and is mesmerized by the confluence of human destinies passing over it. His genius lies in his perception of unique human character and the ability to reveal it in all its complexity with the clear light of god-like wisdom. Third person narrative brought to its ultimate resolution, and the epic novel to its most complete expression. It deserves to be read, and perhaps, celebrated."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"In this beautiful and panoramic novel, Ivo Andric tells us the story of the little town of Visegrad, in the strategic and much-disputed Bosnia Herzegovina. The main reference is the bridge on the river Drina, a solid stone-bridge built in the XVI Century by Mohamad Pasha as a tribute to his native land. The bridge is the true protagonist of the novel. Social life, politics, and business center on the bridge, especially the central part called the kapia, where it is widest and where people sat down and had a cup of coffee talking to neighbours and watching the girls. The bridge and its life allow the author to depict the mosaic of races, cultures, and religions that is this region of the world. The novel crosses through Turkish domination, Serbian rebellions, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire's domination, starting in 1878, until the fateful year of 1914, when, for the first time, the bridge is partially destroyed (as it would be again in the 1990's wars). Through the little stories of its inhabitants, Visegrad and the bridge become a great picture of the human condition, where sad and happy stories happen, as well as the good and bad effects of each social and political change. A very pleasant reading."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"A fictional masterpiece that serves as a excellent introduction to the study of Bosnian history. After reading The Bridge over the Drina, one can begin to understand some of the deep rooted historical contributions to Bosnia's early 1990s struggles.The Drina bridge, a bridge that spans generations, links early sixteenth century Ottoman Empire with the pre-WWI Austro-Hungarian Empires; giving a glimpse into day-to-day living under such diverse regimes. This book also chronicles the lives of Catholics, Moslems, and Orthodox Christians -- deep seated loyalties to their respective faiths, but somehow, giving the reader hope that it is possible for such diverse groups to live in peace -- with each other."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Ivo Andric describes the life and times of the people of Visegrad, a small riverside town in Bosnia, from 1516 to 1914. The novel begins as a boy from a nearby town is taken by force to serve the government in \\"Stambul\\". He rises in the ranks to Grand Viser (sic) and commands the construction of a bridge as a gift to his hometown.The bridge not only provided a means to connect two parts of Visegrad, (an undependable ferry had been the only previous means) it was a vital part of the community. The bridge had a wide center, a \\"kapia\\" on which over the years was a scene for markets, gatherings, guard houses and sometimes was the site of life changing events. The history is told through tales of the townspeople; most tales involve the bridge. First there is the harsh life of construction workers, and later there are tales of gamblers, shop keepers, guards, floods, school teachers, students, hoteliers, peasants, dreamers and drunkards. The tales help the reader to envision the social life, customs and concerns of the people of this region and foreshadow what is to come.The people of this town are vulnerable to decisions made far away. Policies of the Ottomans and later the Hapsburgs are administered in different ways, but the result is the same in that young males are conscripted and new taxes are levied. Like the bridge, a railroad and educational opportunities for the young bring more outside influence to the town, for better and for worse.As Serbian insurgents threaten the larger powers, the strategic location of the town, its bridge, railroad and small Serbian population make it a battleground. Its people, most of whom have no political philosophy, respond to the new conditions in ways that fit their age, family needs or their ethnicity.I read the 1977 University of Chicago Press volume. The cover features a representation of the bridge, but this one does fit the text. For one thing, it doesn't have the \\"kapia\\" which is essential to the story. At the bottom of some pages there are letters, p. 33 has a B; p. 65 a C; p. 97 a D, etc., with no explanation.The prose has a fable like quality and is a pleasure to read. It helps to the reader to understand this region of the world. This has been called a masterpiece and it is apparent why this author received a Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Ivo Andric's stately architectonic prose spans the five-century history of Visegrad, in Bosnia, as imperturbably as the Ottoman stone bridge that centered the economic, political, and social life of the town. The bridge, as told with thorough historicity, was built as a 'gift' to the region by Mohammed S&ouml;k&uuml;ll&uuml;, a janissary taken from a Serbian peasant family who rose by natural ability to become the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire in the mid 16th Century. Life in Visegrad, with its uneasy blend of Muslims, Christians and Jews, flows under the bridge as steadily as time, now a turbid torrent now a turgid trickle but like Time itself always toward the sea of forgetfulness. Incidents of passion, violence, cruelty, and comedy occur and recur on the 'kapia' - the broad center of the bridge - leaving their imprint in folk songs and lurking fears. Andric writes: \\"\\"So, on the kapia, between the skies, the river and the hills, generation after generation learnt not to mourn overmuch what the troubled waters had borne away. They entered there into the unconscious philosophy of the town; that life was an incomprehensible marvel, since it was incessantly wasted and spent, yet none the less it endured 'like the bridge on the Drina'.\\"\\"That enduring phlegmatic balance, that provincial tranquillity, would last even through the decadence of Ottoman authority and the incorporation of Bosnia into another multi-cultural empire - Austria-Hungary - but it would meet its destruction with the intrusion of modernity, nationalism, and World War 1. The bridge itself would be mined and demolished in the War. Though Ivo Andric depicts the exploitation and tyranny of the Ottomans, then the crass invasive bureaucracy of the Austrians, with caustic realism, it's plain that he pines for the old days and old ways, that his vision of history is utterly conservative and nostalgic.What's remarkably fine about this measured history is Andric's ability to share insights into the mentalities of all parties, Muslims and Jews as respectfully as Christian, rich and poor, successes and failures, those who adapt and those who don't. Like the bridge that resounds to the footsteps of all with equanimity and carries all traffic licit or illicit impartially, Andric depicts the virtuous and the wicked with open affection for their humanity. A barely-fictionalized biography of a stone bridge, 314 pages of small print, might sound like a challenge to any reader's attention span, but Andric makes it both emotionally affecting and historically enlightening. No other book, I think, can evoke the distinct realities of Balkan history, or elucidate the psychology of the post-Yugoslav calamities as vividly as this one.For once, I urge readers not to skip the introduction by William McNeill, which outlines Bosnian history with helpful brevity. I wonder also at the authority of this translation by Lovett Edwards. It reads gracefully enough in English, but there are loopholes in it, as noted by some earlier reviewers. The biggest loophole is the identification of the Muslims of Visegrad as \\"Turks\\". Ethnic Turks they certainly were not. Rather they were the descendants of Slavic converts to Islam, chiefly from among the heretic Bogomil Christians. Since I can't read Serbo-Croatian, I'm uncertain whether Andric intended us to accept that the converts identified themselves as Turks or whether the translator simply brushed the issue aside. It is an important distinction, made important by the violence of ethnic and religious \\"cleansing\\" in the Bosnia of the 21st Century.Chiefly it's the author's love of the place and the people - stone and water, permanence and transience - that make \\"The Bridge on the Drina\\" a beautiful reading experience."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Being the daughter of Croatians and having studied Balkan history for a while, I have been exposed to a lot of material and experiences involving the culture of the Balkans. And I find that this book, more than any other, truly captures the character of the South Slavs and the exquisite beauty inherent in the ferocity of this region. I fully recommend this novel to everyone and anyone, regardless of background in the subject matter or a particular interest. It is an extremely powerful reading experience that will resonate particularly strongly with anyone who has ties to the region."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"We have traveled extensively in the region (especially Turkey), and have many friends among the Bulgarians, Montenegrans and Serbs. One of the anomolies of the region is that such cultural hatred of one another lies so shallow beneath such gracious, philosophical and educated peoples.When Yugoslavia broke up after the fall of the Soviet Empire, many people thought that these cultural conflicts had been so effectively suppressed by Tito that they would never rise again. Those with some knowledge of the people and area knew that chaos and brutality were more likely. Although much had appeared to have changed, the hatreds had been retained, just like vestigial tails.\\"The Bridge on the Drina\\" tells a fictionalized truth about how Turks, Serbs and Jews lived together, accomodating one another in a small, remote village for over four hundred years. But the story also includes the disruptions and changes in power structure that took place, lowering the prestige of one group at the expense of another. All of this is part the cultural memory carried even by young people today.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is endeavoring to understand not just the Balkans, but human nature in any place and at any time. Another good book to acompany this one would be \\"Land Without Justice\\" by Milovan Djilas.I do not speak Serbian, but I do agree with those who critisized the translation. In places it is rough and difficult to understand. On the other hand, the thoughts being transmitted are subtle and any translator would have had difficulties properly conveying them without losing the emotions of the author.All around, this was an enjoyable and enlightening read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"I bought this book for my aunt's birthday.

He was able to put historic facts in a readable almost mystifying format that made this book a master piece, even though the word is now terribly overused, The Bridge on The Drina is a master piece and Andric is a masterful story teller as he is a writer. The story that Andric presents is a powerfully moving story and is based on historic fact. It does not only give the reader a better perspective to view the conflicts in the Balkans of the 90's and the recent Kosovo trouble, but it also supplies the reader with a better understanding of a conflict that traces it's roots to the 14th century, that can be used in understanding war's and conflicts based on ethnicity and religions else where."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Someone mentioned in reviewing this book that it didn't come across very well in translation.

The central image and metaphor is the town's bridge, a lovely structure built by a Grand Vizer who was born in the river valley crossed by the bridge. Divac uses the bridge to symbolize the multi-ethnic and multi-religous nature of Bosnian society as it developed under the Ottomans and later under the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Events taking place on and around the bridge trace the history of Bosnia, its increasing contact with the western industrial world, and the destruction of traditional Bosnian society in the First World War, an event that results in the destruction of the bridge. The plan of the book is a series of related tales centered on the bridge. The quality of writing is excellent, the stories are invariably interesting and unsentimental. The series of civil wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia have given this book an almost prophetic quality and particular poignancy."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"\\"generation after generation learnt not to mourn overmuch what the troubled waters had borne away...[life] was incessantly wasted and spent, yet none the less it lasted and endured \`like the bridge on the Drina'\\"This quote describes well the overall tone of this novel.

I highly reccommend it to anyone who wants to better understand Balkan nationalism and the wars of the early 90s, or to anyone who has an interest in Balkan history. I would suggest that you have a basic knowledge of the history of that time period though before reading it, otherwise you won't appreciate it as much."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"To write about Andric and his work, also means writing about fights (verbal ones) between Croatians, Serbs and Bosnians, which are lead to the present day over the fact whose author Andric really is. But that story is not for this place, so we shall skip it and we are going to turn our look towards these pages.Brige over Drina is not merely a sociologic study as you can read in some of the reviews, it, really is that, but only on a shallow scale, scale that could be seen with a first reading. Life on the border between Bosnia and Serbia, could be understood as a good theme for a socio-literate research, but Andric shoots much higher than that.Bridge on Drina is neither the story about human destinies, though many are interwoven between it's pillars and the village beside it, human destinies are everywhere, so they are present even in this book, but the are not the main subject.Bridge on Drina is story about people (not about their destinies), about passability of all things, even those who are meant to be infinite, without ending, and which couldn't be destroyed no matter how hard one could try, it's a stroy about Balcan, about specific way of life, life which does not hurry anywhere, in which &quot;parties&quot; are held all day long, in which one walks over bridge for hours, casually glancing on a water beneath, exchanging few words, and gossips with people who do the same, it's a life of a little people in a &quot;barren wasteland&quot; of borderland, which was never independent, but always under some other rule, being Turkish, or German one, which influenced on society, and changed ways of life from it's roots.In contrary with a modern Croatian/Serbian/Bosnian prose, bridge over drina posess an exemplary style and language, very easy understandeable and fluent, which occupies ones perception with a tones of a nostalgia which jumps from every syllable in the book.You could find critics in this book, you could find wondering, but over all that you shall find bridge as a symbol of link between nations on a much deeper scale than merely connecting opposite sides of river. that bridge connects life of the people and from that bridge life became apparent in a village beside it.This is a wonderfull book, definition of a fine arts, though I have a feeling that much of familiarity and warmth is lost in english translation, so I encourage all of you out there who posses adequate understanding of slavic laguages to read this book in original.Read it, than let it rest, than read it again, than let it rest again, and so on, and so on..."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"In the news today I read about the Stari Most rebuilt bridge.

This great European writer is not only extremely relevant today, having a great deal to say to us in an era of ethnic conflicts and ethnic cleansing; he is also a great storyteller who deserves a place alongside the likes of Leo Perutz, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Yasar Kemal, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.Of course, there are much more unfortunate misperceptions of Andric. Surely the greatest injustice is the fairly common perception of Andric as a hater of Muslims. Some Serb nationalists see him as a hero, and some Bosniak Muslims see him as having provided grist for the mill of the forces which led to the massacres of their people by Serb nationalists in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1990s. Both are wrong, just as they are wrong in seeing Bosnian-born film director Emir Kusturica as a traitor to his people and a proponent of Serb nationalism. Probably this misperception owes much to the one of the most memorable passages in the book, one in which the impalement of a Christian Serb, ordered by the Turkish official who began the building of the bridge over the Drina in Visegrad, is described in horrifying detail. But Andric is simply providing a realistic account of the history of Bosnia, and it is useless to deny that acts of brutality were committed by the Ottomans during their occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. People who think this passage makes the novel a textbook in Serb nationalism and hatred, though, overlook several facts. The first is the fact that the Middle Ages and the Renaissance were violent times throughout Europe and this particular act of violence was not at all unusual (the most famous impaler of all times was, of course, a Christian, the Romanian Vlad Dracula). The second is the fact that the Sultan ordered the corrupt official responsible for this impalement to be replaced by an official who was a good and honest one, showing that not all Turkish administrators were bad. Third, these critics also overlook the fact that Andric is no happier about the Austro-Hungarian occupation than he was about the Ottoman one (he sees the Austrians as less brutal and more \\"civilized\\" occupiers, but he laments the destruction of the old Visegrad caused by the Austrians' rationalizing and modernizing investments). Certainly Andric does not join Serb jingoists in seeing the Ottoman bridge which gives the book its name as an undesirable foreign element, in contrast to the Serb nationalists who, in the 1990s, blew up the Ottoman bridge which is the pride of Mostar's old town (CORRECTION: THE MOSTAR BRIDGE WAS BLOWN UP BY CROATS, NOT SERBS). And the portraits of the Muslim characters are as lovingly drawn as those of the Christian and Jewish ones. It will, for example, be hard for the reader to forget Alihodja, the character with whose death the book ends. People who find hate in this book find it only because they bring it with them. Andric was not a hater.Regarding Andric's relevance in today's world: a number of passages in this book have a prophetic quality, particularly at the end, where the beginning of the conflicts initiated by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo is described. The events recounted here concern the persecution of Serbs, but to today's well-informed reader, Andric's words will inevitably bring to mind images of the massacres of Bosniak Muslims in Visegrad, the town which serves as the setting for this book. \\"That wild beast, which lives in man and does not dare to show itself until the barriers of law and custom have been removed, was now set free. The signal was given, the barriers were down. ... A man who saw clearly and with open eyes and was then living could see how this miracle took place and how the whole of a society could, in a single day, be transformed. In a few minutes the business quarter, based on centuries of tradition, was wiped out. It is true that there had always been concealed enmities and jealousies and religious intolerance, coarseness and cruelty, but there had also been courage and fellowship and a feeling for measure and order, which restrained all these instincts within the limits of the supportable and, in the end, calmed them down and submitted them to the general interest of life in common. Men who had been leaders in the commercial quarter for forty years vanished overnight as if they had all died suddenly, together with the habits, customs and institutions which they represented.\\"[...]"},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Some years ago I set out to read something by all of the Nobel Prize novelists. This has resulted in some long searches and some (occassionally) boring books. However, it has, in general, been a most rewarding experience. One of the highlights thus far has been &quot;discovering&quot; &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;. Although I read the book 14 years ago, it has stayed with me.The basic story is using the construction of a bridge centuries ago to trace the history of the Balkan area (and, occassionally, country) of Bosnia. What makes the book interesting is what makes that area interesting; the many different ethnic groups that fought over and, sometimes, co-existed in this region where the Muslim crusades were stopped but not repulsed. There are many stories centered around the bridge and they tell not only of the history of the area but of the people as well. This is a well-written, absorbing book. I have read several other books since by Ivo Andric and they have been worthwhile as well. However, it is &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; that properly marked him as one of the better European authors of the 20th Century. This is a literary experience that you should not miss."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Ivo Andric describes the history of ex-Yugoslavian region through the building and a life of a bridge. Let this not fool you. The book is not devoid but infused with emotions, feelings, and will leave the reader in cold sweet. The brutality of the life in the historical perspective of the region is given much detail. Those who have weak stomach should be careful about reading the first few chapters. You will, when you finish reading this book, understand the region and the people a bit better. And maybe by understanding the region and the people, you will get a glimpse at the volatile soil of ex-Yugoslavia, grasping the centuries of fighting, all in hopes for freedom. Some questions of recent conflicts might be answered. And you will definitely pose many more questions.Andric received his Nobel Prize for this book, and the fact that it is one of few books written by an Yugoslavian author, which has been translated into many languages, shows its value in the international community of readers. It will hold you and it will fascinate you. You will want to throw up and it will make you cry. But, you will leave knowing that there is always a bridge leading you into realms unknown...is it heaven or hell? that is yours to decide."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"This fantastic novel describes the life in Bosnia during Turkish rule throughout the existence of the bridge on the beautiful river Drina. It's in fact describing the whole rule of Ottoman Empire over small Bosnian bridge and cities it connects. The actual perish of Ottoman reign over Bosnia is symbolized in the very last sentence of the novel. This is a great book that uncovers life in Bosnia in very vivid, terrified and truthful way, and not only those who understand the history of Bosnia throughout centuries, yet many others can appreciate this great literary work. Ivo Andric with his addictive writing adds more beauty to it."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"There is no more lyrical, enlightening and humane introduction to the vast historical, linguistic, religious and political puzzle that is the Balkans than this masterwork of Ivo Andric. I stress, however, \\"introduction,\\" as no fictional work can begin to address the myriad pieces of this most beautiful, terrible and vexing puzzle.Andric's tale, covering the life of multiple generations in a small city in eastern Bosnia, centers on the Ottoman bridge constructed in the center of town. Its high spans look down on the swirling waters of the Drina River, and at its center is a ballustrade-lined platform called a capia, which becomes the center of town life for centuries. Andric's lyrical prose is nothing short of magnificent, even in translation. His multitude of characters are insightfully and skillfully drawn. And ever the narrative returns to the bridge. In effect the novel is something akin to both Tolstoy and Michener, with a rich ironical voice reminiscent of the best Latin American writers.A word of caution, however. If you come to the novel seeking a definitive cause or motive for the Bosnian War, or the heartbreaking tragedies of the Balkans generally, present or past, you will come away misguided. Andric is merely the voice of one witness from one perspective. An understanding of the complexity of the the Balkans requires more than one voice, but rather a knowledge of Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, Hapsburg, German, Italian and Russian history; an understanding of Islam, Judaism, and the Roman and Orthodox Churches; and from a careful hearing of a multitude of other \\"voices.\\""},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"If you wish to capture the essence of the southern slavic ethos and historical trademark, read this book, embrace it, feel it. Ivo Andric masterfully collects pivotal traits of the Yugoslav people through centuries of occupation by Ottomans and Austrians. He grasps the crux of today's challenges in the Balkans: the scars by invaders and the thirst for national and even personal identity. I recommend every US government foreign services official and every NATO officer to read this book. I would also hope they'd understand it."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"The Turks built it, but many of the \\"Turks\\" were Balkan converts descended from the Slavic people of Bosnia, Serbia, and other regions. The eleven-arched bridge stood there, over the green Drina, for centuries, as the human parade passed over it. This wonderful novel tells the story of the people who lived nearby, of those who came to dominate the town from outside, and ultimately, who, in 1914, destroyed the stone span. As a novel that covers nearly 350 years, THE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA can have no continuous cast of characters. Instead, there are sharply drawn portraits of the inhabitants of Visegrad---Muslims, Serbs, Gypsies, and Jews---and the people who came from all over the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the days when that state occupied Bosnia (1878-1914). Just as Canadian novelist Hugh MacLennan's \\"Barometer Rising\\" has an explosion as the main character, so Andric has made a bridge the main character here. We meet the Turkish builders of the bridge and the local opposition to it. Accidents happen, an awful punitive impalement is described in gruesome detail. The townsmen meet on the kapia---a wide section of the bridge in its midsection--for centuries: it provides a place to talk and drink coffee, for youth to sing. A Turkish blockhouse is built in one period, to catch rebels, who fight for the end to Turkish rule. The bridge is decorated with the heads of luckless captives. The stone inn, built as a free lodging for travellers, declines and eventually collapses. A girl refuses the love of a young man who has seen her crossing the bridge, but the parents decide on a marriage. She jumps off the bridge to her death, but remains forever in the songs of townspeople. Resistance and rebellion swirl around the bridge during the 19th century before the Austro-Hungarian takeover in 1878. Gamblers appear, and maybe the Devil as well. A soldier is seduced by a Serbian woman who plans to smuggle a guerrilla leader across--he is jailed for his troubles and kills himself. Galician Jews come to run hotels and businesses, but lead sad lives. Early 20th century students argue and fight over clashing ideals---nationalism, communism, socialism. And at last the Great War empties the town and destroys the bridge. The world that so many generations had known came to an end. A vast panorama of history, philosophy, and romance fill this novel, which led to a Nobel Prize for its author in 1961. I read it over 40 years ago, but recently took it up again, having forgotten most of it. It blew me away again.The bridge is a real one. It suffered more damages during World War II in the vicious multi-sided fighting that wracked Yugoslavia. Then, during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, thousands of Muslims were murdered and pushed from that very bridge. The bloody history continued. On page 118, Andric writes, \\"moments of social upset and great inevitable change usually throw up just such men, unbalanced and incomplete, to turn things inside out or lead [men] astray. This is one of the signs of times of disorder.\\" These words, written so long before, describe Milosevic to a tee. As I read Andric's novel again---these thoughts added an extra tragic note to it.Yugoslavia is no more. It was an idea of a certain time. Perhaps it was a good one, perhaps not: I am in no position to judge. But no doubt a cultural flowering took place. When I read this marvelous book back in my twenties, it stimulated me to look into Yugoslav literature in general. I was not disappointed. I found the novels of Krleza, Djilas, Bulatovic, Vuco, and Oljaca, all of which enriched my life. But Andric was certainly the best. He is one of the great writers of the twentieth century. If you have never read him, you have missed something."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"I'm a yugoslav girl, we live in Holland.

That's why I love this book so much, it doesn't judge people just because of their ethnicity. We must all stop doing that, in a history, far far ago, we were ONE NATION, when we came here from behind the Carpats. And Ivo Andric is not a Bosnian Serb nor a Bosnian Croat, he's YUGOSLAV! The four reasons why the Balkan is so f**ked up are: 1)The Byzantium Empire, they made the Serbians orthodox 2)The Ottomans, they threw in the Islam 3) Austria-Hungary, they made the Croats catholic 4) The Slavic stubborness! If Andric was alive now, he would be ashamed because of us. We do not deserve his book if we cannot use it to bring lasting peace. The war, it broke my heart, as I still have a niece in Croatia who I never even met, because my uncle was kicked out because he's a Serb. Now he's a drunk, my parents are frustrated ever since the war and my life is hell. I just want the old Yugoslavia back, with it's tourism, music (Merlin, Oliver, Neda Ukraden and Crvena Jabuka) and no more judging!

Brilliant, even. It took me three chapters to warm myself to the translation and the writing (not easy when you generally read modern fiction) but once Ivo Andric steps into his comfortable armchair and begins to tell you about the characters who live in the town of Visegrad, it is not impossible to be anything but spell bound.The novel, really a series of interconnected short stories, brings the region to life. I retold the stories of the doomed bride, the love struck Galician guard tricked by a Turkish maiden and the gambler who plays cards with the devil to my daughter as we travelled through the Balkans, and every evening she asked for another tale.The bridge also symbolises the vibrant, but often turbulent, history of life at the cross roads of Turkish and Austrian history.

The bridge remains an object of fascination, though, since it stands as a permanent refutation of the equally intransigent conviction of the current Serb and Bosnian popular mindset which holds that the Turks were stupid and destructive.The stories Andric weaves in and out of this geographic reference point are interesting, and some graphic. None more so (to my mind) than the torture scene atop the bridge involving a wooden stake and someone being punished. I won't wreck it for the reader by going any further.20 years ago I spent part of an evening on this bridge with a Serb, who kept insisting that we play a game of trying to correlate each letter of the alphabet (the regular, non-cyrillic alphabet, thankfully) with the name of a famous river located anywhere in the Eurasian land mass.

The many Serbian readers say &quot;if he lived until 1992/if he saw the war, he would be sorry.&quot; No, on the contrary, first he would be quite happy to see the jingoistic SANU memorandum and the one million people meeting of Slobo at Kosovo Polje. He would, in fact, have loved it, since it signalled the beginning of the tragedy of Yugoslav Muslims whom he loathed so much.If we, the Serbs, refuse to accept the fact that what happened in Bosnia, and sadly in Kosovo, was our mistake, then expect the repetition of it, say, in Sumadija, Vojvodina, Crna Gora, etc.. Because of our primitive nationalism, inspired by people like Andric, Serbian and other people continue to pay heavy prices. We must stopblaming the Turks for all of our problems.It is a shame that he was awarded the Nobel Prize for hating the &quot;Turks&quot;, i.e. all Muslims living in the Balkans, as Serbian and Croat fascists like to call them.(I know that it is strange to write these in Valjevo.)"},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"This is a serious, even compelling work of historical fiction, but it is not a masterpiece. It is far too episodic, and more importantly, does not fully bring to history the richness and passion and aesthetic power of literature. For example, the putative climax, the destruction of the bridge is extremely weak, even without purpose.There is an interesting parallel (perhaps not coincidental)between the beginning of The Bridge on the Drina and Kadare's The Three-Arched Bridge.

I am not a glutton in reading, though, as there are books I will not read, and regret reading a few that I did. I will advise you of three novels not to read, as they are bad for your mind and emotions. People often know the bad effects of food they eat, but are less knowledgeable about the possible bad effects of what they put into their minds. Of course, I would not stop anyone from reading (as I would not stop an adult from eating, but I tend to avoid people who are obese who do not have a medical reason for it, and people of poor reading habits), but knowing what is undesirable will help counter the bad effects, ---as perhaps exercise helps counter the bad effects of fried foods, fat, salt, sugar, processed food and bad carbohydrates.1- The Sadistic: The Bridge on the Drina, by Ivo Andric.Andric's book had been on my list to read since adolescence. I was not enthusiastic to read him because I had been informed of the sadism displayed in his book, the first of his historical trilogy of Bosnia,--- oh, dear!One time at a library book sale I discovered a copy, and bought it for a dollar. I was reluctant to begin reading it, but then I thought I owed it to my education to do so. I lasted not much further than one hundred pages, maybe to 120 or so. At that point, Andric was describing in excruciating detail the impalement of an opponent of the regime by the brutal rulers of it and in loving detail, as I perceived. I put down the book, and thought about it for a few days, and then tossed it into the garbage. I did not and do not want to know what being impaled means in its entirety. (It is not a simple pounding of a stake through the heart, but is crueler than that. It is more torturous than crucifixion. Christ would have welcomed crucifixion rather than impalement. )A number of years later, I found another copy of Andric's book at a yard sale, and this time for a quarter. I bought it, brought it home, thought about it overnight, and then tossed it into the trash. I am perfectly educated without having read that book.Ivo Andric won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1975. Good luck to all who read him.*(I have thought for a number of years that the Nobel Committee is an organization that is very much overdue for a thorough investigation and savage cleaning, especially for its decisions in literature and politics. It now gives the peace prize for presumption of good works, as in the recent award (2009), and maybe soon for presumption for a literary work yet to be written. All of Western society was affected by brutal violence, once the Indian killing and the Civil War in America cleared the way for it, and the prize for Andric is the result. The Nobel Committee needs a cleansing like Hercules at the Augean stables.)2- The Obese - Gravity's Rainbow, by Thomas Pynchon.I had purchased Pynchon's first book, V, back in the 1960s, and found it worth reading. I also read The Crying of Lot 49, and accepted it as par for the course for novels that were published at the time. I will admit that I have not retained a great deal from these fashionable novels, though I meant to keep up with Pynchon's work.About fifteen years ago, I picked up Gravity's Rainbow. I dutifully began reading it, and thought I was getting into it, ---though I could not see where it was going, but then I reacted. It is a huge book, well over 700 pages in small print. I had far too many things to do and other books to read than to continue with this fat slob of a book. It must contain more words than all the rest of the works in the western tradition from Homer, both Testaments, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Whitman and all the books in the American literary tradition. I could not and cannot bear the ponderings of the fatso literary mind as displayed in the book. (It appeared to me that Pynchon had got hold of a word processor, a novelty at the time he started to write his book, I assume, and could not let go.)There are at least two ways to hit a target. One way is to load a double-barreled shotgun with buckshot, stand about five feet from the bull's-eye, and blast away. Of course the bull's-eye will be hit, and even blown to bits along with the rest of the target and the fence on which it was fastened. Another way is to use a high-powered rifle, stand three miles away, aim carefully, and---Zoooooook!---send a single bullet directly into the center of the bull's-eye. I would prefer the second way, in target shooting and in literary composition, as it is more skillful and satisfying in style. It indicates a disciplined mind.Gustave Flaubert, the great 19th century French novelist and the writer who established the modern idiom of the novel, was an advocate of finding the exact word (le mot juste) to describe his compositions, and thus preferred the high-powered rifle style. Pynchon, in Gravity's Rainbow, took the shotgun approach and used every word he ever learned and many thousands of times. He can thus, in his novel, be described as the ultimate anti-Flaubertian (Flaubertesque?) writer. Of course, modern fiction is given much latitude in narrative form, but I do not care to lard my mind with such lard as did Pynchon. But again, if everything possible is said then I guess a writer gets to say what he wants to say, or mean, eventually, whatever it is. If you say everything then eventually you will say something significant, ---I suppose. If you could disentangle what he might have meant from what he wrote, you might have something. But that is the le mot juste style. Have fun when you read the book.Pynchon has written other novels since Gravity's Rainbow, but I lost interest in him, as I have for most modern fiction because I find it narrow-minded, specious and contingent.3- The Bloodthirsty - Blood Meridian, by Cormac McCarthy.First of all, this book cannot be called a novel because it does not have character development. The main characters, though I am being kind in calling them so, the Judge and \\"the Kid\\" remain throughout the novel exactly the same, evil incarnate and stupidity incarnate. Modern fiction is given much latitude in format, but this book needs another genre. I suggest it be classified as Horror Fiction for Intellectuals, because in McCarthy's book the hero (or whatever) dies; in Horror Fiction for adolescents, the hero lives and triumphs. This is the only literary difference between the two genres. (It is a male companion piece to the romance novel genre, but in a studly way. Whereas the romance novel has \\"romantic rape\\" at its core, Blood Meridian has actual rape, torture and murder, the \\"shoot \`em up\\" style of writing.)Another first of all is that I read the book on the advice of Harold Bloom. It was the worse literary advice I ever got. (Unlike Bloom, I was unable - and thankfully - to overcome my repugnance of the book. The problem with Bloom is that he has read so much that he could take the advertising blurb on a tube of toothpaste and write a critical thesis of American intellectual history based on it.) The book is a monolithic, monomaniac working out of the critical thesis assumed by Bloom that America is an absolutely bloodthirsty place with its heroes (a la Billy Budd) reticent, even mute, sacrificial and barely even interactive with their environment. Such a hero is indistinguishable from a stupid and nave bystander. In fact, McCarthy's so-called ur-hero (or whatever), \\"the Kid\\" is totally non-comprehending to the point of not even understanding the context of his life. He is a mute and a neuter, stupid and unheroic and is qualitatively different than Melville's Billy Budd. He deserves to get killed in a toilet by the Judge. The book represents the dumbing-down of American literature, a cynical view of the author. It seems that the crude, primitive, adolescent development of America has found its nadir in McCarthy's work. It derives from the belief that the source or truth of things is \\"down- diggety-deep\\" in the psychic life of man, derived from Freud and company. Such belief is a metaphor and no more true or false than the view that all things good, true, beautiful and rational are from the \\"above\\" and beyond. (There is the possibility that McCarthy wrote his book in belief and to the life, alas if so.)As Bloom taught, so McCarthy wrote, though they may have never met, and maybe all the worse for it. While it is true that a new novel takes some of its power from novels written previously, it still has to stand on its own, --- and Blood Meridian does not. All the books in Bloom's head have filled the gaps of McCarthy's novel. You have heard that America is one long bloody fight. McCarthy's book is a working out of that thesis in mangled, dying flesh. No one needs to tell me that, though, and so the book is redundant. The book, further, is to be comprehended by sociology, and not by literature, a deadly error. It is a derivative work of literature, and not a novel.The worst thing about McCarthy's book, however, is that he wasted my time in reading it, as all his percepts and brutalities can be picked up elsewhere. There is nothing new in it: slaughter in the West; a superhuman (and perverted) villain; a moronic hero; hatred of the other (Native Americans). It may be the full working out of Manifest Destiny in the American West, an ideology made of bloody flesh.Blood Meridian represents the end of the novel in America in what may be called The Literature of the Republic. (Now it is time to consider a canon for The Literature of the American Empire.)*I am perfectly cognizant that my advice will not put off anyone from reading the books but may whet their appetite for them. Consider that I intended it.[I may write a separate review of Blood Meridian in a new format for review literature. It will have as its title: Blood Redundant: The Novel of the American Bloodlust. Or, perhaps I will call it Manifest Destiny: The Book of Indian-Killing.](TRC Final Revision 12-03-09)"},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"It's a sad state of affairs when a work of fiction (like the above mentioned book) is used and quoted as a historical fact. The people that look to this book as an explaination of the Bosnian problem are narrow minded to say the least. They remind me of those that quote the &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; to justify their bigotry. This book ought to remain what it is a work of fiction and nothing else."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"This is not a masterpiece, this is a book that contains misinformation and cunning propaganda. Andric's main aim is to depict Muslims as archaic, primitive and intransigent. In my view, Andric is prejudiced, biased and intolerant. However, the book's literary value remains relatively high but the fact that bigotry pervades the entire book seriously undermines the book as a whole. Irrefutably, sweeping generalizations and preconceived ideas characterize the book. His subtle yet highly insidious misconceptions of the Turks are evident throughout the book. These points should be kept in mind before reading this book. Some reviewers have asserted that Andric's historical account helps explain the causes of the Bosnian war. This assertion is fallacious, baised and naive. Basically, the message that Andric attempts to convey to the reader is that Muslims are evil, barbaric, atavistic and intractable. The question that comes to mind is why was Andric awarded a prize when he was prejudiced, biased and cunning? Parochialism characterizes the entire book. It seems that books that criticize Islam are highly popular and valuable."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Andric outlines the history of Bosnia in a series of episodes over three centuries, from the Turkish kidnapping of the young Serbian boy who became an Ottoman vizier to the bridge's destruction in World War I by Austrian artillery. The bridge dominates life in the Bosnian town of Visegrad and, in Andric's hands, assumes a personality. Memorable episodes include the story of Radislav, a Serb ferryman who tries to preserve his livelihood; the beautiful Fata, who uses the bridge to escape an arranged marriage; and the gambler, who bets his life and soul against the devil. The Swedish Academy did not err when it picked Andric for the Nobel Prize. This is a magnificent achievement, and it should not be missed."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"This novel is trully a masterpiece of literature.

One nation's concept of \\"justice\\" or \\"right\\" does not necessarily make sense in another area, in another culture - which after all, may be better than our own in some absolute sense.Just read how the locals regarded the entry of Austro-Hungarian troops in the 1870s. Even though they represented the consensus of the European great powers (much like the IFOR, etc. of recent vintage), even though they brought with them sanitation, clean and well-lighted streets and equal justice for all - they were not welcome.This book got the Nobel Prize for good reason.

When anyone interested in the Foreign Service asks me for good reads, this is always on it, even though Andric's description of impaling prisoners alive is something that can come back to haunt you in the middle of the night.

Readers looking for insight into the labyrinth of Balkan history will find here a useful starting point. At heart, this is a book about civilization and its changes. It pivots upon the contrast between the small parochial existence of the quiet Bosnian town where the bridge is the central and everlasting feature versus the wider world of Balkan politics where Ottoman Turkey, Orthodox Serbia, and Catholic Austria-Hungary wage a centuries-long battle for political domination.The book chronicles the bridge and the town for over three centuries. It is filled with memorable characters, soldiers, lovers, saloon-keepers, priests, and town leaders. There is the 19th-century schoolmaster who embodies the parochial village so perfectly. He is better-educated than most of the townspeople, but only slightly. This reputed wisdom gives him the arrogance to act as the town historian, a duty he fulfills by keeping a small notebook in which he fails to record historical events. Even the seminal affairs of 1878, when the region was transferred from the Ottomans to the Habsburgs, merits only a few lines in his notebook because he judges that these events are simply not terribly important. And that captures the essence of the book: events in the wider world are deemed unimportant in the village until they come, like the flood in the early pages, in a torrent of change and surprise.Thus does the town evolve, isolated from, yet thoroughly buffeted by, the great historical affairs of the centuries. In the end Pavle the merchant finds that this myopic approach has led him to ruin. Alihodja, whose unique ability to articulate the impact of world politics on the lives of the town's provincials earns him an injured ear and a reputation as an eccentric, never quite realizes how closely his vision entwines his fate with that of the bridge itself.The standard interpretation holds that the bridge is the symbol for the Ottoman Empire, resolute and everlasting, welcoming yet exotic, and built to standards far higher than any to which this little town can aspire. In the original title Andric uses the word for a Turkish bridge (cuprija) and not the standard Serbo-Croatian word for bridge (most). Yet at the same time, the bridge resists this symbolism. It is not a bridge from the past to the future, or from the village to the wider world, or between Christian Europe and Muslim Turkey. It is simply a sturdy stone bridge. While the uncomplicated lives of the townsfolk dip and yaw in full color, and while the ponderous events of the outside world roll on in inscrutable ways, the bridge remains unchanged. The true symbols in the book are the rich and detailed characters who live and die by the Drina river. Each has something to tell us, and none is superfluous. These characters describe for us the consequences of conflict and cooperation in a comfortable little town caught in uncomprehending suffering by its location along one of history's great fault lines. The bridge... the bridge simply spans the Drina, as it always has."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"The bridge on the Drina continues to stand witness to political changes in the Balkans while the ethnic mosaic of the region remains more or less static. Andric has done a remarkable job of explaining the intracies of Balkan society through his story. Using the bridge as an eyewitness to 500 years of history, we see the rise and fall of empires as a community of Serbs, Croats, Jews, Christians and Moslems live, love and work side by side.Contrary to what the media would have us believe, the ethnic groups of the Balkans have not \\"hated one another for 500 years and will continue to do so.\\" This book portrays Balkan life in a much more realistic manner than many newly published books on the subject have. If you are interested in the Balkans and are searching for a balanced view of what society was like before the current troubles, read this book. While it is fiction, the patterns of daily life, the social interactions and inter-ethnic relationships portrayed by Andric are right on the money. Little wonder this fabulous story was awarded the Pulitzer Prize when it first came out."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Andric writes a fictional, yet truthful, history of the bridge at Visegrad which stood for centuries. The key to the book, from a reader interested in this from a more historical perspective rather than a literary viewpoint, is that the tensions between the different residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina are apparent. From the Turkish occupation to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the factions intertwine throughout the history of the town and the bridge. Although told, or translated, in a slow, laconic style, the writing was wonderful. The individual stories were well told and kept the history of the bridge moving forward.I enjoyed this book quite a bit. After reading it, I felt that I understood this part of the world better -- and that I had a better perspective on my ancestors (Radenovic or Ragenovich) from Montenegro who emigrated to the US in the 19th century"},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Ivo Andric and his \\"Bridge on the Drina\\" were an extremely great surprise. I truly did not expect to enjoy the book when I first picked it up. What I found was a rich treasure of Bosnian history. I understand that the work is fiction, but it seemed like such a true glimpse of history. Andric was a master of giving characters throughout the book that stoked the interest of the reader. The main character was the bridge itself. Everything and everyone else centered around this great old Turkish bridge. We see hundreds of years pass by over the reading of this book. Each of those new generations faces new challenges, from the days before a bridge existed, to the days of World War I. Everything in between gives detailed day to day experiences, intertwining generations and people. Andric really had a talent worthy of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature, which he won for this book. You owe it to yourself to get a copy and glimpse the past in a special way."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"A lifelong Slavicist with particular love for the former Yugoslavia drove me to this book early in my studies of the Balkans. I read the book with no particular appreciation for what I was reading several years ago, and I recently reread it (it is definitely a book that warrants rereading for its attention to detail, its excellent descriptions, and its ability to shed light on the history of the Balkan region-- particularly for those, like me, who are not native to the region.) I traveled to the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Croatia) last year, and after having been there, I gained a whole new appreciation for this book. The most fitting way to describe it is to say that it is vivid, alive, and enduring. I loved it. It tells the story of a noble and fascinating people and culture."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"This is the story of a bridge, built by the Turks in the sixteenth century, the gift to his homeland of Grand Vizer Mehmed Pasha. The bridge is the hero and the location of the story, which is the history of a town based on what happened on and around the bridge. When reading it, one finds it difficult to believe that it was allowed to be published in a Communist country! At any rate, the author gives equal treatment to the Moslems, Christians, and Jews that live in the town that grew up around the bridge. In fact, one of the most hard-working and lovable characters is a Jewish woman named Lotte, who manages the hotel owned by her brother-in-law. I highly recommend the book, although you should read it in a different printing edition than the one I read as the quality of the material used was very bad -- pages started falling out of the book before I was even halfway finished..."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Although this book is fiction, it provides some excellent insights into the complexities of the problems and issues that are present in Bosnia-Hercegovina today. Having spent a year in Bosnia (dealing with both the BiH Federation and the Republika Srpska) as a peace keeper back in 1995-96, I witnessed and participated in modern-day versions of the events and stories told in Mr Andric's book. &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; highlites the diverse and complex interpersonal relationships of all the Yugoslavian peoples (not only Bosnian Serb, Muslim, and Croat, but the Jews and Gypsies as well) and attempts to give the reader an understanding of why the &quot;Bosnian Problem&quot; is not an easy &quot;problem&quot; to solve. Read the book for what it is, fiction, but take away what Mr Andric most likely intended it to be - an insight into a region (in which some may argue the center of Europe, and others the frontier or border between west and east) of cultural, religious, political, economic, and ethnic differences that resulted from hundreds of years of external influences. For myself, it all became clearer in Chapter XIX - could these external influences be put in check, the people would most likely solve the &quot;problem&quot;. This is my opinion of having spent 12 months living and talking with Bosnian Serbs, Muslims, and Croats who I am very much reminded of in the characters of Mr Andric's book."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"I have the book in the original. Edwards' translation is terrible. He has not only a dubious aesthetic sense, but his grasp of the Serbian language is wanting. In places the translation is literal; in places it is wrong. There is scarcely a line of dialogue translated flawlessly. I recommend keeping all this in mind when reading.On the other hand, Andric's chronicle is all it aspires to be. It is a careful description of the famous Bosnian town where he spent his childhood, the town that hugs the bridge that Mehmed-pasha Sokolovichi built. Naturally, the portion of it which intersects his life, and which consists of the twenty-two years that pass from 1892 to 1914, will be found more interesting than the rest, in my opinion; but Andric knows his weakness, and the bulk of the book lies just in that portion."},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"Firstly, I remember reading this book in my native tounge, the one Andric used to write this book. That was during the last years of my high school. First thing I remember was that it was very hard to read it, initially though, due to the language and style Andric used. After 20-30 pages I could not leave the book. It is a beautiful work which I was thought is a close interpretation of the real history of that region. It is a story of a small town on the river Drina, river that separates Bosnia and Serbia. The 'hero' or the book is the Bridge built in (i believe) 15th century. Andric tells the story where everything changes trough times while the bridge still stands there as a testament to what has passed. It truly deserved the Nobel Prize it got. Recommendation is just read it.For two people down posting about his etnicity. Ivo Andric was a catholic who said that he was born Croat but saw himself as a Yugoslav, but would always be a Serb at heart. I thing that is where Miletic and most of the Serbs get the idea that he was a Serb. The way I remember him (reading about him :-) ), i.e. what most people describe him as, is a great caring person one that truly loved people from that region (especially people from Bosnia), a true example of what most people of that region are really like.Cheers"},{"Title":"The bridge on the Drina (A Signet classic)","review":"My initial opinion of the novel after reading it was that it was average at best. But now, after a few days spent absorbing what I had just read, I have a new found appreciation for the novel. Small things such as the symbolism of the repairing of the bridge, or the connection it representated both physically and metaphorically between two different peoples. As many other people who reviewed it have remarked, it is a powerful as well as informative novel that sheds light on the situation in that area of the world, even if it's a work of fiction. The detail given to life in the city makes it come alive and the sheer scale of the novel leaves me feeling as though I have lived there my whole life.

Those unwitting purchasers who expect an anthology of provocative, mid-60s New Wave tales by Sturgeon are going to be disappointed.To be fair to Sturgeon, many tales by other authors, released in the SF literature during the interval 1940 - 1961, suffer from the same faults and defects present in the stories in 'Starshine': excessive wordiness, poorly written dialogue, internal monologues overloaded with run-on sentences, and unimaginative re-workings of the same narrow set of themes.The anthology opens with \`Derm Fool' (1940) about a regular joe caught in a quirky situation; there is a swell dame he needs to impress.\`The Haunt' (1941) is also about a regular joe who is trying to impress a swell dame; the plan involves a putative haunted house.\`Artnan Process' (1941) deals with two capable Earthmen sent to a remote planet to discover the secret of an energy conversion process. There is an emphasis on humor.\`The World Well Lost' (1953): two alien lovebirds /refugees come to Earth; placating their planet of origin requires deporting them back home, an act that troubles a crew member aboard the deportation ship. The story's clumsy, obtuse prose overwhelms its 'daring' subtext.\`The Pod and the Barrier' (1957): a starship crew must venture to breach a deadly force field. Much angst and drama among the crew.\`How to Kill Aunty' (1961): a bedridden old lady is engaged in a quiet, vicious war of wits with her sulking, homicidal nephew / estate inheritor.Even determined Nostalgists are going to find little to be excited about in 'Starshine'."},{"Title":"Starshine","review":"I remember Harlan Ellison writing about his dead friends inAngry Candyand being particularly angry with an obituary writer that didn't know Theodore Sturgeon. After reading this book, I can see why. Sturgeon was one of those strange brilliant writers that managed to push the genre past the pure science/theoretical/rocket ship ghetto. His characters are slightly borsht belt (even lower east side) but his grasp of the human experience is excellent.While many of these stories are the genre tropes - the weak man trying to kill his overbearing aunt, the space con artists against the slightly befuddled aliens, the haunted house - they manage to feel fresh under the expert hand of Sturgeon.Granted, once the book is over you forget it, but it's wonderful light reading and deserves classic status much more than the current batch of \\"classics\\" from that era (no I didn't like Saul Bellow. I foundSeize the Day (Penguin Classics)a plodding mess. And don't even get me started on Arthur Miller)"},{"Title":"Producing Culture and Capital : Family Firms in Italy","review":"Although I'm Italian and interested in the fashion/textile industry, I wasn't aware of the historical backgrounds of the most prestigeous Italian families who started textile businesses early in the Century. The author did an awesome job in gathering all the information the book contains. This book will help you get an idea of: where the major Italian textile firms are located around the lake Como; what are the families' styles and traditions beyond the businesses; and, ultimately, which are their characteristics. Simply intersting and amusing book."},{"Title":"Producing Culture and Capital : Family Firms in Italy","review":"Professor Yanagisako undertakes an ethnographic study of thirty-eight family firms in northern Italy's silk industry from an anthropological perspective in order to go against the prevailing theories propounded by Weberian and Marxist scholars that capitalism can be self-perpetuating that requires no culturally motivated agents to reproduce or capitalism is the rational and calculated pursuit of profit and accumulation in which the effects of culture towards the diffusion of capitalism in the western world are not long-term and stronger. To her, culture and capitalism are not oxymoron and they can be mutually interdependent.In this book, Professor Yanagisako undertakes a critical reconsideration of the concept of culture within the framework of anthropology as an analysis of family capitalism in Italy. She rejects the widespread notion that western capitalism is a homogenising and acultural force. She maintains that capital is accumulated, dispersed, and reproduced through historically specific cultural processes which are being formed through everyday practices of entrepreneurs. By studying sentiments, identities, kinship and gender of family firms in northern Italy's silk industry, she suggests that the application of cultural essentialist theory in the study of family capitalism in northern Italy cannot fully account for diverse everyday practices of family firms in the same geopolitical space. To her, we cannot view culture as a fixed and unchanging system and entrepreneurial practices within a specific national or regional space as homogeneous.Professor Yanagisako interviews family firm founders and their family members and relatives. She also collects information from \\"Camera di Commercio\\" (Chamber of Commerce) in the provincial office that contains more detailed quantitative and qualitative data surrounding family firms. According to her findings, family firm founders are used to be depicted as \\"men of strong character\\" (P. 40), and \\"accentratori\\" (P.88) (making all the decision themselves), whereas there are sparse descriptions of founder's wives with such distinctive characters and personalities. The strength and character of the emotional bonds within the family become a productive force that enables family firms to survive and prosper. Amongst thirty-eight family firms, Professor Yanagisako finds that the practices of family firm founders in the upper, middle, and lower bourgeoisie factions vary even though they have similar sentiments, desires, and meanings of kinship and gender and therefore, they differ as regards capital accumulation, diversification, and reproduction. Chapter 5 (\\"Betrayal as a Force of Production\\" ) of the book is very interesting for its in-depth analysis of a recurring process of how betrayal and trust can lead to continuation and breakdown of solidarity of family firms.This book should be read by readers who are interested in culture and family capitalism because it provides a new perspective towards the concept of culture and many particular insights and razor-sharp analyses of family capitalism. Resulting from rigorous integration of theories and empirical evidence made by Professor Yanagisako, this book is also strongly recommended as a good piece of scholar work for ethnographic researchers in the domains of family firms, entrepreneurship, and cultural studies."},{"Title":"Innocent When You Dream: The Tom Waits Reader","review":"I grabbed this book on the way to the emergency room -- something to hold onto while waiting and freaking.

It opens with a foreword by Frank Black and an introduction by Mac Montandon.Part One: Early Years, contains the following amongst many others: The 1974 press release for Heart Of Saturday Night by Waits himself; A short interview with Clark Peterson of Creem magazine from 1978 titled The Slime Who Came In From The Cold; from 1976, there is an article from Sweet & Sour, a long Zig Zag interview and a New Yorker article.The 1977 Rolling Stone piece by David McGee is very informative and from 1979 there is a short Washington Post article. This section also contains a poem by Charles Bukowski with a short introduction noting that it captures the entire Waitsian world.In Part Two: The Middle Years, I found the following to be the most compelling: Peter Sabbag's in-depth 1987 article from the Los Angeles Times Magazine, a long formal question and answer interview by Glen O'Brien in a 1985 Spin magazine, 20 Questions from a 1988 Playboy and another question and answer interview from 1989 with Elvis Costello in Option.Part Three: These Days, offers inter alia the following informative pieces: A 1999 Billboard review of Mule Variations and a short 1999 live review by Jon Pareles from the New York Times. From the same year there is a short review by Luc Sante in The Village Voice and an engaging conversational piece by David Fricke in Rolling Stone. There is also a short question and answer session from a 2004 Vanity Fair.This section concludes with Nirvana, a 1992 poem by Charles Bukowski. It was included because in an interview with Soma magazine in 2002, Waits referred to this as his favorite poem. The book concludes with a Discography and a Timeline from Waits' birth on 7th December 1949 to the release of his 2004 album Real Gone. The book documents his entire career and is perhaps better than any biography as it contain so many perspectives from so many different writers."},{"Title":"Innocent When You Dream: The Tom Waits Reader","review":"I bought this book on Amazon thinking it would be a hip birthday gift bound to please a huge Tom Waits fan.

Tom is absurd. This book is a load of fun. Makes me feel now like I did when I read Vonnegut in high school. Very little on the creative process, as Waits is no less creative in talking to interviewers as he is with his music.Only downside is that a great bit of the NPR interview is left out when Tom grumbles at Terry Gross' suggestion that the song \\"God's Away On Business\\" is atheistic. \\"No. He's away on business. God's a busy guy. He'll be back.\\" or something like that. See I wouldn't have to misquote it if it was in the book.

It's engrossing, entertaining and enlightening. Editor Mac Montandon has done an excellent job of editing this volume, bringing together a collection of essays, interviews and other Waits-ian writings that accomplishes the seemingly impossible--rekindling that exhilirating feeling of discovery nearly every person who's ever listened to Tom Waits for the first time has come away with. No small feat. The Frank Black piece is the icing on a rum-soaked cake of a book that is a delight from start to end."},{"Title":"Innocent When You Dream: The Tom Waits Reader","review":"Excellent book. This book is a collection of interviews, show reviews and magazine and newspaper articles spanning Waits's career. Most of the interviews are from the perspective of the average reporter who has no way of getting at the center of the Waits Tutsie Roll Pop (\\"How many licks does it take to get to the center?\\") and that provides an interesting perspective in that the reader gets to see how Waits chooses to portray himself. However, some of the interviews are done by close friends, like Elvis Costello and Jim Jarmusch (\\"Down by Law\\" and \\"Night on Earth\\"), and the reader gets a glimpse of maybe who the true Waits is. It's a great contrast even if it wasn't intended to be the focus of the collection.Another captivating aspect of the book is that the reader is provided details about all the unique methods Waits uses to make his music. For example, on \\"The Earth Died Screaming\\", sound effects are made by having people bang sticks and 2x4s on the pavement of the studio parking lot.A must have for any Waits fan!And it's nearly 400 pages long!!"},{"Title":"Innocent When You Dream: The Tom Waits Reader","review":"If you're a fan of an artist, it's difficult, time-consuming and expensive to keep track of all the interviews and articles written about your favourite artist.

They are very interesting and it's nice to have them all compiled into a single book. I think it's great that Frank Black wrote the Foreword. He did a good job.However, I don't know this Mac Montandon guy (the editor). In the Introduction, his only original writing throughout the book (4 pages long), he managed to make an error. He said that the song \\"Coney Island Baby\\" was on the album \\"Alice.\\" Which, of course, is wrong. That song is on \\"Blood Money.\\" I'm sure it was an innocent mistake, but why wasn't it caught after a few edits? I mean, it was only four pages of information to edit. Couldn't the publisher at least have an intern go through and make sure all the songs and albums corresponded correctly? Anyway, as harmless as this error may seem, I think it is pretty amateur.Overall, this book receives four stars. It is really a good collection and an interesting read. However, it is not a biography. Therefore, it is not deserving of five stars. Mac Montandon receives three stars. I appreciate him for compiling the interviews, but do not appreciate his error. Frank Black receives four stars because he is Frank Black - and because he did a good job with the Foreword (look for the lyric references!)."},{"Title":"Innocent When You Dream: The Tom Waits Reader","review":"It's great to have a well edited selection of material on the man. With so much out there on such a prolific artist you can get lost. In addition, an intelliegent eye on familiar material adds depth to your understanding and appreciation."},{"Title":"Innocent When You Dream: The Tom Waits Reader","review":"This book is not a biography. It is a collection of articles and interviews in which The Man, Tom Waits, is sole subject. Since Waits has remained private about his life, you can count on wondering about many of the answers he provides for writers during interviews. But then again, this is typical Waits, and if you seriously mind it, you're probably not a huge Waits fan in the first place.The articles cover about thirty, thirty-five years of Waits' career, describing here his difficulty finding an audience early on and there his inimitable stage antics and style. Many of the articles themselves note how he has remained quiet about his personal life but the writers still find reasons to ask him questions to which they probably know they won't receive straight answers. Expect a lot of chatting, expect a lot of humor in place of honesty. Expect frankness and self-deprecation. In short, you have to love him in order to read this book. If you don't like his music (and frankly, anyone who likes sound should listen to his records) then you'll probably put this book down almost immediately.But you're probably interested in this book and reading this review because you happen to like his music. Good, that's a start. Well, you, dear fans, will love the stories, even if some of them you've heard before. I have found, listening to almost his entire discography, that Waits repeats his yarns or puts different spins on them, uses the same jokes, etc. So what. Anyway, you'll find some of them here. And you'll probably read the whole thing anyway because you want to know everything there is to know about him. In that case, I have to admit, the book does, besides providing the occasional in-depth writings that reveal interesting things (whether about Waits, music or life in general), the book is made up partially of a great deal of filler, some short articles remarking on his history. Several articles and reviews, in light of Waits recording again or releasing a new album, simply jot down his discography and tell little of anything new. You probably know some of Waits' songs were made into huge hits by other artists (\\"Ol' 55\\" covered by the Eagles, \\"Downtown Train\\" by Rod Stewart... you're going to learn that several, several times). So expect repetition, because you're going to get it.As for everything else, hey, it's Tom Waits.

His work is interesting and deals with a part of life few people really care to discover. It's cool to read anything about Tom and try to discover what makes him tick. He's a human-interest story.

After its discovery by a Spanish Corporal, the book goes into the stories that happend on this land. While some of the characters recur, most of the characters are forgotten after their story is told. Steinbeck's character descriptions are the masterwork that is expected of him. However, since there is no running theme aside from the land itself, the reader may have difficulty maintaining interest. Without a main character, it is difficult to be drawn in to the story.Each chapter in the book starts a separate story. Some of the stories are amusing. I found the story in Chapter IV to be the best. Other stories such as Chapter IX seem to lack any coherence with the rest of the stories, but serve only the purpose of forwarding an opinion on a social issue. In the case of Chapter IX, Steinbeck is discussing the ethics of the death penalty.While fans of Steinbeck are certain to read this book, casual fans are unlikely to enjoy it. The Steinbeck fan who reads all of his work is likely to find some of the stories enjoyable."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"I had never heard of Steinbeck's Pastures of Heaven before stumbling across it by accident. Since this book has never had the fame of Steinbeck's later novels - East of Eden, Grapes of Wrath, etc. - it's unfamiliar to many readers. It's shouldn't be! These laconic inter-connected stories tell of the people who come to make their homes in the Salinas Valley. Some folks send out roots and live there for generations. Others move though the small town like tumbleweeds. As a whole they weave a tapestry that is at once specific to the time and place, yet universal to the American experience.In many ways Pastures of Heaven reminds me to Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio. But where much of Anderson's book dealt with dreams lost, set aside or abandoned, Steinbeck puts his faith in the American spirit.Also, for those who have read and cherished Steinbeck's later novels, let them find the seeds of later characters and themes in Pastures. Even in his early career Steinbeck was developing the prototypes of the Trasks and the Joads and others."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"Steinbeck was a young man and unknown writer when he wrote and first published this book, but you wouldn't know it by the beautiful prose and the moving set of stories, all taking place in Pastures of Heaven, an idilic valley in early-20th-century Monterey County, California.This is an accessible book, populated with a diverse group of memorable characters that reflect many aspects of human nature. Also very present is Steinbeck's love for the natural world and the places in the California Central Coast where he was born and grew up alongside the simple people. But this book transcends regionalisms and it is beautiful literature that can be enjoyed by anyone anywhere, decades after its conception.While many people would recommend to read first Steinbeck's tougher books such as \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Of Mice and Men\\", I say \\"Pastures of Heaven\\", despite being a relatively obscure book in his career, would serve as a fine introduction to his art, particularly if the reader is not looking for the strong social themes of his best-known works. On the same vein, \\"The Long Valley\\", published years later and depicting a more mature writing style, is another terrific series of short-stories taking place in the same world of Salinas Valley/Monterey (\\"Steinbeck Country\\")."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"A beautiful story about the disintegration of a farming community.

Steinbeck goes through great lengths to show that this valley is a paradise lost, an Eden. Then he gets to the people in the valley, their lives, the true depths of the what the valley's inhabitants live with. This examination of the Salinas Valley, its toilers, hypocrits, inhabitants all in one, is Steinbeck's first. He underlines all the themes his later works will take, all the form, all the understanding, all the compassion is there. This is Steinbeck on his road to greatness with a series of enjoyable (if not disheartening) tales."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"A wonderful read. Each chapter would draw me in.

Every time I revisit Steinbeck I wonder why it has taken me so long to return. Steinbeck remains a giant. His name should be remembered with the likes of Tolstoy or Mark Twain: a master of his craft. Even in this early work, his affection for people, his understanding and compassion, his faith in our awkward grace comes through every word. If you have never read anything he has written, this is a fine place to start. If you have read him several times over, this is a fine place to continue. Though it is possible to look at this work as a palette for what will become East of Eden, that should not take anything away from what he has done here. This is a book that some day, you might read again to enjoy it just as much as you enjoyed it the first time ... every time I read Steinbeck I leave a little better for the experience:a little more forgiving of myself and the world around me, a little more curious, a little more open, a little happier for it."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"Be aware that the paperback version of this book is a few dollars cheaper than the digital file.

I understand that The Pastures of Heaven is one of his best works. I don't think there is a bad John Steinbeck book. I have read most of his works and have enjoyed every book. I love Steinbeck's characters and the time and location of his stories are always interesting and entertaining. The feeling, style and language of the 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's are perfectly captured in his books. There is always a moral or biblical tie in his novels and it's fun to try to figure out the real plot of the novel. I am looking forward to reading this book and know that it will be a work of art."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"\`The Pastures of Heaven' is the second book of Steinbeck's to be published and rather than being a straight forward novel, this is more a collection of short stories that feature the same characters throughout. I have read numerous Steinbeck books and have yet to be disappointed and this one is no exception. You get his beautiful descriptions, unique characterisations and short self contained stories that explore a range of human emotions. These stories are set within a California valley, near Salinas, where many of his other books are also set. Of all Steinbeck's books, this one made me feel the saddest as I read it. Each story has beauty, warmth and wonderful writing and yet they all seem to end on a sad or poignant note. I guess this is analogous to life, where we have moments of joy and happiness tempered by moments of sadness and disappointment. This book also has an introduction written by James Nagal which explores some of the themes of the book, as well as explanatory notes at the end that clarify certain phrases used throughout the book. If you are new to Steinbeck then I suggest you start with another of his books first (\`Grapes of Wrath' or \`Of Mice and Men' are excellent starting places) but you will want to visit this book at some point down the line and you will not be disappointed once you do. Steinbeck is a truly masterful writer and this book only cements that opinion.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"Stop two in my quest to read everything of Steinbeck's in chronological order is _The Pastures of Heavens_. If his first novel, the 1929 _Cup of Gold_, was an apprenticeship in fiction -- and a largely unsuccessful one at that -- then The Pastures is journeyman fiction. It's starting to show promise, it definitely has its moments, but it's not quite ready for prime time.Early in their careers, many writers go through a stage of imitating those that they perceive to be literary giants. The results are usually unsatisfying. This case is no exception.What Steinbeck is doing is trying to write a short story cycle in the vein of Sherwood Anderson's _Winesburg, Ohio_. While hardly anyone reads it anymore, it made a vast impression in its day, coming in at twenty-fourth on the MLA list of all-time best novels. Steinbeck seems to have picked up on a number of the external features of Winesburg without quite appreciating what makes Winesburg work or what in Winesburg would be tiresome if imitated.The reason that Winesburg-like short story cycles never really caught on is that they tend to combine the worst features of short stories and novels. They require the commitment of novels without giving you the attachment and enjoyment of investing in the characters. Characters tend to weave in and out of stories in such a way that you find yourself thinking, \\"Wait, I've seen that name before. Was that the guy on the school board? Or was he the brother of that other character?\\" It requires repeated reading to figure these things out and usually the pay off of doing that is slim.A number of the threads do come together deliciously in Winesburg. That doesn't happen in The Pastures. True you do get a foretaste of the Steinbeck to come in the final chapter, which is a great study in irony (to say nothing of being prophetic about the suburban future of California). But keeping track of, say, the different Munroes isn't particularly rewarding. It's not like the stories give great insight into each other.The other way in which imitating Winesburg doesn't work is that Anderson was caught up in the concept of \`the grotesque', which leads to characters that are considerably out of kilter. It's like being Dickensque in a secretly tragic, sometimes almost mentally ill way. This can very quickly seem artificial and inauthentic, and a number of characters in The Pastures don't seem quite human and the descriptions of their lives gives only a glimmer of the affection for people that makes Steinbeck's later works so enjoyable. Imagine if someone who thought that they were too cool or hip to smile wrote _Cannery Row_. (But obviously this is a minority position if you look at the other reviews.)Some of the individual chapters do work of course. But this almost works against the book because Steinbeck recycled a lot and did things better the second time around. Reactions to hangings was made unforgettable in \`Vigilante', one chapter is practically a dry run of _Of Mice and Men_, the scene of the new woman in town trying to find her way about is much more memorable in _Sweet Thursday_, etc.So I don't regret reading this -- and I'm certainly glad that an editor encouraged Steinbeck by putting it out -- but I wouldn't put it on a list of the five most important Steinbecks I would try to get other people to read. And I love the other reviewer's story of his parents getting it for him because the title got it passed their religious filter.Of course the logical conclusion of this review is that if you do like The Pastures, you should check out Winesburg, Ohio. I don't think anyone would ever say that Anderson is the better writer, but he had a better vision of what he was trying to accomplish. I think in comparison to Steinbeck's characters a number of Anderson's come across as cold and distant."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"The Pastures of Heaven is a collected of interrelated stories about a California valley nicknamed Pastures of Heaven.

The crystal-clear (to a grownup) allusions to prostitution & incest sailed right over my innocent head, but the funny or tragic--usually both--stories of the wildly disparate kinds of people who settled in the Salinas Valley (can anyone flesh out fictional characters as Steinbeck can, and with so few adjectives?), and the image of how that beautiful green valley must have looked to the pioneers after their ordeal of mountains & desert, have stayed with me for almost 60 years.I'm now going to order a copy to replace the barely-hanging-together one inscribed \\"From Mom & Dad, Christmas 1944\\". (Yellowed \\"Clearance $.25\\" sticker still on the back.)"},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"You needn't be familiar with Steinbeck's work to enjoy Pastures of Heaven. Indeed, he wasn't a well-known writer at the time of its publication. But you DO need to be familiar with the way books used to be read -- over and over and over, allowing the richness of a work to be revealed after multiple readings. So it is with Pastures of Heaven.Certainly, a single reading of this work is rewarding and each story alone could serve as a great introduction to Steinbeck's style and grace. But these stories are interrelated in ways that appear only on the second and third and fourth readings. And...the book should probably be read slowly. (Hint: pay VERY close attention to the first story!)Like other readers, I, too, was disappointed/puzzled after the first reading, but then I found certain images from the book would appear to me weeks and months later. I found the book again in my bags as I traveled cross-country and re-read it slowly, taking two nights to read each story. As I drove the next day, I'd let my mind wander over the textual terrain it had encountered the night before. The story grew in richness and complexity this way and has left me fully satisfied. It remains within close reach on my shelf.While the book as written is a treasure -- one often neglected in discussions of Steinbeck's portfolio -- I have to say that time is changing its nature. As the book nears its 75th birthday, it gets only more true; the universality every good story has is here exemplified and magnified. Centuries from now, this book may be seen not so much as a portrait of its time, but rather a timeless tale, merely set conveniently in a place and era Steinbeck knew well; in this sense, the work reminds me of Shakespeare's work.Final thought: the work also grows richer by the reader's extension of it. The reader will inevitably draw parallels with his or her own life; doing a little contemporary research to investigate side avenues also give the book more depth. I was distracted for a week comparing Steinbeck's Tularecito with Shakespeare's Caliban.In short, if you are an inquisitive, thinking reader, one not afraid to give as much to Steinbeck's novel as he has given to you, then you will enjoy this book immensely."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"For me, reading Steinbeck is a hit-and-miss endeavor. So \\"The Pastures of Heaven,\\" undeservedly one of Steinbeck's least-known works, is a pleasant and affecting surprise--a volume of interlinking stories (simply called \\"chapters\\") whose mature style and semi-mystical themes remind me, oddly enough, of Garcia Marquez. This collection is not your typical Steinbeck, but it's memorable and astonishingly elegant nonetheless.Although every story in the book has something to recommend it (I can't imagine any reader not liking at least several of them), I especially enjoyed one, labeled Chapter VI. (The story must have had particular resonance for Steinbeck as well, since he later published it separately in a private edition entitled \\"Nothing So Monstrous\\" and added an epilogue.) About a widower who faces the community's disapproval of the unorthodox way he raises his son, this edisode will haunt me for some time. The price of the book is worth this \\"chapter\\" alone."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"The novel's structure is a pattern of repetition, but, unlike some things that are repetitious, &quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot; is by no means boring. Each chapter tells the individual story of an inhabitant of the valley town of Pastures of Heaven. Although each character and situation is different, each chapter follows the same story-line. A Common factor shared in these chapters is the involvement of one man by the name of Burt Munroe. The novel has a general lack of irony (ability to guess the outcome) but this is necessary in order to really understand Steinbeck's intended meaning. Steinbeck is very successful in making the reader experience the feelings of the characters. An emotional connection is built with the reader to the character. When a character is happy, so is the reader. When character is hopeless or empty, the reader is also. At one point in the novel a character is described as being left with \\"the ghost of a fire\\" (153), or a former motivation. The reader feels the same dejection as the man. One also developes a strong dislike toward the antagonist in the novel. \\"Pastures of Heaven\\" is somewhat depressing and melancholy, but it is a great novel. It's not that long, which is really nice, yet it contains a lot important literary aspects such as a very unique structure and style. I recommend \\"The Pastures of Heaven\\" to everyone."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"After reading the Grapes of Wrath recently, I became an instant fan of John Steinbeck. So much that while at the used bookstore last week I bought several more of his novels. It would be strange to call his writing a breath of fresh air since he's hardly current but that's the best way that I can describe it. After reading his work you feel like you truly know his fictional characters. You also feel like you've been exploring a wonderful new region. And if you've actually been to the region he's writing about, the memories and thoughts that are rekindled are so amazingly vivid. Could anything be better. Its like a breath of fresh air! This book was a great collection of short stories that focused certain events in the lives of the residents of the Pastures of Heaven. Each short story focused on only one resident or family but main characters from each of the other short stories would show up in supporting roles. It was an interesting structure that I'd never seen before and I loved it. As usual Steinbeck focused on painting a picture of a region and he did a great job of it here. I've actually been to the Pastures of Heaven at Salinas and I'm sure that I've stood in the very same spot in the hills between Carmel and Salinas where John Steinbeck described the awesome view of the valley. I remember looking over the valley with the same awe when I was there. This isn't a gripping and moving tale like Grapes or Wrath. It's much lighter. But its such a fine piece of writing that I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"Pastures of Heaven is not so much a novel as a collection of thematically linked stories all taking place in the same California valley in the early 20th century. Nevertheless, this is a satisfying work from one of the giants of our age. In the very first chapter we get hints that there's something haunted about this idyllic little valley, and while one wouldn't call these horror stories (they're all very true-to-life) each of them seems to conclude with the protagonists feeling greatly diminished by what has occurred. Of course everyone faces trouble at some point in their lives, and a story with a happy ending is just one that leaves off before the really bad stuff happens. Clearly Steinbeck wants to show that even in an earthly paradise, people still have serious problems.Steinbeck's prose is flawless, and he refuses to editorialize on the behavior of his characters, allowing the reader to judge which are wise and which are foolish. There's only a hint of the yearning for social justice that motivated so many of his more famous works. The collection offers a fair amount of variety despite the unities of time and place and mood (a pall of fatalism hangs over every vignette) but ultimately the individual stories weren't all that memorable. A few weeks after reading this book, the only entries this reviewer can recall are the boy who was enjoying the simple life until others decided it wasn't good for him; and the sisters who hoped to make their living selling home cooking and wound up selling something else. The rest was certainly well-written, but didn't leave a very lasting impression. The regional color is all there, but we can be glad that Steinbeck eventually found more cogent means to express his passion for his beloved central California. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"Steinbeck at his best.This is a collection of short stories loosely connected that paint a picture of a California slowly maturing from its infancy to its adolescence.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"Steinbeck's book comes with this comment on the back cover: \\"Each of these self-contained stories is linked to the others by the presence of the Munroes, a family whose misguided behavior and lack of sensitivity precipitate disasters and tragedies.\\" This opinion, which the author of the Introduction seems to endorse, strikes me as a very surface take on the deeper significance of these stories.The Munroes do show up in all of them; but when they do, a bubble of fantasy is punctured. They are the Nemesis principle, the breath of reality, among people lost in delusions and deceptions. Because of it, a man nicknamed Shark loses his social mask and finds his backbone, a father is forced to give up custody of his wild son, another father realizes the wrongness of raising his son in isolated poverty, a woman lets go of the insane daughter she's emotionally dependent on and stands up for her own life, two sisters face a crucial choice about their future, a daughter is given the chance to face her long-lost father...These are not tragedies so much as consequences that puncture the psychic insulation of people living in a kind of Californian Eden. Their stories are not Steinbeck's finest, but they reflect the lucid writing and psychological acumen that characterize his later work."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"More a book of short stories than a real novel, The Pastures of Heaven is one of my favorite of Johnny Steinbeck's. The book consists of ten stories centered around the very different and very realistic groups of people living in the California valley. Bittersweet is a good way to describe most of the stories as most seem to end tragically and hit where it hurts.Steinbeck, as always, tells the stories as a passive observer with a great eye for detail and leaves it to us to form our own opinions on the characters and events. Each story will have you debating the characters' motives and actions. Easy to read and hard to put down."},{"Title":"The pastures of heaven","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of a friend who named it as his very favorite book... I wouldn't name it as my favorite but it was definitely worth reading at the time, the collection of short stories is captivating and touching if you are interested in human psychology, it is very sad and bittersweet in many parts... a little slow all-around though."},{"Title":"Plantzilla","review":"Mortimer Henryson loves Plantzilla. All year, during third grade, he sat next to him, brushing the cilia on his leaves, watering him, and keeping growth charts. &quot;Plantzilla is the only plant I care that much about.&quot; Now that summer vacation is right around the corner, Mortimer wants to take Plantzilla home with him. &quot;...he might miss me over the vacation and wonder where I am.&quot; Mr Lester, his science teacher is only too happy to find Plantzilla a good home for the summer, and so with his mother's permission, Mortimer brings his unusual potted friend home.

Together word and art paint a fun-filled, loving portrait of a boy and his plant, that captures the imagination and sends it soaring.

Younger Readers (Awards))"},{"Title":"Reindeer People","review":"I don't know where exactly to put this book - it is partly a memoir, a travelogue, an anthropological study for the lay reader...Vitebsky spent a number of summers with different bands of Eveny, a Tungus tribe in mid Siberia. These Eveny were all associated with a 'State Farm', a Soviet era relic that regulates the use of the territory assigned to the bands, shipping of reindeer meat and antlers and bringing in supplies. The Farm was in this case controlled by an incompetent, alcoholic director and his cronies, who had been responsible for a number of disastrous decisions that had a big impact on the region as a whole.Eveny have been hit hard by Soviet times and even harder in the chaos of the perestroika. They lost their shamans and the number of men willing to spend their winters herding reindeer in the forbidding sub sub zero taiga is decreasing, especially as the women refuse to leave the relative comfort of villages for the traditional nomadic way of life. As Vitebsky trails the herders on their annual migration, he is witnessing the impressive array of skills these people have to survive in one of the most inhospitable regions n this planet; slowly, as he is taken into their confidences, he also sees a part of their life that is hidden from the casual visitor. Although their shamans have all been killed, and the rituals all but stamped out, a number of folk 'superstitions' control all areas of Eveny life. Propitiating spirits of the land, dead ancestors, interpreting omens and dreams all play a central role in Eveny activity. There is a number of striking similarities with NA Indians in the relationship to the land, their respect of silence, mutual assistance and the non verbal communication that happens in that silence. Like the Indians, Eveny don't speak much, but when they do, the words mean something... like the Indians, the Eveny are getting destroyed by alcohol.Vitebsky is mostly interested in social aspects of contemporary Eveny life - social tensions, alliances, intrigues and gossip. Given the tools he has he does a good job in bringing us a portrait of a native community deep in Siberia. Unlike what one might expect, his eveny are no ignorant herders - these guys have been around in schools, the military, they read astronomy, Wittgenstein and Mme Blavatsky and listen daily to radio Moscow; they seemed to be way better informed about the world situation than your average American (which doesn't say a lot).Nevertheless, given its ambitious title, the book somehow does not deliver what it promises, at least it not for me. 'Living with animals and spirits' was missing something, i guess it was animals and spirits. Above all, Vitebsky is all too careful to approach these except through his informants. Now I also know why I am not an anthropologist. It would be very difficult for me to watch the State Farm director destroy people's lives without getting involved in some way; well, V. is an anthropologist and documents the disintegration that occurs with professional detachment. Still, there is good stuff in there and if you are interested in reindeer, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Reindeer People","review":"I learned here that Reindeer herding for the commercial meat market has been a staple of Artic communities throughout the 20th Century (hence the effort to translpant it to Alaska in the 1920s).This is an amazing story of a British anthropologist's 25+ years visiting and documenting the life of some of the last indigenous Siberian people to herd domestic reindeer. We meet many keenly individual men women and children, from the university-trained to the descendants of shamans. I was reminded of the Mongul family in the documenary movie \\"The Weeping Camel,\\" and of Amundson's antarctic expeditions, which used native skills while Scott died using modern mechanical aids. We learn what it was like to live under Soviet rule (when labor camps drove the meat markets); we watch Perestroika as it affects both animals and people, and we witness the region's disastrous ecological and economic decline under Putin's Russia."},{"Title":"Reindeer People","review":"Vitebsky's book is a wonderful look at the life, lives and living conditions in an area of the world most of us would consider uninhabitable. While it is an anthropological study, it overflows with human feelings and contact that make this a truly unforgettable read. This truly shows the need for humans to coexist with nature, not rule it.Read this book."},{"Title":"Reindeer People","review":"For someone who has only traveled so far as a few hundred miles in a sedan, my world is mind-numbingly small. Logistically, I rely on MapQuest to get me from \\"Point A\\" to \\"Point B\\"... and hopefully back in one piece. Without truly comprehending the land and life enveloping me in a \\"rural-suburban\\" town located somewhere in the cesspool of Bowash, I sorely needed a wake-up call to the raw emotion and spirit that has been inherently ingrained in the Eveny people, their reindeer, and their relationship to the expanses of Sakhan Siberia. As Vitebsky relives such experiences in The Reindeer People, his strikingly vivid account of living side-by-side with the Eveny not only intrigues, but brings to light the troubles faced by indigenous people that have been perpetuated by the Soviet era as well as its horrendous aftermath. Vitebsky's tale of the inevitable downfall of what was once a pristine way of life for these people offers a poignantly bittersweet glimpse of what is becoming all but history. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest books to come my way in a long time!"},{"Title":"Reindeer People","review":"Fascinating historical and factual account of the animal itself but more over, an incredible view of how they have influenced the social evolution of a huge part of the world.

Their lives during Soviet times and the changes after perestroika are especially interesting."},{"Title":"Reindeer People","review":"This book is about the author's life among reindeer herders in Siberia. It mostly documents the devastating results of collectivization on their culture, especially family life. With the fall of Communism, the situation has not changed appreciably, as their lives are irrevocably disrupted and they still suffer from bureaucracy.
