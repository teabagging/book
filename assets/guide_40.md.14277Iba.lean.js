The Witch of Blackbird Pond is the coming of age tale of sixteen-year-old Kathrine Tyler of Barbados as she comes to live in the late 1600 colony of Connecticut. Coming from luxurious Barbados, Kathrine, also known as Kit, has a lot of surprises awaiting her in the bleak colony of Connecticut. As Kit sees the bleak New England shoreline from the boat, she begins to wonder whether or not coming to New England is such a good idea after all. When she arrives in Connecticut, her Aunt Rachel, and her Uncle Matthew take her in. As she begins to live with her relatives, she starts to realize that living in New England is no easy task, for she must work all day carding wool, weeding vegetables, and doing other hard and time consuming tasks. Coming from a rich home in Barbados, this isn't at all what she had expected! Kit also attracts the attention of fellow townsfolk by revealing that she can swim, read well, and that she wears silk and satin dresses. Little does she know that many of her considered to be odd behaviors by the fellow townsfolk may end up getting her suspected of being a witch! After befriending an old Quaker, and suspected witch, it is only a matter of time before the townsfolk accuse her of being a witch! As the story progresses, it becomes intense and suspenseful. Aiding to the suspense is a witch-hunt, a government dispute, and many other intense scenes. I have only read the book once, but I can still tell that Elizabeth George Speare spent put tons and tons of effort into writing this book. Throughout the book, I noticed that she was very descriptive with the style of clothing, colonial architect, food, religion, customs, and scenery. Her description of the setting was so realistic that it felt like I was actually in the story, not just reading it. To be descriptive as she was, it must of token her hours upon hours of time just to do the research alone for her book. Her vivid descriptions of her characters and their actions and feelings really make you wonder how you would act and feel if you were in their position. Even though action is absent throughout much of the book, I still found it incredibly interesting and almost impossible to put down. Where the story lacks in action, it abounds in a detailed plot that is guaranteed to keep any reader hooked. And when you do get to the action in the book, it is literally impossible to put down! Why you might walk right of a cliff and still continue to read it without noticing anything! It's that good! I give this book a ten plus out of five for it's creativity and it's ability to grip any reader's attention. For these reasons, I would highly recommend this extremely good book to anyone, especially historical fiction fans."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I read this book in fourth grade and I still rember the wonderful book! I decided to read it again and it wa just as good as I thaught it would be!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I've lost track of the number of times that I have read this book. It is definatly on my top ten list. When Kit arrives in gloomy Whethersfield, for the first time in her life she experiances not fitting in. Oh, her cousins and aunt try to make her feel welcome, but she's just a problem for them all. But when Kit meets the old women who lives near Blackbird Pond, she finally has a true friend.

I've remembered it all these years (I'm now 22). The reason I came looking for it is I have a younger cousin who enjoys to read as much as I did at her age. I'm sharing this book with her, and hope she will take from it the same joy I did."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is one of my three all-time favorite books. I reread it every few years and each time, I learn somthing new about the characters. Kit Tyler is a wonderful heroine, and her struggle to adjust to life in America is a wonderful metaphor that most children (and even adults) can relate to, whether it's moving to a new school, job, or community. Plus, the historical aspect separates this wonderful novel from the rest of the pack. You'll learn something while being entertained- what more can you ask for?!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Spear is a great book. It's about a girl named Kit who used to live with her grandfather in the Caribiean Island. Now, since her grandfather died, she's moving to the Connectict Colony to live with her aunt and uncle.On the ship,she meets Nat and John Holbrook.

The Townspeople don't like Hannah just because that she keeps to herslf . Then when sickness spreads, the townspeople blame Hannah because she herself was accused of witchcraft. If you want to find out what happens next,read the book to find out. My favorite part was was when Kit met Hannah. I liked that part because it made me feel good that Kit made a friend that she could talk to. I thought that Kit was very brave because even though she made mistakes, she didn't give up. I hope you will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This is a book about a high spirited girl named Kit Tyler.

The characters are well developed and it is very descriptive. I think the message is very insightful, and I also enjoyed the love story. I would recommend this book for an older child and even adults!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The book Witch of Black Bird Pond was an adventurous book as well as a bit of romance. It was about a girl who travels to America to find family to live with since her family died. She ends up finding them and they are taken by surprise by some things she can and can not do. As well as thing she posses like, beautiful dresses and money. She needs to help on their farm but is not used to that so she runs off only to find a little house in a meadow of flowers about a mile away from where she lives now and the lady walks up to her, the one from the little house. She returns home and they become pals but many believe that she is a witch. What happens in the end, read the book to find out.I loved the book! It is probably a ten (10) and older book, and a book for adults too. It is an exciting book because who knows what a response or action will be next. I would rate The Witch of Black Bird Pond a five star (*****) book for its simply wonderful story. It's a book I would recommend but mostly for girls who love a bit of romance but mostly adventure."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Sixteen year old Kit Tyler, has spent most of her life with her wealthy grandfather on his plantation on the sunny island of Barbados. She is treated like royalty and is richer than rich. Then, Kit's grandfather falls ill and dies, so Kit is forced to go live with the only family she has left, her Aunt Rachel and Uncle Matthew. Kit boards a ship on its way to her aunt and uncle in Connecticut and meets a number of people. A child named Prudence loses her doll in the water and while she is reaching after it, she falls in. Kit leaps in after her without a second thought, and brings her safely back to the boat. The people on the boat were not familiar with women swimming and therefore thought she was a witch. Pretty soon word spreads and half of the town suspects Kit of being a witch. Kit befriends an old Quaker woman in the forest named Hannah Tupper who is thought as a witch herself. Kit must fight to make everyone believe they are not witches before they lose their lives. Overall, The Witch of Blackbird Pond was a very well-written and entertaining book.One reason why this book was interesting was because of the main character, Kit Tyler. She was feisty, outspoken, and she stood up for what she believed in without a care of what anyone else thought. For example, the town thought her bright colored dresses were a sign of rebellion and her uncle warned her to stop wearing them, but she wore them anyway. Kit also befriended a woman named Hannah Tupper who not only was called a witch, but she was a Quaker as well. At the end of the story Kit married a man named Nat, who was a sailor and apparently \\"not good enough for her.\\"Another reason why this book was entertaining was the unintended humor. Something in this story that was really funny were the reasons the town accused Kit of being a witch. They thought she was a witch because she could swim, because of what she wore, and because of the things she said and did. There was a particular event in the story where Kit is teaching Prudence to read and write herself because Prudence's parents don't think Prudence is smart enough to be taught at a real school. Kit tells Prudence to continue writing her name over and over again in a book. Someone from the village finds this book and thinks Kit is trying to put a spell on Prudence because they think Kit is writing Prudence's name over and over again. Of course, Prudence defends Kit, but the people from the town think she is only protecting her because she is bewitched. Throughout the story similar events happen and they make even less sense.This book was also enjoyable because of the ending. Even though Kit's older nice cousin Mercy, dies, the story ended well. Nat, who Kit met through her friend Hannah, is a sailor and the son of the owner of the boat Kit arrived on. In the end of the story, Kit and Nat get married and Nat gets his own ship. As a joke because of all the events that happened during the story, Nat names his ship The Witch, and promises Kit he will take her anywhere. Hannah also accompanies them both on the ship. Kit's formerly grumpy uncle becomes nicer and more open since he lost his daughter, Mercy.The final reason this book was a good read was because of the variety of characters. The group of friends in this story are unique and unlikely to meet. The very unlikely group of friends in this story are Kit, Nat, Prudence, and Hannah. Kit is a rich and spoiled girl who is surprisingly nice. Nat is a normal sailor with a kind heart. Prudence is a little girl whose mother abuses her and thinks she is very stupid. Hannah is an odd old lady that lives in a small hut out in an abandoned meadow in the middle of a field with a black cat. Hannah Tupper is the person that really brought them all together. Even though these characters have some similar issues it seems odd that they became friends because they are from opposite worlds. All in all, this was a very good book and is good to read if you want to learn about the colony religions and also want to read a good book.S.Brown"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"A year ago, for schoolwork I had a choice to read this book, and I took it.

But when I finished the whole story, I got some interesting idea changing my old idea of witch. I think the witch in the book means a person daring to create good thing but contrasts with others as Kit Tyler and her friends. It's a reason why they were accused to be the witches. Like Kit said \\" people are afraid of things they don't understand\\" this idea has existed in the real world since people always prejudge others because of differ. The witch is the good symbol of this matter. I also one phased of Hannah \\" There is no escape if love is not there\\" it's true that people can't run away from love.

By reading the myriad of fantastic reviews already published for this book one already knows the basic plot of the story, but not only is the Witch of Blackbird Pond a wonderful story but it really teaches the young reader what life was like in New England during the time, what females felt over their oppresion, and the real fear that a women felt, knowing that no one was really brave enough to stand up agianst the mob to defend her if she was ever in trouble. Kit is a stranger to the world of Puritanism just like the reader and she discovers what life held for women in the time along with the reader.

She has almost been accused of being a witch, for normal girls do not know how to swim. Her first impression of America isn't too grand; dreary, cold, and wet. She misses her Grandfather and the warm shores of Barbados. When Kit reaches her relative's home, her mood is just dampened. Uncle Mathew is a strict Puritan, and he won't accept any of the fineries that Kit has brought along. Uncle Mathew's wife, Aunt Rachel, is a bit kinder. Rachel's two daughters, Mercy and Judith, are quite different. Mercy is a sweet, loving girl who is lame in one leg, and Judith is a snappy, yet beautiful girl (who sometimes became quite jealous of Kit.) Kit is homesick, and to get her mind off of things she helps Mercy run a dame school. All is fine until one mishap, and Kit runs off into the woods where she meets the \\"witch.\\" Hannah, an old Quaker woman, is rumored to be a witch. All of the Puritans fear her, and she and her husband had to stay in prison for an x amount of years in Massachusetts for being Quakers. However, Hannah is a sweet old woman, and Kit becomes fast friends with her. Many characters come along in the story, and the plot thickens.

We've been using Kathleen Kent's The Heretic's Daughter, but The Witch of Blackbird Pond tells just about the same story with more accessible content. It's certainly just as appropriate for adults as for young people.The story moves at a quick pace and gives a realistic sense of setting. It covers themes from the time period such as religious intolerance, hypocrisy, the slave debate, fear of outsiders.I highly recommend this reading for anyone interested in late 1600s Early America.

I read this book many years ago, and decided to purchase it, since I found it enjoyable."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I'll begin by saying that I wasn't entirely convinced that I was going to like this book when I first started reading it. In fact, I was downright sure that I wasn't going to be able to relate to the main character anymore than I could relate to the sea worthy Dolphin. I was also sure that the storyline was going to be drab and moralistic because it was published in '58.I was very pleasantly surprised however when I found myself eagerly turning pages after the first few chapters. Despite the slow start I was very much enthralled by the storyline and put on perpetual edge by the constant predicaments of the main character, Kit.There were some very dry parts of the book that I'm surprised I made it through, but then there were those one or two moments when I was actually drawing up on the couch in suspense thinking to myself \\"If what I think is going to happen happens I'll pass out!\\"Towards the end I was even starting to tear up in frustration due to the unfairness in which the main character is treated by the townspeople.That's how emotional I can get over books, people. It's pretty absurd.The biggest surprise came when I realized near the end of the book that I could relate to this 16 year old royalist girl rather well. In fact... I found that I could completely understand her situation as a spunky foreigner in the midst of a very plain and strict group of strangers.At first I was very keen on despising the puritan characters that surrounded Kit, choosing to focus very much on the fact that Kit seemed constantly oppressed by the drab, colorless culture.After putting the book down, however, I began to realize that there was no \\"This is better than that\\" or \\"that is better than this\\". In fact it came very much down to \\"To each-his own\\". At first when I believed that the author was attempting to cast the puritan lifestyle of Kit's family in a negative light I couldn't help but clamor on about how unfortunate the main character was to be in her situation.However, I began to theorize that the author was very cleverly pointing out to the reader their own judgmental attitude. Just as with Kit, the reader goes from being completely appalled at the main character's surroundings and then slowly they come to realize there's strength and beauty in it (even if it's not the favorite of the reader).Anyway, I could really go on about it all day, but I'll end the review by telling you all that I was pleasantly surprised by the captivating story of a young woman discovering new perspectives and finding new ways to know herself and others."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This is a great book for middle schoolers, teens and even young adults.

I liked the basic plot of the story but it was too dragging. This book made everything too slow yet some things happened really fast especially for the time period. Like how Nat came back from the trip to Barbados so quickly in the ships they had back then. The story was too descriptive and it was too perfect for a person's life. Everything went so well at the end and nothing bad happened which is most not likely to happen. Even from the beginning you could guess what the story was about because nowadays everything seems to be a love story in which the peoiple realize they like each other at the end.

If you haven't read one of her books you better get in style because these books are more than you can explain in words!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"ISBN 0440495962 - Excellent, well written book for ages 12 and up, Witch is more likely to appeal to girls. This book has enough romance to make it unappealing to some, but it deserves the Newbery Award it won in 1959.Kit Tyler was orphaned years before, but it is only now that she feels like an orphan - her grandfather, Sir Francis Tyler, a well-off plantation owner on Barbados, has died and Kit finds out that all he's left behind is mountainous debt. His entire estate is sold off to pay those debts and Kit's own slave has to be sold, as well, to finance her journey to Connecticut. There, her mother's only sister, beautiful Rachel, lives with her family. She befriends Nat Eaton, the captain's son, but fails to tell him that her family isn't expecting her. He is surprised by their surprise, when Kit shows up on their doorstep, where they part ways. Kit, too, gets a surprise, when she finds that her aunt, once a great beauty, is a somewhat worn, plain woman. Clearly her life has changed her.It takes some time for Kit to get accustomed to the ways of her aunt's family, who are Puritans (Kit had even disparagingly referred to them as \\"Roundheads\\" while still on the boat). Their simple life of hard work is a harsh existence with little joy and Kit misses much about her old life. Still, she has no one else and tries to learn to do the chores she is given to the best of her ability. When William Ashby, a young man of some means, begins to court her, Kit realizes that he might be the best chance she has to escape from the drudgery of her life under Uncle Matthew's roof. Judith, Kit's cousin, had previously set her sights on William, but when he favors Kit, she turns her attention to John Holbrook, a budding clergyman. Judith is unaware that her crippled sister, Mercy, has fallen in love with John and even less aware that John also loves Mercy.While the prospect of escape via marriage to William is in the future, Kit lives in the present, becoming friendly with Hannah, an elderly Quaker woman who lives alone on the shore of Blackbird Pond. The townspeople believe her to be a witch, mostly because she isn't Puritan. Consorting with Hannah doesn't do much to improve Kit's standing in the town, but she laughs off the idea of herself or anyone being a witch - until they lock her up and put her on trial. Her friendships with Nat and Prudence pay off in a big way, when they appear at the trial, but Nat runs before she can thank him - and before she realizes that it is Nat that she really loves.As a teen or pre-teen, this book would not have impressed me much, and I'd have found the romance gag-worthy. Everyone ends up with the guy they should end up with and all, it is implied, live happily ever after. As an adult, however, I really enjoyed the story. The prejudice of the time, not unlike the prejudice of ANY time period, was interesting. To read that the ability to swim was an indication that one was a witch is funny now, but a nice bit of irony for the time - the only way to prove your innocence was to die by drowning! Not perfect, and a little more \\"historical romance\\" than plain old \\"historical fiction\\", but still very nicely done.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This captivating story of a girl who is forced to move from her warm Carribean home to the bleak, cold town of Wethersfield, is an excellent novel for young readers who like to read historical fiction books.

It's about a sixteen-year-old girl, named Kit, who has to leave her native island of Barbados to live with her aunt, un-welcoming uncle, and her two cousins, Judith and Mercy. In Wethersfield, Conneticut, Kit finds that after a life with slaves to do the work for her, she must learn a lot so that she can be a help to her aunt and uncle. Kit discovers the hardships of the colonial American life, and also discovers how cruel the cases of witchcraft are. After she befriends an old Quaker woman accused of being a witch, Kit herself soon becomes accused of practicing witchcraft. Then Kit is saved by her friends, a young girl named Prudence whom she taught to read, and the son of the captain on the ship she sailed over with.

In my opinion Spere did a great job at really letting the reader know what it was like to live in the 1700's. She made it seem so real by talking so descriptively of all the customs and the way of doing things in that time period. Spere clearly had to do a lot of research to know so much of that time. If someone is interested in learning about American history this book would be a great choice. I also found this book to be very exciting. There were so many times that you were left thinking did that just really happen. I think the story was so exciting because of how descriptive Spere was. She left you amazed in what she made some of her characters do and think. I would reccomend this book anyone, even if your not interested in American history because the novel is so exciting. Atleast in my case it left me wanting to know more about the 1700's even thow i had no interest in it before."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The book, Witch Of Blackbird Pond, was actually pretty good. The authorr kept you thinking about, who would marry who at the end, and what's going to happen to Hannah the &quot;witch.&quot; The book is also very suspensful. It leaves out important parts until later on in the book. For instance, when Kit was being put on trial for witch craft, you didn't know that Nat would be involved beczuse the author made you believe that he left with the ship.The book was also a little frustrating. I think it was because, you obvisiouly knew that Mercy and John were inlove and yet, the author made you believe that John would be to shy or intimidated to speak up and admit to Judith that he was inlove with Mercy and not her. You also knew that William and Judith were made for eachother because the author made Judith really seem to want to live in a big house with lots of money, and thats what William did. The author actually did a good job there beczuse it made the book not be boring and long winded, because she made you think about a lot of what was going on. She did very good at making the book suspensful. I hopee you decide to read this book because i enjoyed it and it takes a lot for a book to keep me reading and not get bored:0)"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I think that &quot;The Witch of blackbird Pond&quot; was a great book to read.The characters were very realistic.Kit was a rich and stuck-up girl who changed after she was in Weathersfeild for a while.I dont really think that she was a witch because she didn't put spells on people, wear all black or anything like that. I think that Mattew Wood was a very mean man and I think that Kit felt the same way, until he stood up for her when she was on trial.To me Judith didn't like the idea of Kit coming to live in Weathersfeild because she would lose attention, after a while she seemed to become nicer.Rachel and Mercy were alike to me because they both like the idea of Kit coming to live with them. On the other hand I wouldn't read the book for a couple or reasons. One is because everything happened to slowly, which made the story a little boring.Another reason why I didn't like the book is because some of the events were hard for me picture of in my head.Pictures would of helped a lot.Lastly,I didn't like this book because it was on a topic that didn't me, expecialy because I already read it once."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Spears was a suspenseful and enjoyable novel. I can only imagine how Kit felt coming from Barbados where she had a lot of freedom, to Connecticut where she faced hard work everyday. Through Kit's journey, I learned about how it might have been to grow up in colonial times. I also learned about what it means to be a true friend. Kit was not afraid to get to know Hannah Tupper even though all of the townspeople disliked her. The novel includes many different relationships between all of its characters. I wanted to keep reading to find out how all of their friendships would grow and change throughout the story. I was surprised to see how the relationships ended up. The only thing that I did not like about the novel was that it seemed to start out slow. I had a hard time getting interested at first. Fortunately, the story did pick up and I enjoyed the rest of the novel. I think that anyone who reads this novel will learn a lot and enjoy the story at the same time."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Overall I think that the author did a good job on the book \\" The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\". I thought this for many reasons. First of all the characters were realistic and they made it seem like it was back in the olden days. For example Kits uncle was furious when he saw his daughters in Kits fancy dresses and he said that they didn't need that stuff. But today almost anyone would be glad to get nice new clothes. Another reason I liked this book was because it was suspenseful. It was very suspenseful when the townspeople were going 2 Hannah's house with the torches because you didn't know if Hannah would be alright or not. Another suspenseful part was in the courtroom scene because you aren't sure whether kit will accused of witchcraft or not. For these reasons I enjoyed the book \\" The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\"."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I think this was an interesting story but could have been better. One thing I liked was how you could feel how Kit felt in coming to a new land. When she was showing the dresses off to Mercy and Judith, Matthew got really mad and Kit was probably confused. You could feel what it would be like in that situation. Also making the story in her point of view was a great idea because then people would know how she was not a witch and sometimes feel how she is feeling. They would think the people weren't thinking correctly, but if it were from another view, like Goodwife's, it would just tell how she is a witch and not how she isn't. Something they could do is to make Kit more adventurous, like if she went on the boat to escape with Nat, people might go after her and she wouldn't be at the trial to see if she's a witch. I think Kit is a little boring, and she always seems to follow the rules, at least most of the time. Also I wonder what would happen if she went back to Barbados and maybe Kit would be more confident after she went back after all this. That is why I think Kit is sort of a boring person and she could use some personality."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Oct.20, 2000The Witch of Blackbird PondI found the book by Elizabeth George Speare interesting and entertaining. I really think she did a good job on many aspects of the book. First off, I think she did a good job on the attitudes of the people in the book. She made the characters and made them their own, unique personality. And even though in the beginning you think all the towns' people are the same, in the end (and especially at the trial for Kit), you see that they are all different. She followed each of them throughout the book and always had a reason for their actions. For example, when Kit was sitting in the barn waiting for William to come, and William never did, she had William explain why he never did. That definitely stressed his character and entertained the reader. Also when Hannah put her foot down and wouldn't go with Nat on the ship until she had her cat, it made the reader think: is this Hannah in this kind of situation? And the answer is yes; because her cat was the only thing she had left, since they burned down her house and her husband's dead. That also brings out Nats' character and shows that he really cares about Hannah. That's why I think that Elizabeth George Speare really succeeded on the characters of the book. One thing I think that the author did not accomplish well is the priorities in the book. By the title and the first couple of chapters, you'd think that the whole book is going to be about witches, but it's not and in that way, it can be very misleading. Maybe she meant to do that, but the book isn't really about witches until the very end again. In the middle of the book, it's just focusing, on her life with Aunt Rachel and family. Also, Hannah is mentioned to be a witch, but a big deal is not really made out of it. They just mention it as the reason why nobody really likes her. That is something that I disagree with the author on the book, The Witch of Blackbird Pond."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I think the character, Mathew Wood, which Spear created was the most believable in the entire book. He was the one character in &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; that, when Kit came unexpectedly, was not the least bit pleased, nor was he ashamed to express it. I think that Spear did a tremendous job showing Mathew's personality and true character. One of the events which I thought best represented Mathew was in the beginning of the book, he looked Kit right in the eye and &quot;Laid down the laws&quot; about her wearing such horrendous clothing. On the other hand, there were a couple of events which changed my perspective on Mathew Woods' character. One includes, when Mathew decided not to go on the witch hunt. I thought thought that it was an interesting change of events. Over all, if I were to rate the character of Mathew Wood on a scale from 1-10 I would give him an 8. There were many moods which created &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot;. My favorite of all of the moods through out the book had to be the intensity. If you think back to the book, you will recall many, very intense moments. One of them includes, when Kit was on trial for being a witch, which had to have been my personal favorite. I hear my heart beating while reading that part. Another very intense moment was when the witch hunt was going on. My eyes were glued to the pages during the section of the book. I think that the way Spear creates the mood in this story best represents her a writer. I would give the mood of the story a 10 if I were to rate it on a scale from 1-10."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"There were many good aspects to the story. One good aspect is the setting of Blackbird Pond because that type of setting seems to be a good place for a witch to live in. Another good aspect to the story is the characters, because each one has his or her own special ability and personality. Good aspect is the date and century it took place because witches were mostly feared at that time.There were also many bad aspects to the story. One bad aspect is that the author was telling more about Kit's adaptation to her new home instead of telling more about the whole point of the story, which is the witch. Another bad aspect to the story is that there were just too many conflicts in the story. Another bad aspect to the story is that the mood is mostly depresing because of Kit's hard time adapting to her new home. In conclusion, those are the good and bad aspects to the story."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I believe that the author really out done himself with this fabulous book!The characters are great and unique in every way because each one has his or her own special ability a personality , and the setting is the best.Another great thing about this is that the time period was excellent, especially because witches mostly feared at that time."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Kit Tyler--recently orphaned by her beloved grandfather--moves from the hot, wild life of Barbados to the cold, morally rigid New England.

She was an out-going young rebellion. Some others in the story were Mercy, Judith, Mathew Wood, Aunt Rachel, and Hannah. Mercy and Judith were quiet most of the time but at times they would become a little more out-going than usual. Mathew Wood was a tall stern man who had fury. Aunt Rachel was a quiet woman but she would and could out break at times. Hannah was the \\"suspected witch and was a kind and a very lonely Quaker.Even before she set foot on the dull and forbidding shore of Wethersfield, Conneticut, on that April day in 1687. Kit Tyler felt the finger of suspension pointing at her. A solid cloud of disapproval settled about her as dis heartning as the contrast of this gray, barren land to the shimmering green that hinged the turquoise bay of Barbados which had been her home for sixteen years.Her unconventional upbringing and her luxorious wardrobe were out of place in the primative household of her aunt's family and so were her clumsy ettorta at cleaning and scrubbing.

Then she is introduced to a man named William Ashby who starts to like Kit very fast.

John Holbrook announced he wanted to marry Mercy. Kit's dear old friend, Hannah Tupper's house had finally been swallowed up by Blackbird Pond after years of flooding at the pond. And at the very end, two weddings were announced, John Holbrook and Mercy Wood & William Ashby and Judith Wood.I like this book because all of the characters had something interesting about all of them.

Coming from a wealthy life in Barbados, Kit has many things she is unaccustomed to. Along with facing many hardships of earning her keep because her new family isn't prosperous at all, as well as her daily chores and tasks, she manages to make many friends along the way. Hannah, a wise old widow accused of being a witch, Prudence, a young neglected girl, and John Hollonbrook, of which Kit becomes very fond of. Poor Kit couldn't have come to the new world at a worse of time however, due to the conflicts with the king in Europe and war breaking loose. The witch trials were also coming to a spark. Poor Hannah is accused of being a witch for she does not follow the traditions as everyone else in the town. However, Kit stays by her side through it all. Family matters become horrid as well when the whole family becomes fatally ill. Will the countries problems become solved? Will Hannah be executed for what she is believed to be? Will Kit's new family die of sickness? How does Kit affect the future of all these people? In a story of excitement and sadness, Kit becomes a woman and learns what she must do to make the right choices.*Likes*I enjoyed the book \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" for the most part. I enjoyed the character descriptions very much because the way they described what the characters were wearing and there setting was very lucid but fluently stated. For example when in the book it stated, \\"...The dolphin left the open sea, sailed briskly across the sound to the wide mouth of the Connecticut River...\\" (p. 1) I also enjoyed how so much history was based upon this book. It was a way for me to understand the colonial times better and really understand what life was like back then. For example, it really involved major milestones in history, which made it easier to understand. My last favorite thing about this book was the major twists and turns it took. Some of the major events you would have never expected. All and all the book was very enjoyable.*Dislikes*The dislikes I had about \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" were slim, however there were a few. The main thing I didn't enjoy about the book was although the descriptions were very thorough I just thought at some points of the book, they were too histrionic and went overboard. For an example when Kit is lying in a nearby field, it describes the field in a manor so much that I lost interest. Another thing I did not enjoy was the book was a bit childish for my age. This is my fault for choosing he book but I still thought that for me I could have read a more enthralling book. Lastly, I did not enjoy how many characters were placed in the book. Throughout the book so many characters with similar names were introduced. It became overwhelming at a point because I was confusing some characters. However the book was enjoyable at most parts but if I could revise the book, I would say these things based on my judgment.*Conclusion*In conclusion to this review, I would definitely recommend thins book to younger readers from the ages 9 - 12. However I being 13 I did not enjoy the book as much as I think a younger person might. I did enjoy the book but do not recommend it to anyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I think this book was odd.

I think this book resembled a soap opera."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I thought that the Witch of Blackbird pond was a fairly boring story. Throughout the book there's not anything very exciting that the characters say or do. I also thought that the ending was too happy. Every character in the book was very happy at the end and i thought that it was too much. I think that if i were to give this book a grade it would be a C-. And also, if you're going to read this book, I don't recommend that you should read it if you are under the age of 10. If you like history, romance, and happy endings, then I very strongly recommend this book for you. Otherwise you will most likely find this book very boring."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I am very disapointed that my teacher chose this book for my class to read. I feel it was very dull and boring, with nothing to keep the reader attentive. Throughout the entire book, there were no exciting scenes (there was one situation where the author could have made an exciting moment, but instead decided to turn it into a section of tasteless humor) and many of the chapters were about relationships between characters which were not explained enough to be interesting, or the various chores and jobs that the main character, Kit, did.I know there are many readers who enjoyed this book, but I personally do not like books who just tell the lives of someone unless there are some exciting events. Too many of the chapters of this book were wasted on petty happenings such as washing clothes or teaching someone to read. If you are looking for a book with excitement or adventure (which is what the title implies), I do not recommend this."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This book is boring, but there are some ok parts.

The story was actually about how dating worked back in colonial times.The author mentioned that in order to go out with someone that the male had to ask the father's permission in order to call on the female.An example of this would be when an admirer of Kit{William Ashby} asked Kit's uncle if he could call her out.He did this by sucking up to him then asking him his permission.In conclusion, my once again is that this book has nothing to do with witches or witch craft."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Sources have said that Elizabeth George Speare's book, the witch of black bird pond, is an outstanding and intriguing book. Some were even creative and said that it is a spellbinding novel of suspense and romance. Most said it is a well written and that they enjoyed the way she formed her characters. In my opinion though, all of these book critics have been embellishing the facts.I agree that it was a well written but nothing so outstanding, so intriguing that I would recommend this book for joy reading. It is hard to believe that over 200,000 hard copies alone have been sold. The plot was very typical, because even sheep could guess what the out come would be in almost all the events. How could the wooly animals do this and there be an ounce of suspense with in the cover of Speare's book.One critic even went as far as to say that the novel was compelling. I wonder if the person making that statement knew that compelling meant: tending to demand attention, how could a book that someone might choose to read to put them to sleep be compelling.Although, this is just my opinion of Speare's book. You might find the book to be as the book critics have said. The book may really be compelling, outstanding, and suspenseful. But if I were you I wouldn't take such a risky chance. A chance that after spending several hours reading the book that you realize that you agree with my opinion. Then you would wish you had spent your time reading some other book that actually had some suspense in it, but even then you would be taking a chance"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I strongly erge you to get a life if you like this book.

So, don't judge this story by its title. It's not really about a witch, its about people & how easily people can simply make superficial judgements of others. The main character is displaced from her home & has to start a life in the colonies & thus hangs a tale. There is also some Jane Austin storytelling going on which doesn't feel out of place at all.

The writing was tight and well done. The title and the picture of Kit on the cover threw me off; I was glad the witch wasn't her--until later. One can read the story outline in other reviews. Suffice it to say, I am tremendously glad I read this book--finally--I graduated from college in 1958. So it's not just for young adults, as many of the reviewers have noted.

Immediately, she sets tongues wagging with her unusual ways and the friendship she develops with the supposed witch who lives near Blackbird Pond. Young and naive, Kit does not realize that her carefree lifestyle of the Carribean is not only unacceptable in this new world it could be dangerous for those she loves and herself.I was instantly intrigued by this well written and delightful novel. It has been on my to-read list since I was young. I've enjoyed the other novels written by Speare and was glad to finally get a chance to read this Newberry award winning novel for adolescents. Thoughtful and precise with fiesty characters, The Witch of Blackbird Pond is exactly the type of book I hope that I can encourage my own children to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Although this book was published over 50 years ago in 1958, the story and writing are as accessible as ever to a new audience.Kit Tyler is a sixteen year old orphan who has grown up under the loving care of her wealthy grandfather in the Caribbean isle of Barbados. Kit's youth is freewheeling and carefree until her grandfather dies and she is startled to discover that he was heavily in debt. After settling the estate, Kit is forced to leave Barbados and impetuously decides to board a ship to Wethersfield, a Puritan town in Connecticut, where her Aunt Rachel lives. While on the ship, Kit begins to realise that her upbringing and ways of thought are not only strange to the Puritans, but are considered unwelcome and downright dangerous. Her ability to read and swim, her luxurious silk dresses, and her lack of piousness startle her shipmates - John Holbrooke, a shy young man studying to be a minister, and even Nat Eaton, the quick witted and fiery first mate.Kit arrives in Wethersfield and is aghast to see how small, provincial and colourless it is compared to the fine towns in Barbados. She arrives to a startled but warm welcome from her Aunt Rachel and her cousin Mercy, but her dour Uncle Matthew and beautiful but sulky cousin Judith are leas welcoming. Kit struggles to find her place in her new surroundings, which seem to block her every effort at forming connections with others, whether it is with young Prudence Cruff, or with the mysterious woman who lives in the Great Meadow. Kit persists on creating her own world and puts her new family at risk when she is accused of witchcraft by the increasingly intolerant and fearful townspeople. This book has enthralling adventure, family tension, and even a bit of gentle romance. The secondary characters spring to life and their stories are followed as well. For those of you worried about the witchcraft or magic themes, there is no actual magic practiced in the book. Characters are accused of being witches, but at no point is it ever portrayed or even suggested that any of the characters were actually either able or desirous of performing witchcraft. Witchcraft is depicted in a historical light as an example of scapegoating and intolerance. There are no fantasy elements.The Witch of Blackbird Pond has been treasured by young readers for over 50 years for its timelessness and and superb writing. This book was truly deserving of its Newbery Medal and the author's other books including The Sign of the Beaver and The Bronze Bow continue to captivate new audiences.

This is one good book.Kit Tyler is a sixteen-year-old girl who leaves Barbados after her grandfather's death for the more austere world of Puritan New England to say with her aunt's family. But Kit is completely unprepared for the ways of these people. Even so, she manages to grow in unimaginable ways as she connects with people with whom she would have never seen herself.And it's not a simple moralistic book. It's a book about a girl coming of age. Unlike other books of the Puritans, there are no villains, just those who are different and it's amazing to see Kit come to understand that.The characters are entrancing and dimensional, the setting is described in an honest prose that only shows Speare's love of New England.It deserves its Newberry."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This book is definitely worth reading several times.

Some of it was entertaining but a lot of the words were hard and it was confusing because of the way they talked. It was hard to understand. But mostly, I liked it.The book takes place in 1687 and is about a teenage girl named Kit Tyler. She lives on her grandfather's plantation on the island of Barbados. The weather is always sunny and nice and she can swim and play all day and doesn't have to do any work. One day, Kit's grandfather suddenly dies and she is left with no money so she has to go on a ship called the \\"Dolphin\\" to live with her aunt and uncle and her two cousins, Mercy and Judith in a Puritan colony of Connecticut. Life is a lot harder because she has to work all the time and the weather is not nice like it was in Barbados. The people are very religious and strict and she feels like she doesn't fit in. She takes a job as a school teacher but the schoolmaster doesn't like the way she is teaching so he fires her. One day, she meets a kind woman named Hannah Tupper who lives in the meadows. Hannah is very nice to her and she likes to visit her. But when Kit tells her aunt and uncle that she is seeing Hannah, they tell her that she can't see her anymore because she is a witch. Kit disobeys her aunt and uncle and decides to keep seeing Hannah.

The people go to Hannah's house to arrest her and put her on trial for using witchcraft. Kit gets to her first and hides her and the townspeople burn down her house. Kit gets Hannah on the \\"Dolphin\\" and she goes to a safe town. Her aunt and uncle and the people of the town find out that she has helped Hannah and think that she is also a witch. They arrest her and during the trial they accuse her of witchcraft. Her friend Nat comes to help her and gets her out of trouble. Nat leaves for the sea again and Kit is very homesick for Barbados.

I have only read it once in a couple of weeks and was surprised at how colonial it was. Everything in the story is 1700 colonial like, including the type of works they did, the stocks, the type of clothes, calling instead of dating, the types of food, etc. I could go on and on. Speare must have done lots of research to make her story so genuine. Although, it is sort of old (seeing as though my mom read it in 3rd grade), it seems she wrote it 300 years ago, not 50. The descriptions of everything make you feel you are really in Wethersfield, Conn. She also wrote about the witch superstitions, like wearing odd clothes, being able to swim, and reading and acting out plays. When I first read the cover title, I thought the book was going to be about witches. Although there is a small witch trial in the back of the book, it is basically about Kit's life in Connecticut, in colonial times. I was a little disappointed about the fact that the book was not about witches. I read the book because I was interested in witches, not in colonial life. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in American history."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Speare won the Newberry medal in 1957. This book is historical fiction. The setting was in 1750 in an east coastline shore in the Americas in a village of farmers with a high character value. The general public at this time and place thought of witchcraft as the devil's art and burned witches (or anybody they thought was a witch) at the stake. These were unjust times for many accused of being a witch. I thought Ms. Speare did a great job of portraying feelings and the time and era in which the story takes place. The story runs smoothly from event to event and the details in the story help you get a sense of what's happening. The author includes many concrete descriptions and gives you a very vivid idea of what's going on. The best part about this book was it was actually exciting and you never knew the entire truth till the very end.... Historical fiction is a fiction story but it is based on an event that actually happened in history. This book meets the standards of historical fiction because in the 1750's (the time in which the book takes place) the scenarios with the characters are what it was like. For example when a male wanted to marry a girl he would \\"call\\" on her and on certain evenings he would come over and talk with her. He would also make a house for both of them to live in. Both these things happen in the book and lots of other things. This book was a great book and had great detail!

Which then forced her to have to go and live with hergrandfather who was very rich. Soon after she went to live with hergrandfather he to passed away, which left her with no one to livewith. Her grandfather owed a debt to a man that he never paid,Katherine didn't have hardly enough money to pay him with so the manasked her to marry him but she said no. Then Katherine decided totravel to her aunt and uncle's house to live with them for awhile. Katherine traveled by boat to their house on the Dolphin.While Katherine was on board, a young girl's doll dropped into thewater and Katherine went and jumped into the water to get the dollsince the young girl's mother wouldn't. In this time there was aroutine that was followed by young woman and women. This was, theywere thrown into the water and then if they sank they weren't a witch,but if they floated they were a witch. So while Katherine was in thewater trying to receive the doll, a young by the name of Nate jumpedin to make Katherine sink so that everyone thought that she was awitch. Once Katherine had arrived at her aunt and uncle's house, shewas told to stay away from a lady who lived near the pond and everyonethought that she was a witch. So then Katherine became curious to thelady that lived near the pond and decided that she would go and visither. Someone found out that Katherine went to visit the lady and wentto tell her uncle.

The characters had personalities all their own. There was an amusing variety of personality. You go from soft-spoken John Holbrook to strictly puritan Matthew Wood to very vocal Gershom Bulkeley. This book was great!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The book that I was reading is called The Witch of Blackbird Pond. This book is by Elizabeth George Spearce. This book was amazing because the main character, which was Kit, expressed herself in a way no other characters express themselves.In this book the main character is Kit, she is accused of being a witch. It all started on the ship the \\"Dolphin\\" because a little girl drops her doll in the ocean and Kit jumps after it to save it. Supposedly if you can swim that means that you're a witch, a \\"regular\\" girl would just sink. Kit denies it and says that her grandfather taught her.There were some things I didn't like and some I did about the book. I liked the book because this reminded me of the Salem Witch Trails. I also liked this book because the book had many interesting settings. My last reason is because I liked the way Kit expressed herself towards the people around her. What I didn't like is that it didn't talk a lot about the title. Also I didn't like the way that she didn't talk about the other characters.There were many settings in this book. The first setting was the \\"Dolphin\\" which is the ship Kit boardes on. The second setting is Connecticut. The third is mostly where the story took place after Kit got off the Dolphin, which is her Aunt's house. Lastly, Blackbird Pond is another setting. This book was historical fiction."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Can you believe the great book I have just finished? The great book I just finished reading is titled The Witch Of Blackbird Pond. The great writer that wrote this book is Elizabeth George Speare. The genre is Historical Fiction. This book takes place in Connecticut, in Blackbird pond, at Kit's aunt's house, and the \\"Dolphin.\\"This book is about a girl and he name is Kit and she used to live with her grandfather, but he died. Then before her grandfather died a guy wanted to marry Kit but she didn't want to. So she went aboard the \\"Dolphin\\" (a ship) and a little girl dropped he doll. So kit went to get it in the water and she knew how to swim. But when she came back she came back she was in a little bit of trouble because she was accused of being a witch, because \\"regular\\" girls would drown. Then she went to her aunt's house and they had a school in the summer, and Kit's cousin Mercy is the teacher. The they let Kit teach and she made a mistake and they didn't let Kit teach but then they gave he r a 2nd chance. At some point they tell kit that there is a witch in Blackbird pond and that she does witchcraft and she got in a lot of trouble for being a witch. In the end everything turns out all right for everyone because the two cousins found the perfect guy to marry and Kit finds freedom. So Mercy marries John Holbrook and Kit's other cousin Judith marries William Ashby.I liked the book because the book was interesting like when they went to the pond and she met the witch. I also liked the book because they had little kids and I like little kids and I like little kids and because it talks about the problems that she went through to get accustomed to the new way of living.

Not only does she have to do the chores she used to have servants do, but her Puritan relatives are much stricter then her previous upbringing has taught her to be.But her life isn't all bad. There is the interest William, the most eligible bachelor in town, has shown in her. And there's the refuge she's managed to find in Hannah, the town outcast suspected of being a witch. But will she ever truly adjust to her new life?I found this book in Jr. High, and have read it four or five times since then. I recently reread it again, and was completely drawn into the story. I couldn't put it down, and I already knew how it ended. The characters are sympathetic and interesting, especially Kit. You can help but root for her to find some happiness in her new life. The plot is engrossing, with several sub-plots expertly woven through the book. And the time and place of the setting is brought to life in such an amazing way it feels like you are actually in the town of Wethersfield.This book is so engrossing that anyone will love it. And the theme about judging others will stick with you long after you've read the last page. I can not recommend this book highly enough.

It tells the story of Kit Tyler, a 16-year-old girl who sails from Barbados to Connecticut after her grandfather passes away. Kit travels to Connecticut to live with her aunt and her aunt's family, none of who have met her and who do not know that she is coming. Connecticut was a Puritan community struggling for independence from England at this time and the culture shock is difficult for Kit, who grew up affluent and independent. The townspeople are not very welcoming to her and some believe to fear that she is a witch because she is different from them. Kit's troubles get worse when she becomes friends with an old Quaker woman people called the Witch of Blackbird Pond.I would recommend this book for ages 10 and up. Most children have felt like they didn't fit in at some point and will be able to relate to Kit. This book teaches children about tolerance, acceptance, and not being judgmental. I would use this book in a school setting as part of a social studies curriculum. It is appropriate for discussions about witch trials, Puritan history, and Connecticut history.

Recently, in a fit of nostalgia, I purchased &quot;Calico Captive&quot; and, on a whim, I also grabbed &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; simply because it was by the same author and also set in colonial times. I felt I could use some light, escapist reading material in order to take a break from my usual heavy fare of military history books.Anyway I started to read &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; at around 9:30 in the evening. At 2AM, I finished it. I couldn't put it down! After the first few chapters the book becomes a real page turner. I had to find out what would happen next. Would Kit ever adapt to the austere life of the Puritans? How would the situation with Prudence Cruff pan out? Would Kit marry William? Would John marry the girl he truly loved? Would Uncle Matthew ever soften? And, of course, what would happen if the Puritans found out about Kit's friendship with a suspected witch?

It's about a white girl, from the sunny West Indies, who moves to the cold, unwelcoming colonies in New England. Her uncle, a Puritan, reluctantly takes her in. Though they treat her as good as as their own children, they're clearly not happy to have her. For starters, the Puritans are serious people, and she's used to play and leisure. The Puritans are austere and Spartan, while she's used to flamboyant luxury. The family's life is preoccupied with hunting, farming, cooking, and cleaning; the kind of stuff one has to do in order to eat. She, however, comes from a wealthy family and has never even cooked for herself.But she learns. The family are Puritans after all, and it's their duty to teach her self-sufficiency. Soon she settles into the routine, cooking meals, cleaning, and teaching young children to read.But Puritan life comes with a problem. The people believe in the existence of witches, and anybody who appears unusual is a suspect. Hannah, a kindly old woman who lives alone, was once a suspected witch. She has a scar on her face as a reminder of how she suffered under the Puritans' paranoia. Worse, she's a Quaker, and the Quakers are despised by the Puritans.Faced with an inquisition-like investigation, she faces the harshness of the Colonial laws of the time. Judge's decisions are not based on codified laws, but on the religious and social mores and norms. Every single good thing she's done since arriving is suspected as an act of witchcraft and subversion.But there is hope. As with today's legal system, success depends on getting the right advocate! Will the townspeople stand up for her and denounce the witch hunts, or will she be tortured by religious hysteria?"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"A witch? Someone thinks you are a witch? When Kit leaves Barbados on the lovely Dolphin ship to live in America with her Uncle, she is unprepared for what she encounters. What a surprise when she discovers that being able to read, swim, wear fancy clothes, as well as befriending a kind old woman is odd behavior for this town. In The Witch of Blackbird Pond, Elizabeth George Spears sends you on a reading adventure. The story includes a number of surprising and suspenseful events including a frightening witch hunt and a big outcry among some angry villagers against their government. Some parts of the story are a little boring, but the elaborate language and unpredictable moments bring you right back into the book. The climax of this book is the best part. It's unbeleivable and exciting. The main character, Kit, is very interesting. You will feel like you know her only after reading a few pages. Fiesty, wise, and stubborn are some of Kit's personality traits. You will also become very familiar with many of the other characters including Kit's two cousins, her Aunt and Uncle, Nat a seaman, and John and William two very interesting men, plus many more!

They are the decendents of Roald Dahl and even as much as I am glad they are out there, I sometime wonder why there aren't more decendents of Frances Hodgson Burnett. Where are the sweetly serious books? This is one such decendant and more should be out there. The Witch of Blackbird Pond is an absolutely wonderful novel of historical fiction that throws early America into stark light. I read this book over and over when I was a child and though I have not read it in 15 or more years, I can still remeber the twists and turns of the plot. History is rekindled through Kit (I can still remember her name), a young emigrant just come to America to start a new life far from her natice Barbados. You see the grey winters, the hard working people whose religion shapes their daily lives, and the fear. Speare brings a small part of reality to life. And that is what is truly missing from so many modern children books. I truly recommend this book to all kids who have a thirst for the past."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I had to read this book as an assignment in 6th grade. Ten years later, I have re-read it 10 times. That's right, one time for every year! That's how much the story stuck in my mind.Rather than give away the plot, here's are a few reasons why The Witch of Blackbird Pond is so special to me, i.e. my favorite scenes:1. I really related to Kit Tyler and I still do. It's the feeling of being out of place, of not belonging and not being accepted, of having people try to change you, and then running away and finding the meadows and making friends such as Prudence and Hannah Tupper and finally feeling at peace.2. The scene when Kit accidently saw Mercy's love for John Holbrook and realized that Mercy loved him.3. The scene where Kit walked out of the door and saw her hated Uncle Matthew as a lonely, defiant figure clutching the soil of his land! It was there that she first started to respect the strength within him.4. And finally, without recounting all the sentimental parts of the book: I LOVE the character of Nat Eaton and all the scenes when Kit and Nat are together. Elizabeth George Spheres portrayed them with alot of subtle chemistry. They banter because they are, in truth, really attracted to each other. And Nat, despite his cocky attitude, really comes to Kit's rescue everytime. Coincidence?

It has well developed characters and humor.This is the plot:Kit Tyler, a recently orphaned teen, boards a boat that is heading for America. After a long voyage, she finally sees the shore of the land that she will come to live at. She is not impressed. But, hey! You can't blame her. After living a luxurious life on the tropical city of Barbados, The Connecticut Colony must look pretty bleak.Once there, she goes to her Aunt's house, where she is welcomed by her cousins, Judith and Mercy. Her Uncle...not so much...The life she must learn to live there is much different from her old life, involving the work her slaves would normally do, and having to live through the boring Thursday sermons of the puritan church.

The story of the girl who leaves her island home and must adjust to the harsh New England environment struck a chord with me, as I was a military kid and always moving from place to place. This story is about a girl who finds herself in a new environment that goes against everything she has ever learned or experienced, and she must learn who she is in order to survive this new land. It's also a romance story, and an intriguing story that shows what can happen when people become so closed-minded about what is \\"right\\" and \\"proper\\" that they refuse to look past a person's supposed subversive actions in order to really see or understand that person.

This girl was able to swim and was rich her whole life. So she was accustomed to never working and being able to swim and have fun all day. So you can already see the conflict there.

Kit was received by her Uncle in a less than welcoming manner though, her Aunt and two cousins Mercy and Judith were glad to have her. What she didn't count on, however, was how different, and hard, her aunt and uncle's grim, cheerless, and strict Puritan way of life was.

When they learned she could read and swim, she was accused of being a witch. When Kit befriended Hannah Tupper, an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond it was more than the community could take. Yet, Kit learned that \\"Hannah Tupper was far from being a witch, but certainly she had worked a magic charm.

I understand she may be a young girl who is somewhat possessive of her home state's claim to witch hunt fame, but witch hysteria took over all of New England at that time. Here is an excerpt from a website dealing with the history of Stamford, CT and surrounding areas:\\"The early codes of New England made witchcraft a capital offense. Religious and English precedents were considered as sufficient authority. Connecticut passed a law in 1642 which stated that \\"If any man or woman be a witch-that is, hath or consulteth with a familiar spirit-they shall be put to death.\\" In New Haven Colony the law declared that \\"If any person be a witch, he or she shall be put to death, according to Exod. 22.18, Levit.20.27, Deut.18.10,11.\\"Prior to the 1692 delusion numerous trials for witchcraft in Connecticut were held-at Windsor (1647), Wethersfield (1648, 1650-51), Stratford (1651), Fairfield (1653), New Haven (1655, 1657), Easthampton (1658), and Saybrook (1661). Ten persons were accused and placed under arrest in 1662 and four were tried, convicted and executed. The victims were the last individuals to suffer the death penalty for witchcraft in Connecticut. By 1692 court procedures relating to witchcraft were well established.\\"Ms. Spears does not have her history confused, but rather did excellent research toward writing this book. Recommended reading for all young folks interested in early American history."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"&quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond,&quot; by Elizabeth George Speare, is the story of Kit Tyler, a young woman from Barbados who in 1687 goes to live with relatives in Connecticut colony. Kit experiences quite a bit of culture shock. A key figure in the story is Hannah Tupper, an elderly neighbor suspected of witchcraft.This is a fascinating story, well told by Speare. The strong-willed Kit is an admirable character, and I really got caught up in her story. Speare offers an intriguing look at colonial era life and culture--the book is full of interesting details and thoughtful touches, such as a reference to colonial-era poet Anne Bradstreet.In a relatively short novel Speare touches on a rich assortment of colonial-era topics: religious difference, anti-Quaker bigotry, politics, education, fears of witchcraft, etc. All these things are skillfully woven into the compelling story. And Speare vividly describes the natural beauty of colonial Connecticut with the changing seasons.The book has a copyright date of 1958, so I would say that it has stood the test of time as a literary work. It's also a Newbery Medal winner. For a good companion text I would recommend a volume of Anne Bradstreet's poems."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I've recently just read this book despite the fact that I'm an older reader (not that old!).

And after a time she is also under suspicion of practicing witchcraft herself. This book says it is for ages 12 and up but I am 10 and I still enjoyed it very much. This book makes you long for the ending, to see whether she escapes from suspicion, and finds true love, or if she retuns home. It is old history from the year of 1687. It really brings out the feeling of this girl, Kit Tyler, as she struggles through this difficult life that her cousins, aunt and uncle live in.

Kit's journey from the warm Caribbean to the coldPuritan valley in Connecticut has been read again and again, and will likely be read for decades to come. A charming romance of an outsider trying to fit into a new and strange culture, the novel immediately brings the reader a sense of what it is like to try and fit into a world very different from the one you grew up in. My only complaints about the novel are minor: the picture of the Puritans is far too cold, given what we now understand about the Puritans (although their persecution of the Quakers is dead on in the novel), and the ending seems a little too pat and contrived (I won't tell you, other than to say that everybody ends up with somebody they deserve). Still, a wonderful read after all these years."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a good book.Friendship was clearly a theme of this good book, The Witch of Blackbird Pond.

One day she went there with her friend Nat to help fix Hannah's roof, and when she got home, her uncle Matthew got mad at her.

The time it took place was during the time when the American colonies were being settled. This book was well written and would be great to read for people who love soap operas. There was not a lot of action in this book and no adventure. At times I didn't even want to read the book and other times I was locked on to it. There is some irony in this book and it can get very exciting.

There were parts in the book than were kind of slow and drug on. I would give this book two stars. Some of the parts that should have been long were very short and not enthralling. One example of this would be the witch trials. I thought that would be thrilling and exciting, but instead it was was short and down to the point. If it would have been more gripping, it would have got a better rate. I didn't like how this book bounced from one spot to another. In some some places you got lost. I didn't like the beginning because it didn't draw me in or keep my attention. She didn't give me much of a physical description of the characters or the setting. The plot was unclear and had many different problems, so it was hard to keep straight what was happening. The ending was a good ending it was probably the best part of the book because everybody got what they wanted. If it would have had more detail and suspense.

The main character is Kit Tyler. The story is about a girl who came from England and went to the Caribbean and went to New England to live with her cousins. The town that she lived in was a town in Connecticut in 1687.The people accused Kit of being a witch. She could not do anything about it and she was put in a store room. The son of the captain saved her from being persecuted as a witch. She got away from the people that accused her. This book is a good way to understand the way the people who were different were treated in New England in the 1600s."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I enjoyed this book mainly because it is a Historical fiction novel. I think this book would be a good reading source for anyone between the ages of 11-13 because it has alot to teach about life in the 1800's while letting you read a facinating story about a girl and the troubles she goes through after she moves away from her home in Barbados to her uncles home in New England.

Everyone was just plain everyday individuals that did everyday things, like cleaning and spinning wool, making meals, cleaning the house and making clothes. It would have been interesting if the author had put Kit or some other character on an adventure or made it a fiction not a historical fiction.

I want to read a book about some adventure or action."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"It's not that this is a poorly written or poorly concieved book.

I didn't really like it because it just isn't my kind of book. I usually like more action filled books like hunting books of murder novels, I just think that they are more interesting.The Witch of Black Bird pond was pretty well written. The author did a good job of trying to make it interesting. There are some people that liked the book a lot but I just wasn't one of them. I also though that the author wrote the book very correct to history with all of the witch hunt stuff. The author did a good job describing and telling the story. I think that if you like romance with a little bit of action in it this is definitely the book for you.Probably one of the reasons that I didn't like it is because it had a witch in it and I don't believe in witches. That made it really hard for me to take seriously. I didn't much care for the names of the characters.

After reading Harry Potter, some say, there's nowhere for kids to go to find other good books.The quality of the writing in this book and other Newbery Award winners runs circles around any Harry Potter book (and probably also around Twilight).If you're a teacher or a parent and don't know how to find all the Newbery books, just google Newbery on the internet - there's been a medal-winning book every year since, I think, the 1920's, as well as several Newbery Honor books each year, and they're all listed.Have your child or student read a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I have always loved this book, but and all i had was the paperback so when i found this i was so excited.

We were studying the Puritan Time period of history and this book was a wonderful depiction of the lifestyles and beliefs of people living during this period. The language was challenging in the beginning but the students were are to grasp the message of the book. We noted similarities with the main character Kit and the girls growing up in today's world.Kit portrays the life of a 16 year old girl amongst a new and unusual Puritan community. She is from a foreign shore and therefore she is disliked and thought of as suspicious (because she is different). Kit befriends a Quaker woman far outside of town, the two develop a wonderful relationship. The community casts scorn on the women and eventually Kit is scorned as well.This book was a wonderful teaching tool because it depicted how belief and presumption can cause great pain and suffering for individuals that have \\"different\\" beliefs, attitudes and feelings. It also helped my young students understand the tribulations of history and how being different can at times cost one their home, their lively hood and even their life. We had a lively discussion on how Kit remained strong and self assured among so much bitterness and hatred.This is a must read for any social studies class learning about Puritan history and the Salem Witch trials."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This book is very applicable to everyday life.

In Connecticut, she mat her aunts family which is aunt Rachel,uncle Matthew,Mercy, and Judith. She also met William Asby who wanted to marry her and Hannah Tupper known as the witch of blackbird pond. When ever she feels down and stressed,she goes to Hannah's and she also teaches a girl named Prudence how to read. When she tells her only family now about Hannah Tupper they tell her not to go there. However, Kit still goes there and she meets Hannah's seafaring friend Nat shoet for Nathaniel Eaton. There was a sickness going througout the town and they blamed it on Hannah. Kit went to go to help her escape. They burned her house and Kit and Hannah went where no one could see them and as the sun rose, she saw the Dolphin, the boat in which Nat would be on.Nat took Hannah to to his Mom in Saybrook and asked Kit if she wanted to go but she couldn't. Kit and William had a talk and decided that they should see other people. What ended up happening was John Holbrook and Mercy got married and Judith married William asby and it was a double wedding. Kit on the other hand had feelings about Nat but she didn't know what to do .Nat came back and said that he wanted to talk to her uncle about things ans then asked in a non direct way if she will marry him.I like the book because it keeps you intrested and the end is romantic and it has a really great ending.I didn't like it when Judith just assumed that John wanted to be with her because what she didn't know was that John liked Mercy and mercy liked John, the only preson other than John that knew was Kit.

One day, Kit was helping her cousin in a field, when she spotted an old, little house. She saw an old lady working there. She asked her cousin about it. Her cousin said, \\"She is the witch of Blackbird pond.\\" Kit was scared. When things got worse, Kit finally broke. She ran and ran and ran. Her feet carried her to the big field. She through herself on the ground and sobbed herself to sleep. When she woke up, the witch was standing there and watching her. The witch said, \\"Thee must be hungry. Come with Thee.\\" Kit was not afraid at all of this sweet old lady. She took her into her house and gave her some food and drink. Kit felt wonderful after that. She thought to herself, \\"Why would anyone say that she is a witch?\\" They became good friends. Kit heard a mob one night. She crept out of the house and eave-dropped them.

The story takes place in 1687.Katherine \\"Kit\\" Tyler lived with her grandfather in Barbados on his large plantation. When he died, Kit sold everything to pay the workers and to not leave any debt. Unfortunately, that left her with nothing. She decided to travel by ship to Connecticut to live with her aunt and uncle.When Kit arrives, she learns that things are very different in the Puritan settlement than she is used to. It is hard for her to become used to this way of life, but she manages because she is a strong and fiercely determined girl!Kit becomes friends with an old woman named Hannah, who has been ostracized by the Puritan community because she is a Quaker. The Puritans call her \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond.\\" Kit feels a sort of kinship with her and, even though she has been forbidden by her uncle, she visits Hannah as often as she can. The only other person to be brave enough to visit Hannah is Nat Eaton, a sailor who brings goods to Hannah whenever he returns to the settlement. Hannah found Nat in the meadow by her house when he was a young boy in the same manner that she found Kit: sobbing! Just as she had done with Kit, she had invited Nat back to her home for some blueberry cake and to cuddle her cats. The kindly woman was, and continues to be, such a comfort to him!In the meadow by Blackbird Pond, Kit finds a young girl named Prudence. Just as Hannah had done to her, Kit invites Prudence back to Hannah's house explaining that it is a safe and loving place for her to visit. Kit was taught by her grandfather to read, although it was practically unheard of at that time for a girl to have learned this important skill. She taught Prudence not only how to read but also to write in cursive.When sickness befalls the community and the children start dying, the residents decide that the Witch must be to blame! Kit risks everything to get to Hannah's house before the mob, and she and Hannah hide in the bushes watching while the mob burns down her house and searches for her. Luckily, Nat's boat returns the following morning and he takes Hannah aboard and brings her to live with his aunt in a town where she will be safe.Although Hannah escaped safely, Kit was arrested for helping and consorting with a witch and was accused of even being a witch herself! Who will come to Kit's defense?We loved this book! Kit is a fabulous character. She faces adversity with such admirable strength. This is our second book by Speare (we previously read The Sign of the Beaver), and we love that Speare's protagonists are non-judgmental and have acceptance of those who are different.This book also inspired a lot of discussion about Puritans, Quakers, and the Salem Witch trials.MY RATING: 5 stars!!

Kit, who had been raised by her grandfather, while living in Barbados, has forced her to move in with her aunt and uncle in Connecticut, due to her grandfather's death. Things are much different in the colonies of Connecticut though. Life is not the same for Kit, doing chores and having strict adult figures is not something she is used to. People around town look at Kit in disbelief, as her dress, attitude, and disrespect is unacceptable.Of course with all of the new, bad news, comes some good news. Kit has made some friends. William, one of the most attractive men in town has shown interest. Perhaps Kit will find love in this unknown place? Then again, she has become fond of the one person who is despised and disowned by the town, who is believed to be a witch. Will Kit ever be accepted by the residents of Wethersfield, especially after they find out who her new friend is? Can Kit learn to not be judgmental, or will she struggle forever to once again find happiness?

Things were really hard, now having to work herself when she had not so much as washed the dishes in her life. She loved her cousins and her aunt, but she just could not stand it.Eventually, Kit meets this kind, sweet, elderly Lady named Hannah Tupper. Everyone thinks she is a witch and the blame every thing that goes wrong on her. It mostly is because she is a Quaker, a group of people that had a different religous beleifs than all of the other people in town. Kit knows that Hannah is not a witch and cares for her, and refuses to turn her down.I like this book, but it was not one of my very favorites. The style the author used was a very interesting way of doing it, but it confused me, and got me lost at times. One of the reasons I admire this book is because it teaches you that everyone has choices in life, whether they are good or bad.

She goes aboard the ship, the Dolphin, heading for Connecticut Colony, and wishes to live a better life at her aunt's house. While on the way, she becomes friends with the captain's son, Nat Eaton, John Holbrook, a man planning on becoming a minister, and Prudence, a little girl. When she finally arrives at her destination, she tries to fit in with the Puritans, and to keep up with her lively cousin, Judith, and her gentle one, Mercy. After a number of different accidents in the family and outside, she finds becomes friends with an old Quaker woman named Hannah, that lives at Blackbird Pond, who is said to be a witch. Kit does not believe this, and she keeps on being friends with the old woman. But, the villagers see Kit as a threat to the community, since they do not trust her as being a friend to their witch, and she goes on trial. Just as she thinks she is doomed, Nat Eaton and Prudence save her. However, Kit discovers that she will never fit in with the Puritans, and planned on going on the Dolphin the next time the ship came. Finally, the ship docks, and she goes on it, for what seems to be a much better future.My favorite part of the book was where Kit goes on trial. I thought of this at my favorite part for I think it is very interesting to hear how other people act to problems and try to blame it on someone else. I think it is very funny how people think of small problems and turn them into what sounds like a major disasters performed by a witch. I like the part where Prudence comes in, and stuns her own parents by doing what they had never thought she would be able to do, which was reading the Bible and writing her own name. I think it is not right when parents think very little about kids and think they are still their little babies that always need their parents to help them.I recommend this book to kids the ages of 10 and up. I also recommend adults to read this book and learn the facts of how kids can do things without any help from their parents or any one else. I believe Elizabeth George Speare is a great author who has written many books that I have enjoyed. After reading this book, I came to really enjoy it. At first I thought it was very boring, but in the end, it became more interesting and fun. I also learned not to judge anyone by what people say about them, but you should always think about your judgement before actually thinking about if it is true or not.

The main character, Kit Tyler, is brought to life by her nobility attribute, her independent disposition, and her careless and brave ways. The way Speare brings couples together in the novel is amazing. I am a firm believer in helping people and having healthy relationships; Speare displays this so thoughtful through the witch and Kit Tyler. Even though it was entirly fiction, you feel like you are really there through the whole thing. As I had said before, this was a very unique book. The way that it skips what could be boring events and goes straight to the important ones in each chapter is impecable. It keeps the reader focused on the true plot of the story. The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that the trial was not as suspenceful as I hoped it would be, but other that, my imagingation ran wild. Read this book as soon as you can, it is well worth the time."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Speare, Elizabeth George. The Witch of Blackbird Pond. New York: Yearling, 1987Martin, Michelle H. \\"Hey, Who' the Kid with the Green Umbrella?: Re-evaluating the Black-A-Moor and Little Black Sambo.\\" The Lion and the Unicorn 22 (1998): 147-162Kit Tyler gazes for the first time at the cold shores of Connecticut Colony. This is going to be her new home, and it doesn't compare to the Caribbean Islands she left behind. Not only does she feel like an outcast when she moves to this Puritan community, but when she meets a witch and they become friends, Kit encounters suspicion, fear, and anger. Elizabeth George Speare has written a well constructed and outstanding historical novel, The Witch of Blackbird Pond, of a girl who wants to overcome the hatred of this place she is made to live and call her new home. The use of such words as \\"staring hungrily at the first sight of land...\\"(Kit) gives us a better picture of this particular scene and the emotions she felt as she saw land for the first time in a while. This also sets the scenes in the book because the reader can feel like they are part of the book. Kit feels like a social outcast, and her community made her feel this way. Although this story was written in the 20th Century Speare wanted to portray life in the 17th Century. This is done by sharing the values the Puritans had and the way the people in her community feels. This novel depicts a never-ending battle that has been going for many centuries between the so-called \`outcasts' of society. In her article \\"Hey, Who's the Kid with the Umbrella?: Re-evaluating the Black-A-Moor and Little Black Sambo\\", Dr. Michelle H. Martin says that black children were virtually invisible in children's literature until the 1960's, and this is shown to be true in this story. (147) Even though this story was written in the 20th Century, there were not any black children in this book. In fact, there were not many of the other races either in the book. I am sure there were other than white people on this boat so why aren't they mentioned in the text? Martin's article goes on to talk of the two books that depict African Americans better but I feel that more stories should, especially recent stories, should talk about other cultures in some way. Despite this problem, however, I feel that The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a wonderful and intriguing book filled with unexpected events and an outstanding ending.This was a wonderful way to depict the hardships going on during this time period."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said, but I'll say it anyway. I love this book. Kit is an easy to like character with good qualities and faults just like you and I but she is completely likable. Plus, I find that there is not a boring part in this book. It is interesting to see how she, the &quot;little bird&quot; that doesn't seem to belong anywhere but in Barbados, tries to fit into a place where she thinks she can't. In time she finds her place and feels accepted, but it's how she got there that makes this book so engrossing."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"MY GRANDCHILDREN NEEDED THIS BOOK FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT.

When her grandfather suddenly dies, Kit decides to live with her only living relatives in Connecticut. She has a rocky start on the boat trip over. On the Dolphin, she meets a boy named Nat Eaton, the captain's son, a young girl named Prudence Cruff, whose mother abuses her and accuses Kit of being a witch, and a man named John Holbrook, who is going to Wethersfield to be a student of the minister. It all started when Prudence's doll fell overboard and Kit jumps in to get it. In Connecticut, if you float on water, you are considered a witch. She is an outcast from the moment she gets off the ship. With her beautiful gowns and wild manner, she doesn't fit in with her Connecticut, Puritan family. She lives with her Uncle Matthew, her Aunt Rachel, and her two cousins, Mercy, and Judith. Uncle Matthew doesn't welcome Kit at all. He is upset that she didn't write him a letter first, but she didn't tell him that she didn't write because she had to leave right away or else she would have to marry an old man. Everyone at the &quot;Meeting&quot; or church, is shocked of her lovely clothes, and her personality. William Ashby, a boy Kit's age starts to court her, but Judith likes him. Everyone knows that William won't build his own house until he knows who he wants to marry, and everyone knows that he is about to propose to Kit. Everyone, including Judith, thinks John Holbrook is going to propose to Judith, but he really is in love with Mercy and she is in love with him. Kit feels bad about not being able to help the family much, and is very happy when she gets an oppertunity to make wages and teaching school with Mercy. Kit decides to teach the children by putting on a play about a story in the bible. It gets out of hand and Mr. Kimberley, the school master gets very upset and dismisses or &quot;fires&quot; Kit. She runs to the Meadow and there, she meets a Widow Tupper, who everyone believes to be a witch. She secretly becomes good friends with Widow Tupper, and the Widow helps her get her job back in the school, and secretly teaches Prudence how to read. Then a plague sweeps through the town and Kit is accused of doing it! Mercy is close to dying and Judith is also very sick. Kit has to save Hannah Tupper before its too late! When Kit is put on trial she finds her true friends. This story is very romantic, and very exciting. It shows how people care for each other and help each other no matter what. I think this is a wonderful book for all ages, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as it did."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"If you like unique settings and plots, and also the supernatural and what people thought about it, then this book is a really good match for you. One of the main focuses is the Puritan community. It provides, in indepth detail, the customs, beliefs, rituals, and everyday life of an average Puritan in 1687. Another focus is the American colonies in the late 1600s and the friction between the king of England and the settlers. It's really the start of the Revolutionary War, and it shows how it started. And, of course, another point of this book is unjust persecution of people with minor differences or far-fetched accusations. As with the Salem witch trials, persecution of &quot;witches&quot;, or people of a different religion, as with Hannah Tupper in this book, was common in that period and that place. An interesting part of this book was the character of Mercy, and also the character of Judith. The sisters are alike and different in many ways. You have to go deep into their character to really understand that they have the same views about family. But another unique idea in this book was that the &quot;beautiful&quot; one wasn't nessecarily the nicest. And as one of my closing statements I would like to add that back in the late 1600s, when you were different, suspicion was cast upon you for no just reason, and it made you more vulnerable to the blame. Also, women and children weren't treated as fairly as today, and readers have to understand that. To conclude my report, this book is as unique as they come. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Barry Moser illustrates this reissue of a Newbery Award-winning story of a girl marked by suspicion from the moment she enters colonial Connecticut in 1687.

I love the way she explained with detail every setting as it changed. For example, when the setting changed from the boat to Weithersfield, she explained what the setting was like as Kit's opinion about this place. She described it as having flat, square houses and nothing like Barbadoes, where she used to live. Another example is when the setting changed during the witch hunt for Kit's friend, Hannah, an old, sweet lady who is accused of being a witch. She described very well the mob of people and the burning of Hannah's house. She Also described very well the house of her cousins, The Woods. Not only did she describe the setting well but characters and their feelings, like how hard the chores were to Kit and how Mercy and John loved each other so much.This novel is an excellent one and anyone who has the opportunity to read it should."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"In the book the Witch of Blackbird Pond, a girl named Kit runs from her home in Barados to come to her aunt and uncle's home in Wethersfield after her grandfather died.

According to the author, these ten commandments can provide &quot;ground rules&quot; that may stabilize society. He offers clear definition of the intent of each commandment and looks at the implication that each could have in social ethics. Harrelson demonstrates excellent knowledge of the topic and a sensitivity to pluralism. This is not an evangelically driven text. This text centers on this issue of human rights ... not theology. He offers historical and cultural anecdotes that clarify his appreciation of the commandments and their role in society. In general, this is a great conversation piece that offers insights to people everywhere. The only caution I have is that the language used in the book, at times, gets somewhat complex. This is not leisure reading by any extent of the imagination."},{"Title":"TEN COMMANDMENTS & HUMAN RIGHTS","review":"Harrelson's scholarship I do not question. He exegetes each of the ten commandments with quite a degree of skill. His knowledge of the Hebrew grammar is impressive, and his grasp of Christian theology is adequate to his task.What I object to is Harrelson's setting up of Moses as a sort of Thomas Jefferson figure. He bucks mainline scholarship by attributing much of the decalogue to Moses, but he does not go so far as to say the God of the Hebrews told him to say these things. The result is that Moses emerges as a sort of religio-political genius who set about to establish a new civilization. While this in itself is not objectionable as a story, it does lead to some misguided conclusions.First of all, Harrelson &quot;translates&quot; the first commandment for the pluralistic masses, saying that for it to do work in our world it ought to read something like &quot;You shall have only one ultimate master.&quot; This seems utterly misguided. The commandment comes in the context of a God rescuing a people from an oppressor. That God is not talking to the folks back in Egypt. I'm sure that there were plenty of single-minded folks back in Egypt. That's not the point of the commandment. By abstracting &quot;principles&quot; from the commandments, Harrelson strips them of their ability to speak to concrete historical situations. What we need is an act of imagination, not a disposal of history.On the exegetical end I give Harrelson thumbs up. When he tries to make Moses head of the UN I have to object."},{"Title":"An encyclopedia of pieced quilt patterns","review":"This book must have almost every quilt pattern known to man!

I imagine it would be a valuable resource for museum curators, quilt collectors, and quilt scholars, in terms of identifying antique quilts or writing about them, and also perhaps for instructors. If you are looking for actual patterns, you won't find them here; it does not provide templates or any piecing instructions. It is not a how-to book, but more of a reference book.The patterns are depicted in small black-and-white drawings, so that several can fit on a page, and they are shaded to show how they are traditionally pieced using lights and darks, if applicable. Brackman lists each pattern and the name(s) by which it is known, along with the earliest known source mentioning the pattern by name. It's interesting to see how \\"old\\" some of the patterns we think of as \\"traditional\\" really are!

The collection of patterns is priceless if you're seeking a specific, obscure pattern difficult to find elsewhere. Unfortunately, however, nothing is shown in color (or with clearly delineated components), so I couldn't visualize how they'd look as quilts. I, myself, much prefer BH&amp;G's _501 Quilt Blocks_, which shows each in color (gorgeous!), along with a block clearly showing each segment, and directions for assembling it. That one is so gorgeous (it just arrived) that I'm about to see if I can buy it in hardcover; it sparks my creativity whenever I look at it. If this (the Bannister book) had included color photos, I would be wildly enthusiastic about it -- but the tiny black and white blocks seem very uninspiring, with no hint how they might look good, tips toward assembling them, etc. I'm returning my copy; it just cost too much and takes up too much room for something this plebeian. However, if you're just seeking basic sketches of obscure old blocks, you'll adore this one -- which is obviously a million times more complete than the BH&amp;G book I just raved about (or any other book I've ever heard of, for that matter)."},{"Title":"An encyclopedia of pieced quilt patterns","review":"The title is honest: this truly is an encyclopedia. Taken by itself, this wonderful resource will seem dry, but you'll return to Ms. Brackman's book again and again. There is a brief introduction and an easily understood key to finding the blocks which follow (drawn in black & white). Don't look here for colorways tips or settings options, don't look for projects or how-to's - you won't find any. Instead, come here to browse, revisit old favorites and perhaps discover new and rediscover forgotten blocks. There is enough inspiration here for a bazillion quilts. Truly a treasure."},{"Title":"An encyclopedia of pieced quilt patterns","review":"The book reveals the intense research the author employs in all of her works. I particularly enjoyed the ease of identification by which any block can be researched by a series of shapes. Recently I was asked to conserve a family quilt which I called \\"Spools\\". Hidden for 90 years in a chimney in Fort Worth Texas, the book revealed it is also called \\"Double Bit Ax\\" and that name originated in Amarillo in 1879. This information gave the heirs a clue to the maker of their quilt."},{"Title":"An encyclopedia of pieced quilt patterns","review":"First - Kudos to Barbara Brackman for being a pioneer in quilt pattern indexing. However, this book should not be taken as a comprehensive, all-inclusive historical reference for quilt block names and dating.In the introduction to the book, the author clearly states that she used 20th century magazines and articles for research with an emphasis on publications between 1920 and 1950. She admits to focusing on publications and pattern catalogs available in the midwest and omitted patterns and names that were not found in her midwest region. There appears to have been no attempt to search for actual quilts made before the 20th century or to research the origins of names beyond the period she was focused on.On a technical side, the black & white patterns are hand drawn and difficult to see. Color notes on blocks are impossible to read without a magnifying glass. The index is Barbara's own and difficult to decipher even with the author's key.If you are looking for \\"modern\\" names this is a great source. If you are looking for clear pattern pictures, see Maggie Malone's encyclopedia. For those (like myself) who are involved in historical research of pattern names - see museum catalogs instead.I purchased this book after it was quoted in several articles regarding block dating. I was very disappointed at the limitations of the author's research and that so many articles refer to this book without regard to the focus stated by the author in the introduction - shame on you!"},{"Title":"An encyclopedia of pieced quilt patterns","review":"I think those who gave this book a low rating were unclear on its intent and purpose. This book is NOT a how-to book, or a book of pretty pictures on how to use quilts in decorating. It is not a book on how to design a quilt, although it's very useful for designers with the savvy to imagine or play with colorway variations, and to figure out how to assemble blocks, how to calculate patch sizes, and how to figure yardage requirments.This book is a reference primarily on how to identify quilt blocks. It is encyclopedic in its listing of just about every block pattern published in the US during the time period it covers. If you're trying to figure out the name of a block you've seen, or if you're trying to get your creative juices flowing, Brackman's book is just the ticket. I feel it's an essential part of the library of any designer or anyone with any interest at all in quilting history."},{"Title":"An encyclopedia of pieced quilt patterns","review":"This is a great, if not the best historical source of quilt patterns in print.

I would have loved to have known this story back then to tell around the campfire. - - - Three brothers live in a mythical valley where they have a vista of a gorgeous waterfall pouring out of the mountains. The afternoon turns the waterfall to a golden blaze, hence the name Golden River. The two older brothers are very mean and bully the youngest of them and make him do the chores. They are angered to find that one night while they are gone the younger brother gives shelter to a stranger. Arriving back home they throw him out in spite of his warning that he is the West Wind and will return just one time. His return is in the form of a gale force wind that destroys their house. Not only that but the West Wind stops the rainfall into the valley; the farm dries up; the three brothers move to the city. They use some gold that they have to become goldsmiths but spend the profits instead of using some to buy more gold for smithing. The younger brother treasures a gold mug with a face imprinted on it. They tear it away from him and toss it into the kettle to be melted down. Then they leave. The youngest brother hears a voice from the kettle and realizes that it comes from the face that was on the mug. He is asking to be fished out. When the brother does this, the gold face becomes a head and body and sprouts arms and legs and struts about as a dwarf. This is the King of the Golden River. As a reward for the boy's kindnesses he tells the boy the secret of how to turn the river to gold to make himself rich.- - That's all I will divulge. - - There is a moral, of course.

I guess that Ruskin considered himself such an intellectual jack of all trades that he'd a have a go at the genre, if only to say he'd done it.The story is built from familiar parts. There's a Cinderella theme, built around a young boy and his two cruel brothers. There's also a theme of the wandering stranger who, after being treated well or poorly, rewards the doer equally well or poorly. In fact, that was such a cool idea that Ruskin threw in two magical beings quite independent of each other, making the front and back halves of this little creature look like thay came from two different animals.It's a pleasant enough fairy tale, but not one that I'd spend a lot of time hunting down.//wiredweirdPS: This reviews a different edition of the story, apparently not listed at Amazon.

If one was to ask the author why this would be, I would guess that his response would be, that a Marine in the bush does not have time to reflect upon anything other than the mission at hand. I was also glad to see a book about combat in Vietnam,that was written by a black Marine. The year of 1967 was a deadly year for the Marines, especially for those Marines in and around the DMZ.

Some of the examples may tax the memories of younger engineers and engineering students, but that's exactly the point of this book, to emphasize the nature of engineering: improving what has already been done in the past.I, too, found the repetitive references to a limited number of examples tiring; I suspect this was done because Petroski had prior knowledge of these case studies and wished to minimize his research by drawing on what he knew about before writing. As an amateur historian of technology, I was also disappointed that few earlier historical examples were treated in any depth, the Crystal Palace being a notable exception.The book is an easy read. Henry Petroski's prose is easy to grasp and flows well, holding the reader's interest, despite the repetition."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"In this enlightening book, Petroski, who is professor of civil engineering, has succeeded admirably in conveying what engineering is and what engineers do in a manner that is accessible even to my grandmother, i.e., the general public. His presentation, although somewhat repetitive, is clear and sprinkled judiciously with humor. Moreover, it is illustrated with familiar analogies, and also numerous mechanical and civil engineering examples including everyday objects such as paper clips, toys and knives.To engineer is to design, \`making something that has not existed before'. Petroski provides insights into the design process (which involves computers extensively nowadays) and its limitations, and also the means employed by engineers to prevent failures in their designs.He emphasizes, however, that it is not possible to anticipate all possible ways a design can fail and thus failures inevitably occur because engineers are, after all, humans. Numerous examples of catastrophic structural failures throughout history are presented and discussed. All involved the tragic loss of lives (for instance, the collapse of two crowded suspended walkways onto the crowded floor of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency hotel in 1981) except the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge in Washington State in 1940.Petroksi also discusses the failure analysis or forensic engineering that is performed in the wake of a catastrophic design failure to understand how and why the failure occurred. He argues convincingly throughout the book that understanding such design failures can advance engineering more than successes. Design failures, like other failures in life, should be embraced, rather than denied or ignored, and learned from. Great engineers, and great people in general, are the ones who heed George Santayana's famous dictum: \`Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'"},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"The answer is well explained in this book. By the time you built such a car, it might be so heavy it couldn't move!The real interest in this book are the analyses of various disasters that should have been planned for, but weren't.The most terrible engineering disaster (and the reason I bought this book) was the collapse of the sky walkway in a hotel in Kansas City in the 1980's. I was just returning from KC when I heard the horrific news on the radio. The skyway collapsed during a dance, killing hundreds and injuring more in a dreadful disaster. I was very upset by this terrible event. Why did this happen?The explanation in &quot;To Engineer Is Human&quot; is really brilliant; the walkway was designed &quot;properly&quot; with a bolt that went through the beam supporting it. But it could not be built as designed because the bolt couldn't be installed in the vertical support. Instead, the builders split the vertical support into two parts in order to install two bolts, and each part was then able to move independently, causing a shear force that eventually led to the disaster. A brilliant analysis and one that showed that despite correct design, the plan must be able to be implemented to work--or else the execution of the plan may doomed to disastrous failure.That lesson is really important when you are engineering anything, even software. You may specify an important feature, but if the R&amp;D department cannot implement the plan, the product may fail to meet its goals, even be defective.The book is a bit &quot;thin&quot;--I wanted more and wished it were longer and had more detail, but I will say it makes its point and memorably so. After reading it, your eyes will be opened to how things are designed, how things fail and how engineering affects our lives."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"A deep insight into complex problem solving; it isn't done in a single brilliant step but in smaller steps while learning from our mistakes.This isn't a very good book in my opinion, and it's a shame because it's a very strong thesis excellently presented. But all too briefly and too thinly demonstrated. A really great idea that seems to have fizzled for some reason.The basic idea is that engineering is commonly imagined (at least by people outside of engineering) to be a matter of systematically studying a problem and crafting a great solution. The reality, as the author explains very well, is that engineering efforts viewed in retrospect are more like hypotheses or good guesses at solutions. We craft something that works, and then see the weaknesses and learn from them for the next improvement.The point is that improvements are not simply a matter of meeting new customer demands or adding new features, nor even just correcting avoidable mistakes. Some corrections and improvements are neccessary because complex systems have aspects that really can't reasonably be predicted at design time. The mistakes don't just arise because engineers are less than perfect, but are an intrinsic part of the process of human beings engineering complex designs in the real world. There is rarely if ever even the potential for creating a flawless perfect design that anticipates all likely contingencies and second and third order causal effects of even simple changes.Whether a &quot;zero defect&quot; mentality is helpful or not as an ideal, it doesn't reflect how engineering actually works, at least when complex systems are involved. The reality of human engineering is that intermediate failures are an important part of the process. Engineering methodology needs to take this into account, and make best use of it, or else lead engineers in a futile struggle for a perfect initial design and forever wonder why they fail.Although the I think the idea is very solid, useful, and important, this book certainly lacks the depth it needed to make the point and would have made an excellent chapter in a more detailed book. There are important issues raised here, but not answered, about how to improve the engineering process based on this insight into the role of failures.As a companion to this, I recommend Dietrich Dorner's cognitive science account of the origin of planning failure in complex systems in &quot;The Logic of Failure.&quot; Dorner explains in more detail, with the help of his problem situation simulation research, why consequences are so difficult to forsee and plan for."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"Why do buildings and bridges suddenly collapse, or why do airplanes fall outof the sky ? Even though since the start of the industrial revolution therelative number of disastrous accidents has gone down, it is still a dailyevent.Some great examples are given (most prominently the walkway of a Houstonhotel that collapsed during the opening ceremony) with pictures and detailedanalysis. Great stuff even for non civil-engineers since with someimagination you may learn some more general design lessons.The editorial side of the book is less impressing, most facts andinterpretations are repeated 3 or 4 times throughout the book (excluding theintroduction and back flap) so I never got further than 3 quarters into it,preventing myself from another deja vu.In any way, a veryimportant and useful read."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"In this book, Petroski brings up a few good points. Engineering is human. Engineers, as oppose to what some think, are not perfect. They are not able to create a perfect design for the given problem. They create what they believe is the best solution for the given design specifications. They, along with others, test their solution, in theory. The majority of these solutions are created and succeed perfectly. Although most of these designs are successful, some are not.It seems to be most of the failures of designs happen when it deals with something big, including the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel walkways, which killed over 100 people, or the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. These failures become famous and the engineers are the first ones to be looked at.Along with engineering success comes failure. This is a part of being human. Human engineering will always have its failures along with its successes. When engineers build something, they analyze it to determine if their solution is the best solution. Sometimes it takes a failure for the engineers to see their failures and to correct the problem. This book tries to explain this and does in most cases. In some of the cases, it leaves the reader wondering what else could have been done or what needs to be done in the future to prevent these failures."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"This little gem is an analysis of engineering failures, and the learning that occurs due to these failures. While he is himself a professor of engineering, Petroski uses language comprehensible to the layman making this book accessible to almost anyone. During the course of the book he argues that engineering is part art and part science, and that as a discipline engineers focus on building safe, affordable, and reliable things (from paper clips to airliners) to meet a set of requirements. He goes on to elaborate that, being human, engineers make errors and sometimes spectacular failures ensue. The key, he argues, is that once errors are exposed, engineers can glean knowledge from those problems to improve future designs.He uses accessible examples that most people can readily relate to, from researching failure modes on one of his son's toys (the components used most frequently failed first, just like a frequently used light bulb burns out more quickly due to metal fatigue and subsequent cracking), to the deadly collapse of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel walkways, which killed over 100 people. He also discusses easy to comprehend failures (suspension bridges in strong wind), and more intricate interactions, such as was revealed in the Chicago DC-10 accident. Throughout, he retains an aura of good humor and approachability, which makes this book far more readable than most books in this field.My only complaint about the book is not even the fault of Mr. Petroski at all: the font in the book is very small, and combined with small borders, the book is a bit tough to physically read. Small matter, though, as once you start the book, you will not want to put it down. Well done."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"To Engineer is HumanTo Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Designis a wonderful read, for all the reasons in other reviews posted here (and elsewhere I'm sure) and more. DISCLAIMER: I am not an engineer, nor do I play one on television or YouTube.I picked up this book because of its subtitle \\"the role of failure in successful design.\\" What could I learn from another discipline's perspective on successes and failures in creating a product? I think if readers come at Petroski's work from this angle (and many have, do, and will) the self-reflective dissection of why things don't work, go wrong, or prove fatal is a necessary skill and habit for anyone walking among the rest of the human population (as well as our animal and environmental cohabitants). Whether it is labeled critical thinking or something else (self-improvement in reverse perhaps), this is a good introduction to \\"being human\\" - the first chapter.One of the major lessons either in school or in life is to learn from our missteps, mistakes, and misadventures. Easier said than done. Aside from the medical or nuclear professions perhaps the many facets of engineering is equally important. For instance, I came away learning from Petroski a little bit more about walkways, railroad bridges, and other things that occasionally fall down - and why, and the things around us that do not (and why). The lesson, as every student of history (rightly or wrongly) concedes on some level to Santayana's aphorism on repetitive consequences, is simply hopefully we learn from our mistakes and do better the next time around. As I think about this I wish I could find my copy of Robert Fulghum'sAll I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.Perhaps the ironic (or iconic) jewel of this book on engineering failures is the one that should have failed but didn't: the Crystal Palace. I won't spoil the chapter for you, although the story like some many others, including the opening collapse of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel skywalks, is one of the recurring themes throughout To Engineer is Human. Simply, the idea was to create a temporary structure for the 1851 Great Exhibition in London. This temporary structure lasted in some form, however, until finally demolished in 1940. The longevity of this structure notwithstanding, this is not a dry rehash of a building. As with all the chapters in this slim book, there is a moral to this story - and a lesson for more than engineers. The moral, of the book as well, is that \\"[t]he object of engineering design is to obviate failure, but the truly fail-proof design is chimerical\\" (217).How do we prevent failure if it is a moving target? After almost thirty years, Petroski's wonderful book is a good starting place and surely a \\"successful design\\" by the standards of the essays and ideas circulating in this book. I recommend this book for everyone with a general interest in figuring things out.

The subject matter is dry to begin with, however, Petroski does nothing to liven it. I am an engineer also, and am not threatened by the technical information (admittedly lifted from his students' term papers). I have chemical engineering textbooks that read like a novel. Hopefully the courses he teaches are clearer than this muddled prose.Petroski is certainly an engineer. He has engineered an elegant method of making money from saps like us.

He discusses failure by fatigue, failure by fracture, instability, buckling, corrosion and erosion as well as overload, understrength and deterioration.Engineering, described by Petroski, is \\"a human endeavor that is both creative and analytical\\" in its phases from design and planning to implementation and construction. The lessons of failure generally pinpoint the weak links. But engineering anticipates failure and all plans are designed to avoid it. Therefore it is not structural success that improves a design, but structural failure.Petroski presents examples, case studies, comical stories and serious lessons in an easy-to-read non-scientific style that would delight student, engineer, and layperson alike. Rather short on detail it could benefit from more examples, especially other areas of engineering.In To Engineer is Human, Petroski could be talking about sport, about career, or about writing, for there are certain lessons for life - the greatest being: from cracks, breakthroughs follow."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"The most interesting thing about the book is the cover (a famous photograph of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsing in the wind in 1940). But then all it really amounts to is 232 pages of defensiveness, repeating over and over that failure is just a part of life and experimentation and if we don't want to stagnate we have to expect cracks and collapses, so don't blame the hapless engineer for trying to forward human achievement. Yes, engineers and designers can sometimes be the scapegoats for failures beyond their control, but he makes a weak case and uses this argument to eclipse the real causes and analyses of structural failure. The author cites very few actual examples, analizes the same few examples over and over, and his one or two attempts at discussing novel failures--such as cracks in a set of kitchen knives--go nowhere since it's pure speculation, with no actual research. What's most glaring is his almost complete neglect for the basic role of cost-cutting measures in leading businesses to ignore testing, quality control, maintenance, and basic oversight, the domination of engineering and science by capitalism, putting profits before safety, an essential component he barely touches. In a book supposedly written for the lay person the illustrations, which are critical for understanding the examples he refers to, are few and far between. Some of the major examples he cites, such as the collapse of the Hartford Civic Center roof or the John Hancock building windows failure in Boston, aren't illustrated at all. And for a mostly polemical work there are surprising inconsistencies--in the last chapter he says that that exposing engineering failure are a credit to the profession, only to cite on the next page an engineering conference on structural failure that refused to publish any results. It's an interesting premise, but he goes nowhere (or rather in circles) with it.

It is a classic on engineering design and failure and every engineer should read it."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"Highly topical and very informative. If you are an engineer with 20+ years experience or a laymen seeking to learn more about the role of failure in design, this is a terrific read!"},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"The author attempts to explain engineering failures to the lay person, and does so to some extent - at least to those who can make it through this sometimes excruciating book.As an engineer myself, I find the examples given to be grossly oversimplified. So many examples are all really of much the same thing, and the author seemed to have hardly bothered doing any homework. Even when he mentions a couple of aircraft accidents he manages to find ones that were the result of a structural failure and not any of the other non-structural but still engineering factors that can and do contribute to accidents (even back in 1982 when aircraft were much simpler).Here is a concise version of the book, summed up in a single quote from an attorney: \\"Good judgement is usually the result of experience. And experience is frequently the result of bad judgement.\\"While the author does say a little more than that, there's not a lot to grab onto. Here are some of the main points he seems to be making, which are either dead wrong or grossly misleading:* If you want progress, you'll have to accept failures. Usually major ones causing death.* Engineering is always performed by trial-and-error.* Bridges and buildings are engineering's greatest - or perhaps, only notable - achievements.* All failures are structural.* All failures have a single cause.The author rambles and uses words like \`opprobrious.' (Is that really helping the reader?) The discussion on the Crystal Palace is fascinating, but almost irrelevant. The last few chapters almost salvage the book, but the author never really goes down the more interesting paths, and instead drives right past them like tourist attractions by the freeway. You only get a glimpse of why engineers need to make compromises, and why complexity or computer-aided design cause them difficulties. A few examples and detail in these areas would have made a far more interesting and informative read.While the book makes a few good points, most will be fairly obvious and it takes a long time to make them. A very aggressive editor might have brought the copy down to four or five chapters at most without really losing any of the substance.Ultimately, this book should be relegated to the packing boxes of history, while more modern, deep-thinking, useful, informative and interesting works adorn the shelves of working engineers."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"In the interest of being fair, I have to at least say that this book has an excellent goal. Explaining that failures are to be expected and that engineering is a thoroughly human endeavour is extremely important, and I admire the author's decision to try and get the information across. That being said, I don't think we'll find a single worse way to get the information across. Petroski's way of writing is boring, dry, and completely humorless. I find myself thinking of that math teacher we all had who cracked lame jokes and laughed at them when no one else did. He presents examples that are obvious and boring, and expects us all to just drink it in.Ultimately, I think that this book is clearly written by an engineer and not someone who likes to write. I myself am an engineering student, and I recognize the work of someone who has no interest in english class. Petroski, sadly, has no idea how to write, or how to captivate a reader. He seems to blindly stumble past legitimately interesting points, only to continuously drone on about Speak n' Spells and Bridges.It was a thoroughly disappointing book, written mostly about boring and uninteresting ideas, and written in a most boring and uninteresting way."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"The author took 232 pages to state what could have been said in 23 pages.

Both writers give themselves the same basic thesis: as Petroski states in the Preface, \\"this book is my answer to the questions \`What is engineering?' and \`What do engineers do?'\\"While Florman's brilliant work truly does explain the role of engineering among man's intellectual pursuits, as well the passion that drives engineers (the \\"what\\" and \\"why\\" of the profession), Petroski has produced a work much more focused on the \\"how\\" or process of engineering, in particular structural / civil engineering. In this book, Petroski answers best a somewhat more mundane question posed to him by a neighbor: how could the skywalks in the Kansas City Hyatt Regency collapse in 1981?Petroski does a decent job explaining why engineering, like any other profession performed by human beings in a universe with non-zero entropy and finite time and money, cannot achieve perfection. He fills his book with many examples of infamous structural engineering failures, from the pyramids of Egypt to present day. Almost all of these are enthralling to anyone with a modicum of interest in the subject matter; the one exception is Petroski's postulate as to the failures of his aged kitchen knives. After having read Petroski's book, the reader will understand why there will continue to be engineering failures far into the future (this is not to say that the rate of failures cannot be decreased).Besides not achieving as broad a thesis as he may have intended, the other main problem with Petroski's book is its repetitiveness of his major lessons, namely that engineers can learn more from failures than successes, and are duty-bound to analyze failures for learning opportunities. While valuable, these lessons are repeated in almost every chapter, such that any one chapter could stand alone as an individual essay on the topic. A final issue for readers to consider is how much of Petroski's book is relevant to other branches of engineering besides structural / civil. Certainly not every engineer is designing objects whose failure could endanger human life, and many in the software profession would say that most of their lessons on how to design software come from studying algorithms and the designs of successful programs. However, by erring on the side of caution, one can claim Petroski's book applies to all engineering as well as other professions, particularly medicine.I would recommend Petroski's book foremost to structural / civil engineers, and next to all engineers and others interested in the engineering design process."},{"Title":"To Engineer Is Human Signed","review":"This book left me a little dissapointed, Petroski had a full tank of gas and only drove around the block.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Black Series: Poems","review":"Those familiar with Laurie Sheck's three other books will find her latest to be an impressive expansion on her vivid imagery drawn from urban or ancient settings as she now ventures into the black of the Nevada Test Site, among other places. Anyone who has visited the haunting Mercury, Nevada cannot fail to be captivated by Laurie's poem Traces. We who read The Store Windows Glitter in the Boston Review last year and were gasping for more will not be disappointed, as she continues with The Mannequins to explore and contrast the living and the inanimate.Laurie has once again crystallized the meaning of urban life in The Subway Platform, which is in some ways a poetic parallel to Cristina Peri Rossi's The Crack in The Museum of Useless Efforts, though Laurie's poem is more personal and intense.Readers who enjoyed Laurie's previous works on ancient subjects will find much to enchant here, such as Medusa and Pompeii. It is this contrast between the past and contemporary worlds that makes these poems a compelling read. Cave paintings compared with urban grafitti (in separate poems) are but one example of the startling imagery that permeates this book.Another aspect of these poems that elevates them above much of today's poetry is their sense of the impact of computers and technology on our lives. In reading most poets writing today, one would never know that computers or advanced technology exist at all, as these dominant aspects of life are largely ignored. Laurie's poem Circuits is but one illustration of how this book responds to our electronic environment and makes a literary statement that any reader can appreciate.Note: The title of this review is a variant on the title of Moynihan's Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding. The misunderstanding here concerns a rather pathetic review of Black Series that appeared in the New York Times in which the critic displayed a complete ignorance of what Laurie's poetry is. Without belaboring the point, that reviewer felt that Black Series needs more &quot;precision,&quot; a charge so ridiculous that it reminds me of a critic of Emily Dickinson's &quot;I taste a liquor never brewed/From tankards scooped in pearl&quot; who disliked the poem because he believed pearl to be an inadequate material for making a beverage container. That's about as much sense as the NYT review makes, so ignore it.Black Series is a book to buy and enjoy through multiple readings. The subject matter is astonishingly diverse, and the poems are much more intense than most being written today. This book is a feast for the reader."},{"Title":"Black Series: Poems","review":"I must take issue with the Publishers Weekly review quoted on this site, where the reviewer accuses Laurie Sheck of emulating Jorie Graham. That's a stunningly false assessment, since nothing could be further from the truth. I find Ms. Sheck's poems very original, and certainly not derivative of Ms. Graham. As a matter of fact, most of the Jorie Graham poems I've read left me rather cold and distant with their forced and calculating artistry, whereas Laurie Sheck often moves me on intellectual as well as emotional levels."},{"Title":"The Enchantment (Sonnet Books)","review":"While Conor MacCloud and his brother Rowan fought in the Crusades, their Uncle Simon seized their land and castle in Inverness, Scotland. When Conor returns from his escapades in the Mediterranean, including a stay in an Egyptian prison, he fights to regain that which is rightfully his, but his noble army loses to Simon's superior forces. The healer Magdah persuades Conor to find the Peacekeeper. He agrees and she chants in a strange language that sends him in search of a legend.To his shock and bewilderment, Conor finds himself in twenty-first century Seattle. He persuades Eilan Dougan, an empath, that she is the Peacekeeper and his people need her on a quest through time and space. Though some welcome her in fourteenth century Scotland as a savior, others demand her death as a witch. Eilan's only hope to survive this strange world is her guide, Conor, a man she now loves with all her heart. He reciprocates her feelings and just wants to keep her safe rather than subject her to danger as called by her mission.Pam Binder writes a spellbinding magical romance that combines elements from a time travel tale with that of the paranormal and the historical into an entertaining reading experience. The story line of THE ENCHANTMENT is action-packed and filled with romance and danger. Conor is a hero, but the tale belongs to Eilan even if she adapts to easily to a much less technological era. Ms. Binder is an enchantress whose tales inscribe a taste of magic that will send her audience in a quest to read all her novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Enchantment (Sonnet Books)","review":"I tried really hard to like this book. The first couple of chapters were really promising, but then the author suddenly lost track of where she was going. Stilted broken part-way descriptive sentences. No serious romance going on. I really didn't care if they ended up together. I suggest Karen Marie Moning for really great time travel romance, or for the serious time travel enthusiast - Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. Both authors have never written a dud. This was definitely a dud, no offense intended to the author of course. It just didn't happen."},{"Title":"The Enchantment (Sonnet Books)","review":"This book was romantic drivel. It made me think it was pulled directly from the pages of an early 1970s Harlequin.

Most of his fellow clansmen were dead and the small band that was left had barely escaped the vile dungeons of the East. Conor wanted nothing more than to return home and try to let his native Scotland heal his wounds. But Conor was not destined to have peace for quite some time. Conor returned home to his beloved Inverness, Scotland, but he returned to find his mad Uncle Simon ruling as laird of the area. Conor and his small band valiantly tried to take the castle from him, but failed. Conor had refused to take the witch Magdah's advice, but he swore to his dying kinsman that he would seek out the Peacemaker. Little did he know that the ring's magic would hurl him into modern-day Seattle where Eilan Dougan would be waiting...Eilan was an empath and could feel what people were thinking when she touched them, but she wasn't comfortable using this power and preferred to avoid intimacy. Eilan had done her best to hide from mankind by living in a sparsely populated area of Colorado, but she agreed to return home to Seattle to run her parents' antique shop while they were on vacation. When a wild man wearing a bloody kilt suddenly appeared in the shop waving his sword and calling for the Peacemaker, Eilan was terrified and immediately called the police. Conor realized that he had frightened Eilan and tried to make her listen to him, but it was too late, Conor was carted off to jail.Eilan instantly regretted sending Conor off with the police and knew that she needed to talk to Conor and to try and see what he wanted. Before she knew it, she had gotten Conor out of jail and was stuck with him. She spent some time introducing Conor to the wide variety of food available and the convenience of showers, but Conor chafed at the delay. He was all too aware of time passing for his people while he delayed in this wonderland. Conor knew that Eilan had to come with him willingly, but he began to despair that she would never agree...This book started off really well and I enjoyed getting to know Conor and Eilan while they explored Seattle. This part of the book was well developed and nicely paced, but when Eilan finally agreed to return to Conor's time, the author just rushed through the past and it turned out to be only about 1/3 of the book. Eilan resisted using her powers and had no idea how to use them, but she was just suddenly able to dive in and solve everyone's problems within a few weeks of her arrival. I wish the author had spent some more time writing the latter part of the book because this could have been a wonderful story, but it just ended way too abruptly and I did not enjoy the part in Scotland. If you can find this book on sale or borrow it from your library, it is worth reading, but it is still a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Enchantment (Sonnet Books)","review":"I was very excited about this book when I read the back cover. Unfortunately the book doesn't live up to its potential. I liked the main plot but the author didn't spend much time describing the characters, the scenery. She left you hanging.

I would pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Enchantment (Sonnet Books)","review":"When a kilted scotsman drops into her antique shop with crazy words about the 'peacemaker,' Eilan Dougan does what any woman would do--calls the cops. But she can't keep her mind off the handsome scotsman--or forget that she has long been nicknamed peacemaker. When he promises to take her back in time and to cure the inoperable tumor that is slowly killing her, Eilan agrees to the venture--mad though it may seem.Conor McCloud has returned from a crusade only to find that his uncle has usurped his castle and is conducting a literal witch hunt. Although Conor has fought against magics of all kinds, he promises a dying friend that he'll seek out the peacemaker and bring peace to his land. He doesn't count on falling in love with a witch, but that is exactly what happens. Back in the 14th century, the two must find a way to bring love where hate is now dominant.Author Pam Binder combines time travel with a Scotland/Medieval historical to deliver the classic alpha male to his centuries-separated true love. Readers will want to overlook several huge anachronisms (exactly how many crusades was Conor returning from, where was Turkey during the 14th century if Conor spent time there when the Byzantines still ruled much of Anatolia, and how is Conor so familiar with new world foods) but may find it harder to accept Binder's decision to hide most of the peacemaking from the reader. For me, at least, the huge problems that required magic beyond time seemed suddenly to vanish."},{"Title":"The Enchantment (Sonnet Books)","review":"Eilan Dougan has a gift.

Regardie was infact Crowley's secretary for some years and this is as much a story of two great lives intertwined. I thoroughly enjoyed this work and gained an immense respect for Regardie for being the ultimate, cooler head prevailing, in all circumstances.Some lovely moments at the end have our author spending time withIsrael in old age somewhere in California, Regardie mimicking the old Beast as he calls out in mock Crowley fashion...&quot;Love is the bleedin law, love under bleedin will&quot;Priceless stuff.

It's something I always put in my bag for air-travel reading, because you can pick it up and put it down when you need to...the author and the illustrator both were participants in the Conflict, so you know it's accurate. The content is educational but not stuffy, since it was written to explain to soldiers' families what exactly Union Army life was like...and the humor still carries through to this day. After you've read the historical studies or walked a battlefield, THIS is the book you want to read to put yourself in the shoes of the everyday soldier--and it's easy to do with the author's skills.

THE UNTOLD STORY OF PATTON'S SECRET MISSION BY RICHARD BARON MAJOR ABE BAUM-RICHARD GOLDHURST","review":"\\"Raid!\\" is an older book (1981) and written by Major Abe Baum who led the raid and others who were there.On 25 March 1945, General George S. Patton Jr. issued orders for a rescue raid on the POW camp at Hammelburg, Germany which housed an unknown number of Allied officers. Hammelburg meant deep penetration behind German lines, some 60 miles east of the Allied front at the time. The orders also decreed that this was to be a small force of less than 300, supposedly to keep the raid a secret.The planners and chosen leaders were very unhappy with the small size of the force for such an undertaking, (294 men and 53 vehicles) but orders were orders. Unknown to the raiding force until just before the jump off, was the fact that General Patton's son-in-law, Lt. Colonel John K. Waters was being held at the camp. This fact further soured the raiders, that Patton would send the undermanned, under equipped force with no air or backup support, to liberate a relative. Another danger was that many of the raiders were of the Jewish faith.After taking many causalities during heavy combat, Major Baum's combat unit was able to fight their way to Hammelburg, The rest of the account deals with what they did there, and how the tattered force figured they were going to get back.In Patton's personal journal, published posthumously in the Saturday Evening Post in August, 1948, advised that he could think of no error he had made in the campaign in Europe except failing to send a combat command (a fully reinforced, heavly armed, combat group) to Hammelburg.A fast paced account from the people who were there and well worth the read."},{"Title":"QoS in Integrated 3G Networks","review":"I found this book too hard to read.

I was disappointed in Montgomery's book. There are some traits women have accepted as fact down through the years that are not inherent, just learned behavior.

Which I had ordered based on a Nabukov recommendation as the greatest book ever, etc., etc. I couldn't get past the first few pages. It hurts to read it. Really. It's painful. But then at times, so is Nabukov. And I've read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, all great, deservedly so. And never painful."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"I'm sorry, but I apparently disagree with Nabokov. While an interesting read, &quot;Petersburg&quot; is confusing to the point of absurdity (not in a good way) and ultimately not very enlighting. When thought of in the context of the Revolution of 1905, Bely's occult beliefs, etc., the novel is slightly more interesting but still not worth the time and mental effort required to read it. Some might say I'm missing something, but I would say their looking too hard. You'd be better off actually reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; or, if you want some Russian, &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; or some Chekhov."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"If that's your taste, you'll be entertained by this book. For better or worse, it's in the same class."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"According to Vladimir Nabokov, this work rates with Joyce's Ulysses and Kafka's Transformations. I'll take this one over its competition. One of the most well-read works of Russia's Silver Age, I recommend it not only as literature but also as cultural history. PLEASE, find an edition of the Maguire and Malmstad translation, it's much more lucid. Bely is difficult enough even if you read Russian; you need all the help in translation you can get. The notes are copious but, if read attentively, help place the book in the cultural context in which it was written."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"Andrei Bely's &quot;Petersburg&quot; is rightly praised as a masterpiece. Knowing Bely's symbolist background, I had exepected the shimmering interlacing of symbols. Yet, while reading the book, I was surprised by the amount of historical and personal desire (and their intertwining) and the masterful way in which it was rendered. Linguistic experiments, grotesque, time-and-space shifts, intertextuality, metatextuality... and, yet, a fully comprehensible narrative! This novel is a true modernist diamond. The book questions what we usually perceive as the predominance of Anglomodernism - yes, the Russians were writing great things after Dostoevsky, too!"},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"In any discussion of Bely's PETERSBURG there eventually arises the question of whether or not it's one of the 20th century's greatest novels. Frankly, I'm not even sure what this means, because what you will take from this book depends very much on what you came for.Distinctive narrative structure, mind-bending imagery, and creative use of language earn PETERSBURG a place in the literary pantheon. As an important product of the Symbolist movement and a document of Russian revolutionary ferment, it deserves the considerable scholarly attention it has received. The Maguire/Malmstad translation is a tour de force, and their care for their subject is greatly in evidence in what must have been one of the toughest translation tasks ever attempted. For any students out there: if any of the foregoing are of any interest to you, you are in for a treat.None of these things, however, guarantee that PETERSBURG will be a particularly good choice for the casual reader, and in fact it's an extremely tough row to hoe. The book is noisy, chaotic, cluttered, and at times supremely difficult to follow. As a reader, I felt myself experiencing the book very much as a painting, albeit one viewed through a frenetically shaken magnifying glass. Some of what you'll see will be stunning; much will be baffling. I believe very much that there is sense behind every fragment of this book, but it takes hard work to dig it up, and often just dragging your eyes across the page is not so easy.As a further stumbling block to many readers, PETERSBURG's beauty relies very much on the beauty of the city of Petersburg itself. The city's atmosphere will be familiar, of course, to almost all Russian readers, but for non-Russians who have not spent time in Petersburg, an important sense of place will be missing.As other reviewers have noted, the plot is relatively thin, but if you're looking for a good yarn, there are other reasons why PETERSBURG is not a good choice for you. I suspect that very few casual readers--or even folks who just like Russian literature and want to try something from the 20th century--will have the background knowledge needed to put this novel in its intended context. Bely had an audience in mind, and we were not really it.If you're interested in Russian novels from the 20th century, of course there are many, but please allow me to suggest Bulgakov's THE MASTER AND MARGARITA in place of PETERSBURG. They are not particularly closely related--although, again for students: I sense there's a term paper there--but there is a similarity in their zany madness and Bulgakov is much more approachable."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"Nabokov, the translator's introduction triumphantly proclaims, thought Petersburg one the three best books ever written, beside Joyce's Ulysses and Kafka's Metamorphosis. Nabokov, they do not emphasize quite as proudly, was also a native Russian, so he might have had this book a little easier.Truly, this is a masterpiece, even if a little hard to translate. Imagine Ulysses, barely possible to read as it is, translated into another language, and you might come close to the difficulties in navigating through Bely's symbolist playground complete with 50+ pages of endnotes. However, unless you plan on learning Russian sometime very soon, that is no excuse for skipping this novel--certainly the lack of a successful English translation is the only thing that keeps it from joining the ranks of other great Russian novels. The fragile tale of an enchanting yet troubled city and the dancing psyches that inhabit it is well worth any difficulties in translation."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"Petersburg was originally published between 1913 and 1914 in installments by Sirin in its literary miscellany of the same name, and then in book form in 1916. Obviously dissatisfied with the first edition, Bely began revising it almost immediately, but during the revolutionary and civil war period, he could find no one interested in publishing a revised second edition. Bely emigrated to Berlin temporarily, where he found a publisher, and made massive cuts to the novel. The revised novel was published in 1922 (the authoritative text for this translation), and was reprinted in the Soviet Union in 1928 with minor changes made by Bely and extensive modifications made by the Soviet censors. The 1928 edition was reprinted in 1935, but with the growing demand that literature conform to the standards of Socialist Realism, Petersburg was virtually ignored until, with the gradual easing of restrictions after Stalin's death, it regained a certain respectability.The novel takes place over a short period of time in the autumn of 1905. Although Russian cultural activity was gaining more and more prominence on an international scale, political and social unrest were on the rise domestically. Demand for reform was rampant, and even outright revolution was being advocated in some circles. Commencing in January 1905, a series of strikes, assassinations, and uprisings had occurred. The widespread feeling among the populace that the old values were inadequate for a burgeoning modernity, and that Russia was teetering on the edge of an abyss, becomes apparent early in the novel in this beautifully poetic passage:From the fecund time when the metallic Horseman had galloped hither, when he had flung his steed upon the Finnish granite, Russia was divided in two. Divided in two as well were the destinies of the fatherland. Suffering and weeping, Russia was divided in two, until the final hour.Russia, you are like a steed! Your two front hooves have leaped far off into the darkness, into the void, while your two rear hooves are firmly implanted in the granite soil. (64)As Maguire and Malmstad note, this prophetic meditation on Russia's destiny is similar to several lines in Pushkin's poem, The Bronze Horseman. Both Bely and Pushkin raise the issue stemming from Peter the Great's Westernizing innovations: had Peter's western influences detached Russia from her native traditions and divided her in two, the peasants on the one hand and the Westernized elite on the other, setting her on an unknown course that would eventually lead to destruction?The plot is rather simple, a political thriller paced by a ticking time bomb that Nikolai Apollonovich Ableukhov, a university student who has become entangled in a revolutionary terrorist organization, agrees to plant in his father's house, the senator, Apollon Apollonovich Ableukhov. Underlying the apparent simplicity, however, is a very complex text with intricately woven plots and subplots on many levels. Petersburg is suspenseful, socially relevant, political, psychological, philosophical, and historical, and loose ends come together in the myriad of characters who populate the novel, ranging from the powerful and privileged to the poor and discontented, through whom Bely paints a vivid picture of Petersburg society. There are double agents, terrorists, journalists, secret police, government officials, and society people. Peter the Great is himself evoked through the images of the Bronze Horseman and the Flying Dutchman. Many characters confront a personal crisis: the family crisis triggered by his wife's flight to Spain with her Italian lover in the case of the senator; the love crisis of his son, Nikolai Apollonovich, as a result of his broken relationship with Sofia Petrovna; and the consciousness crises experienced by both Nikolai, who has rejected Kant, and Dudkin, who has become disillusioned with Nietzsche, each searching for a new meaning in life. These personal crises are intensified by, and representative of, the real social, political and governmental crises within Russia herself.As a paradigm of Russian Symbolism, with no omniscient narrator, Bely demands that his readers be attentive, astute, and perceptive. Using synecdoche as a mode of expression, Bely often will not provide an image as a whole-we see a piece of attire, a prominent feature, a segment:Rolling toward them down the street were many-thousand swarms of bowlers. Rolling toward them were top hats, and the froth of ostrich feathers.Noses sprang out from everywhere. (178)Earlier in the novel, Bely depicts another crowd scene:Contemplating the flowing silhouettes, Apollon Apollonovich likened them to shining dots. One of these dots broke loose from its orbit and hurtled at him with dizzying speed, taking the form of an immense crimson sphere--among the bowlers on the corner, he caught sight of a pair of eyes. And the eyes expressed the inadmissible. They recognized the senator, and, having recognized him, they grew rabid, dilated, lit up, and flashed. (14)The present is chaos, precariously moving on an apocalyptic path. Apollon Apollonovich recognizes the chaos and sees the crowd in fragments because of his sense of isolation and vulnerability in a Russia at the brink of radical change. The dots and spheres also form a leitmotif through which the apocalyptic themes of the novel are presented. The sphere is crimson, a color associated with revolution and danger. An ominous feeling, together with a sense of apprehension and disorientation, permeates the novel. The sense of insecurity we experience as we read through the novel parallels the sense of insecurity the inhabitants of 1905 Petersburg must have endured."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"\\"Petersburg' is a book I stumbled across, not having planned to go there. I'm delighted that I did, as it turned out to be one of the most unique and absorbing reading experiences I've had to date. Frankly, the cover art of this edition was the lure which dragged me in. The whimsical/macabre, cartoonish image of a masquerader in a checkered harlequin costume, extending forth a card with skull and crossbones imprinted thereon, with an occult-looking red moon over his shoulder, suggested that no ordinary story was contained inside.The book delivered on my expectations, but not in the theater-of-the absurd manner I had presumed. Though the style of the book is unconventional and contains fantastical or phantasmagorical episodes, the symbolism of the novel seems always to relate back to real events, persons, or mental concepts. Whereas theater of the absurd ignores conventional literary forms to convey an impression of man's isolation in a meaningless universe, 'Petersburg' seems to use it's unconventional methods to point in the opposite direction.If it were not for the excellent commentary provided by translators Maguire and Malmstad, I wouldn't be able to offer that opinion with any confidence. The more than sixty pages of explanatory notes add a clarity to what would be mass confusion on the part of a non-Russian reader confronted with the many allusions to Russian history as well as the cultural and physical setting of St. Petersburg. Explanations of puns as well as the noting of philosophical and religious allusions clear up many things which would have been obscure. With the help of the commentary, it seems plain that there is an intent of showing a historical direction for Russia, with St. Petersburg representing it's soul. There is an evident integral belief embedded in the story, in a purposeful destiny for Russia, even though the exact nature of that destiny was as yet unclear.The claim has often been made that any translation of a book is, in fact, a different book. Be that as it may, this English translation of 'Petersburg' has captured a quality of romantic strangeness in this story of St. Petersburg in the autumn of 1905 that points toward transcendence rather than nihilism. Though there is absurdity, irrationality, psychic fragmentation, hallucination, and paranoia manifested in the actions of the characters, these elements serve to point out the need for and groping toward transcendence by these very imperfect people.There is a good deal of symbolism in the novel, of a kind that is different from symbolism encountered in other books, in that much of it was influenced by the author's association with Anthroposophy, as well as uniquely Russian symbols. The frequent use of colors to establish a context, and the occurrences of para-normal mental phenomena point toward his occult leanings. The symbolism of the bronze statue of Peter the Great coming to life and clattering through the streets is a product of Russian heritage and the iconography of Peter as the founder and patron of modern Russia.Though the style of the narration seems quite disjointed and fragmented at first, it continually weaves itself together into a unified whole where history, location, people, ideological as well as armed conflict, and symbolism blend together in an inseparable whole which yields a very strong impression of the historical period of September-October, 1905.Many beautifully vivid passages evoke a sense of the mystery and grandeur of the city, and a sense of it's destiny. The city and its unique features figure prominently in the novel, but that is not to say that the human characters count for nothing. Although they are not developed in great depth, what we do learn about them is extremely relevant toward the portrayal of the revolutionary and apocalyptic currents sweeping Russia at the time.If you enjoy cerebral books which challenge your comprehension by presenting their messages in unique and layered vehicles of language, 'Petersburg' might well appeal to you."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"I agree with one of the reviewers who found this book \\"painful\\" to read, yet Nabokov compared it to Joyce! How could he e wrong? Well, he read the book in Russian! So what I did is to dig deeper to find another version. I am happy to say that the Maguire&Malmstad;Petersburggives justice to the book. First, it lacks the fairly pathetic introduction that the Penguin classic version has. The intro is sneaked as urtext and all it does is to vomit on Stalin and the 1937 events, which happened after Bely's death. It also has the presumption of telling the reader what to think about the book, what to \\"see\\" and what to expect. In contrast the Maguire&Malmstad; version has a meaningful and helpful introduction, the translation is thoughtful and appropriate English is used to translate the improbable Symbolist verbiage used by Bely. I read both, and I feel I read a great book )M&M;) and an awful one (Penguin). I very strongly recommend reading this book in its good version!"},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"One of the great modern novels, as revolutionary in its way as Ulysses or At Swim Two Birds, it dazzles with humor, allusion, wit, imagery...It's a distinct advantage to know a bit about Russian culture and to have visited the city of the title.Having read the original prior to reading this translation, I feel this book lends itself poorly to translation; the translators do a decent job but the nature and essence of Bely's art is quite inextricable from the Russian language; still, a glimpse of the quality of the original can be had."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"Just absolutely wonderful! Perhaps the finest work ever written, Bely mixes beautiful language with a stark political commentary on early 20th century Russia. Petersburg represents in both narrative and language the confusion and anarchist tendencies in modernism. The moments of hallucination parallels the &quot;Circe&quot; chapter of Joyce's Ulysses and are crafted with genius. If only I could read Russian to capture the full flavor of Bely's brilliance."},{"Title":"Petersburg","review":"A strangly comical story about the chaos and absurdity of Russian life and politics circa 1905.

Warning: The prose is somewhat a slow read as it takes time to get used to the Symbolists style of writing. If you can get through the first 30 pages you won't regret it. This book has not been called the best Novel of the 20th century for nothing !!!"},{"Title":"Design and construction of the Pochuck Quagmire Bridge--a suspension timber bridge: Appalachian Trail, Vernon Valley, New Jersey (NA-TP)","review":"Engineer Tibor Latincsics has written a superb book on the 1995 design and construction of the Pochuck Quagmire suspension footbridge bridge in New Jersey, which enabled completion of a missing link on the Appalachian Trail. Latincsics was the principal designer and engineer but many other volunteer organizations and groups were involved in the construction. This was no simple effort: The 146 foot bridge was built on unstable soil and demanded careful engineering to ensure pedestrian safety and make it suitable for construction by volunteer labor. At the same time, funds were limited and a sensitive wetlands site added to the challenges.The book is profusely illustrated, contains numerous scaled engineering drawings, and tells candidly of the many challenges encountered and overcome. References and materials lists are included.I found this publication useful in designing and constructing a smaller wood footbridge in Oregon. Even though the designs were very different, the practical insights and planning advice contributed importantly to the success of our project. I recommend this book to pedestrian bridge enthusiasts in general, and to engineers who wish to examine one of many approaches to footbridge design. Google Images has excellent photos of the completed bridge."},{"Title":"Los Principios del Exito : Como Llegar de Donde Esta a Donde Quiere Ir","review":"Excelente libro como guia quienes quieren hacer un cambio en su vida personal y lograr Exito en su vida.

Living Language combines written explanation and oral illustration very nicely. The advanced version, both French and Spanish, is very idiomatic and requires a good grasp of the material in the Beginner/Intermediate level.

A couple years ago I converted the cassettes for the beginner-intermediate and the advanced packages to mp3 and am now brushing up on the language before a long-overdue return trip to Quebec.What continues to impress me about this series is its comprehensive coverage of the language from beginner through intermediate and on to the advanced level. It is superior to the 2 semesters of college-level French that I took from a good instructor, more well-rounded than Pimsleur's audio-only focus, and covers nearly all the situations, circumstances, and social registers (informal, formal, business, etc.) in which you're likely to find yourself in the Francophone world. It's prepared me well for trips to France, Belgium, Senegal, and Quebec.Whenever I'm heading off to 'la Francophonie', I roll out this package, zip through the Beginner-Intermediate set in a few weeks, and then rest calm and steady among French speakers. You won't understand all the slang in Paris, and some Quebecois terms will first still puzzle you, but you will have mastered far more than the basics, be comfortable with most subtleties of the language, and most importantly you will have endeared yourself to many French speakers.I've checked other self-study courses at many bookstores (Chapters/Indigo, Borders, Barnes & Noble, etc.), but they all fall short of the gold standard set by this edition.

The themes are quite interesting, they are dealing more with real life than pure grammar.-: Vocab part doesn't include words I am using all the time when speaking with my friends in France (and it's not slang) so I would say that a good vocab book / website should be added to help learners."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"When I put in the first disc for Beginning French, I thought I had put in the wrong one.

Also, the book is pretty inexpensive.Thing I don't like: Each chapter begins with a short conversation in French, but without access to the recorded conversation I have a hard time knowing if I am pronouncing words correctly. I feel like I'm either Americanizing the text, or that I sound like a really bad actor playing a Frenchman in an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. The CDs associated with the text are sold separately and raise the price SUBSTANTIALLY.

The explanations of grammar are concise, quite clear, and complete for an introductory course. My only recommendations for improving the courses would be (a) to dispense with the second set of recordings and replace them with material supporting (b) to increase the amount of exercise material, and (c) to include a suggestion that, as a learning strategy, memorizing the dialogues (an admittedly painful exercise) might help learners absorb the target language.

In fact, I'll have to buy a new book soon since my old one is so worn out from nights of study and review. This set, to me, is so much better than Pimsleur. It all depends on what you wish to learn. Pimsleur is all audio, so from a purely conversion vantage it might be better for tourists, but it doesn't teach you the ins and outs of the language. Grammar is basic (sometimes non existent). This is the exact opposite. You learn the language properly, by learning how to build it noun by verb etc. It's the way that every child should be taught his primary language (but seldom is, hence Prof. Higgins' rant!). After completing this course (which, if you're studying it thoroughly, should be at the rate of a lesson a week), you will have all the tools you need to construct sentences in several forms of the past, present, and future, as well as having a very solid foundation for pronunciating (most students biggest complaint about French) correctly. I bought this set my senior year of high school to prepare me for college French, and I must say, I learned more from this set than I did all four years of high school French and the first year of college. If you really want to lay the ground work for French fluency, voici le livre!!!"},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"The Living Language Ultimate series is my personal number 1 choice when it comes to learning foreign languages, and this French version is no exception.The whole course is based around realistic dialogues, so you are learning spoken French all the way through the book. Of course you will learn to read it too, but the focus on the spoken language to the extent to which it is presented here helps you build up speech patterns.Each dialogue features certain language points that are covered in detail in the explanations that follow. These explanations are easy to follow, but extensive enough to give you everything you really need to know, rather than obscure facts and features of the language you are never going to need. In addition, cultural notes support each unit.The audio component is unique to Living Language, a far as I know. Of the 8 cassettes or CDs, 4 are for use in class, and contain only French. The other 4 are for use at those times when you are travelling, exercising etc. i.e. when you are unable to use the book but you are able to listen and repeat. The \`On The Go' recordings feature explanations in English, which support and reinforce the learning you do with the textbook. Far from being a gimmick, these recordings offer a unique element to the course, which allows you to extend your knowledge, even when you cannot learn in a traditional study environment.A further feature of the course is the advanced volume, which is based upon the same conversational approach as the beginner/intermediate course, and which offers the student the option to take the language further in a format he or she is used to, and therefore, comfortable with.Admittedly, Living Language Ultimate seems to cost slightly more than other self-study courses on the market, but they are well worth it, and with the Amazon special price you really are getting a bargain on a solid and well integrated language course, that will undoubtedly stand you in good stead whether you are a self-learner or a student of French.If you're serious about learning French, and you are only intent on purchasing one course, then I recommend this one."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"Excellent self study course as is all of the ultimate series. If you are motivated and organized in your studies you can learn much from this course not only about the language but also how to use it which is most important. You will not need a teacher. In fact I have never known anyone to become truely proficient through classes. You must study every day. I would reccomend this course along with Barrons mastering. Barrons for the drilling method which may be old but us tried and true and Ultimate for the up to date diologues and vocabulary. Also listen to movies with french tracks and also the internet news in French can be invaluable in developing your listening comprehension."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"I am French and I teach French as a foreign language. I highly recommand thsi method. It starts with simple dialogues which get trickier and trickier but very gradually. The voices, intonation and accent sound really authentic too. A very good choice !"},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"For the analytically minded language learner who really wants to LEARN the language, this course is probably the most balanced available. It is well laid out and presented in a clear, concise manner. There are plenty of practice problems. The text itself takes you farther than most beginning language courses and the advanced book (sold separately) picks up where this one ends. There is lots of audio--two separate series on the CDs, one following the book, the other supplemental (can be listened to while you are driving, exercising, or whatever).I like the Living Language books because they are self-contained and I don't feel as if I need to be working through other course books concurrently as I do when working through offerings from some other language-learning publishers. The only negative for me personally is that the vocabulary comes quite fast. I find myself getting way ahead in the grammar while being stalled with loads of vocabulary. This, however, is a personal weakness/strength issue and you may not have this problem. Other than that, I can't think of a thing that I don't like about this course.How does this offering compare with other company's offerings? I would have to say that Living Languages and Hugo are my favorites. Hugo is great for stripped down, no fluff presentation. I really like their stuff. But, they tend to be very intense and typically do not have sufficient practice problems. Living Language is more balanced and takes you farther with the grammar and vocabulary. I'd say the two are tied for my favorites. Teach Yourself also has some great offerings... but choose wisely, because they are not consistent and offer some real dogs as well. Living Language and Hugo have a consistent format and you know what to expect from all of their courses.Of course, this book will require study. It is not a \\"Learn French While You Watch TV and Eat Popcorn\\" or \\"French in Your Sleep\\" or \\"French in the Blink of an Eye\\" course. As long as you go into it knowing this and are willing and able to actually study and invest some time, you should have a good experience with Ultimate French. If you don't like to study and invest time, you'll have a great new dust collector in a protective clamshell sleeve."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"For a beginner, the dialogues on the CD are spoken much too quickly! I would understand if they were spoken quickly one time to be able to hear how they would sound naturally. But then they need to be repeated more slowly so that a beginning student can try to follow along. Even the repetition phase of the CD (when you repeat after the native speaker) goes too fast. For intermediate french, this would work, but not for beginning."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"As I write this, I'm a little over halfway through this program, and I am very pleased with it. The four CDs for use with the book are very clear and useful in helping to pronounce French correctly. The book is an excellent text-all points of grammar are explained clearly and plenty of examples are given to illustrate how to use the language correctly. The dialogues are easy to learn and very practical-they contain things that the average person would actually talk about when visiting a French-speaking area; topics such as food, shopping, buying train tickets, sightseeing, and so forth. The book also contains an excellent and useful appendix, which recaps points of grammar and has a section on letter writing.So why four stars instead of five? My main criticism concerns the \\"Learn as you Go\\" CDs. I do not find these terribly helpful. They contain extra phrases like \\"The chair is made of mahogany\\" that the average user is extremely unlikely to need, and that with no transcription whatever, so it's hard to say if you've repeated it correctly or not. I think the \\"Learn on the Go\\" CDs could have been put to much better use recording the many grammatical examples in the text. In their defense, they do go over the pronunciation of new verb conjugations as they are introduced, and that IS very helpful. The space on these four CDs could, however, in general have been much better used.The book does have a few minor flaws. For instance, in one early dialogue the year 1960 is said, at a point when only the numbers up to 19 have been taught (and in French, 1960 is said as one thousand nine hundred sixty). There are a few other things that would confuse a complete newcomer to French, though if you've had any exposure to French before the book won't give you any trouble. Even if you are completely new to French, I would still recommend this product. If you make it through the first few units it will go very easily afterward if you stick with it. Also, though the course is self-contained, I would strongly recommend getting a dictionary and a verb guide to go with it. Then you will have all the tools you need to learn basic French independently.This course's few flaws are far outweighed by its many good points. It is enjoyable to use and very informative. It demands effort, of course-like everything worth doing. I believe this is the best self-teaching course for French available, and I look forward to moving on to the Advanced set soon."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"We are using this for our fast paced French refresher course through PCC's continuing education foreign language program. Though I recommend this as a good French text, it is laid out oddly. First, the dialogue is at the beginning of each chapter. These dialogues contain words which are probably unfamiliar to most students until they actually read the section. It is quite confusing to try and pronounce or read these unfamiliar words. I know that the authors felt it better to have students 'try' and read it, then learn the words, then go back to it, but it just doesn't work all that well. Even the instructor has us skip the dialogue until after we work through the chapter it pertains to. Also, the quizzes at the end of each chapter are rudimentary at best.Positives: there are charts at the end that contain many verb conjugations and lists of other important words. Each chapter is concise and gives the student ample material to work with while not overwhelming the student with endless lists. The paces is nice and the flow from chapter to chapter seems to follow a nice curve for actually learning the language, not learning a few phrases for travel. I would have liked more sentence building exercises, but for a $13 beginner to intermediate book, it covers a lot of material without getting too in depth.I highly highly highly recommend the following purchases, even if the instructor does not require them.French Grammar (Barron's Foreign Language Guides)- this is indispensable. This is the book which takes one from merely learning a few words and phrases to actually putting this all to use and building a good foundation for French speaking. It is inexpensive and worth 5x as much in my opinion. Only problem is that it is compact. But it packs in a TON of content and helps with sentence building.Merriam-Webster's French-English Dictionary- amazing bang for the buck French - English dictionary. Has some charts in the beginning, including a useful conjugation chart. But has over 80,000 entries and 100,000 translations. Pretty amazing for $6 or $7. I have the paperback because I don't really want to lug a kindle to class.These three books are perfect for getting started. Then you might try located a good CD resource. I don't recommend Rosetta Stone because of the exorbitant price (you gotta pay for all that marketing they do). Michel Thomas has a good course on CD that builds sentences, but at last look they were all 3rd party and cost $100+... not really worth it at that point. But if you come across it for a good price then buy it.Also it sounds goofy, but check out some of the kids picture books (even for an adult). The ones that have the pictures with the French word and no English translation. You can buy four or five of these for $5-$10 each and they are basically what Rosetta Stone is. See a picture of something and learn the French word for it, not look at an English word and translate it. Get it? Oh, and grab a couple of workbooks that are highly rated for practice.And also of note: the same holds true for other languages with the same publishers' items. I took Japanese and used Living Language, Barron's Grammar, and Webster's Dictionary along with some picture books and the Michel Thomas CDs and it was a breeze to learn with all of those useful tools. So even if it's Italian, Spanish, or another language, I expect these to be good items to purchase (in those respective languages)."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"I checked out the \\"ultimate french\\" set from the library because I enjoyed the \\"Beyond the basics\\" course for Italian by the same company. I've found that Living Language is very inconsistent in the style and presentation among its various levels of courses and languages covered.This is one style I didn't like. It just plain turned me off from continuing on.There is one set of CDs that are supposed to go along with the book, and another set supposed to be used alone, independent of the book. I find this presents too much double coverage in a negative way: It becomes confusing, perhaps overwhelming to a beginner. This would be alright if the spoken and written lessons weren't also too quick from the outset. A pronunciation lesson would have been nice as a first lesson (I only recall a written one that seemed to be a preface in the book). The native speakers then proceed to speak at a normal pace and style for a native. At this level, at the beginning of a course, speakers should slow down and enunciate even if words are ultimately meant to have a slur from one to the next. I am sure that this course could be useful for those who have had previous contact with the french language; it seems that the \\"beginner\\" section of the course is really a review for intermediate learners.I'll try the Complete French (Teach Yourself series) book/CD; as a language tutor and student, the book follows a philosophy that I've found to be very helpful in learning. I'll review that if I ever use it."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRENCH: BEGINNER - INTERMEDIATE.","review":"I have no complaints with the book. I did think that it came with a CD, but it does not. Guess I was mislead by reading the reviews. But, its rough learning a language when you can\`t hear the words pronounced properly!

Well written."},{"Title":"Sunlight and Shadow","review":"SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW is the first book I've read by Sue Boggio and Mare Pearl and I think they are great writers. The book reads like a true crime. The book is character driven. All of the characters are fully developed. My experience as a reader was the characters were real people. I cared about all of them, with all of their strengths and flaws.Think you're safe when you go out in a town you've known your entire life? Read this book. Think everyone you know can't possibly be a threat to you? Read this book. All of Sue and Mare characters are someone I may know. All of the characters are so real.You have no choice but to put yourself into shoes of the victims, their sick worry, grieving relatives and hard police work to find Bobby. Get ready to examine all of your relationships. Get ready to be looking over your shoulder.Sue and Mare's first published novel SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW is a concise and insightful look into the life and culture of New Mexico. But more than that, it is a chilling look into the often forgotten realm of marrying outside of your family and community expectations. It left me speculating about the rewards and sacrifices Abby, Bobby, CeCe, Miguel, Rachel and Charlie experienced with the choice they made to marry outside of their family expectations and culture.New Mexico is more tolerant of the differences but people still make scarifies for their choices here in the Land of Enchantment, Sue and Mare brilliantly show the reader that we have a long way to go . . . as humans. Didn't we all come here to LOVE? Can love be bad?The relationship between Abby and Rachel is most intriguing. Rachel's fantasy of Bobby and her romantic love relationship supersedes reality. Sue and Mare does an amazing job of developing all the characters in this account. Skillfully they cover Rachel's and Bobby's childhood, Bobby's role in Rachel's life as a teenager.Rachel's fantasy and expectation of Roberto / Bobby is necessitate when she becomes his lover as a teenager; he?s the man who took Rachel?s virginity when she was just fifteen is compelling. Rachel has convinced herself that Roberto / Bobby will come back to New Mexico, marry her, live on their families land and will live the fairytale dream and be happy ever after. Instead, Bobby returns with Abby his pregnant wealthy WASP wife. Can anything be worse? Yes, Bobby / Roberto disappear from both Abby and Rachel?s life without a trace. The change in both Rachel and Abby is captivating.Examining the definition of family was a central theme in SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW. The people of Esperanza espouse the value of the family. It was interesting which characters exemplifies this value and who fall short. It will make you examine your definition of family and your values.The New Mexico setting is also treated like a character. I recognized the land I love and my home in SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW. Especially the three dimensional description of Madrid the old east mountain mining town that is now home to flower children of the sixties, biker bars, growers markets and art galleries.***WARNING*** SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW?S town of Esperanza is fictional. I?ve lived in NM for forty-five years. My sister owns ?Kritter Kuts by Kris?, a dog grooming business in Los Lunas, NM. I drive through Isleta Pueblo, Bosque Farms, Los Lunas at least once month to have Harry AKA handstand Harry, my rescued bearded collie (the breed used in Honda commercials, the long hair blowing in the wind, dog) groomed at his auntie Kris?.I thought I had been totally asleep and missed the town of Esperanza my entire life. My sister drives throughout the community where SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW is set every week. Wednesdays is ?Kritter Kuts by Kris? senior citizens special. (free pick up and delivery for senior citizen?s and their dogs) Kris has lived in Los Lunas for twenty years and she knows every crook and cranny of her community. Before opening ?Kritter Kuts by Kris?, my sister drove a Semi-truck cross country with her husband. She has her CDL license and is very good with directions. Kris assured me that there was no town of Esperanza between Isleta Pueblo and Bosque Farms.I poured over maps and could not find the small town of Esperanza. When I finished SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW it was revealed in ?a conversation with Sue Boggio and Mare Pearl? at the back of the book, that Esperanza was fictional. Everyone thought I was a loon and had a good laugh. Okay, I keep my hair blond to warn people. With that said, SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW setting is three dimensional.Santiago Baca young tragic life pulled at my heart strings. Santiago reminded me of my neighbor Joey Baca. Joey as a child would give me special gifts rocks, wild flowers when I was out hoeing weeds. My Joey lost his mother to breast cancer around the same age as Santiago was introduced. Joey?s father would never strike any of his four children or raise his voice to them. Joey and I shared Harry Potter series just like Abby and Santiago. James the younger boy loved Edith Tarbescu?s THE BOY WHO STUCK OUT HIS TONGUE: A Yiddish Folk Tail. My German grandmother would tell me the same story as a child. We had fun with theYiddish phrases. My Joey is now fourteen and works part-time as a busboy at Village Pizza.The theme of the goats is very realistic. I awake to the sound of Joey?s great aunt, my neighbor?s hungry goat.The mystical element of the Bruja was realistic. Every book needs a good villain. What is better than a witch casting spells? Oh my!SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW is a quick read that will have you turning the pages. I look forward to more of Sue Boggio and Mare Pearl books. Enjoy!

It's also hard to believe that there really was a great meeting-of-the-mind relationship between Abby and Bobby in that after his having been away for so long in the Navy their communciation skills seem to be reduced to the bed. I had to stop reading this book which is rare. For me a novel with two authors rings warning bells. And unfortunately this was no exception.

Rick Martin, the young man with a horn, is consumed by music but destroyed by bad booze, evil women and by his own impossible musical ambition.There is a school of thought, of which this novel is emblematic, that true geniuses are tormented or even driven mad because they apprehend things that are beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals and become frustrated in trying to realize them fully and/or express them in terms that we can comprehend.

Thank you!"},{"Title":"Introductory Chemistry (2nd Edition)","review":"After using this book for my sophomore year in high school I decided to read about the authors, and the day I saw that they had PhD's in TEACHING CHEMISTRY was the day that intelligent life ceased to exist. This book does teach about chemistry, but in the most unorthodox way that you could not even imagine what they do. They give you five hundred definitions on everything. All this does is make it more and more confusing. Please, just give me a basic definition and if I need something explained I'll ask my teacher, who deserves his doctorate in teaching chemistry.Another bad thing about this book is that is puts all the information that would take five lines up text into a long drawn out three page essay on something in real life. I do not care about that garbage! All I want is the information and I don't want to waste a half hour trying to find it in some stupid example I could care less about. 99% of the time I was reading the book I was getting a headache because all I could think was GET TO THE POINT ALREADY! One time I was making sure I wrote an acid base reaction correctly so I decided to check the book like I would in any other course. But in my fatal attempts to check my work I found out that the only acid base reaction in this text book is the equilibrium of water, and that doesn't help me one bit. If your wondering why I'm in such a bad mood right now, it's because I just stopped studying my final chemistry exam.Stoicheometry is very a very simple concept that a cave man could understand, but the way this book does it makes half the class perplexed beyond what was thought to be chemically possible. If you're someone that memorizes math equations instead of understanding them, this book is not something to look forward to.All it does is write out and explain the equation in the most confusing way. I did not have a problem with this because I never had to look at what they put, but when I tried to use it to explain something to a classmate I ended up closing the book and drawing out a much simpler version on a piece of paper. The only problem I ran into was that my teacher was worried about the lack of work I was showing on my free response problems, because I did not do it the long drawn out way the book tells you to. Consequently, I ended up having to do the problem my way, and then translating it on to the answer sheet the way the book tells you to do it."},{"Title":"Introductory Chemistry (2nd Edition)","review":"The book came actually a lot quicker than i was expecting and it made me very happy. the book was in good condition and there are no problems at all :) very satisfied thank you :D"},{"Title":"Introductory Chemistry (2nd Edition)","review":"BOOK CAME IN ON TIME AND IN GREAT CONDITION, AS EXPECTED!

This book had the perfect combination of love, adventure, suspense, and wit. For those of you who read the first 2 books to me City of Flowers was very shocking but in a good way. *****"},{"Title":"Stravaganza: City of Flowers","review":"WOW! Mary Hoffman really concluded the series nicely! But I still like the second book, City of Stars, better. So, here's a summary:Sky goes to the same school as Georiga and Lucien (previous stravagantes) and Nicholas (who used to live in Talia, a parallel world of Italy). He finds a fragrant bottle left on his doorstep, and it turns out to be a talisman that takes him to a friar's- Brother Sulien- cell in Giglia (Florence in Italy). In Giglia, there are going to be four di Chimici weddings. There is probably going to be a murder there by the Nucci clan (a rival of the di Cimici) and the stravagantes are preparing for the danger. A lot of people of both Nucci and di Chimici families are either wounded or hurt, and Niccolo ends up challenging Luciano to a duel, which if I describe too much, will give everything away!There is a little bit of romance in this book too... and Georgia and Nicholas are going to go back. I would DEFINITELY recommend it!"},{"Title":"Stravaganza: City of Flowers","review":"I loved the first one in this series and this one is no different. The setting of the story is wonderfully described and gives ground for a plot that is sure to arouse one's curiosity. The delicate web of the colorful characters upon which the book revolves around becomes even more vivid in this fabulous book. I could barely get anthing accomlished I was so intent on finding out what happened next. I highly recommend this book for any reader who desires a mysterious, passionate, and irresistible read."},{"Title":"Stravaganza: City of Flowers","review":"This, the third book in the \\"Stravaganza\\" series, is almost twice the size of the first installmentCity Of Masksand I can't help but feel that its pacing suffers as a result. Though still rich in detail and description, \\"City of Flowers\\" feels rather sluggish at times, with none of the intrigue or urgency that filled the pages of its predecessors. It picks up considerably toward the end of the novel, with weddings and feuds and floods and murders most foul, but the getting there seems to take forever.The Stravaganza books are built on the conceit that certain people from our world are able to \\"stravagate\\" in their sleep to an alternative-world version of Italy, a country made up of several city-states known collectively as Talia. There are several conditions in place for stravagation to occur: travellers first have to be in possession of a talisman specially chosen to allow transportation, they cannot stay in Talia overnight due to the fact their earthly bodies are in a comatose-state whilst they are away, and once they reach Talia they are identifiable by their lack of a shadow. Likewise, Talian citizens are able to stravagate into our world, and throughout the series Mary Hoffman has explored the implications and consequences of such journeys back and forth, adding new characters each time.This time the new Stravagante is Sky Meadows, a teenager who is being raised by a single mother. He has never met his father, a famous rock-singer known as the Rainbow Warrior (and how a rock singer builds a career on that name is a mystery to me). Older than his years, he struggles with his mother's mental illness as well as the usual tribulations of teenage life. But all that is about to change when he discovers a small glass bottle on his doorstep and falls asleep with it in his hands.He awakens in the city of Giglia among a brotherhood of scientist-friars who inform him that he is the latest in a line of Stravagante, brought to the city for an important though as yet unknown reason. It probably has something to do with the power-hungry Duke Niccolo and the rest of the di Chimici family, the antagonists of the previous books. Here in Giglia they are rivals with the equally wealthy Nucci family, and the upcoming joint-wedding of Niccolo's sons seems a perfect opportunity for the feud to break out. The stravagante band together in order to protect the wedding ceremony, little knowing how deep and bitter the rivalry really is between the two families.Meanwhile, Sky has his own problems back in the real world, what with his girlfriend getting suspicious over his new friendship with other Stravagante, his mother's ongoing illness, and his estranged father's unexpected arrival back into his life. As well as this there are other little subplots concerning various other characters, including the Duchesse Arianna of Bellezza and her unwelcome proposal from Duke Niccolo, Luciano's struggle with his secret feelings for Arianna, Nicolas's desire to return to Talia, and a young orphan boy's tribulations in the employment of long-time di Chimici spy: the man known as the Eel.Juggling all these plot-threads is a challenge that Hoffman handles admirably, but as mentioned, \\"City of Flowers\\" is the longest book yet, and sometimes gets bogged down with its vast array of characters. A family tree and dramatis personae have been included at the back of the book in order to keep track of everyone, and any reader who skips the previous two books will find themselves hopelessly lost.Sky himself, ostensibly meant to be the protagonist, is practically superfluous to the plot and doesn't really seem to do anything that could not be handled just as easily by the other stravagante (who are given certain powers hitherto unmentioned in the previous books) and not even Hoffman herself seems particularly interested in his backstory. He's certainly a much blander character than the others, and I wonder if it would have been better to just stick with Luciano, Arianna, Georgia and Nicolas as the protagonists, since they all had much more poignant and interesting stories to tell.Still, Hoffman's world-building is still the main draw-card, as she vividly describes the city of Giglia and its surrounding area, filled with buildings, vineyards, churches, rivers and friaries. In her afterwords, in which she explains the inspiration for the di Chimici family was the de Medici, and the template for Giglia was Florence, I wasn't surprised to learn that she was actually in the city when writing the book. Also noteworthy is the way in which no character is purely good or evil, but rather a particular shade of grey. Even Duke Niccolo has his weaknesses and moments of genuine warmth, fear and humanity. Rather than a typical fantasy scenario of good versus evil, the \\"Stravaganza\\" books concern a human drama.Plenty of threads are tied up in this book, with the death of a significant character and definitive endings for at least two others. Nevertheless, there are more books that follow this one, and I'll be interested to see whether Hoffman continues with this massive cast, or whether she cuts down for the sake of simplicity. I loved readingCity Of Masksand I hope that the series gets some of that first magic back again."},{"Title":"Stravaganza: City of Flowers","review":"Being the third in the series of Strvaganza, don't read this until you have read the first two books: City of Masks and City of Stars! You'll be hooked after you finish the first book ! Unimaginably irresitable to read!!!!! Filled with intrigue, mystery, love, adventure, and magic, this is a book for any age level! What are you waiting for? Start reading!"},{"Title":"Stravaganza: City of Flowers","review":"Before you buy the City Of Flowers...1. You absolutly must read the City of Masks. No Ifs, Ands, or Buts. Not reading the City of Masks first will lead to \\"strange\\" side effects such as mass confusion, unwarranted raised eyebrowns, and moments when you feel like there was something you should have picked up on, and maybe it was important..because it was. And possible weight gain due to the fact feeling like I'm being a dunce and can't figure it out makes me feel like corn muffins. Yum.2. I read this before the city of stars. Not recommended. While you will be able to follow it well, there were so many spoilers for CoS that it was riuned for me..my own fault, but still. Possible, but not reccommended.3. Quite probably the best in the series.Like all the Stravagante, Sky is misreble, and when he finds a prefume bottle, when he goes to bed, he is transfered to Talia, and alternate dimension of ancient Italy. He is transforted to Giglia, the heart of the Di Chimici. This was originally meant to be a trilogy, so this book was incredibly well rounded, and it was enjoyable, and I savored every second of it. Now, we all know if you want to end a threesome of books FOR REAL, somebody has to die. And have thier ashes scattered in space to insure no surprise comebacks (Really? You didn't die in that huge explosion..oh..so..timetraveling people handed you a fireproof suit and you fell into the plotdevice timehole? Gotcha) Three more books came out *yay* and they all worked. This not only had the most action from the first three, it had the most character development, and made it clear the diplomatic issues were very important. Excellent novel, and like CoS, it brought back, in my opnion, two of the best characters, Falco and Gaetano :)"},{"Title":"Stravaganza: City of Flowers","review":"An excellent young Adult series cleverly incorporating time travel from current day to an alternative Italy. The first in the series, City of Masks, hooked me. Each book can be read individually and thoroughly enjoyed. However reading the series explains a background from some of the characters. An interesting depiction of time travel and absorbing details about Italy. Unfortunately the title may be offputting for male readers, however the stories are all equally enjoyable for everyone."},{"Title":"Stravaganza: City of Flowers","review":"This was a GREAT book. I loved the first book in the series, City of Masks, and thought that none of the sequels could be any better. I was wrong!! The plot is full of twists and turns and so much happens on every page, there were some points I thought I would get lost. The author, however, does a perfect job of distinguishing each plot line and making everything clear. It was great to see all of the characters together and I enjoyed every part of the book. I would definately recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book, but only after reading the first two.

I'm not so sure if the switching main chara's in each book was what did it, but I felt no liking for our third chara.Because of this, the ending feels rather cheap when we return to Lucien and Arianna. The whole, and they \\"fell in love and lived happily ever after\\" only works when the two chara's actually spend time together and develop. That way it doesn't sound so fairy tale like. (I have a strong liking to books like HP, where fantasy feels realistic)Yes, its exciting, but I wish it had been dull through the beginning, so I didn't rush to the end only to find I would never pick this book up again.The relationships dont feel whole hearted, but rather, \\"I'm choosing you cuz I have no other choice and the book is nearly over,\\"Also, through the whole series the Pagan worldview is blunt and annoying. The whole, \\"we worship a woman cuz we dont like men\\" came off feminist and disturbing. When it was introduced long ago it felt unneeded, since Lucien, and everyone else never felt time to wonder if she was even real. One has to wonder why we even have it?If you care nothing for religion, and dont find yourself nitpicking over the unreal love in badly written stories (I confess, it's easy to want to live happily ever after no matter what) then you will enjoy this last book.Why does it seem so many authors rush the last book????"},{"Title":"Social Dilemmas (Social Psychology)","review":"This book is written in a style that falls somewhere between doctoral dissertation and plain-talk layman's introduction. Those of us who find the subject fascinating will appreciate the book as straightforward, comprehensive and simple to read; if you're not fundamentally interested in social dilemmas, you will probably find it very dry and slightly dull (there isn't a lot of personality here). Either way, it will tell you nearly everything you'd need to know about social dilemmas.Every theory that's introduced is followed by a detailed description of the computer models or experiments that prove or raise questions about that theory. The good news there is that you can easily skip over that information if it's too complicated or not relevant for you. It also means that you know exactly where the theories came from and how much evidence supports them.The book gets a little redundant in places, which adds a little to the boredom factor if you're reading it cover-to-cover, but it also means that you don't have to read the entire book to understand any given chapter.They do link social dilemmas to real-world problems frequently, but the whole text would read better and be more interesting (in my opinion) if they'd include significantly more examples about how people have actually dealt with and/or solved real-life social dilemmas in a way that did not tie back to graduate research."},{"Title":"Omega 3 Oils: A Practical Guide","review":"This book is essentially the published results of a study Donald O. Rudin did in the early 1980s. In this study, Rudin gave a group of forty-four patients high doses of flax oil and vitamin supplements for two years. His results: Most patients in the study showed health improvements in a variety of areas, including cardiovascular health, emotional disorders, immune disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, joint and muscle problems, skin problems, and urinary tract problems. I recently read this book along with Andrew Stoll's The Omega-3 Condition in my ongoing search for better health and relief from persistant, nagging feelings of anxiety and depression. While Rudin's words and the results of his study give me great hope, my own experience with flax oil has not been as dramatic as the participants in his study. After a two months of taking a daily dose of flax oil (and fish oil, I might add), I have noticed that the dry skin in my eyebrows and ears has dissipated, but I have not noticed any anti-depressant, anti-anxiety effects while taking flax oil. Rudin's &quot;modernization disease theory&quot;--that most of the ailments plaguing us today, (i.e. cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and depression) are the result of dietary modifications in the last century, appeals to me on an emotional level. Also appealing to me is the idea that our modern healthcare system is totally monopolistic and based on dealing with problems that are not medical, but are more related to nutrition and lifestyle. However, I suppose that even if all of this is emotionally appealing to me, the science of Rudin's flax oil/omega-3 theory is probably not very valid. Overall, I think this book is interesting and well worth a read for anyone interested in nutrition."},{"Title":"Omega 3 Oils: A Practical Guide","review":"This is a great book but it lacks scientific evidence and it rests it's theories on one experiment conducted by the author, the experiment itself was hardly done under the strict standards of the scientific community, he didn't even have a control group, by what is he comparing it with!!

The recommendations of the book are based on an experimental forty-four patients study performed by the author in 1980 (at a time when little was known about essential fatty acids). Although since then research on the role of essential fatty acids has greatly expanded our knowledge, none of the more recent experiments undermines the previous recommendations of the book.The book lists the best natural sources of omega-3 essential fatty acids.

His breadth of learning is indeed staggering, and his ability to comment on a wide range of \\"human artifacts\\", (music, philosophy, politics) with humility and insight is as breathtaking as it is illuminating. This work on Aethetics spans the full range of what we (should?) consider humanity's attmpt to objectify its inner life in outward forms that give those less talanted, ideas and contexts to accomodate their highest aspirations. His work is among the best that rebuts the modern view that all such things are irredemiably \\"subjective\\" - a characterizaation that robs great works of art of their universal appeal and applicability, as well as their ability to lift us, however momentarily, above what Hegel called this life (\\"the highway of dispair\\") so that we can glimpse the finer aspects of our nature. Roger Scruton is to be congratulated for giving us hope that the Aesthetic spirit in humanity can triumph over the the mundane."},{"Title":"Aesthetic Understanding (Carthage Reprint)","review":"Scruton's presentation of true conservatism elsewhere is a marvelous apologetic for the worldview; this collection of essays treats various issues within art and its relation to society in the light of that worldview.

All I knew about him before reading this fascinating biography was that he worked for the Post Office and wrote before he went to work. This biography is well written in an easy accessible style with many references to Trollope's own autobiography and to his novels and non-fiction.You do not need to have read any of Trollope's writing to enjoy this book. It shows Trollope in the context of his era - Charles Dickens was famous, as were George Eliot and Thackeray and all were known to Trollope. He spent some of his life in Italy and in Ireland as well as living in London, Hertfordshire and other parts of the Home Counties. He travelled extensively at home and abroad and wrote books and travel articles about his experiences. His writing about Australia still provides one of the best sources of information for life in that country in the mid nineteenth century.What came over most strongly to me from this book was the sheer enthusiasm and interest Trollope had in people and his surroundings and life in general. His is a larger than life character which some people found overbearing. He had enduring platonic friendships with women which his wife Rose seems to have accepted as being part of her husband's life. She herself played a large part in getting his novels ready for publication as did his niece, Florence.This is a really interesting book which paints a vivid portrait of Trollope and his relations as well as life in literary circles in the nineteenth century. I recommend it if you want to know more about this much underrated nineteenth century author. I shall be re-reading the novels with greater insight and enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Oakdale Affair (Ace 60563)","review":"I am a long time Burroughs fan, mainly Tarzan and his Mars series, so when I saw this one available for free on the kindle I snapped it up as I had never heard of it before. Unbeknown to me, it is the 3rd book in the Mucker series. Well, I found that out when I was 80% through the book, and I suppose it might have made the main character, Bridge, a little more understandable. Truthfully, if I had known it was the 3rd book, I wouldn't have read it, but now that I finished it, it really didn't matter. The book starts off with a bang, but you don't have much background information, so you slowly figure out who the people are as you go along.The book is the story of Bridge, a self proclaimed tramp/hobo, who comes across different people in one night and tries to help some and tries to protect others. It involves a haunted house, gypsies, bears and a variety of criminals and country folk. It is a crime story that gets solved in the last few pages. I think the storyline occurs over a span of 2 to 3 days. The style of writing gives the book an old feel to it, but I suppose it should. Not my favorite novel of ERB's, but it is a good story and goes quickly. Short and sweet."},{"Title":"The Oakdale Affair (Ace 60563)","review":"I hate to rate a Burroughs book so low.

The other version is the complete Mucker trillogy for $0.99.

It is simply, but beautifully written. I read these stories as a child, and now read them to my 7 year old -- though she can read them on her own. They are perfect for the beginning reader -- such as someone starting their second grade education.The illustrations, done in a teal and black motif, are very detailed, and like the boy itself, romantic and nostalgic.The stories cover the seasons of the year, as seen through the eyes of Ruth, the narrator. She tells stories of the little adventures she and her siblings encounter, though they seem like big adventures to these wee ones. The family has little money, but lots of love, sometimes tough love as the parents are strict at times (but gentle and understanding most of the time).As a grown up, these stories have taken on deeper meanings than when I read them so long ago. They are about family relationships, discussed under the guise of the small mishaps that befall us all when we are growing up. This is an idealized time -- there are no drugs or violence. Yet while the time is idealized, it is clear that life is often hard for this struggling family. Buying a warm coat for the winter is a challenge.Ms. Clark wrote with a clear hand and sympathetic heart. She offers not only interesting story lines but she also takes time out to describe the beauties of life along this small, friendly river.I wish this book were in reprint. It should be a classic but it is little known. If one is available, buy it. I think you will come to treasure it. I know I will never part with my copy."},{"Title":"The Nutcracker","review":"I am something of a collector of Hoffmann's Nutcracker stories, especially the illustrated children's picture books. I have two criteria. One: The full Hoffmann text must be used in the text--no abridgements! Two: The illustrations must be fantastic--in every sense of the word.The three very best, in no particular order:1. Maurice Sendak's version. Sendak designed the costumes and sets for the Pacific Northwest Ballet's Nutcracker Suite. The designs were also used for Nutcracker:The Movie (which, sadly, is not available on DVD. hint!). It is filled with endless color sketches that communicate the strange atmosphere of Hoffmann's text--and Tchaikovsky's music.2. Carter Goodrich's version. Most notably known for his whimsical New Yorker cartoons, Goodrich's soft, yet dream-like images give his imagination free-reign. The world of the Nutcracker has never been so accessible to young and old alike.3. Of course, Gennady Spirin's version. Jewel-like, yet with an old-world patina, each painting glitters with the magic of Christmas. Every image can (and should) be poured over to examine the breathless detail of Spirin's baroque dollhouse universe.There are too many uninspired or bowdlerized versions of this tale littering the market. If I may, I'd like to make some suggestions of others who would be worthy to take a \\"crack\\" at this Christmastime masterpiece:Edward Sorel, of \\"The Saturday Kid\\" fame.David Wiesner of \\"Sector 7\\".Peter Malone, who did an excellent job with \\"The Magic Flute\\".Brian Selznick of \\"The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins\\".Peter Sis, who created the haunting \\"The Three Golden Keys\\".and Marc Sutherland, who made the deliriously animistic \\"MacMurtrey's Wall\\"."},{"Title":"The Nutcracker","review":"This book belongs in any serious Christmas book collection.

Then a congressman from Idaho, his size was as imposing as his character. He was friendly, cordial and cheerful, but as strong on princple as a great religious leader, not a politician. He had the guts to take on the IRS before his time, beleiving no agency of the government was above the law or constitution. It was because of this principle and the audacity to hold hearings that he was convicted of a trumped-up campaign violation, expelled from congress and imprisoned. The charges, even if true, were less serious than the politically connected Geraldine Ferrarro was allowed to plea-bargain into a small fine and keep her position not many years later.

The information deals mainly with the story of Our Lady of Guadalup and its impact on Mexican-American women. The author sheds light on the story by giving Aztec background, allusions, and references. My only complaint is that the writer chose only to include Mexican-American women from California in her survey. I felt that Mexican-American women from other regions of America, such as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona as well as California, might have offered a broader perspective for this book. Nevertheless, this book was very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Our Lady of Guadalupe : Faith and Empowerment among Mexican-American Women","review":"I read this book as a Catholic, a trained lay minister, and a non-Hispanic. I learned about the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and I learned what it means to Mexican-American women. The story is about empowerment. It's word that sometimes scares the Catholic Church. Especially the hierarchy. This was Dr. Rodriguez doctoral thesis and it eminently readable because she wrote it from the heart. Her dream opens the book and opens the reader's mind to enter into the story. It is a research project with the spirit of Our Lady and Dr. Rodriguez."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus was well known for defending values of justice, freedom and human dignity, I don't think his great work \\"the stranger\\" was a negative portrayal of human life in any way. The stranger is simply Camus' way of presenting his philosophy of absurdity in a very artistic, logical way.Camus's absurdist philosophy implies that life has no rational meaning, and there isn't a rational reason for the order of events in this world, therefore existence itself is absurd, which of course would contradict all religious beliefs that there is a divine reason for everything that happens and that life itself is divine. However, Camus in pursuit of his absurdist philosophy never believed that the absence of meaning in our lives should push humans into despair and agony, rather he believed in humans dignity under the pressure of this indifferent world.The stranger, or the main character of the novel: Meursault, who lived in Algiers, (Algiers was a French colony, Albert Camus was born there) is an emotionally indifferent person, who moves through life reacting to no event, even his mother's death. Meursault doesn't believe in God and doesn't have any emotional attachment to anything or anybody. Meursault on the other hand is an honest person who doesn't lie about his feelings and tells it as he sees it; he's simply a person with no hidden agendas and no mysterious motives.Meursault's life exists as a series of random events with seemingly no logic to why or when the event occur, not even his marriage decision or the support that he gives to certain friends seem logical. For no clear motive or reason, Meursault commits a murder and is taken to prison. The trial that takes place in the second part of the book is the most intense and mentally engaging part of Camus' stranger.The main focus of the trial shifts radically from the murder to an analysis of Meursault's character: his atheism, his lack of emotions at his mom's funeral, his brief interactions with people he met at his mom's funeral and even his conversation with the priest who came to prison to redeem Meursault and ask him to take Jesus as his savior. The court is trying to find the reason behind this irrational crime, just like society and religion are trying to find reason behind irrational events of life.Meursault is sentenced to death and pressured again by the priest to choose religion before he dies. At this point, Meursault, who was never emotional about any thing in his life, becomes very emotional about his rejection of religion and accepts death as the only destiny awaiting all humans. Getting rid of all hope, and accepting death was the only conclusion that allowed Meursault his inner peace.At a time of intense intellectual confusion after the second world war, Camus is not to be blamed for thinking that existence was absurd, at a time where lives are being lost for no reason and religion was being misused all over the world for political ,controlling, and non spiritual reasons. If the reader is interested in philosophy, religion, or literature, the stranger is a fascinating journey into the human mind and an exploration of life's purpose."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"After reading this book, it made me realize a lot of things about the present state of writing that I hadn't known. It was funny in many parts, although I wouldn't claim that it was as thorough as some other books deal with this subject. It was sort of banal in many ways, but definitely worth reading. What I mean by some of my previous statements is that in many literary journals writers try to tackle the banal but it comes of as boring. This book never does, it maintains a dramatic touch, and a bit of suspense to go along with the banal."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"(Note: This is a review of Stuart Gilbert's translation)I am not familiar with Albert Camus's work, but decided to read this. I was hooked from the beginning. Camus is very effective at instilling a sense of urgency and suspense. Throughout the novel, you feel helpless, nothing more than a passenger being driven toward the inevitable conclusion.The main character is as much a victim of whimsy and circumstance as a willing participant in it. At times he seems like nothing more than a sentient animal, able to communicate with other people effectively, but unable (or unwilling) to emote. As I read, my mind became filled with questions. Is his condition the result of a mental handicap, or an innate acceptance of reality? Is it actually possible for someone to be like this? Was he always like this, or did something make him this way?What's worse is the question I continually avoid: is he right?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Short crisp sentences. Easy to read, but in total not necessarily easy to understand if you start thinking about what this story might mean. Just like in his novel \\"The Plague\\" Camus rubs the hard reality of death in your face to force the eternal, meaning-of-life question to the surface.In the hot sun under the influence of a lot of wine Meursault stumbles into killing an Arab. What was he thinking? He is a man who thinks for himself. How could he get himself into such trouble? Unlike everyone else (according to the priest) when faced with death Meursault does not submit to the comfort the priest offers, even though he admits he is afraid.More proof that Meursault was an independent thinker can be found on page 42 where he expresses his opinion about Paris: \\"It's dirty. Lots of pigeons and dark courtyards. Everybody's pale.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I had the pleasure of enjoying this masterpiece after finishing school at the age of 25. Simply put, it is amazing. If you have never read this buy it now!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This short novel exemplifies existentialism. Life is meaningless and daily events are trivial. These points are emphasized through the main character, Meursault, and his dispassionate manner. His reaction towards the death of his mother is summed up with the indifferent statement of \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe...\\" As incomprehensible as his response is, as a reader, I found myself sympathizing and relating to this emotionally isolated man.The Stanger, though not a happy book, is a an insightful and interesting read. Recognizing unfortunate similarities between yourself and the character of Meursault is bound to take place (such as the need to observe surrounding human tendencies, or the need to guard yourself against disappointment). Though you will not be able to fully embrace the character Meursault, you cannot help but feel that his outlook on life makes perfect sense.Albert Camus excels at using the various characters within The Stanger to represent allegories of life. With old Salamano and his dog, one witnesses the power of daily routine and the resistance to change. Camus' writing style is to the point and easy to read. I enjoyed the existential theme and loved attempting to dissect the complex character of Meursault."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book changed my life. Period. Camus, best known for his advocacy of existentialism and absurdism and his collection of essays, writes a novel that seeps into one's subconscious and begins to have the reader identify with the character, care about the character, and wonder about the absurdity of the trials and ridiculous nature of humans.Intriguing, engaging, page-turning and (sadly) short, this book is a great weekend read. This translation in particular makes the story accessible and easy to comprehend-- a major plus."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is rather strange. There is a very distinct writing style, and Camus paints a very vivid picture of everything that is going on.The plot itself is at first completely bewildering. The book starts out with the death of our main character's mother, and then moves with startling speed to completely different things, and before you even realize what's happening, there's a baffling trial.The thing that troubled me most about the story was the trial itself, because knowing how silly the arguments are, one can get extremely frustrated, and I found myself quite angry at the book.It was the ending that I truly enjoyed. It was a very solid, satisfying ending, making the overall reflections easier. This is certainly a good book; not perfect, not incredible, and, in fact, often very confusing. Overall, though, it's an interesting book to read, and when I was done, I found myself thinking about all sorts of things, because the book really does make you think. It's not perfect, no, but it is thought-provoking. And while some people cannot stand it, others love it dearly. It's a book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"this is the first piece of writing i have read from albert camus and i found it very interesting. the character meursault is a very indifferent character who seems to be very impartial when he hears of his mother's death and kind of continues to be static untill the the second half of the book. i do not want to give the book away as some of the others have, but i feel that no matter what one person does and no matter what ones perception is, it can never match the perception of others. one of my favorite lines in the story is when meursault is talking to the chaplain about seeking redemption through god because according th chaplain \\"it is not the human justice that matters but divine justice\\" and meursault's response was \\"it was the human justice that put me here\\". no matter what acts you commit, whether they be henous, incensitive or loving, one way or another you will be judged and upon that judgement will be your sentence. it was definitely an easy read that takes the readers on a ride into the thoughts of a man who accepts the one thing he can not change; his fate. \\"with this, i dont even have a chance to survive, not even a slim one\\"."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is one of the best books I have ever read.

I think it to be more a 2 than a 3.* I did not read it for luxury or enjoyment. It was an assignment.* Please read this from the point of view of a student in English class.This book does its job relatively well. It is thought-provoking, disturbing, and well written. I enjoyed the writing itself. Fundamentals, indeed, good job, round of applause.This book was, in the end, about a view of life different from what I have. I was not, however, doomed to hate it for that reason alone. But dislike it, I certainly did.I am in no way the kind of person who enjoys nothing but uplifting and happy literature. I enjoy the thought behind this book, its unique presentation using the main character as a symbol of human consciousness on the most basic level, and the way even his view was presented. I respect it to a degree. I do, however, shortly after finishing it, find that the useful thought behind the supposed moral was completely lost in a tornado of hopelessness. Even the ideas of the book were swept up into doom- a screeching, hard slam against a wall that stops you completely.Where this book and its ideas went seemed so beyond anything that can have a name, \\"existentialism\\". It just seems like an excuse to be absurd to me.You may not agree with my impression, but as a single reader, this is what I got. Nothing but hopelessness. In the end, everything was nothing. I have a big problem with this idea in general, and I found myself feeling like the chaplain at the end, with tears in his eyes, trying to no avail to change an unchangeable man. The character was a sort of anti-human whom I could not understand or relate to, however hard I tried, and whose ideas were so wrought with a suggestion that simply seems idiotic and null to mention that I am still finding that my thoughts are overlapping.If what this character thought were true, and everyone on earth came to believe it someday, then I don't think the world would exist. I don't think anything would. There would be absolutely nothing behind it. It would make no sense, and nothing as great as the universe can possibly be so senseless and pointless. As this man might agree, there should be reason behind everything- and past our fluid human consciousness, I am positive that there is.Sitting here now I realize that this might simply be the point of \\"existentialism\\", and that this sort of thing is allowed. If that is the case I hope to avoid this kind of literature in the future. Even then I did not enjoy this book and I wish I did not have to read it. It depressed me and drowned out my curious thought, and instead of thinking about life and pondering like I thought I would be at the beginning, I couldn't help but wonder what the point of being upset OR pondering was. A book that does that is simply out of my comprehension. Maybe I'm simply too above or below the thought (your call!) to appreciate this. I can only hope so. But even then, I presume that would be pointless too.To be fair: if you enjoy this sort of writing, and want to get so deep that you don't even know where you are anymore, and wish to be quite likely disturbed, then read this as you can probably handle it.If you are looking for a regular book, or simply a thought-provoking one, look elsewhere to books that offer items you can actually utilize.Good riddance to The Stranger."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus was the guiding hero of the protagonist in \\"You Deserve Nothing\\"a recently read and reviewed novel , I was invigorated to pick up Camus' masterpiece \\"The Stranger\\".Years past Ive read plenty of Sarte and the leading biography of his life, which included enticing descriptions and anecdotes of his fellow existentialists Albert Camus's \\"The Stranger'.Unlike French Surrealistic painting French Existentialism in literature has not survived our ever maturing collective scrutiny so very well.The layering in of post modern culture in the following 60 years recontextualizes much of French existentialist novelists and authors and their weighty tomes (Foucault)as self indulgent if not a bit comic. On the other hand French Existential poets of the period are as potent as ever ie:Baudelere 'Flowers of Evil\\".I am one who believes that writers & artists drive the ebb and flow of our deepest awareness.French existentialism ,so revered on campus in the fifties and sixties, has just not held up to the evolving scope of conciousness to the present. where as German existentialist have transcended the decades nicely(Freidrich Nietzche).\\"The Stranger\\" appears on 'greatest' book list of the twentieth century often and as the favorite book of many notable thinkers.I was prepared for an unforgettable read.It is spare and precise piece of writing which is at once a descriptive atmospheric tale,and philosophical text .The Author is careful and dettached as he leads his protagonist through a gauntlet of apparently unasuming harmless if not accidental events which accelerate into doom.Along the way however he reveals an abiding indifference to his own fate ,effectively characterizes the classic French existential anti-hero.Mssr Camus's portrayal of hapless events in the life of his unfeeling misanthrope is nothing less than a warning; an inevtable outcome which awaits all who indulge the promise of romanticism.The setting ,North Africa 1944 ,is a slice life woven well into the story and gives the reader insight to the symbiosis of Arabs and French.Ironically same place and time approximately,just a few miles up the road and a flipped page or two of the calander ,the Americn film director Michael Curtiz was making \\"Casablanca\\" featuring the true grit Americn romantic Hero Humprey Bogart."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Written by a French existentialist (at least at the time he was) and in an american style. Camus tried to make his main character without a conscience in the first half of his book. The main character has a short character arch and comes across as very shallow and indifferent.But the beauty is in the details. Meursault finds himself pitted against a world that fails to understand who he is. Sometimes his appetites for physical pleasure clouds his senses and dictates his reactions; he is brave enough to admit this. The last ten pages or so is what makes this book what it is. The build up of the character of a man who is amoral, yet kind, and a man who still enjoys the company of others. In the last moments he spends with the chaplain, a man who he has refused to see 4 times but that comes anyway, Meursault finds himself through Nietzsche's expressions. Of course the book itself makes no explicit references to the german philosopher, but the words used by Meursault does. And at last, when the chaplain is ripped from Meursault's grasp Meursault realizes what he lives for. He lives for the moment, the excitement, the boredom, the life he made--because he himself did make it. The chaplain, has killed himself for a world that is only present in the minds eye, no reality of which is being or can be experienced.This book is for those exploring classical literature; for the existentialist; for the philosophers."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"On the last page of THE STRANGER, Albert Camus shows his hand, as much as tells us we need not infer this or that. Our world is one of \\"benign indifference\\" and, like his mother, our anti-hero Meursault is about to be liberated by death, liberated from all the nonsense, the games, the preening, the self-importance, the institutions, the rules, the rituals, the solipsism, and, most of all, the hypocrisy of what we all agree to call \\"life.\\"Who, it would seem, is the Prosecutor in the trial, to judge anyone? For Meursault, the world consists of these simplicities: sounds, smells, sights, tastes, touched feelings. Throughout the novella, the senses creep in -- some manmade, others those of the world. If this indifferent young man pays heed to anything, that appears to be it. In every other sense, he is the opposite of, say, Holden Caulfield, the boy who cares too much. Meursault cares too little, but from an existential viewpoint, wherein the world is random and the players in it foolish because they fail to realize it -- in fact, like the priest at the end, they insist on impressing some order on it -- this \\"cautionary tale\\" lacks any caution. It is what it is -- a tale. Liberation lies in admitting as much, but, one realizes, it takes almost superhuman strength to admit as much.This gets to the core of existentialism, which, I guess, is not so much a philosophy as an ideal. If you strip away the comforts of family (his mother), church (the priest), society (his friends and girlfriends), you're left with a certain starkness. But what if you fend off terms like anarchy and nihilism and embrace such a \\"crutch-free\\" life as its true meaning, one beyond most men because they dare not admit as much?And yet you don't see many people racing up to embrace such thoughts, do you. Camus's novella reminded me at times of Sartre's short story of a condemned man's last night in prison, \\"The Wall.\\" I have no idea which came first. And I have no idea what the differences are between these two French heavyweights who lived in the same church (gasp!) only a different pew. But I liked Camus's use of story to make his points, how the sun blinded Meursault at the key moments, such that even the reader seems confused and disoriented at the time bullets are fired. How different it is from his heightened senses in a prison cell, waiting for \\"that\\" dawn, the one that ends his existence and promises no variation of an existence afterwards.Where would he have been without the priest to inadvertently save him at the end? Without that scene, he would have been like the rest of us. A pitiful, slobbering, cowardly shell of a man doing all he can not to scream as he is led to the guillotine. But no. Though we don't see the scene, we are given to understand that he will walk to his death with the supreme confidence and nonchalance of the stars he stares at every night. Cold, indifferent, random -- just like the life that will churn on without him after the blade...."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I usually don't like translated works because there is often so much lost in translation. Many works (especially Greek mythology) can ramble and be agonizing to read through. However, this translation is beautiful. Matthew Ward has captured the ideas of Albert Camus: the searing apathy that haunts the life of Meursault. Even down to the most insignificant sentences and details, Meursault's struggle with indifference is always apparent. It is a quick read and reminds me very much of \\"Inherit the Wind\\" (mid-1900s courtroom struggle type of thing, ending with a potent moral message). \\"The Stranger\\" will leave you feeling the deepest sympathies for Meursault and conducting a deep self reflection."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The stranger stands outside of the society.

He can't show his mourning over the dead mother. The dead of the Arab makes him guilty in the eyes of the society. They condemn him about his behaviour. Albert Camus had experience this situation on the shore in real life. He shows that moral and discrimination have a narrow gab. They are two sides of a medal. Freedom and liberality are mayor are mayor values in our society. In the book the society is not ready for this liberality. The concept of this book is like an antic drama. At the end Mersault takes the dead as an option because he is not ready to give up his freedom. He lives like that there is no tomorrow. Every day can be his last. He can't bear the nerds and the hypocrite society. This makes the stranger a brilliant novel of the genre of existentialism."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is absolutely amazing! It's such an intriguing story, especially if you're studying existentialism in high school and college. As for the service,the shipping for this book was excellent! It came on time and the condition was brand new! Finally, the prices are unbeatable! As a student, you save time and money!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"As soon as you read up to the first chapter, you are struck with the mystery of the protagonist's mental state, and develop a sort of awe for the character. You read on and on and are continuously hooked on Camus's egregious words. So hooked in fact, you may be able to read it in one sitting (as I have). Camus is an astoundingly captivating novelist whose (in my honest opinion) greatest masterpiece is \\"The Stranger.\\" This novel has left me nothing but breathlessness, a new favorite book, a new perspective on not only France's, but most of the world's legal system, a new perspective on a not-so-innocent mind, a peculiar love for both Camus and this book's main character, and this review. This book is overall, a heart-wrenching classic."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is a slim novel, a very fast read. You can't help but be affected by the circumstances in which Monsieur Meursault finds himself in. The novel tackles plenty of issues, including morals, judgment, and even the death penalty.I read Matthew Ward's translation from the French, and he had some interesting notes and tidbits to share. Like Camus deliberately used short sentences and brief descriptions, imitating some of the other popular (American) writers at that time."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I love a good story, and especially a story that has a deeper purpose. Camus' novel is just that. The whole existence of the main character is a series of events that seem disjointed, but through the novel, you begin to see his life is one meaningless event after another one. We are invited to look at a man who has nothing but the experience of the moment. Nothing is meaningful, and nothing is meaningless, it just is. The sorrow and hollowness that come from this type of existence are palpable. In the end, Mersault becomes exactly what his life has been. A great book to read with other people and discuss."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When asked what I felt was the greatest novel of the twentieth century, this is the one I came up with a some moments for reflection. It is short, highly accesable, and contains some of the most fascinating and exhillerating insights into the nature of humanity. Camus' narrative touch is often breath-taking, and makes you want to learn French just to read the book properly. He manages, as a stylist, things that the likes of Sartre and Proust could only dream about. I love this book perhaps too dearly, but I would reccomend it to any thinking adult."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus presents in this small novel a certain view of the world. The indifferent universe creates an indifferent hero. The lack of seeming moral feeling and scruple, the absence of deep emotion in the hero fit in well with the seeming indifference of both society and cosmos to the hero.This detachment however becomes an expression of its time and a style. It becomes too something others can recognize and admire as a true way of being. It becomes the absurd hero in an indifferent world whose life and action have a kind of detached mystique and beauty.By every sign the one true feeling Camus shows in this work is his admiration for beautiful prose."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger tells the story of Meursault, a man who seems aimless in life and has stopped noting his feelings. Events that would seem major to others do not effect him in any emotional way. When his mother dies, he is not saddened in the least bit, and goes on a date the day after her funeral. When he becomes involved in the dangerous affairs of an amoral pimp named Raymond, Meursault's fate takes a turn for the worst. He eventually commits a pointless murder, and faces the possibility of having to face the worst consequence possible; execution.The simple narrative of this novel parallels the theme of existentialism, and the pointlessness of life. This book definetely requires reading between the lines, so it is not for everyone. Some also believe that the author's outlook on life highly influences the novel, while I believe that it does not hinder the potency of the message."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is definitely the most thought-provoking book I have read in quite some time. I first heard about this book from the Cure song \\"Killing an Arab\\" and thought that it would be worth checking out. This book especially appealed to me because I feel that people are always so busy searching for ways to give their lives meaning that they don't step back and consider the whole picture. The plot of The Stranger seems relatively simple at first; an average man is drawn into a senseless murder though a series of unlucky circumstances. As you get further into the book it slowly gets more complicated (as does Camus' style of writing.) Eventually you learn that the murder is not the focal point of the book, instead it is about how Meursault's attitude and actions do him in (this was termed \\"the nakedness of a man faced with the absurd\\" by Camus.) In the end Meursault comes to realize that there is nothing he can do about death because we all die someday and somehow and when all is said and done, life is ultimately meaningless (this is the main point behind Camus' type of existentialism.)"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I don't believe Albert Camus had any that idea that his novel \`The Stranger' would be so popular and timeless when he wrote that book in 1946. It is not a fluke, but he didn't seem to have many aspirations and pretensions when writing this short, but amazing, book.In a nutshell, \`The Strange' is the story of an Algerian, Mr. Meursault, who loses the strings of his life, and leads a flow of events decide his fate. The narrative begins of the death of his mothers. He is forced to go to the retirement house where she used to live and attend the funeral. In doing so, he feels strange, and doesn't seem to have any tender feeling toward his dead mother-- to the surprise of the local people. Later on he starts dating Marie --but notice he doesn't love her. It is just that it is easier to be with her, than being alone. He ends getting involved with Raymond --who seems to be not very honest. And in an unfortunate event he kills an Arab. That's when his life falls apart. Well, it would, if he was a normal person but he is not.Camus has created a vivid --albeit lacking in energy and chutzpah -- character to be the protagonist of his novel. Meursault is not a normal person, however he is just the French average Joe of the mid 40s. He doesn't have many aspirations for his life; he lets the flow of events drive his life. The book is so well written that after a couple of pages you really feel upset with him. Is he incapable of showing feelings, or doesn't he have any feelings? These are questions raised throughout the novel, but it seems that the writer never came up with a plain answer to that, because it is not easy.Like it is stated in the novel \`Everything is true and nothing is true.' Like in life, it is nothing is really one thing. It all depends on a referential to what is true and what is not. Meursault seems to not have this referential. He simply doesn't care about being alive and governing his life. With this Camus shows all that generation angst. They seem to lack strong feelings, or even any kind of feelings.\`The Stranger' is one of the 20th Century classics, one of those books destined to be discussed forever-- because it generates so many different interpretations. More than book, it became a cultural event. It is a novel that deserves multiple readings."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"i feel very upset with this book, and all of the other european books we re-print and change.

I am reading the ORIGINAL version of this book and it is amazing, when i see this, it makes me want to break something, why would anyone change a beutiful work of literature, this is just another example of American's doing this.

The words draw you in and allow you to feel in the action. One of the greatest books written."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus has made a real classic with his book The stranger. Camus provides readers with a glimpse into the life of a young Frenchman named Mersault. The first line of the book is one of the most famous lines in literature. the line shows Mersault's affection for his mother. The telegram Mersault recieves does not tell when his mother died, only the fact that she did die. In the Book Mersault has a girlfriend by the name of Marie. Marie is somewhat a bandage for Mersault after his mother dies. althought Mersault's mothers death does not affect him totally, he still needs help coping with it. throughout the whole book Mersault does not take stands on his views towards different events in the book. i think Camus was trying to tell where neutrality can get you. i enjoyed this book very much, and im a teenager by the age of 16. you should pick this book up, its short, sweet, and has soo much meaning to it, its astounding."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus has a way with words like that of the finest of poets. This brilliantly crafted story is a fine achievment in literature. As you have probably read from the other reviews, The Stranger is the story of a man, Mersault, who enjoys only the sensual pleasures of life, if only for brief moments. He does not love his companion and is totally indifferent to the death of his mother; he doesn't even know when she died. He commits a crime on the beach and stands trial, but is convicted solely because he is detached from society--he is a stranger.I have nothing to add to the plot because many have done so much better than I ever could judging from the reviews I 've read already. I only have a few comments and suggestions.If you've never read Camus before, then this is the book to start with; it gives you a glimpse into the mind of a brilliant thinker, writer, and artist. If possible, you should read The Myth of Sisyphus alongside(or even after) The Stranger. You will have a better feel as to what Camus is all about, though I doubt anyone will ever really understand him.The Stranger will have many question the nature of their own existence. This is how powerful Camus's writing is. Overall, The Stranger is a profoundly beautiful work and it is one of my favorites. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger was an extremely thought provoking book, and it applies to every society at any time, thus is as powerful today in America as it was in France 50 years ago. Basically the book is about a man in Algiers who is killed by his society for his social abnormalities. He commited murder, but was executed for not crying at his mother's funeral. To me this book was a painful reflection of the mold that societies try to force people into, and the way the society views people who don't fit the mold. I felt this book was extremely powerful because of how it shows the cruelty that society can inflict to people who don't fit in."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"It didn't sink in until the next day. I couldn't believe how sad it was."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"\\"The Stranger\\" is (and I know that some of you out there will inadvertently feel this is presumptuous)One of if not the greatest work of short fiction in the history of the twentieth century. Let us forget the legacy of the author.(being a key contributor to philosophy,literature, and essays among other subjects too numerous to debate) Let us even forget that this was his first truly finished piece of fiction. The story of Mearsult stands to this day (and most certainly beyond) as the finest exploration of man and his struggle with the absurdity of modern life. Existential thought could never have been realized without our hero. Mearsult was the protagonist by the way. Not the judge, nor the Arab, nor the sun.Mearsult is a completely identifiable personality in all of modern man. He is no stranger to any of us , infact I believe that if we really scrutinize the character of Mearsult then we can find a relationship with him that isn't buried or hidden. There is no deep pursuit of darkness in the soul here. He is and will remain the exact copy of our selves for decades to come.To get on with it then, I should say that this examination of the world , religion, consequence, etc stands as one of the finest pieces of work from Camus. No great grandstanding against facism , no explorations of how sinister the self is when confronted by the reality of the self. This work is a true masterpiece and monument to Camus ideals and philosophies on the absurd.I would further recomend that if the topic interested you that you should read his collected esseys entitled\\" The Rebel\\"."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The flat affect of Camus' prose sometimes makes him seem less a writer than a philosopher creating parable or sisyphian allegory. Yet contemporary writers might emulate his devastating calm more often. Camus' only religion is the elemental--light, heat, effort, and movement--and in those basics he saw all he needed to create a story...because we are all makings of the sun. Just before the murder at the core of the novel, and the narrator's asserts that \\"To stay, or to make a move--it came to much the same\\" sets the scene for the senseless act three pages later. This moment, however, is no mere \\"telling\\"; it succinctly describes the emotional inertia, exhaustion of will, and nausea to which humans fall prey. Knowing how it really feels to have meaning drop away, he knows any more elaborate description would seem false. What is more, he says just enough to make the murder both understandable and baffling. Camus' triumph--not just as a philosopher but also as a writer--is telling his tale and feeling its truth."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"As other people have stated, this is definitely a powerful book. I love books that really make you re-evaluate your life and what components define you, and this is one of them. As desolate as this sounds, the existentialist pattern of this book entices you to realize how trivial we are in the great scheme of things. How many of us remember stories about or have even heard of the unremarkable \\"normal\\" people from 100 years ago? Hardly anyone, I would assume, unless you're into genealogy. The main character's indifference with the world is more honest than I could imagine. When his girlfriend asks for him to marry her, he basically says OK, and when she asks him if he loves her, he tells her that he doesn't really love her, and then she asks him why he would marry her, and he tells her because that is what she wants. In modern times, how many people can be thought of that get married for that same reason? It's the same thing when he's in jail. He says that it doesn't matter when he dies because he's going to die someday anyway. This is definitely a book that leads the reader to new thoughts about life. Since this is such a short, interesting, and easy read, I highly recommend it to anyone, from the non-reader that wants to experience a new kind of philosophy, to the ardent reader that doesn't have a lot of time on his or her hands. A truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is perhaps the most disturbing book I have read in the recent past. Camus gives a chilling story of a man with no morals. C.S. Lewis desribes a man like this in Mere Christianity as being like someone who is born color bind, except that instead of being blind to colors, he is blind to morals.Most of Camus books deal almost exclusively with existentialism, mostly with transcending Nihilism. However, in this book, Nihilism is never transcended. All is meaningless, even death.Albert Camus is a literary genius, but God have mercy on the soul of the man who believes anything like what the man in this book believes, for his life is truly meaningless in his eyes."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is a ponderous, uninspiring read, but it presents a meaningful message. People who feel alienated, bewildered, and detached in an indifferent universe will recognize parallels with their own experiences. If you sing in the Choir, this book is an apostasy, a blight on an orderly world.The fortunate many, whose belief in transcendence nestles their hearts in warmth and certainty will be impatient with a heathen who floats unanchored by conventional values and social mores. If you are religious, mans' every action is birthed within the context of rational cause and effect.Meursault does not have the guidance that organized religion provides. He has not internalized the rules, the guidelines that create conscience, guilt about what he does or does not do. He is freefloating in the universe.Yes, he does inexplicable things; things that are inexplicable if you expect a rational explanation. Things happen in the context of the moment - he puts 4 shots into the Arab when the first shot probably killed him. Why? We don't know. As humans, we are uncomfortable with that answer; we must have an answer and where there a void we will fill it in with...something. He did it because...If you are an atheist, you can relate, at an emotional level with Meursault's experiences. But it goes beyond religion; Meursault did not grieve over the death of his mother. In our society everyone loves their mother (see Philip Wylie's Generation of Vipers). What if your mother never showed you any love, physical affection, or caring? What if your relationship with her was indifferent?This book is about the \\"benign indifference of the universe.\\" As such, it is not an enjoyable or fulfulling book. It may be cathartic, perhaps clensing for some. For many who don't know who they are, where they come from, or where they are going this book offers a small reprieve."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus' own summary on the book lies in this phrase \\"...J'ai r&eacute;sum&eacute; L'&Eacute;tranger, il y a longtemps, par une phrase dont je reconnais qu'elle est tr&egrave;s paradoxale : 'Dans notre soci&eacute;te tout homme qui ne pleure pas &agrave; l'enterrement de sa m&egrave;re risque d'tre condamn&eacute; &agrave; mort.\\". Translated this means that in our society all men who do not cry at their mother's funeral risk to be condemned to death. Of course the death that Camus refers to is not physical death but rather spiritual death. The spiritual death that arrives because of the struggle for idividual survival. Humans are so involved in personal survival that neglect what might be considered important and humane. That is why Camus has said that \\"\\"L'absurde nat de la confrontation de l'appel humain avec le silence d&eacute;raisonnable du monde.\\". The absurd (in this case the actions of Meursault) is a result of the confronation of a human cry with the indifference of the world. The world did not care about Mersault before the murder but it condemns him for it.The story revolves around this character (Meursault) who at his mother's funeral shows an indifferent attitude. Sitting on one side of the coffin he feels as if he is at a courtroom since all his mother's friends are sitting across from him. There is no grief that he feels, an attitude that he carries with him throughout his life. The same picture takes place at the end when he is sitting in front of a jury being judged after he has murdered a man for no apparent reason. He makes no apologies for his behavior because he finds no fault in his behavior. He is the sole judge of his actions and to him they are justified.One think to consider is that this man is not a hypocrite. His indifference is evident in all aspects of his life and he never claims to be something that he is not. He is the product of the society that he lives in, so deep down I think that Camus with this book does not seek to condemn this man but rather the society that produces and promotes these emotions. Many people go through life as hypocrites and in essence they are not better than Meursault. Meursault defined his path based on his own views of morality and proper behavior which can be as correct as the ones of society in general."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Title says it all, the Stuart Gilbert translation is much better.

Camus introduces to us M. Meursault, the epitome of existentialism. I was forced to read this book for my AP Lit course. I enjoyed it so much, not only because it was the shortest but also because it was written in the kind of English I speak (as opposed to the other two books, King Lear and Tess of the d'Urbervilles :-]). The more I read, the more I felt like part of Meursault. His nonchalance made sense to me. It was wonderful. A great read for all seventeen year olds out there!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger by Albert CamusThe novel was published in 1942 and it was Camus' first novel. It won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1957.The setting of the novel is in French Algeria. Camus begins the story with Meursault, the narrator, stating: \\"Mother died today.\\" It is a terrific opening line; a great line to get the reader's attention.The plot is simple. Meursault, the main character who is also the narrator, is a Frenchman living in French Algiers. He attends his mother's funeral but he does not exhibit grief over the death of his mother. His actions and behavior show that he seemed unaffected by his mother's death, which of course was very disturbing to me as the reader. He carries on with his life as though nothing had happened. He narrates the uninteresting events in his daily life culminating in his senseless murder of an Arab man. The book is divided into Part One (before the murder) and Part Two (after the murder). Part One ends with a description of the murder, which to me, was the climax of the story. Part two deals with the trial. He is condemned to die by guillotine.After reading the novel, the interest, at least for me, is not so much the details of the plot but the personality of Meursault, the literary devices used by Camus to dramatize highpoints or turning points in the story, and of course Camus' philosophy that the world and society are essentially absurd and indifferent; life is meaningless; the randomness of violence and death. We are like ships tossed about in a stormy sea. Society does not care about you as a person and therefore, it is up to you as an individual to find meaning in life. But in the end what is the use? Does it really matter? Thinkers and philosophers refer to this way of thinking as existentialism. The novel is perceived a classic example of existentialism. Camus used the thoughts and the personality of the main character, Meursault, to illustrate and underline his existentialist philosophy.Meursault is emotionally impoverished; he has no passion in life. He is dispassionate and detached. He works as a clerk or secretary and the characteristic attribute of his life is dullness: sleeping, going to work. He exhibits neither excitement nor enthusiasm for living. One day is pretty much like another day.Meursault attributes his killing of the Arab man as \\"chance.\\" Meursault expresses neither guilt nor regret. It was just chance and the heat of the day; as if he was not at all responsible for the crime. The incident occurs on a beach in Algiers, when Meursault, his girlfriend Marie, and his friend Raymond spend a weekend at the beach. There was no motive to the killing. It was a reflex reaction to a self-perceived threat. What he felt, what his emotions were during that crucial and fatal encounter, Meursault does not tell us. During that fatal moment, Meursault focused more on describing the heat at the beach where the murder occurred and how the heat affected his senses. It would seem as though the extreme heat and glare of the sun caused him to kill the Arab. The best passage in the book occurs in this section, the conclusion of Part One. In this passage, we can appreciate Camus' brilliance as a writer by his use of word imagery to move the story. I consider the passage one of the finest examples of descriptive writing.The book is a great read but I did not like the personality of the main character and I do not agree with the author's philosophy that the world and society are indifferent, that life is meaningless. We give meaning and direction to our life. The world is what we make it. The book raises timeless questions about ethics, the meaning and direction of life and social justice."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The StrangerCamus begins the story with Meursault, the narrator, stating: \\"Mother died today.\\" It is a terrific opening line; a great line to get the reader's attention.The plot is simple.

In prison, while waiting for his execution, he became angry with his chaplain. I found the encounter between Meursault and the priest extremely fascinating though. I must confess that I found a bit of comedy in the conversation between the priest and Meursault, especially the part when the priest was hinting that Meursault might see a divine face on the prison walls of his room. Meursalt sarcastically thought to himself that all the time he was hoping to see the his girlfriend's face on the proson walls in vain. Because Meursault didn't believe in God, the priest of course was upset and when the priest said, \\"I shall pray for you\\", Meursault lost his temper. In the end, Meursault comes to terms with what he believes to be an indifferent universe and finds solace and happiness in accepting the this indifferent and absurd universe on its own terms.Meursault is odd and certainly not a likeable character but the descriptive writing style of Camus is excellent. The book is a great read. It raises timeless questions about ethics, the meaning and direction of life and social justice. I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book has been analyzed to death already - we can say its existentialism or point numerous fingers towards the words of Nietzsche and other great philosophers, and we can even make arguments regarding the virtues of death. Yes, this book does all of those things, but the subtleties of this book warrant our appreciation nonetheless.This book paints a vivid portrait of extremes. At first, the simplistic so-called American language and writing style, the utter lack of imagery and emotion, not to mention Meursault's complete lack of sensitivity, put me off. Nevertheless, very shortly I came to realize that Merusault is not actually a mere character in a story; he is a mirror, reflecting back all humanity's apathy. Some might say that Meursault is a caricature, a device used to advance a philosophical argument, and while that might be true, I do not take issue when an author exaggerates a character to make a very deliberate point.Meursault got used to his life, got used to the mundane, got used to the day to day drudgery, so used to it that \\"the emptiness of a man's heart becomes an abyss threatening to swallow up society.\\" Meursault is the victim of indifference. Every pleasure in life is meaningless for him, worth less than nothing. And it's only after Meursault is imprisoned for murder and confronted with his own death that he sees all he has taken for granted. Not only does he see the great beauty in the world, he also sees humanity as the world's greatest ugliness. Meursault holds fast to this exposed truth; when confronted with his own impending execution in the end, his only wish is \\"that there be a large crowd of spectators [...] and that they greet me with cries of hate.\\" One wish, and that is to live one moment free from indifference.Many struggle through this work. Yes, it can be seen as painfully boring in the beginning, but as you read, the story changes pace, the language shifts, and the beauty of the words begins to bloom as the pages turn. Meursault's situation might seem unrealistic, absurd even, but given a longer look ... its truth is glaringly apparent and quite disturbing."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"\\"The Stranger\\" may be hailed as an existentialist classic, but its author rejected that label. Albert Camus wasn't one for joining any club, whether or not they'd have him as a member. In \\"The Stranger\\", he celebrates, insofar as the novel can be said to celebrate anything, being an outsider.Meursault lives a life of complete detachment, a fact brought home when his mother dies. He feels nothing but a vague obligation to be present for her funeral. His girlfriend wants to marry, but he just shrugs disinterested agreement. His boss offers a promotion, including relocation from Algiers to Paris, and it's like six of one versus a half dozen of the other.This might seem a rather poor way to live, but when Meursault finally takes decisive action, it results in a death sentence. The situation gives him the perspective to realize that his path has been right; and his ultimate fate is a matter of cosmic indifference.\\"I could see that it makes little difference whether one dies at thirty or threescore and ten - since, in either case, other men and women will continue living, the world will go on as before,\\" he thinks.Like the old saying goes, in the long run we'll all be dead anyway. It's hard to tell whether Camus is simply presenting this mindset as unavoidable truth, or sending it up in some subtle way. Certainly the concept of hero as pimp-befriending sociopath makes one wonder whether this is supposed to be read as straightforwardly as written. Whatever Camus's motivation for this, his first novel, published in 1942, \\"The Stranger\\" presents a gripping narrative of total alienation, one of tremendous sadness and a bit of humor. A drawn-out finale feels more like a philosophy essay than fiction, but Camus's presentation of the thinking of a condemned person (use a little imagination and it can be any of us) sticks in your guts.The first half of the book is for me the richest part. Meursault's life in his shabby apartment, all but one small part of it unused, is almost comic in its bleakness, and thus endurable in a way the second, unrelievedly bleaker half, is not. Meursault stands on his porch for an entire day, smoking cigarettes, eating chocolate, waving to a passing parade of soccer players, and watching the cats run along the street as day turns to night. One neighbor has a dog he beats, but cries over when it escapes. Another, the pimp he befriends, wants Meursault to agree with his woman-beating strategies. Meursault shrugs, offering enough assent to keep the guy satisfied.What one makes of Meursault's only volitional action, the one that ends Part One, is the novel's great mystery. Insofar as I cared (and it's hard to when the protagonist clearly doesn't), it may well be the price of Meursault's temporary socialization. Make friends with criminals and become one yourself. Yet that seems too moralistic a message for Camus. Perhaps for him, it's the fact he socializes with anyone that puts him so at fault. Or maybe he's not at fault, because the sun was hot and nothing really matters anyway.Those who pick up a book wanting a concrete story and a definitive resolution won't be happy with \\"The Stranger\\". It's not a story as much as it is a philosophical construction, defining the nature of existence in its bleakest form. To a large extent, it succeeds, because the character of Meursault and his surroundings are related so pungently in Camus's singularly detached prose."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I first started reading it I was a little confused, hoping that each new page I turned would say something that would point to the actual purpose of the book. I didn't think it was a bad book I just simply didn't see any real point to it. 'Why would anyone write a book like this?' I thought to myself. 'I mean Meursault is just a completely self-centered loser, indifferent to life itself.' By the last chapter, however, when he is pondering about his imminent execution, the literacy styles describing the concepts of life and death towards an ordinary person with no real biases towards the world whatsoever, was so thought-proving and beautiful that it probably could have made Clint Eastwood cry within the movie Grand Torino. After finishing the book, however, I was still a little confused about what the point of the work was. Still even 3 days later, I was still pondering about it, replaying each chapter over in my head--which is always a definite sign of a good book. Finally, I came to possibly my first logical conclusion: Meursault's thoughts as he was waiting to be executed finally resulted in a basic theme of \\"well, we all gotta die sometime, so really, no big deal.\\" Moreover, I think the author was indirectly trying to imply that \\"yeah, we all going to die sometime, therefore, it's not actually death--how it's how or when you die--that's important, but, what you do on this earth and in life is important.\\" I believe that Meursault's final statement, \\"For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration\\", characterized that theme up perfectly. It left me with the impression that Meursault has his final opportunity to make something memorable and meaningful out of his life, even if it was only his execution."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The universe does not care for us.For many, this is a daunting realization.\\"The Stranger\\" is a fictional account of a senseless murder committed by a man that knows he is alive only through sensory experiences. Everything else, be it his mother's death, his misogynistic neighbor, or even the simple sunlight, means nothing. It has no bearing on Meursault. It does not affect him. It does not concern him. He continues living without consequence.Until he visits the beach.It is there that, through unfortunate chance, Meursault murders a hated Arab; yet Meursault knows not why this is, both the hatred and the murder. But it does not stop him.It is at this point where Camus introduces an absurdist element to \\"The Stranger.\\" Once ensnared in the legal system, Meursault's character undergoes a series of transformations at the hands of others. But Meursault the man, Meusault the persona, remains much the same.Unchanged.Camus highlights the banality of persecution, impending death, and salvation, stripping these elements of meaning and instead mocking them as absurd and, ultimately, meaningless.And for some, this knowledge is salvation."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I have used this book in a variety of classes ranging from beginning level French culture to teaching college reading prep skills. I choose it because students are often surprised at the lack of involvement Meursault has in his own life. This was the point Camus was trying to make, to be sure. This book is separated into two distinct parts: before and after M. goes to jail for killing some arabs. The book will spart a debate on racism, gender issues, cultural issues of the pied-noir and lliterary styles like absurdism. Did I mention that it is not that long? That is the students' favorite part.Anyone should try it for something different. You don't need to be in a lit class to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus' The Stranger gives us a portrait of the logical extremity of Nihlism in his character who goes through life with a detachment that is quite disturbing. A numbing look at life as experienced as a series of disconnected episodes without meaning, without commitment , without love.Does this short novel deserve the critical and academic acclaim and analysis it has received for the last 50 years? Maybe not as literature but as a reflection of the philosophical climate of postwar Europe in which it was conceived and written it still resonates."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Nihilism...existentialism...theory of the absurd...I don't which category this book technically falls into, all I can say is that it made me squirm. The protagonist of the novel was a very calm person, quite detached in fact, but ironically it is his calmness which unsettled me.Is this what life really is all about? Does it have no meaning, no purpose? Are there no morals? No God? I don't know...I'll let the philosophers and thinkers debate that. I can't alter my beliefs now, but the book provided me a window into all the things which I don't believe in.I would certainly recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When it became known that President Bush recently read the Stranger, one comedian remarked that he was happy that the president was finally completing his ninth grade reading list. Like many students, I read this book in high school, enjoyed it, and then decided to read it again as I had forgetten much of the plot. The book remains of interest too me still many years after reading it in high school. As is well known, existential themes such as choices and their consequences, and individual subjectivity are quite prominent, yet the novel is more than simply a philospophical treatise. It flows easily and is quite short but the reader can spend a great deal of time considering the questions raised by the stranger. The story's protagonist, Mersault, is a young Algerian very detached both from his personal emotions and from the traditional values one expects in society. One does however feel that there is a certain sincerity to many of his actions. There is no outward show or pretense, he says and does what he feels. The book begins as he attends his mother's funeral and behaves somewhat indifferently. He cared for her, but they had little in common and he doesn't consider showing any grief that he doesn't truly feel. He then forms an attachment to a young woman who loves him. He says he will marry her if that is what she wants, but again he behaves very ambivalently. In the second half of the novel, Mersault, through a chain of unlikely and unfortunate circumstances commits a crime. The plot then focuses on his trial and societies' outrage not only at his crime, but for the untraditional behaviour he exhibited in the novel's beginning. He is portrayed as an uncaring and unfeeling monster by the lawyers. The reader believes that this is too harsh a judgement, but then how can he be characterized? I think that this is the question that makes this a very rich novel whether you are a high school student, or president Bush"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Let me begin by saying upfront that I can't comment on the quality of the translation. I have not read other translations, nor have I read the original French.While I read \\"The Stranger\\", I had mixed feelings through out. At times, I was eager to continue reading. At other times, the plot seemed to drag. The thing I realized is that this is a philosophy book in the form of a novel. This is Camus' way of explaining his absurdist philosophy that as much as we try to ascribe meaning to our lives, there is none. This is a good book to reinforce the idea that we are all going to die eventually, so we better make the most of our lives today. I'm not sure if that's what the author was trying to convey, but that's what I took away. I feel like the bulk of the message comes in the last chapter and Mr. Camus would be more effective in explaining his philosophy in an essay rather than a novel. But \\"The Stranger\\" is an entertaining read worth the price.On a side note, I also purchased the audio book read by Jonathan Davis. I could not even finish listening to the first chapter. I tried to read along, but couldn't handle it. He read so slowly and had so many awkward pauses in between sentences. I don't recommend the audio book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"All that can be said in praise of this novel has been said on the page already in the other reviews. However, I think it needs to be addressed that this is the newer, \\"americanized\\" translation of the novel and, in my opinion, one would be better off sticking with the original Stuart Gilbert translation that was so satisfactory for so long. Ward's translation seems much too informal, in a tone that seems to ramble and not get across a mood fitting enough for Meursault's character. If at all possible, I recommend finding Gilbert's translation, as, in my opinion, it was much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus captures the nihilistic, narcissistic mindset of 20th century man hauntingly, simply, and without apology. His protagonist Meursault is a man with very little thought beyond his own physical comfort or discomfort. His reflections rarely even go deep enough to ascertain his own motivations and feelings, much less those of others. The only time real emotion is elicited from him is when a priest visits him and urges him to believe in God, in an afterlife, in something more and with purpose. Meursault suddenly snaps and begins shouting. Finally something has touched his soul, which had been untouched by love for his mother, the love of his girlfriend, or the murder of a man.The Stranger is a modern classic and those who wish to call themselves well-read should read it for that reason alone. To become a classic, however, it had to reach deeper, to address some basic human thought or motivation. In this case, Camus shows us the end result of a philosophy that sees no hope, no direction, no point to life or the things associated with it. This is nihilism, and it leaves us despairing -- and glad to close the cover on the book and know that we are not nihilists."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I dont like to rate works of art, but that being said, this is probably my favorite novel to date. It is the story of a seemingly dispassionate young man who stumbles into an arbitrary situation which eventually forces him to confront his own mortality. The majority of the story recounts the events that lead to this confrontation. Throughout the events, many of which are quite dramatic, the character remains emotionally detatched.There is a sense of nihilism in his reflections. But by the last chapter his nihilism trancends rational antibelief into something equally godless, equally meaningless, yet something far more real, far more irrational and far more human. It is in the last chapter where the novel flowers from rugged minimalist narrative into powerful and poetic philosophical prose. The theme is expanded from the particular to the universal, and Camus establishes himself as the most passionate voice of the existentialist movement."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In 'The Stranger', we are taken through the daily eventsof a seemingly ordinary man leading up to and followinghis senseless murder of an Arab, over a domestic disputeconcerning his 'pal', Raymond. The novel is essentiallya character study from an existentialist viewpoint. Theanti-hero, Meursault, is a man of no convictions who is notdriven by passion, money, or love.. but by the simple desireto get by, day to day. The murder of the Arab was senseless, andhe knows it, but does not feel particularly remorseful. When hismother dies, he is apathetic. Meursault felt, from dayto day, the way all of us have felt at times. His nihilisticattitute, while repulsive to many, has a cold and inescapablelogic. In the end, death is inevitable. It will claim us all,no matter how much we cling to life. It is this fact that makesour lives and the frantic scrambling for happiness absurd. Thereis no God, there is no higher meaning, or for that matter, anylower meaning. This brings me to my objection to some of theearlier reviews which criticized the lack of plot in the novel.To them, I'd point out that the lack of plot is a stylisticdevice used to showcase the randomness and absurdity of life.The events in the novel in fact are random. Meursault does notplay an active part in his fate. The shooting of the Arab wasnot intentional, and when he says during the trial thatit was 'because of the sun', we should take him at face value.This is not a plot driven novel. Like many existentialist works,much of the prose is devoted to minor details which may seemirrelevant. Meursault once states that he has lost the habit ofself-analyzation. Camus spends as little time analyzing hischaracter as the character does himself. The style of the novelis almost phenomenological in that we are given a list of eventsand mindstates from the point of view of the protagonist,without analysis or futher reflection. The prose is simple andto the point. A complex plot would have worked against thetheme of the book, which is man's crisis of facing the absurdityand pointlessness of existence.Definately give this short novel a chance. While it does notsay a lot that hasn't been said by other existentialist authors,it does so with a certain grace and economy. A word of warningthough: it can be a somewhat depressing read."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read the edition of The Stranger as translated by Stuart Gilbert and while I enjoyed it, I completely disagree with the synopsis statement on the back of my edition which reads in part, &quot;A terrifying picture of a man victimized by life itself- he is a faceless man, who has commited a pointless murder- it is a book whose unrelenting grip upon our consciousness has not diminished to this day.&quot;I think to say the protagonist, Meursaeult, is a &quot;victim&quot; of anything is absurd. I don't believe he ever saw, or wanted himself seen, as such. This is actually a very strong character, very much in tune with himself, what he thinks, what he likes, those things about which he does not think, etc. The word &quot;victim&quot; in no way applies and actually, in my understanding of existentialism, insults the character. Meursault is also described in other reviews as one who has been &quot;unwittingly drawn&quot; into a murder- once again, this suggests a weakness of some kind - a weakness which our protagonist simply does not have. He is not led around by the nose, nor was he &quot;unwittingly drawn&quot; into anything. In stark contract to this theory, he did everything very WILLINGLY and with all his wits about him. Even when his girlfriend proposes, he says yes, but only because it does not matter in any way to him whether they marry or not. He has considered the issue, found it to be of no consequence and is willing to do it if she likes. As for the murder, the same principal applies...he had possession of the gun, was hot and bothered by the sun, decided quite consciously to walk forward, knowing that he would not escape the heat in that direction, nor avert the man up ahead with the knife &quot;it struck me that all I had to do was turn, walk away, think no more about it&quot;) but nonetheless proceeded; What then &quot;unwittingly drew&quot; him to shoot that man- the sun? No, he simply decided to shoot him, felt the revolver in his pocket, acknowledged the oppressive weather and the effect it was having on him and shot. Then knowing he had just &quot;shattered the balance of the day, the spacious calm on this beach on which I had been happy, ... FIRED FOUR MORE SHOTS...&quot; Bang, End of the victimization theory. Nor was he &quot;victimized&quot; by society or the Courts (regardless of how corrupt either is). The man simply lived life fundamentally believing that the world was without purpose, leading only unto death, yet all the more invigorating because of this fact. This man loved life on his own terms. That in contemporary society he'd be considered a sociopath makes no nevermind to me. I have not nor do I believe I will ever meet the realization of these types of characters, i.e. the Howard Roarkes and Muersaults of the world, nor am I sure I want to. I do, however, enjoy reading about them and can see the base validity of their point."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is Albert Camus' most accessible book. Camus, the existentialist, gives us the portrayal of a man (Meursault) that on the outside appears to be a man of indifference. But as one delves deeper into the book, Meursault's life seems to come a bit more into focus. One cannot fully understand Meursault, but one does tend to understand why he is the way he is: deep, intricate, personal, reflective. Meursault will at times amuse you, at times anger you, at times cause you to lose all care for him, only to gain it back on the next page. Thats a credit to Camus' genius. And in the end you may just begin to wonder who &quot;the stranger&quot; really is. Meursault? Society? Yourself? &quot;...I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I shut Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot;, my mind was hushed. It was a very odd book that made me think. Unsure of the books meaning, I read some of the reveiws here, and, slowly, and opinion began to form in my mind. First off, Mersault, the narrator, is the most passive, static symbol I've ever encountered in literature. The nearest analog would be Billy Pilgrim from Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughter House Five&quot;, I suppose, but Mersault is a different animal all together. His entire world is bloodless, and, using modern brain theory, left hemispheric; lineal, rational. Yet, it is this very bloodless existance that Camus is objecting to, at least in my reading of the novel. Mersault is a slacker, neither good nor bad. He is simply there. Sure, he's intelligent, but he's got no insight. He's caught in a reality beyond his control, a material reality that never changes. He's pleasent, interested in others, but unemotional and detatched. The only thing he responds to are changes in his material organism; heat, low blood sugar. That sort of thing. In a way, Mersault is no different from the other characters in the novel caught in life's games. The judge and lawyers, society at large, all seem to condem him, as easily as they'd have accepted him if there hadn't been a murder. Mersault's main problem is that he does not move a finger to change his life. Like a pure Aristotle, filled with cold scientific detatchment, he simply observes, never interfering with a reality that has become a lifeless, bloodless, material trap. Even though he sees the lawyers playing a game with his life that could result in his death, he does nothing to stop it. We, who've seen the murder through his eyes, understand that Mersault felt treatened by the Arab and his knife. We know he did not pre-meditate the murder. Yet he murdered. He did it coldly, but not in cold blood. Yet he doesn't make a move, becomes a pawn in a pointless 'game' between the self-righteous magistrate and the less talented defender. The question that troubled me time and time again, and probably everyone else who's read the book, is why? Why not take an impassioned stand? Why not inveigh against the absurdity of reality, why not fight for life? Why be happy to be imprisoned in society's little game of good versus evil? Why would Mersault not feel sad during his mother's funeral? Mersault simply allows life to work on him, observes what he sees coldly and accurately. His observations about the foolishness of the law, the fact that even the most self-important 'doormen' in this life are still inmates, all ring true. He notices how opposites fit together, yet depend on the other for their existance; Salmano and his dog; the magistrate and the defense; good and bad. Remeber how dejected Salamano felt after his dog, the cur he'd despised, was lost...This strange, dialectic stasis holds the world together. In some way, since Mersault is neutral, he is beyond it all, yet, like all men, is caught in its web. In the end, he becomes serious about the game, and secretly hopes that his execution will be attended by a crowd of spectators, howling in execration. In effect, what I feel Camus is trying to do in the &quot;Stranger&quot; is much more involved than the reading most others here have given the book. He's giving us a symbol of the limits of rational, Aristotilean thought. Pure science has given us the bomb, turned humans into machines. It has made western man maybe a little more intelligent than the animalistic Raymond, but at the expense of depriving him of a reality deeply alive, awash in blood and emotion. Our intelligence has made us robots, unable to see the face of God in the stones that imprison us, which the preist, probably the only truly passionate and sympathetic character in the book, hopes that the listless Mersault, the most modern of men, could see."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"THE STRANGER is one of those timeless classics sure to disturb new readers well into the next millenium. Albert Camus is dealing with truth here, and truth, like life, is not for everyone. And neither is this book. I wouldn't have it any other way. Camus' pitifully honest anti-hero Meursault finds himself on the wrong end of French justice following a carefully plotted train of carelessly indifferent but seemingly innocent decisions culminating in one senseless murder that is the real mystery of the novel. Why did he do it? Who is Monsieur Meursault, really? Naturally, the reason supplied by the author is strongly provocative and certainly unsatisfactory for most if not all. The writing is terse, economic, exact. A wonder, really. Readers should note what is said just as well as what is. This book did what few books can. I was left in a state of aesthetic arrest, neither drawn to nor repulsed by story or character, a sort of neutral zone where all fear and loathing have been replaced by pure wonder--much like Meursault himself. THE STRANGER only confirms for me what I have always suspected: in the hands of a master, writing is the highest form of art. What Camus achieves in a few pages most modern authors would spend chapters doing."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Published in 1942, Camus quite poignantly defines absurdism within fiction. Camus finds a way to develop within the reader considerable sympathy for his protagonist Meursault, who happens to be a stoically indifferent, deterministic, absurdist man-slaughterer - albeit he fails to acknowledge it as such. Meursault only perceives his physical world with very little subjectivity. Even love is hardly an emotionally subjective feeling, but rather a merely physical sensation. If any person wonders over the prospect of living life in total objectivity, then he or she ought to read this book first.Not only is The Stranger well-written modern fiction, but it finely depicts the modernity of feeling in an era of existential vacuuming; a general feeling of apathy, alienation, and atheistic hope. As hard as it is for many to do justice in defining \`existentialism' or \`absurdism,' The Stranger goes far in conveying its concept to the reader, which may be done all in one enjoyable sitting."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger by Albert Camus is an interesting novel about Monsieur Meursalt, an ordinary man who goes through his mother's death, killing a man, and going to prison. I think this novel was fast-paced and easy to read, but it was not very exciting. I would not recommend reading The Stranger. I did not find it exhilerating. However, Albert Camus developed his characters very well. Overall, this book was boring, and I do not suggest reading it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The intellectual emptiness of the French spirit, a existential excuse to totally avoid self-preservation or any positive action, is adroitly depicted in this brief book of moral emptiness.The priority of normal life, from amoeba to kittens to citizens to complex societies, is to live and have control of one's life. The French have lost this innate sense of survival, and this story is an eloquent description of a young man who was once disappointed and thus forever insouciant.The focus of this novel is a character who is a stark contrast to the typical Anglo attitude of resisting state, religious and most other authority; instead, he presents a person devoid of values who simply goes limp even when facing the state authority of the guillotine.Such values nicely describe France and Camus. The French collapse in 1940 is described by the Germans as one of their &quot;weekend wars.&quot; In 1942, Camus spent a year in 'Le Panelier,' an old granite house in the village of Le Chambon, leisurely writing 'The Plague.' Like this book, it is an examination of man's willingness to allow killing without resisting it.It's the attitude of a totally defeated and demoralized people, an anthem of, by and for spineless wimps. The Napoleonic era taught the French that hundreds of millions of Europeans rejected &quot;liberation&quot; when imposed by Franch cannons and bayonets. Since then, France has only survived as an independent state because of the hated &quot;les anglais&quot; who came to their rescue in 1914 and 1944.Utterly devoid of any effort to control his own fate, Camus adroitly portrays a character who -- like France itself -- is a doormat for anyone and everyone. It's a shocking book by American standards, but it inadvertently sums up the current French attitude that it's pointless to even attempt anything that resembles affirmative effort.Read it. Think of it as a contrast between the domineering aggressive attitudes of Americans and the surrender monkeys of France. It's an interesting insight into the mind and spirit of one of America's traditional allies; is timely, relevant and cogent."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I had the same reaction to this book as one might have looking at a Worhol piece: that is to say, there is something there, though nothing of any recognizable significance to the contemporary mind.Clearly, Camus' book really struck a chord with his peers and folks of his own generation. Specifically, there is no doubt that the advent of the end of WWII had a lot of people shaking their heads in contemplation of the madness the world had just witnessed. The knowledge of mankind's willingness to apply its cutting-edge technologies to the slaughter of foes and innocents alike (Re: barbed wire, land mines, tanks, ovens, wholesale bombing of civilian populations, wolf packs, kamikazis, flame throwers, atomic weapons) was a real eye-opener.What you see in the main character (if you can call him that), Meursault, is a true sociopath... less the paranoia. That is, this man is neither proactive nor purposeful in his actions. He reacts as a leaf on a limb in the wind.I am not sure what Camus' point is. Though come to think of it, maybe the point is there is none to begin with.I still look at Worhol's work and recognize that given the right context it may have made sense to me. But until that time, I think Worhol should be left to the fascination of the intelligensia of the art world. Similarly, The Stranger probably read better in 1950. It still might be okay with a latte at Starbuck's listening to 10,000 Maniacs (or, alternatively, the Cure). But I think the masses would be better off if Southebys just auctioned the whole lot off."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"any given tuesday of mine is more exciting than the protagonist's story.

It came highly recommended and I voluntarily (and rather enthusiastically) picked it up.

In the beginning, the man's mother dies, and he doesn't show any feelings. Next, he meets a girl but won't tell her that he loves her. Later, the man kills an Arab on a beach and is put in prison. While in his trial the man is bored and is eventually sentenced to have his head cut off. While waiting for his execution, he tells the chaplain that he doesn't believe in God and never will. The book ends with him in prison, waiting hopelessly for his execution.I did not particularly like this book. It is boring to read a book when the character has no emotion. I also thought that there wasn't enough action and that the ending was pointless."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Being unnaturally obsessed with Kafka, it was assumed by my compadres that I would also like this author, and particularly this book. How wrong they were. The plot makes no sense, the characterization is meager &amp; unconvincing, and the only poetic prose occurs on the last page as our hero (ha!) languishes in prison in the final hours before he is to be executed, wondering what it all means &amp; railing at humanity for treating him like the dog he is."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is an existential story of a man living his life as a self-determing individual. He feels that nothing is truly wrong or right and therefore nothing that he does makes any difference or has any real impact except to himself. It is almost as if he is on a stage writing his life as he goes, acting it out and the rest of the universe is merely a backdrop for whatever he chooses to pursue. It is a timeless novel that tosses out morality and rationality as a means to make choices. It shows a vast emptiness, a soulessness that is overpowering in its totality. This is an amazing, insightful look at life where no matter what one does, the end will always be the same. It is interesting to note that Camus while having the belief that the universe was a cold and indifferent place, still believed in the dignity of each individual being and had a concern for their welfare. It is one of the most widely read books, but it is bleak in an eye-opening manner."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When you haven't met someone ever in real life how could you be a suspect?

The Stranger takes us through the daily life of Meursault, who is a man that lacks ambition for life and cares very little about the actions that he takes in his life. The novel starts out with Meursault receiving notice of his mother's death. His reaction to this is very out of the ordinary, because he doesn't have a reaction. He thinks that his mother's death will not change anything in his life. That scene, and the next scene in the novel lead me to believe that this man does not have any ambition and lacks self-confidence. The next scene involves Meursault shooting an Arab on the beach in which he killed for no apparent reason. Killing the Arab makes his life take a turn for the worst. He ends up going to jail and goes on trial to serve the death penalty. His lack of ambition and will to live makes this novel interesting as it takes you on a journey for the rest of his life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"if you want to discover exstitentialism or if you've ever been curious about camus, this is a good book to start off with...the story was interesting, even if the protagonist, wasn't worth my sympathy...i liked it..."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is my all time favorite book, ever! :) This racks up there with Catcher in the Rye!!

No previous crimes, no rap sheet, alright, he took a life, one life that didn't have nothing to do with him except for his friend making him do it. Let's look at this. The guy had no goals, no ambitions, no nothing. He has a girl, but it don't mean a thing to him one way or the other. Does that make him amoral??

In the first part of the book Meursault's life is explains, leading up to what happens in the second part. In the second part, Meursault is discovering himself, so to say. I found the first part of the book, although a bit bland, much more eventful than the second half of the book. The begining of the book makes Meursault (the protagonist) seem like a freak of nature, having no emotions. It develops him as a very boring person, one who lives life for the day-not the past or future. As soon as the book starts, with the line &quot;Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know,&quot; it is easy to tell that this will is a bland book. Most books start out boring because they are developing the plot. Not this book, this book continues to be boring. The second part of the book is the reason of the book. Although it is more boring, and much less happens, it is the part where Meursault begins to show human qualities (like feeling). This book shows the development of a man. Meursault went from not feeling emotions, to opening himself &quot;to the gentle indifference of the world.&quot; All in all, this was a book with a great lesson. Getting to that lesson was long and boring, but in the end it was a useful lesson to learn."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This novel is set in Algeria and focuses on Mersault, the dispassionate Frenchmen we are forced to read about. Mersault's mother dies at the opening of the novel, although it doesn't matter since Mersault doesn't care anyway. This man is the epitome of an existensialist character, caring for nothing, about nothing, even self preservation. Mersault has a girfriend who says \\"do you love me?\\" to which he responds \\"It doesn't matter but if i had to answer i'd say no.\\" He doesn't care for her, just for the physical pleasure she provides. Just the same when he is faced with the choice of whether or not to kill a man, it followed approximetly this train of thought, \\"I could walk away, but the sun is so bright, and he's sitting in the shade, maybe i should walk towards him and try to get out of the sun; oh no he pulled a knife and the sun is so bright!\\" Without further thought he shoot the man several times in cold blood, caring for nothing except that it is hot out.When Mersault is arrested, he makes no attempt to cover up his action, or to defend it in any way, even by hiring a lawyer. Mersault's lack of emotion and his brutal honesty is what finally leads to his demise. In summation, Mersault is simply an unmotivated sociopath, who if he found he enjoyed killing could have gone on a murder rampage without a thought.I despised this novel completely because of it's lack of holding power. It's obvious that the authur didn't write the novel so that the reader could \\"like\\" the protagonist, but instead to do a study of society, and how society reacts to someone so different. Even so, how can the author expect the reader to care for a character who doesn't care for himself or anyone else, even enough to get to the end of the novel?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"To be put on trial for killing a man and then tried for a lack of emotion makes for a rather interesting day. The main character, Meursault, in Albert Camus's novel,_The Stranger_, experiences this after attending his mother's funeral in Marengo. He is sent to jail and then put on trial for the murder of a Arab man while at a beach. The novel consists of 154 pages divided into two parts, each part consisting of a number of chapters. This drama is directed toward a wide range of readers, as it is fairly short in length and not a difficult reading. The criminal drama formula is skewed by Camus, creating an addicting read. One becomes sucked into reading the intense novel in one sitting. Albert Camus's The Stranger, effectively and efficiently achieves this goal of enlightening the reader with a unique take on issues.While on trial the matter being discussed shifts from Meursault's killing of an Arab to questioning of his lack of sorrow and remorse for, both, his action of shooting a stranger and his reaction to his mother's death. He is then labeled a threat to society and sentenced to death. The philosophy then comes out of Meursault the night prior to his date of execution. With some help from the Chaplain, who continues to push Meursault to believe in God, Meursault comes to a final conclusion that humans are born to die. \\"From the dark horizon of my future a sort of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long. . .\\"(152). For Meursault, death is freedom and new found happiness. There is no reason for sorrow over ones death. \\"No one, no one in the world had any right to weep for her\\"(154).Camus places the character of Meursault in Algiers, where \\"The sun was scorching hot\\"(31). References to the heat and the sun, such as this, are mentioned repeatedly. Camus's elaborate descriptions of the surroundings in conjunction with concise character descriptions formulates the unique style of the novel. Madame Meursault has died and her son comes to her funeral. There he stays with her in her coffin through the night. The others staying at the Home joined him for the night. He \\"had an absurd impression that they had come to sit in judgment\\"(11). Unaware that soon he will be sitting in judgment in a courthouse. After the funeral he used his extra day off from work to see meet with a former coworker named Marie. He and Marie swim in the pool and go to a comedy later that night, where he \\"kissed her, but rather clumsily\\"(24). Two days later, Meursault returns to work and later that evening talks with a neighbor named Raymond Sintes, a known pimp. Raymond is having a dispute with his mistress and Meusault agrees to help get rid of her by writing her a letter. The next night the police come to the apartment complex and break up a fight between Raymond and his mistress. A few days later Marie, Meursault, and Raymond are invited to their friend Masson's beach house. It is here where Raymond and two Arabs, one the brother of his mistress, begin to fight and Meursault shoots one of them. He is sent to jail, put on trial, where his charge is changed from murder to lack of grievances, and is then given the death sentence. It is now that he finds the meaninglessness of sorrow. As stated preciously, \\"From the dark horizon of my future. . .\\"(152). The story comes to an end with Meursault hoping \\"that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration\\"(154). Death is a new freedom for him and his mother. They are able to be happy once again.Albert Camus's The Stranger, effectively and efficiently achieves this goal of enlightening the reader with a unique take on issues. The book will force to reader to stay on his toes, especially with the plots twists towards the end of the novel. I feel that if I had to pick one book to write a song(*) about, it would have to be this book.* The Cure: Killing an Arab"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger by Albert Camus was an extremely montonous book. I did not like Camus's view of life in general. This novel is an existential novel. Therefore, Camus wrote this novel from some exerience and about his views on life. In the novel Meursault is a very laid back person. His views on life are very simple. He does not think that humans have any reason here on earth, and does not see the point in even making an effort to connect with people, believe in something that he came see or touch, or even mourn about his mother's death. Meursault felt that it was all irrelevent in his life. I was not expecting what happened at the end of the book. I did not like this book to start out with, and I thought I had the whole novel figured out when I came to the climax of the story. Camus suprised me though, and I do admire him for his writing style: the simplicity of the text. It was different and like no novel I had read. Even though I did not thoroughly enjoy this book, I do reccomend it to everyone, because I think everyone should experience Camus's writing style and his view on life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book was about a man who has a very negatvie out look on life. It starts out with Meursault attending his mother's funeral. His demeanor at the funeral concerns many of his mothers friends and later on in the book it comes back to haunt him. The day after Meursualt's mother's funeral the two go out for a fun day at the pool and movies. This also contributes to his downfall. Many events in this novel happen but necessarily dont need to. Most of the trouble in the book was brought on by Meursault. The people he asscociates himself with and the influence they have on him make this man more and more corrupt. Raymond, his neighbor, is the biggest person involved with his trouble. He gets Meausault into business he didnt even need to know. And when he attends a beach house with Raymond he does something he will regret, he kills a man. This one event destroys the life of Meursault and any hope he would have. He is condemned to die and spends endless nights in prison thinking of life outside the bars. I feel sorry for Meursault for the life he has lived even though he brought most of it on himself. This book was alright to read and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read suspensful and ironic books."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is THE favorite book of mine! Read it, and re-read it many times! Some translations didn't make, the first few sentences for me. I like old version&quot;...Mother died today. Ot it was yesterday...&quot;. Not &quot;...Mammon died etc...&quot; Nevertheless, older translation pictured disfuctional young Meursault in more familiar light. There He is standing, eating (eggs, without bread) out of skillet over the sink. Lighting up the cigarette. Standing on the balcony, watching people walk by. Nothing else to do.Simlar work as Dostoyevski's &quot;Crimes...&quot; but it doesn'r colapse on the end like &quot;Crimes&quot;. They do not write books like this anymore."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I studied this book in my 12th grade English class and it was certainly interesting. I think all of us found it challenging to imagine a life so detached from emotion but there is no denying the interesting characteristics of this book and I highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The book begins with the death and funeral of Monsieur Mersault's mother. The man is not really affected by the death and goes on living life as he did while she was still living. The weekend after the funeral Mersault ran into a lady who used to work at his office and they went swimming together. Mersault and Marie ended up going to a movie and spending a lot of time together. Raymond invited Mersault up to his room to talk and have dinner. That night, M. Mersault ended up writing a letter to Raymond's old girlfriend who had cheated on him. Her brother, an Arab, had been following Raymond and watching everything he did. One day, Raymond, Mersault and Marie went to one of Raymond's friends' bungalow on the beach. The Arab and two of his friends followed them there. The three men went for a walk and ran into the Arabs. They had a fight and Raymond left with a cut lip and arm. Later on that same day, Mersault decided to go out for another walk. He ran into the Arab man once more. This time, however, Mersault used the revolver that Raymond had given him for the earlier fight and shot the man five times. He was arrested and taken to jail. M. Mersault told his lawyer that he would not lie to the court and he never showed remorse for what he had done. Eleven months later, the judge sentenced him to death. The chaplain tried to talk him about God, but the man decided that there was no point to life and he didn't believe in God anyways. He knew that he lived his life for his afterlife and waited for the day of his execution to come.I thought this book was good. It would not have been my first choice to read, but it came out alright in the end."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In \\"The Stranger\\", Albert Camus weaves a simple tale of the outright, inhumane, mechanistic, systemic conviction of a man who fitting certain seemingly unfit, merciless criteria for someone suffering from dementia and disorder, is given the death penalty. Based on trivial, superficial quota's this young man who was suckered into a conflict with his neighbor pimp over his former girlfriend and her Arab relatives and who eventually in an instance of a few brief seconds has his whole life condemned due to a series of common-day, hectic evolving happenstances.Was it calculated rage and execution at the world that left him feeling remorseless and seeking comfort of his own actions, irrational exuberance exploited by an older superficial role model, or confused, panicky nurture and nature created automatic, uncontrollable reaction and response?Through a simple, sad tale of events Camus shows how the individual and his motives, dreams, goals, and hopes can be trivialized and brushed aside by the greater biased, parochial, viewpoint of society.Relevant to modern day school shootings and the disillusionment hippies and others felt in the 60s and \\"slackers\\" felt in the 90s."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"One could translate the original title of this book also as foreigner, which I think describes more or less all of us at one point or another in life. The language Camus uses in this book is simple, yet the book is only as simple as life...! I think often readers want to be able to completely identify or completely not-identify with the main character. Anything in-between is harder to deal with; this book is all the things in-between. It is a great book that I could recommend to those who in general like Sartre and Kafka."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"While I loved the book and its concepts, it left me feeling rather depressed about the characters. It was written well and really got the author's philisophical views across, developing characters well."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read this novel twice. The power of this fiction is the character keeps heading toward disaster and you want to pull him back to a safe path but you cannot. And that is quite frustrating. That is what makes for great fiction--something that upends the emotions. The novel is set in Camus's native Algeria. He is better know as one of the founder's of the existentialism philosophy which I cannot understand and, consequently, cannot explain. I also read halfway through Camu's autobiographical novel &quot;The First Man&quot; and readl all of his world war II &quot;Troubled Sleep&quot;."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"For a while in this book it appears that the Mr. Meursault is living a normal life with a girlfriend, a few friends, and everything else included in most people's daily life. When his friend asks him to get involved in a plot to get back at a girl that dumped him, his life takes a drastic turn. This is the only real part of the story that at all caught my attention. Up until this point, I had really struggled through the book. As the book goes on, Mr. Meursault is jailed for a crime and sentenced to death. This is the turning point in the book. Throughout the book, he tries to understand why people attempt to begin new lives. After his mother dies, Mr. Meursault learns she had become very close to one of the men in the nursing home where she was living. He also learns that the two had been in love and were supposedly engaged. He doesn't understand why anyone who is close to death would become involved in that way with another human being. At the end of the book, when he is in his jail cell, he discovers that just because you near the end of your life, it does not mean that you are dead yet and that you should approach everything as if you will live forever. Throughout the book, he argued with people about the existence of a God. When the chaplain comes to talk with him, he yells at him. The two argue about what God is and he goes off on the chaplain yelling that he believes there is no after life, so there is no need for God in his life. When the chaplain leaves Mr. Meursault is left to think about what he has said and done. He began to understand why his mother began a new life. Even as life dies, in a way it begins again.From the first page, you are stunned at what is said by Mr. Meursault. His actions confuse you and you stumble over the words, reading them over again and again. This is a book that can be read on many different levels. On one hand, if you enjoy really reading a book, reading between the lines, then this is a very good book for you. If you are able to comprehend what the man is saying, you see a picture of what life really is; a strange twisted world in which an innocent man is taken, put in strange situations and then made a victim of. If you are a kid just trying to pick a short book to read for a report, you may want to look somewhere else. This book is one that must be read several times over to fully understand what is being said and what is happening. I can honestly say that this is the most, bizarre, twisted, and in a way, frightening books I have ever read. Maybe that's why it's a classic."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I first picked up the novel as a piece of school equipment I thougth that it would be completely boring, yet when i got home i started to read it and began realising that this was an original masterpiece. The first line,&quot;Mother died today&quot; instinctivally shows the abnormalities that this charachter &quot;Meursault&quot; matches up to. Then immediately i realsied the isolation and alienation that he was suffering. This novel is a must read, basically because it has issues and values that would never cross ones mind until they are in a situation where they are alone and are being judged immoraly. This novel is fantastic, it offers analyzers with a bowl of chocolate with a cherry on top, and book worms who just love to read opinionative writing, a chance to understand existentialism. It is obvious that Camus was involved in existentialism, and maybe the book was all symbollically referring to Camus life and beliefs.Indications are easily brought to the readers attention if they are ready to explore an alientated mind.Overall it was great, i loved it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I was looking forward to reading \\"The Stranger\\" due to its interesting premise, and upon finishing it, I am not quite sure exactly what I have read. \\"The Stranger\\" is a disturbing look into a seemingly immoral man's life, who commits an inexplicable murder, and is nonchalant in regards to his future. It is an exploration of the questions that plague men's souls about their very existence.We are immediately introduced to our narrator, Meursault, an Algerian Frenchman, as he relates the news of his mother's death. Instead of being overcome with emotion, Meursault reacts to his mother's passing with little more than mere annoyance. He then returns to his job and takes up with a young women he has admired for some time. She becomes besotted with him, but he could care less whether he marries her or not. For no good reason, other than wanting someone to talk to, he befriends the building's pimp and helps him fight off the men who stalk him. In one moment of blinding thoughtlessness, Meursault commits an unthinkable murder. He is arrested, and the rest of the book is devoted to his time in jail and his trial.Although Meursault is the narrator, I feel that we never get to know him. He wanders aimlessly through life, questioning much and gaining few answers. His observations about life in jail, and his questions about what happens after death are thoughtprovoking, but reveal little as to the true nature of his mind. Camus is a gifted writer who explores the darkest realms of the human mind, but fails to come up with any explanation to justify his narrator's motives. In the end, we want something more than questions - even if the answers aren't known."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus' _The Stranger_ does illustrate what existentialism in practice is. As the protagonist, Muersault is faced with what most would consider major life events: the death of his mother, the prospect of a job relocation to Paris, a woman asking him to marry her, murder and a trial he responds with a nonchalance that is disturbing, accepting the actions as part of life, and with the realization that there is very little he can do about them. Yet the novella is also an exploration of the absurd, as Muersault's nonplussed reactions prompt absurd reactions from those around him. Indeed, Muersault's choice to exist - to not attempt to influence or change any of the situations he finds himself in - is absurd.The book is both frustrating and insightful and was a worthwhile read. It gives a much clearer understanding of existentialism than any essay of Sartre's, with an almost sarcastic undertone provided by the sheer absurdity of the plot."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The last time I read this book was in undergraduate school--too young at age 17 (I was a univeristy student of English Literature.). At the time, it made very little sense to me; I simply did not have the necessary life experience to appreciate it. I think I understood, on some level, that Nothing/Death/Emptiness/the possibility of Fate was the basic gist of it all, but now I see a whole lot more here.Now I think that Albert Camus' THE STRANGER is a book more about anonymity, destiny and the absurdity of human life. (Scary)Now I do understand. (I think.) I fancy myself an Existentialist, but this is difficult reading despite the straight-forward langage, plot and character-development.I do recommend this book, but probably to people in atleast their late teens--someone who is not afraid to think about the nothingness that may lie beyond death.I will not be reading this book again. It reminds me too much THE UNDERGROUND MAN (DISTURBING AND ALL ALONE!)"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I have read many of the 284 reviews written before mine, and feel it is important that readers understand what it is that they are reading.First, and foremost, Camus is an existentialist. As the Encyclopdia Britannica states &quot;...Existentialism does not leave man with nothing to do. Once the nullity of the existential possibilities is recognized, man cannot but resign himself to Being, which, in one of its new manifestations in the world or beyond it, conducts him to a new epoch.&quot; Thus in its most basic form existentialism is an investigation into Being--how one lives--how one should live.Second, &quot;The Stranger&quot; is not written as Camus sees life, but rather as a critique against his contemporaries, e.g Jean-Paul Sartre, many of whom see life as absurd or pointless. Do not mistake Meursault's unemotional amoral living as the &quot;Being&quot; of Camus. Why would Camus argue for such an absurdity when he argues against suicide in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;? (Sisyphus living perhaps the most absurd of all existences.)Third, and final, Matthew Ward's translation is superb. Do not be misled by other reviewers that have perhaps not compared translations side by side--Mr. Ward's translation is true to the style of the original--a TRANSLATION rather than a TRANSLITERATION.In conclusion, if one approaches this translation of &quot;The Stranger&quot; with an understanding of existentialism, Camus, and the translation, I believe a full appreciation for this philosophical masterpiece will be gained."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I see why this book gets assigned to high school and college kids. Our relatively fancy sapien brain lets us imagine a perfect world of meaning, purpose, and coherence, but young adult life smacks us up against the real world and our own rational, emotional and social limitations. So we get these thoughtful under 40 (Camus was 33 when this was published) writers who often explore a similar set possible reactions: suicide, rejection of an 'absurd' world, black pessimism.Nonetheless, of all of the examples of this sort of book or story I've read, Camus has written the most puzzling, thought-provoking piece. Read it. Watch your reactions to Meursault in part one, and then in part two, consider if and why they change. Consider if his reasons for what he does or does not do are not in fact similar to ones you've had, even if you do not think yourself so disassociated as he. Consider if his punishment was really so unjust, given his crime and its motivation. Does it matter that the jury's motives were irrelevant? Why? Were they really?I am not suggesting particular answers, these are the questions that bug me at the moment, having read it. And I LIKE books that leave me thinking long after, thus he gets 4 stars even from somebody who mostly prefers books that do not end hopelessly.And gee, what would he have written if he had lived longer than 47 years?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The alarm clock is going off, its six in the morning. Im trying to think of a good reason to lift my head from this pillow. Is there some reason I need to get up. I know there is a reason. I know that even if in the final out come my live is not valuable to anyone but myself, then it was valuable. My life is valuable to me. I enjoy life. This is something that took Meursault, the main character in Albert Camuss The Stranger, a lifetime to understand. Meursault was a simple man. A man of few words and few emotions. He lived off his senses. He cared for no one, because to him no one was worth caring for. Life to him was meaningless. Life was not precious to him. Meursault as a character went through many changes throughout the novel. He started as an insensitive person. One whom didnt even cry at his own mothers funeral. He was indifferent to the world. Then he was faced with the prospect of his own death, he finally understood why life was worth living. He realized that one day of memories can be enough to make a man dream for a lifetime. Meursault realized there is nothing after death. The life you lead is the only time you have. It is given to you and you make the best of it. Not because you have to but because you want to. You should do it because it makes you want to wake up and start another adventurous day. The Stranger is a novel that makes you think about your life. It makes you want to reexamine each day you live, to make sure you are living them to their fullest. That is how I want to live my life. I want to find out what the world can offer me. I want to know what is out there. I want to explore life. Is that how you want to live yours?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"It has been perhaps three years since I've read The Stranger, but the book left an indelible impression on me. The reason, I think, is that this under appreciated work addresses the most profound question of our times: the question of the narcisisstic and anti-social personality disorders and their challenge to civilization. Beyond a doubt this was the question Camus was addressing here, and he was doing so long before these issues were in the forefront of psychological thought.In his seemingly casual anticipation of the significance of these conditions and his realistic interpretation of their banal nature lies the work's misleadingly prosaic quality; yet under that seemingly tepid surface lies the horror of the human spirit disconnected from love.This, along with the crystal clear prose that always characterized Camus, resulted in an understated novel that is a triumph of Western Literature.Whatever our interpretation of the origins of these mental conditions, or our understanding of their meanings - whether it is the result of overpopulation, or of individualism vs. the collective good, or of simple genetics, or of some other factor - there is no doubt that this is the great question of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. From Hitler to Ghandi, from spirituality to science, from plutocracy to democracy, from frugality to materialism: human nature itself is the catalyist and human nature comes down to the individual.Within this mystery of the individual, as much as that of society itself, lies the origin of the two world wars and all of the subsequent strife of the hyper-material age. We are trapped in a duality between survival and connection, between selfishness and transcendence, between life and death.That \\"The Stranger\\" can be completely unmoved at his own mother's funeral, that he can exist isolated from any emotional connection and that he can eventually be led to murder without any more effort than a child is led to candy is the profound message of this novel. It is a condemnation of our increasing isolation from one another, from community, and from spirituality. It is a clarion call alerting us that an idividualistic, impersonal, hyper-technical society not only produces these people, but perhaps even encourages them, and at times elevates them to positions of great power.With the second world war in clear hindsight it was this towering quandry that clearly obsorbed Camus in this work, and there is no more important question for a current reader to engage.And so, seen in it's proper light, \\"the Stranger\\" is a riveting story of lovelessness, alienation, spiritual meaninglessness, and of the inability of the individual to even understand what they are missing - the kind of existence that resulted in a Nazi Germany or a Soviet Russia, and of it's consequences. We must not allow our distance from this work in space and time to obscure the fact that it is still the central question of today. That was the gift camus gave to us in The Stranger, and we should accept it with gratitude."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"First and foremost, I probably don't have to write about what a famous and influential book this is since, odds are, if you're looking at this book (and my review) you are already somewhat familiar with that fact.That being said, I found this book rather dull from a literary standpoint. It's quintessential existentialism and Camus at his finest. There is no overarching, plot driving feature to this book. However, it does focus on the protagonist's struggle to find meaning and purpose as he goes through the French judicial system after committing murder. As a philosophy major, it appears to me that \\"The Stranger\\" has more philosophic value than literary or entertainment value.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to broaden their knowledge of 20th century philosophy, continental philosophy, or existentialism.........or Hemingway lovers."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I have never studied (or even once read about) existentialism and I read this book purely for pleasure. Without being in search of existentialist thought, like many frustrated students who gave this book a bad review may have been, I found it to be immensely well-written and simply a perfect little novel. Camus used fantastic sentence composition disguised by Meursault's (or perhaps translator Matthew Ward's) drollery while the simplicity of the events hid the absurdity of the story. I now consider the book a necessity of my own literary knowledge, especially being such a pleasantly quick read."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read with amusement the reviews of this novella. One fellow was uncomfortable with this story and gave it 4 stars though he said he hated it. I believe Camus would be pleased. Others said the story stayed with them long after finishing the book. Exactly. This is philosophy--not a murder mystery. The sheer economy of Camus' writing, the short, clipped sentence structure, and simple reliance on creating a setting to present a story reminded me of of a mythical cross between Hemingway and Poe. This story is not meant to be uplifting. It is been meant to make one consider the purpose of existence (existentialism). As for those who believe Camus was pessimistic about the purpose of human existence, read \\"The Plague\\". Read \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\". Camus loved life and provides us all with a way to examine our purpose in a very simple and pure way."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I should make it clear that I did not read the \\"americanized\\" new translation, but rather the orginal english translation that comes off as more formal. I must say i'm rather interested in reading the other translation now, to see if the same atompshere is retained using less formal and language that may not appear as detached.Some how in school they skipped having us read this book sadly, as I feel that young people in particular would benefit from understanding the world of absurdity that the character of Meursault finds himself unwittingly engaged in. In a world where stories like \\"Fight Club\\" are popular among young men, many a young man of that strain would find it very rewarding to spend sometime understanding Camus's world of Meursault, a character who's alienation in society is unavoidable, as he is just being himself. I felt connected in a way to the character who is constantly dealing with an irrational society, but that can never completely deal with him.The book reads very quickly and smoothly. The story while very based in the mind of the character, never lets itself get over indulgent in detail, or when demonstrating its points it never comprises the flow of the story.It will be a certain recommendation to others from myself from now on for sure."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus's much talked about opus was written in 1946 but is a story that defies the common restraints of datedness that hamper so many long-in-the-tooth novels from some of our greatest authors. The story centers around a profoundly dissafected man living a quiet life in Algiers until one day he commits a pointless murder and the story reaches its climax after his trial. Camus's prose is minimal and distant. There is a palpable coldness that runs throughout. Slowly the story and its alienated, emotionally blank narrator work their way deep beaneath your skin and the result is remarkably effective, chilling and unforgettable. The Stranger is a timeless story of lonliness and disaffection and still rings true, perhaps even truer, today. A treasure. An absolute must. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The idea of isolation from society is one that Albert Camus truly made his own throughout his distinguished career, particularly in this novel 'The Stranger'. It is difficult to describe the full depth of a Camus character but it must at least be attempted.What is distinctive of his characters' isolation, including that of Meursault, is that it is always a volountary isolation. The character is not isolated because he has been rejected by society but because he has nothing but contempt for that which surrounds him. Meursault dislikes much of what surrounds him but this is not to say that he is some sort of loner. It is testament to Camus' ability as a writer that the reader is drawn to, rather than repelled by such a character.Meursault is essentially a man who refuses to play the game and refuses to do what society dictates. He pays a heavy price for his refusal to adhere to social conventions, however there are no heroic pretentions in what Meursault does. This character is very representative of Camus' writing and perhaps even of Camus himself and the depiction of his attitudes, actions and existence makes a fascinating and fantastic novel."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"To say that this is an existential work proves that you are an intellectual half-wit and know nothing of the life of Camus or his work. This is largely biographical, until the point of the arab murder, and follows Camus's own personal conflicts with class, familial relationships, ethnic relations, and illness. This should not be read with out first at least skimming THE REBEL. That will give some insight into one of the most under appreciated intellectuals heros of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"\\"The stranger(L'etranger)\\" is a story of someonenamed, \\"Meursault\\", but at the same time of ourselves. I firstfelt him strange, then gradually familiar with myself. This isperhaps because he is not a real \\"stranger.\\"When Meursault's mother dies, his reactions are not whatother people expect from him, such as mourning or at leastweeping in front of the dead. However, he is too tired tosatisfy those expectations and smokes a cigarette,instead.After that he meets his girlfriend, has sex with her, goes tothe beach and kills a guy due to the burning sun who is tryingto attack his companion. That's all. There isn't any evilintention or hostile motive in his attitude.From my point of view, the most remarkable part of this bookis when Meursault looks at the sky and the moon through thesmall hole in ceiling of the prison. According to him, he feelsthe repletion full of happiness that he could never havebefore, recollecting all the memories from the past. For theshort moment, he is freed from everything and everyone andbecomes the perfect sole. I would call this, the \\"Perfectfreedom.\\"A man made up of apathy,indifference, and selfishness isMeursault. He is not interested in anything related to othersand doesn't try to turn their attention to him. That's why Icannot hate him but synpathise with him. He is not a cruelmurderer,undutiful son,unfaithful lover or liar. All we need toknow about him while reading this book is to understand him asthe way he is. And then look at ourselves. There is not muchdifference between him and us. He is our reflection andrepresentative of what we cannot easily express ouside. I wouldrather be a \\"Meursault\\" than the judge or the jury. Theword, \\"Stranger\\" leads to the feeling of some rejection. Peopleusually call something strange if it is different or unfamiliarwith them. However, from the person's point of view they allare the \\"Strangers.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"meursault is not detacted from reality, but rather, he lives life through nature which is not subject to manipulation;i.e. religion, relationships.this is shown at the time of the death of the arab. meursault does not intend to murder the arab, he is acting in self-defence. camus's choice of words here discribes nature as being violent so meursalt reacts to this by defending himself. the arab just happens to be there. meursault is immediately aware that his life has just changed, therefore \\" it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness\\".this shows that meursault is attached to reality. he was, and will be again, happy and in love with life.this said, i do not believe the stranger is a book written to be explained."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger starts out with the main character, Monsiuer Meursault finding out that his mother had died. Meursault was a low income hard worker who could not support his mother at home, so he sent her to an old peoples home in the country. This was the first of his so-called sins used against him later. At first it would seem as though Meursault wasn't sorrowful of his mothers passing, but Meursaults main foible was that of his taciturn nature and unwillingness to show emotion. Later in the story he commits murder in a vehement moment of rage. All of a sudden he is thrown in to a trial with a magistrate. All of Meursaults little mistakes are brought to the attention of the jury, including the fact of his unresponsiveness to a priest and religion as a whole.This author did a great job writing this book and showing how society can tear a person apart using small insignificant mistakes. The author throughout the book shows exactly what Meursault is thinking plus his views on certain matters. The author also points out the flaws of religion and how God is not for everyone and should not be pushed upon by someone. I picked up this book not knowing what it was and enjoyed how Camus could fit all this into a book that is less than 140 pages. It was a quick easy to read story. It was insightfully written and give credit to Matthew Ward for translating it into English so well."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I took upon myself to read L'etranger(that's French for those in the unaware) after seeing the glowing recommendations of others on Amazon and countless people listing it prominently in their Listmania lists. I had read similar books containing a highly disenchanted and disjointed protagonist such as A Clockwork Orange and Fight Club(both excellent works). However, The Stranger, albeit a short work, adds more fuel to the fire of disillusionment in the person of the enigmatic and mysterious Meursault. Camus galvanizes this novella noir with his uncanny use of existentialism to bring attention to the smells, sights, and sounds of the beach and the countryside and Meursault's oneness with nature and conversely his nothingness with God.The Stranger proves incredibly unconventional and simple, yet paradoxically complex and compelling. There are times when I wanted to shake the catatonic Meursault and shout, \\"Wake up!!\\" It seems as if he's almost stoically sleepwalking through life and his highly questionable decisions. He proves totally devoid of conscience and emotion - enigmatic and remorseless to the end. Worth a read - unlike any other work of fiction you will ever read."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"\\"The Stranger\\" is a pleasant breeze in literature but an endless moral debate..Whatever the conclusion might be, I've never read a book so simple, so smooth, so easy to read and yet so surprisingly difficult to dissect. The social, philosophical, psychological and moral questions posed are disturbing and nothing short of brilliance. I'm sure there have been books reviewing \\"The Stranger\\". But each of us can still see it differently through our own lenses! Enjoy (even if it is just an English translation!..)"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I first read this novel I found that the plot of the story was less interesting, and less important than the personal philosophy of the main character, Meursault. Meursault has an indifferent approach to life, he does not believe in sustaining relationships, he indulges in the pleasures of relationships, only when it is convenient for him. One could define it as &quot;carpe diem&quot; but it seems not to be completely accurate with Meursault. Anyway, the plot should not have been the vessel for the man's personal philosophy, that is my only qualm with this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Reading The Stranger gives you the chance to see the world through the eyes of Meursault, a young, attractive, successful man who expresses NO emotions or conscience whatsoever... At his mother's funeral he hardly indicates that he is in mourning other than by wearing a black armband. When his girlfriend asks him to marry her, he says yes, but not because he loves her-- He agrees to marry her because he feels that he might as well, since it will not make a difference in his life anyway. When he receives a lucrative job offer in Paris, he turns it down, explaining to his boss, \\"one life is as good as another\\". While Meursault is pointing a gun at an man, his thoughts are \\"to shoot or not shoot\\". Just as he makes all his other decisions, with indifference, he shoots and kills the man... and I won't tell you the rest. Albert Camus was the first person to publish a book written in a certain form French past tense, so as to give it a more active, flowing feel. It has been said that The Stranger is one of the masterpieces of the 20th Century... so find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger changed my worldview (Weltschauen?) by changing me.If you'd care to analyze Mersault with me for a second, you'll notice that one of his main characteristics is that he doesn't care what other people think of him. His thoughts and actions are not dictated by the reactions it may elicit from those around him. Also, he is completely honest with himself and doesn't delude himself into thinking that he feels emotions which are actually not forthcoming. For example he doesn't either mourn or pretend to mourn at his mother's funeral. It may make other people think of him as a cold, uncaring person, but as far as he's concerned, at least in my opinion, she died when they stopped seeing each other.What Mersault does care about is experiencing the simple pleasures in life, and, in the process, fulfills whatever mundane obligations are necessary to for him to survive in either a civilized bourgeouis society or a jail. In other words, if you let him live life as he sees fit, he won't cause any trouble and will even help you when he feels it is necessary to do so. When unavoidable constraints are placed upon him, such as not being able to smoke in jail, he acclimates himself to the constraints and goes on experiencing whatever simple pleasures are possible in a jail cell. However, if cause him trouble for no reason or try to convert him to your way of living or thinking, he'll defend himself and take the offensive when the opportunity arises. Mersault does what he wants. If you deliberately try to get in his way, watch out.What I'm trying to say here is that Mersault was as free as any human could possibly be. He viewed the world something he could enjoy living in no matter what conditions he was living under. If other people didn't like him for it, so what. Life was made to be enjoyed, not worried or mourned over.So, in conclusion, I guess it changed my world view by giving me a philosophy of how to live my life in it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Find a couple hours in your busy life to read this book--yes, everyone. In this very existential story, the Stranger, Camus shines a bright floodlight into the soul of modern man. Told in the first person by the Stranger awaiting death by the State's guillotine, it is obvious by the very telling of the story that the man was never so put to death. It is also obvious that the Stranger was totally indifferent to whether he was or was not put to death.The death of the Stranger's mother sounds the breakfast bell for his own demise. Later at the beach murder scene the Stranger undergoes a Paul-on-the-Road-to-Damascus-like enlightenment. The Stranger describes this event very poetically. He sees a shaft of light shoot upward from the steel blade of the Arab's knife. He sees \\"Cymbals of the sun clashing on my skull and ... the keen blade of light flashing up from the knife, scarring my eyelashes and gouging into my eyeballs.\\" Next, \\"the sky cracked in two, from end to end, and a great sheet of flame poured down through the rift.\\" Had the reader seen what the Stranger saw he too may have emptied the pistol bullets into the poor Arab. \\"And each successive shot was another loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing.\\" Beginning with the murder he was \\"through with the unreal years of my life.\\"The Priest visits the cell and forces his trite message upon the prisoner. The Father asks, \\"how do you picture life after death?\\" The Stranger wants very little. He answers, \\"A life in which I can remember this life on earth. That's all I want of it.\\" The prisoner's certainty of death was totally sufficient, it was something he could get his teeth into and that was far better than a brittle, fragile belief in God. The torture of waiting for his own death emptied him of hope, thus allowing him to lay \\"his heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.\\" Thus sharing, so brotherly, his fate with the universe made him realize that \\"I'd been happy, and that I was happy still.\\" In death the prisoner would attain public recognition of his indifferent life. \\"All that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Mersault is a &quot;stranger,&quot; identifid as a person who does not feel remorse for anything: He does not cry at his mother's funeral, kills a man, and even shows apathy toward his own death. The most fascinating part, to me, is the ending where Camus provides a question of &quot;human justice.&quot; It is individuals who give meaning to what they believe is important. Yet the society labels what is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong,&quot; which is often difficult for some people to accept. The society and its human justice sometimes is what makes the world absurd. However, we shall never function as a country, as a group, if there were no rules for us to follow.If you find this book difficult to understand, I would recommend that you read The Myth of Sisyphus or A Happy Death. As you continue to read Camus's work, you shall come to understand his quesions, the questions toward absurd societies, the questions to which Camus struggled to find answers yet did not find satisfactory ones.Albert Camus is one of my favorite writers."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is a danger to read. I found myself depressed and uncaring throughout the piece. The Stranger is about a Frenchman, Muersault, and his life. The book takes place with Muersault finding out that his mother had died, creating a feeling of pity for the character, only to find out later that he doesn't even care. At his on mother's funeral, Muersault shows no feeling, he just sits and waits for things to end so he can go back to his life. This is the case from beginning to end. Muersault tortures his girlfriend mentally by telling her he doesn't love her but marriage makes no difference one way or the other, he watches everyday as a heartless man relentlessly beats and curses his dog, he gives his friend reason to think physical abuse on a woman is okay, and he eventually commits murder. At the end of the book Muersault is tried and rightfully put on death row.When I read this book, my feelings did not change at any point. I respect the author and his style but Muersault is not the type of character I prefer to read about. He is overwhelmingly uncaring and not to mention boorrrriinnggg! I do believe there is something good to come out of everything though and what I pulled out of this book is a new appreciation for my own life. I'm much more exciting.In conclusion, the book is obviously a classic and well known novel but just not for me. Camus is not the most uplifting person in this book; on the other hand, life is not always like the Disney channel. I only hope I don't develop some sort of mental illness now, after reading about the dark side of life.Jimbo Martin10th gradeLHS"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I am not a philosopher, quite honestly I stumbled into the world of self studied existensialism as I was finishing college where I specialized in Social Psychology. A professor saw me reading Sartre's 'No Exit' and recommended it to me. A year later I read The Stranger.The Stranger is the manifesto of complete alienation and the absurdity of feeling and emotion in human life. These are important ideas to grasp as you read existensialism, absurdity, Zen Buddhism or Philosophical Marxism. Merely saying the word 'alienation' is one thing. This small 120+ page book so thoroughly, poetically and sadly draws the reader first person into the existence of someone completely alienated from the world that you experience it.I understand the low reviews from some people. The annihilation of emotion is not one easily grasped or comfortably dealt with, and it is one many people will hopefully never fall into, yet it is one that is needed to be understood by many to come to grips with the absurdity that grasps many of our everyday experiences.A major lesson from Sartre's drama 'No Exit' is the lesson of the powerful impact of other people's judgements on the shaping of who we are, and that a form of Hell is the inability to escape each others judgements. 'No Exit' loses some impact in that as a drama it is entirely expressed in the third person. The power of 'The Stranger' is that the reader is immeresed as a participant. Page by page you become an actor, a witness, the only mirror to Meursault's world of nihilism. The reader creates and is immerssed at once in Meursault's Hell.This book is eloquent, beautiful and the power of it is that you as the reader have to supply the emotion to the story. It's your ever growing awakening of sadness and shame to the human condition that will change you forever while reading it.On a lighter note it is also the inspiration for the song 'Killing an Arab' by The Cure."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Being allergic to books that are considered classics, I did not see what all the fuss surrounding the book was about. I just thought, huh? That really was the first thing that wandered through my confused brain after finishing this book.Who is this guy, marseult, anyways? At first appearance, he seems like a robot. then I think, maybe he has mental issues. maybe he had a traumatic childhood. His mom dies, and he doesn't care. his girlfriend has to actually ask him to marry her instead of the other way around. she asks, \\"do you love me?\\" and he replies, \\"maybe, i don't know\\" And then he shoots someone for basically no reason at all and feels no remorse for it. That didn't sound like a person to me. I mean, we all have our moments of weird random emotions (remember the time you couldn't stop yourself from smiling when you were in the principal's office and in deep trouble?) but this was just over the top. The back of the book says that it's about a man \\"caught in the situation of the absurd\\", but any normal man would have avoided the whole situation right off the bat. I say its a absurd person caught in a quicksand situation of his own doing.Many people have said that this Marseult was an existentialist, but I say that's no excuse. I consider myself to be an absurdist with a touch of existentialism, but that's no reason for me to not feel. In fact, I don't consider him to be a existentialist at all, because that's not the reason he doesn't have emotions. I seriously think he has mental problems, not just a different view in life.However, considering the fact that since so many people have written glowing reviews that must be some deeper meaning here that my befuddled mind could not grasp, I feel that the reason for the \\"huh?\\" is me, not the book.But, just to stand out, agonize everyone, and generally make a nuisance out of myself, I have decided to give this book two stars. Yes, there is the thing about standing up for your views, but I consider that a side dish that distracts from my main goals : to stand for all the people out there who don't understand Literature with a capital L, who sit in silence and scratch their head until one thought enters their mind: huh?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"+++++(This review is for the paperback \\"The Stranger,\\" translated by Matthew Ward, and published by Vintage in 1989.)This particular book has four major sections:(1) Introduction (15 pages). It is excellent and I highly recommend reading it carefully before reading the novel itself. It explains, among other things, how the entire novel is related to existentialism. Even though not explicitly stated, this introduction also tells us about the nihilistic aspects of this novel.Existentialism is a twentieth-century philosophical movement whose emphasis is upon personal decision to be made in a world without reason and without purpose. It also emphasizes such things as subjectivity, free will, and individuality.This movement has spawned a form of psychotherapy called existential therapy that is concerned with the present and not with the past or future.Nihilism in philosophy is the denial of existence of any basis for knowledge or truth. It is the general rejection of customary beliefs in morality, religion, and so on. As well, it stresses the belief that there is no meaning or purpose to existence.(2) Chronology (4 pages). Traces in table form the author's life (among other things). The novel is by Albert Camus (1913 to 1960) who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. The novel was first published in 1942 in French and titled \\"The Outsider.\\" Camus died in a car accident.(3) Translator's Note (2 pages). The novel was translated from the French by poet and critic Matthew Ward. Ward states that the \\"'simplicity' of the text is merely apparent and everywhere paradoxical.\\"(4) The Actual Novel (115 pages). This novel is divided into two nearly equal parts of six and five chapters respectively.Part one details the routine, mechanical nature of the main character's everyday life up to the point where he commits a murder. In part two we see how the main character is jolted out of his routine life since he now has to stand trial.There are only four major characters in this novel:(1) Meursault. A Frenchman who is the main character or \\"existentialist hero\\" of the novel. The entire story is told through his eyes.(2) Maman, Meursault's mother. She is not a living character but her presence is felt throughout the novel.(3) Raymond, Meursault's friend. He is indirectly the cause of why Meursault ends up in jail, is convicted of murder, and sentenced to death.(4) Marie, Meursault's girlfriend. Meursault cares for her, but not in the same way that she cares for him.There are eleven minor characters. They are all crucial to the story.The writing in the novel is simple and laconic but powerful. The novel begins with the following: \\"Maman died today. Or maybe yesterday. I don't know.\\" It ends with the following: \\"I...only...wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.\\"The themes or topics that run throughout the novel are many. Some of these are as follows:Death, detachment, indifference, observation, alienation, spiritual exhaustion, apathy, absurdity, callousness, immorality, unemotionalism, and ambiguity.I should warn potential readers of this novel that those unfamiliar with and that do not understand the concepts of existentialism and nihilism may respond with anger towards this novel. All the one and two star reviews below this review illustrate this. What this means is that Camus did a good job in writing his novel.What I did was take a word or a phrase from the first five, one and two star reviews below this one. These words describe existentialism and/or nihilism and express anger. They are as follows:(1) \\"[B]ook...sucks\\" (this reviewer is angry).(2) \\"[M]onotonous\\" book since it elaborates on the routine nature of Meursault's life.(3) \\"[A]ll Meursault reacts to are the most basic wants...food, sex, warmth, sleep.\\"(4) \\"Meursault was an emotionless, hopeless, and disgusting man.\\"(5) \\"I am...angry that I had to read this crap.\\"In conclusion, this is an exceptional book that describes a different type of thinking. Don't miss this unique story!!+++++"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus paints a horrific existential painting into a young man's mind. Preliminary Suggestions: I suggest you get some cliffs notes on this book or any supplementary tutors or have a teacher guide you through the book so that you will not get lost. The symbolism on existential theory does get over some people's heads sometimes. I was extremly fortunate to have a good teacher guide me. This book begins with the funeral of Mersault's mother and his dreary world of nothingness. Throughout the book, Meursault lacks responsibility about his life. He is extremly lazy and he takes life on a primitive level. In the middle of the book, Meursault murders an Arab, which he casts the blame of the murder to the sun or the sand or anything he could blame it on. Meursault undergoes the trial which he is being charged with his philosophy of life and not the Murder of the Arab. The book begins with a death, in the middle there is a death and at the end there is a death. Albert Camus shares an interesting concept of Existentialism with thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre. We all, as human beings, are doomed to be free. We have the freedom to choose our paths in life and we have the authority to change that at any stage of life. This is the common theme of the book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read this book in one night. I can't recall the last time I did that.I consider this book a meaningful read. There is so much to it.A great read that I don't hesitate to recommend."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus describes in great detail what this man is thinking through the book. The Stranger is an interesting novel honestly expressing the theory of existentialism. This great book shows what this mans life is like in and out of jail."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus brilliantly captures the essence of the existential hero. Meursault is forced into an absurd universe and must make decisions in that universe. He accepts responsibility for these actions-thus overcomming the punishment. It is tragic, however, as the all-too-human, Meursault, is sentenced to die not particularly for murder, but for his brutally honest emotions in dealing with past incidents. Camus not only tells a provacative, intriguing tale, but gives the reader a glimpse into his own absurd world."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I think The Stranger was very well-written and well-thought out. It is very descriptive. Albert Camus describes in lots of detail, which makes you feel like you're right there in the story. At first it has a slow pace and can be boring at times, but halfway through the pace picked up. It got confusing at times also but I would just read a section over a couple of times and then understand it. What I really liked the most about the book was how the main character's, which was Monsieur Meursault's, thoughts were vividly described. You felt like you were in the mind of this stranger and understood what he was going through. I love novels that are written in first person, so that explains why I like getting into the stranger's mind. I also like how the thoughts of death were described. I always wondered what a man was thinking when he knew he was going to die soon. Mr. Camus does a great job at providing this information in an interesting way. He makes Monsieur Meursault feel happy about dying. It is strange and creative. Meursault was always made out to be a cold-hearted character and Camus does an exellent job at portraying this too. I would recommend this book to anyone who could pick it up except young children of course. You have to also be a patient reader and take your time with the book. It can be slow and hard to follow, but you have to continue reading. I loved this book, and I really thought it had a great ending."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"An interesting novel about life in French Algeria during the early 1900s.

The last 5 or so pages are stunning, and with reflection upon the rest of the novel, I was smacked in the face with a picture of modern man so clear and untainted that I could almost see Camus chipping away at years of Plato's absolute morality...

This book is a stark, unflintching look at modern man living in an absurd world. The man character is the type of person Wilde had quoted: &quot;Man knows the price of everything these days and the value of nothing.&quot; This is true for Mersault, our anti-hero who kills an arab for reasons that are not very clear. It is a book the questions our &quot;morality&quot;, and realizes that it is only an abstraction. When the hero discovers the world is truly absurd, he lets whatever fate overcomes him in the sense of sweet surrender.

In short, it is one of the classics."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"the book is certainly fascinating and it is becoming more so as time passes and proves that no matter how the world becomes so close, people remain strangers in a strange world. it is a depressing book only if you don not know thst you can break free from that pattern, by being you and taking genuine care of others. The man in the book remains aloof and distant from the world and even his own fate is something which is distant for him. a great book for a a strange century."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Makes you look at the way you live your life.

The Stranger was one of them and when I finished reading the book I wondered what the propose or theme of this book was. A rational man telling a story in a very monotone way who seems to reject emotions and doesn't mind about anything? Is that what the whole book is about? Yes it is! Camus is trying to illustrate a character who doesn't intend to harm our society and in return is disowned and hated. The fact that Mersault always sticks to the truth is seen as something repulsive which make him different and simultaneously he is put into the category stranger. It is useless to search for the theme of the book for there are many. The novel includes so many interesting aspects which can be interpreted in so many different ways that almost any description of the book will suit the story."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is simply one of the greatest novels ever written, period. Regardless of Camus' true message and intent, I defy anyone to read this book and not be profoundly moved one way or another."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I find it hard to believe that there are some people out there that do not find the brutal behavior of merusault endearing. His mannerless killing of an other man is a ture test to his views of the absurdity of life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Like most who read this book, it wasn't until finishing it that I discovered the purpose. When one reads The Stranger, one will question the point of the novel. Throughout the book, one hopes that the next page will bring some excitement...but many of the greatest messages in life are not exciting to listen to. Many of the most important things humans ever learn are not fun to absorb. Camus has done us a great justice by writing this book, and showing us what our lives could be like if we each don't wake up and take part in the lives that we plow through every day. What we will be like when we become as indifferent to everything as we already are to many things. Go read the newspaper...do you know what is going on in the world at this moment?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Reading this book is an exprience one never forgets: you can't stay morally uninvolved with regard to Meursault's, the book's hero, deeds - he is not only a murderer, but has a strange, inexplicable, troubling way of life, which no reader can stay indifferent to. This may be the reason why some people tend to dislike this book, but it's worth remembring that this is not some Oliver Stone's movie which exploits it's viewers - Camus wants you to feel unease about his hero's actions, not to conclude that he is doing something either morally &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;right&quot;, but to ask yourself &quot;what is morality?&quot;, &quot;what is lawful?&quot; etc. Camus is by far one of the most human-loving writers of this century, so it is odd parhaps that he is being accused of making a case for a murderer, while, of course, these were far from his original intentions, writing the book while the 2WW rages on, and while he struggle to survive as part of the French resistance, a very small minority of the French society. Reading this book, in the correct context of Camus' philosophical writings, makes you think if there really is a gap between litrature and philosophy, as Camus himself strongly argued. On a personal note, this book has changed the way I see the world, and it has brought me to read almost all of Camus' writings, which are masterpieces in their own right. A must for every thinking person."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Many readers ackowledge the quality of Camus' writing but question the truth of existentialist philosophy. Maybe this is because existentialism is approached by some as they might approach a theology: as a description of the absolute truth of existence or even a prescription for how one should live.As a devout Christian, I find these works to be valuable illustrations of what happens to the person who cannot transcend his neuroses via spiritual catharsis (see C.S. Lewis for such remedies). The best lessons are learned from reflecting on ideas we find adverse to our own.The thoughtful reader must find Marsault to be a singularly unpitiable character. One of many object lessons I take from The Stranger is that to be preoccupied with oneself is to place one's soul in peril. Its a sad story that perhaps could have been told with more depth if Camus were more novelist and less philosopher. A good book; I would buy it again."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I must say that I enjoyed this book to the highest degree. I find much joy in reading existentialist novels such as those by Camus, Jean Paul-Sartre, and some by Kurt Vonnegut. I find this genre interesting in its reflection of post-war literary sentiment. In essence, I found the main character delightful in his randomness and expressive in his callousness and indifference. &quot;The Stranger&quot; was prompt and concise reading for me and it's a book I definitely want to keep on my bookshelf! Praise to Camus and his wonderful novel"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"It has been ten years since I read &quot;The Stranger. I am quite pleased with the new version. I must admit that the early translation did not live up to the principles of existentialism. This new version does. It is enriching to read. This book must be read at least once every ten years; as a good reminder of how we place value on things in life and life itself. A last note, in order to make the reading more enriching, a little search into Camus' political interest is worthwhile. If this is done, the symbolic language, such as the blistering sun, and the fact that it is an arab that is shot in Algiers, become clear in his writing."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Might I just say that Meursault annoys me, to start with. The thing with this book is that, if you get the symbolism of it, it really makes you think. But, in thinking on it, it slightly frustrates me. Meursaults attitude is that which I see all around me and can not stand...its all linked into existentialism (a philosophy, that while intriguing, I almost comepletly disagree with). I cant imagine why people actual sympathize with Meursault, and hail him as a hero. I think he teaches us some things about ourselves, but nothing positive. He has somehow escaped the integral thing that makes us human, feeling. I do not feel that this excuses him from anything. I do understand, however, that he was judged not on his crime so much as on behaviour that did not suite the society he was living in. I get the point, but he *did* kill another human being, for no reason, and did not care about it at all. Anyway, the book reminds me of all those who want to answer to nothing, of those who convince themselves they simply do not care, when they do. Meursault keeps saying that he doesnt care, but even at the very end, when he attacks the chaplain,he is doing so with the emotion that he had previously denied to himself existed. In all, I like this book and would recommend it, though I found myself frustrated with it several times:)"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Each moment of my life a recall this book, I think every life of the human beings will resemble in some moment to this book, because life has this kind of no sense moments, and nobody can't say have everything under control."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The first time I read this book, as a high school sophomore, I detested it. Now, two years later, being forced to read it over for an English class, I still cannot write that I enjoyed it or found it profound in any way. All I do know is that this time around, though not having taken a liking to the work, I do RESPECT it. I do not see Meursault as any sort of hero. Nor do I completely understand the concept of existentialism. I read many of the online reviews and noticed that many others did not seem to really grasp the concept of existentialism either. The first reviewer asks &quot;Is the protagonist a sociopath..?&quot; That is something I had considered while reading the book. In the Ward translation, page 100, Meursault admits &quot;I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything.&quot; A sociopath (pyschopath) is one who feels no guilt, one with an underdeveloped super ego. If so, and Meursault is a sociopath, how can he be regarded as a hero, or as &quot;at the mercy of society.&quot; He is responsible for his own actions. People tend to forget that he killed a man and deserved, if not a death sentence, one of life imprisonment. Such a man as he would be a constant threat to society. One reviewer points out that the root of Meursaults name means death. I saw the symbolism, but it annoys me when my friends tell me how much they enjoy the book, yet they have missed such details. I do not see how they can appreciate the book except for on a superficial level. All things considered, I found the book dry and overrated, but am left with a new sense of understanding. Who knows, maybe the third time around I'll give it another star.

Because of the disillusionment during the war, the characterization of Mersault is one of no emotions or sentiments. While studying French, we had the chance to read and explore the language and its syntax, as well as the story and the theme of the \\"absurde\\". Personally, the English version of this book does no justice to Albert Camus's impeccable style of description, or lack thereof. The precision of French is lost in the translation to muddled English words. The story comes off as one of plain repitition with no purpose, and the story becomes, at once, dull and unimaginative.Frankly, I hated it. Every single bit of it. And I recommend that anyone with the knowledge of the French language ought to try it in French rather than English."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"While looking through the, what seemed to be never-ending, list of summer reading books for my senior year honors' English course, I came across The Stranger, by Albert Camus. The caption for the book read, \\" Camus asks whether there is a God or just a cold, indifferent universe in this story of the trial of a man who commits a pointless murder.\\" I thought that the synopsis was relatively vague but it captured my interest enough to make it one of the five books I would indulge in during my summer vacation.However, after reading The Stranger, I felt as if I had barely indulged in anything. The plot and the main character, are, to say the least, simple. The novel follows the story of Meursalt, an Algerian clerk. The book is divided split into two parts. Part one is basically page after page of Meursalt's daily routine, which includes his going to work, his coming home, his dining at his friend Celeste's restaurant or occasionally fixing dinner himself and sleeping. Even on his day off, Sunday, he does nothing. He lacks any relationships of substance. He has his mistress, Marie Cardona, his fellow apartment dwellers who he only knows through rumors or watching them and a couple of co-workers with whom he shares about one word each. When he befriends apartment mate, Raymond Sintes, a reputed pimp, there is hope that Meursalt's life will take on some excitement. Disappointingly, their friendship is almost as dull as Meursalt's life. However, in becoming friends with Raymond, Meursalt manages to get himself involved in Raymond's affairs and kills a man.This brings the reader to part two, the trial of Meursalt. During imprisonment and trial, Meursalt seems not to care that he is undergoing a trial or that the end result of this trial could be death. He simply lives life in prison much like he did at home, uneventfully- almost uncaringly. As his trial proceeds, it seems that it is not so much a trial about whether he committed one of the worst crimes but rather a trial of his inadequate character.Monsieur Meursalt's character is so dull and indifferent that it is almost impossible to finish the book. Everything he does and everything he says is so matter of fact, there is no emotion behind anything. He does not waste any time of his insignificant life with emotion with small or large events. This can be seen with the very first sentence of the novel, \\"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure.\\" How can one not be sure when their own mother died?! When his mistress, Marie asks him if he loves her he indifferently replies that it doesn't mean anything but that he probably doesn't. Moreover, he fails to show insight into other characters or share any internal feelings. Meursalt's behavior and lifelessness is a major annoyance which is present throughout the novel.There is further meaning in this novel under all the dull descriptions of the main character's actions and thoughts. Camus is trying to say something about society and fitting in. Yet it is difficult to plow through the boring and unexciting plot and life of Meursalt to get to the heart of it. In order to get anything and everything out of this novel, one has to have a great forbearance for pages filled with simplicity and indifference."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"So we have this guy who sort of muddles through life doing whatever comes to mind. He meets a girl and she asks him to marry her... sure why not? He meets a thug and the thug asks him to be his pal... sure why not? The thug asks him to write a nasty letter to his ex lover, so he can get even with her...sure why not? He goes with the thug to meet a friend...sure why not? The thug gets into a fight with his ex lover brother and asks him to hold a gun on him... sure why not. Later he goes for a walk on the beach and gets dizzy from the sun and runs into the brother and, since he has a burning need of a cool place(where the brother happens to be sitting) he confronts him. The brother pulls a knife and so he shoots him five timesOK now the part about the lawyer... He is arrested and put on trial. He gets a lawyer to defend him who is also a dufus. The trial is just a character assassination and he muddles through that and gets convicted and condemned to death mostly because he did not cry at his mothers funeral.During all this, he does some arm chair philosophizing and wonders how he got into this mess.Well Camus did a good job of developing Meursault's personality...if you could call it that. The rest of the characters are hardly touched on at all.If you look at the novel as a condemnation of the French judicial system, then it has some merit. If you look at it as the sad story of a man with a character disorder, then it has some merit. I know it is blasphemy, but if you really look at it as great literature, I believe it falls far short of the hype."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Okay, so I know it's a \\"masterpiece,\\" but I didn't take to this book like I thought I would (more importantly, should). It's probably just me, but in the end, I needed there to be more to it... to some, therein lies the beauty.In The Stranger, Meursault is a man of dull-character who lives a life that we can all relate to. He holds a job, has a girlfriend, has an apartment and has a friend or two. But what he lacks is the importance of it all. Had he not been so devoid of any complexity his life would have taken another direction... and in the end, his existential way of life was ultimately his demise.It's an easy read with a linear path... you'll gobble it up in a day or two as I did.

I recommend it and it is not too long for those who do not like lengthy stories."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"***This review may contain spoilers.***Along with Herman Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Albert Camus's Monseiur Meursault in \\"The Stranger\\" (hereafter TS) is probably the most inscrutably and bafflingly passive character in all of literature. At least Melville suggests that Bartleby's obstinate refusal to work, to function, to even live may have resulted from the stifling seclusion of the impersonal corporate world. TS does not even attempt to explain Meursault's impassive, impersonal view of life (although, like Bartleby, he is a corporate clerk, if slightly more animated). Meursault reminded me of an android, or more fittingly, an alien (perhaps the novella should have been entitled \\"The Alien\\") or \\"pod person\\", who superficially resembles a human but is not quite familiar with most human emotions. He functions more like a beast that satisfies basic carnal needs (warmth, sex, a cigarette) and does what he has to do to survive.TS is a Hemingwayesque novel, with simple, unpretentious language, and a protagonist that may remind you of Hemingway's disillusioned ex-patriates. However, the ex-pats's behavior could at least be attributed to World War I. What is Meursault's excuse? Whatever it is, it is probably irrelevant. The novel is divided into roughly three parts 1) Meursault's attendance at his mother's funeral, 2) Meursault's daily \\"life\\" activities, and 3) Meursault's arrest, incarceration, and trial after his killing of an Arab. In the first third, to the shock and dismay of many, Meursault barely remembers to attend his mother's funeral. He does not want to see the body before the coffin closes, and he does not openly grieve for her. The clerics, mourners, and church authorities show more compassion than he. They also seem to condemn Meursault for his apparent lack of regard and knowledge about his mother, including the fact that he had her consigned to a nursing home. Meursault merely matter-of-fact states that he and his mother by common design had little to do with each other and that it really was more convenient and beneficial that she stay at a home. Tellingly, he also reveals that Mother was not exactly a religious person, and that he apparently inherited that trait.The second third of the novel details Meursault's unremarkable daily activities in Algiers, Algeria. He is not completely anti-social since he has a quasi-girlfriend Marie, another quasi-friend Raymond, and a crotchedy old neighbor Salmano with whom he interacts. But in those interactions, he is not spiritually there. He reacts robotically and doesn't really seem to care about their feelings. Even when he senses that he has offended someone (usually with brutal honesty), Meursault tries to make amends not because of solicitude but because of vague annoyance with their behavior. Meursault eats, sleeps, swims, has sex with Marie, smokes, and walks, all without any ostensible purpose. Still, he claims his life \\"suits him\\" and he has no real incentive to change it.Meursault's dull, prison-like existence begins radically changing when he helps his \\"pal\\" Raymond, a pimp, discipline an \\"unruly\\" prostitute by composing a threatening letter. This incites the ire of the prostitute's brother, who is part of an Arab gang that starts to stalk Raymond. Meursault, Raymond, and a third party, Masson eventually meet and fight the gang on a beach. Raymond is wounded and Meursault and Masson escort Raymond back to Masson's bungalow by the shore. Meursault somehow acquires Raymond's gun and, under the apparent influence of scorching heat, goes back down the beach, faces a remaining gang member, and fatally pumps five bullets into him.Imprisoned, Meursault dispassionately awaits his homicide trial. On the whole, he adjusts to prison life surprisingly well, probably because it doesn't differ greatly from the prison of the outside world. He has merely traded the larger \\"cell\\" of the world for the smaller and somewhat more restrictive literal one. The only thing he really seems to miss from his former life, such as it was, was the sun and wind on his face. Meursault manages to frustrate his appointed lawyer and the magistrate with his phlegmatic personality and unemotional disinterest in his own fate and anything else. Again, he is condemned for his \\"callous\\" attitude towards his mother, and, astonishingly, for his lack of belief in Christianity. Here, Camus ironically belies the impartial, logical nature of the legal profession with the still relevant observation that even the most heinous suspects could \\"save themselves\\" if they demonstrate the proper remorse and religious penance. Meursault doesn't do that because he simply doesn't believe in it.During the trial, the prosecution continues the condemnation of Meursault as a monstrous, unfeeling mother abuser whose grotesquely inconsiderate and unrepentant nature would predispose him to murder. Camus continues his assault on the legal profession by focusing on its ad hominem attack of Meursault rather than upon the crime's evidence. Nonetheless, the prosecution's character assassination is shockingly effective and Meursault is consigned to the guillotine.Even this doom fails to rouse Meursault much. Instead, he ponders some last-minute, deus-ex-machina act that will save his skin, or even a mad dash for freedom, or how he will behave at the hour of death. The prison chaplain makes a last ditch effort to have Meursault repent before his execution. Meursault furiously replies that that belief system was a nonsensical illusion, so to speak, and that only one's physical life and impending death, even in the face of an empty, uncaring universe, were real. After his tirade, Meursault only wishes that hostile spectators witness his decapitation.Everyone seems to tout TS as an existential, hopeless novella with a reprehensibly godless and insubstantial \\"hero\\". That assessment, in my opinion, doesn't penetrate far enough. I believe that throughout TS, in his distorted, passive-aggressive way, Meursault seeks the meaning of existence. Although he protests that he is content with his life, he really isn't. Otherwise, why commit the murder? He wants a thrill; he wants to feel alive, he is daring God or some other supernatural force to show him the meaning of life. However, TS suggests that passively waiting for God to do his thing is not the answer. Humankind must make the effort to find meaning, purpose, and happiness in life. Meursault does not realize this until nearly the end of the novel, after his outburst against the chaplain. All along, paradoxically enough, his seemingly aimless life led against \\"the benign indifference of the universe\\" had meaning for him, even if for him it is the only true life. And now his hopefully eventful death will cement that meaning. Meursault has his answer, even if some of us may not like it.As the magistrate stated in TS, \\"...[A]ll men believe in God, even those who reject Him.\\" Even professed \\"existentialists\\"."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"It was just was I was looking for, and it came within a week of my purchasing it.

The amoral main character, Meursault has a short attention span and an utterly lazy approach to life - not that he doesn't work hard, but that it doesn't make any difference to him what happens. His catchphrase is that things and events are \\"of so little importance.\\" \\"It's common knowledge that life isn't worth living, anyhow,\\" is what gets him through the day.The novel begins as Meursault's mother dies, and then takes us through his daily activities, culminating in a rather inexcusable murder. The second half of the novel traces Meursault's trial.Ultimately, Meursault rejects God repeatedly, although it certainly didn't help that the minister (along with the one other Christian in the novel) is something of a buffoon, and has a very poor approach. Meursault is content to put his fate in the hands of \\"the benign indifference of the universe.\\"Considering the implications of some of these philosophies, it remains baffling to me that some people are content to die and then to cease to exist. Put another way, some people have so little regard for their own existence. Certainly both existentialism and absurdism are anti-Christianity in this and many other aspects.The novel has a little trouble getting out of the blocks, but it picks up nicely and it's a quick read. Ultimately, the degree to which one enjoys this book is dependent on how one feels about its philosophies.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"All in all, the best book I have ever read!

Even the fact that he was not seen to cry at his mother's funeral becomes an evidence of his guilt.

Despite its length of 123 pages, The Stranger is a literary endurance test: exhausting, exhaustive, excruciating ... and excellent.Meursault is nobody special. A pied-noir residing in pre-World War II Algeria, he guns down an Arab in cold blood on a blistering summer day. The protagonist is thrust into the limelight, and a man who once took life at face value finds himself examining a vacuous life.Such is the plot, but this author's main interests lies elsewhere. Is life not absurd, Camus challenges us through his anti-hero Mersault, when human life is so terminal and soon-forgotten? If yes, why not thrash it and mock it? This question of the absurd has drawn many comparisons with Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, but Camus shook off the existentalist moniker, and this is a tribute to the Frenchman's intellectual honesty. For the idea of the absurd in this novella contrasts sharply with those of classic existentalists, and Camus's artistic technique differs as well.My reading of The Stranger hinged on whether, like existentialists, Camus intended to create humor or artistic distance, and in the end, finding no such evidence in the text, I decided he did not. This is bone-hard reality: a prima facie argument delivered with raw power and skilled craftsmanship, but without, I think, sufficient perspective. Unlike Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, Camus is not poking fun at a 20th-century Chernyshevsky or Hegel here. Camus is right in there with Mersault--dead serious--in this tract of complex ideas and stark layering. The protagonist's declarative statements carry a raw, political force, and indeed he's quite terrifying, and the novel will leave many readers baffled and disturbed.In a word, this book is surreal, and when read from a surrealist's perspective, the book falls neatly into place for me. A central, philosophical question is this: is Mersault stark-raving mad, or is the world? And if it's the latter, is this murderer in fact sane? What does this say about morality and ethics? Camus doesn't want us laugh at his protagonist as we do Dostoevsky's underground man; we might agree with him instead. As surrealist Andre Breton would say, Mursealth is above \\"conscious moral or aesthetic self-censorship,\\" where the convicted becomes society's accuser. The crowd is lost in self-serving hypcrisy and delusion, and only Mersault has the wit and integrity to tell them. In this way, Camus argues for his protagnonist's sanity and ethical grounding as he delivers a dark, foreboding message from the cell of an Algerian prison.The author's sillogism goes something like this: life's unhappy and then we die. Life shouldn't be unhappy, even though we're going to die. Therefore, if we want to be happy, we must embrace death. Like all arguments, this one makes assumptions: people aren't happy, people can't find happiness in the absence of embracing death (such as through spiritual faith). Mersault shouts out his disgust with a rotten world and finds solace in it; he does this in a kind of self-declaration, where he's entitled to speak for himself if he so pleases. In true, post-modern style, Camus suggests we listen to his maverick. Surrealists typically embrace the idiosyncratic and individual while rejecting all forms of group-think--even to the point of refusing to define insane. So no irony is intended when Salvador Dali declares, \\"There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.\\" This is Mersault.Surrealism was popular in Camus's France during the 20th century, but as a reader I nevertheless need to ask whether Mursealt is mad. Mersault is a man of acute awareness struggling in an insane world. This man can murder without contrition, and when the crowd screams out ugly bile in response, they speak with a twisted--but elegant--harmony on the matter of life's cruel nature. In this there's universal solice, and Mersault's individual, relative reality is conjoined with the universal's. Having come full circle, we're left in a moral conundrum where murder is sane. Now Camus has trapped us.Or has he? It's difficult to laugh at Mersault since he's so disturbing. So I approached this question of Mersault's sanity by evaluating the argument, a dangerous foray inside a man's matrix. But this is precisely where Camus failed, in my view--a wry commentary on a book that was so beautifully constructed atop the human intellect. Kierkegaard avoided the trap of self-declaration when he acknowledged a universal idea of the ethical before allowing a need for a telelogical (i.e., with a purpose) suspension of that ethical, and only as a true act of faith. Mersault has no faith, and his suspension of the ethical is purposeless. That is, he has not placed his transgression on the shoulders of a higher authority. Faith is a paradox, Kierkegaard says, and a moral individual will transcend the ethical only on faith that a higher authority will intervene in this life. Mersault absolves himself of such consequences, and as such, morally disconnects himself from the world of mankind. If this is not a form of madness, then what is? I think the argument collapses here: what's missing in The Stranger is layering. Dostoevksy, too, on the other hand, layers his argument vis-&agrave;-vis artistic distancing by presenting his anti-hero in the form of parody. Knowing this, can't we begin to smile at Mersault's self-certain simplicity, despite the internal logic of his argument? The elements of paradox and mockery are not present in The Stranger, but should be.It's a shame. The 20th century was the most violent and ideologically deranged century in human history. This is a great novel and an excellent read, but like so much literature of that era, The Stranger said more about the world in which it was written than perhaps was intended.My TitlesShadow FieldsSnooker Glen"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I was required to read this novel in my English class and I am ever so glad that I had too.

With an exestentialistic perspective, Camus tells a story that is more of a reflection of society than a true novel. The feel that Camus strives for seems to fall short as the main character is not sympathetic. In reality, the character just seems stupid.Monseiur Meursault is not saddened when his mother dies. This disturbs the jury just as much as the fact that he killed a man. With no remorse or guilt, the jury sentences Meursault to death. The main character seems maddeningly silent throughout the course of the story until his speech no longer matters. Visited by the chaplain in prison, Meursault finally spews his sad diatribe for virtually no one to hear.Just as the main character seems unable to connect with his world, I was unable to connect with the story. I understand where Camus was leading the reader in the story, yet I feel that he did not deliver the anticipated effort in taking me to the point."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In the opening chapter we learn that Meursault's (the main characters) mother passed away, yet Meursault stands devoid of any emotional attachment (he didn't even cry). Intrigued by his apathy, I felt Meursault displayed traits of a psychopath. After much searching, I finally realized why Meursault felt indifferent towards his mother. Meursault is a existentialist by nature. Once that is realized, the book travels a linear path to the finale. Meursault life is much too empty, and his existentialist philosophy affects no change in his life. Meursault's friends are more chaotically inspired, than mutually beneficial. In a nutshell Meursault could careless where his relationships lead him. The beauty of the story is found at the end. He convincingly argues about the meaning of fate and life. To him nothing really matters outside the freedom of nothing."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I initially read this book, I was entirely confused and a bit disturbed at what I had just read. As I began to research the book and analyze the book, I began to understand it. The concepts are quite bizarre... but in the end pleasantly intriguing. After first reading the book, I really didn't understand Meursault's character and how all the events enhance the reader's understanding of his character. This book was read for a paper and my teacher told me that Meursault was dynamic. However, I didn't fully understand how until later. During the beginning of the story, Meursault takes a passive role in his life. The events in his life don't seem to be happening to him.... just to someone else or something. At some point during the trial, Meursault discovers that the events are truely happening to him. At this point, he decides to take an active role in his life. He chooses not to sit on the sidelines any longer. He also want to make useful all the time he has left. He doesn't want to waste a moment worrying about God or something else (like when he spent the whole day watching the people from his window). He wants to pack as much into the time he has left and forget about all the past problems he's had. He relates to Maman in that he wants to start over, with no problems or expectations. His life to come will be much more productive than the life he lead earlier. In most reviews of this book, this book has almost been an example of what not to do. I, however, have found comfort in this book in that I think it is an example of what TO do. You should live life as if you are not going to be here tomorrow because you never know what's coming next. You never know when that sun's going to shine just right!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When we first started reading &quot;The Stranger&quot; in class our teacher warned us it would be a boring book, but as I read the first half unlike most of my classmates and my teacher I found &quot;The Stranger&quot; quite interesting. I know someone in my life who is just as strange as Mersault, the protagonist of this book is and it was quite interesting to get a first hand view of an unemotional, amoral, apathetic person. But things got worse when the entire second half of the book turned out to be a trial description. If there is any type of book I hate, it is that of a trial description. But however boring the book might be it is one of the most influential books I have ever read. It is an existentialist book that views the world as an absurd and indifferent place. The world according to this book is a &quot;Godless&quot; place where nobody cares about the people that dwell in it. &quot;The Stranger&quot; is one of the pioneer books in the genre of existentialist books that deal with the absurdity of life. In today's materialistic society, this book seems to make a lot of sense when the codes of religion do not seem to suffice our spiritual needs anymore, when the entire world seems to be apathetic to its surroundings, busy and confined to their own lives. Yes, indeed it is an absurd world that we live in and it is about this world that Camus writes &quot;The Stranger&quot; about. Camus also satirizes the hypocrisy and fakeness of religion and the legal system and how often they are merged together as one. &quot;The Stranger&quot; by Camus ranks up there with the classics, and even though it might not keep our utmost attention throughout the reading it definitely however teaches us a valuable lesson in life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"\\"While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors, I explore more, to expose the core\\" The words of rapper, Guru, best describe the writing style of Albert Camus. The Stranger was written with simple words, and simple sentences, because the main character, Meursault, is a simple man. Camus is making a social commentary. He is telling the reader there is no god, nothing important beyond life. Some feel Meursault is complex, because he does not share the same emotions they do. These natural human feelings are complicated, Meursault is not. It is hard for most readers to believe Meursault honestly does not care about anything. They can not accept a man who is not like them. Meursault should be accepted as the person Camus says he is; after all, he made up the man. The point of the novel is that there is no more to life than what you see and experience. The book should be read from the same point of view. I enjoyed the book because it was like real life. Most books are written in a way that makes them seem far from real, with vocabulary that puts it in a world of it's own. In a musical or opera, people sing everything they want to say. In real life a person would not write a song on the spot to describe their memories of going to the beach. While most novels are written like a musical, The Stranger is real."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"&quot;The Stranger&quot;, by Albert Camus, is a much praised and widely read book. It can be said that its focus is greatly connected with the philosophy of existentialism. I have heard it considered as one of the most important existentialist books, a definite must for the reader who considers themselves to subscribe to that philosophy. Even if one is not considering themselves to be existentialist, the books content can be attractive to those who would at least like to explore the issue. The story centers around a man named Mersault, and more than anything explores his behavior, or lack of. Camus offers us a different type of character, one that doesn't express dramatic amounts of emotion, rather, one that expresses almost none at all. For readers who have not yet encountered such a distinguished and different character, this is definitely a book to read if one wishes to explore areas involving possible facets of human behavior. I would recommend this book exclusively for that purpose. Camus uses his character Mersault as a vehicle to express his existentialist ideas and propositions on the meaning of life, peoples actions, and the world in general. \\"The Stranger\\" is disturbingly iconoclastic and assaults the worlds conventional morality. For any reader, this book should be compelling as well as unsettling, all the while being completely absorbing. Camus makes striking challenges to conventional thought in such a way that no reader could remain unaffected. For the existential enthusiast, or the lay reader, this book promises to be a rewarding and enriching experience."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I didn't expect Camus to be optimistic, of course, but The Stranger absolutely haunted me. Meursault's plight is all of ours. His crime, basically the crime of indifference, is something of which no one can, really, be acquitted. I am sort of a withdrawn person, and Meursault actually appealed to me as a character, although his actions repulsed me. Overall, this book was very frightening in a good way (especially the end of it)."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I am having a difficult time understanding what existentialism represents. If it represents the notion that humans merely exist but nothing really matters, then Mersault is definitely an existentialist. Is existentialism then merely having low blood sugar? What is the difference between this man and a common animal such as a dog? Nothing really matters to the dog except physical sustenance. How can there be an entire literary movement based on something so inconsequential? And if nothing really matters, then why does Camus spend energy writing a novel about an idea that doesn't really matter?I apologize for the sour tone, but this philosophy seems to go against everything I think normal people believe in. It opposses the foundations of human life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I started reading the book, I had some buyer remorse because it's slow going early on. It's also written in an entirely different manner than I'm used to, so it took a bit. That said, I really enjoyed the main character, Mersault. Certainly a unique main character.Like others have stated, the first part of the book is slow compared to Part 2. However, the first part lays a lot of foundation for the second, so there is a point.This book is worth the purchase for a few reasons. For one, there's not much else like it in literature. If there is, I haven't read anything comparable. Second, it's a book that can and should be read more than once. That way, you get more of the context and underlying themes. Third, it's short enough that another read shouldn't take long at all.My only critique is the length of this book. Just when it gets interesting and I'm drawn all the way in, it's over. Small critique anyways, and that might be one of the finer points."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Matthew Ward translation is inferior to the translation by Stuart Gilbert. Using the French \\"Maman\\" does nothing for the reader of English and, in fact, detracts from the quality of the reading experience. Compare the last several lines of the two translations, and you will find Gilbert's much more powerful, even lyrical. When I first read Camus' book, which is my favorite novel, only the Gilbert translation was available, and it blew me away. When the new improved version came out, I read it and tossed it in the trash. Gilbert, however, makes Camus' lines sing with electricity. If you can get the older translation, do so."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Mersault is an existential person; he goes to work each day, comes home each evening, stops when something stops him, and goes along with events that cross his path. At what point does this turn to nihilism, and more importantly, at what point do we stop thinking of his actions as a philosophy and begin to judge them or him?Mersault is complicit when his neighbor asks him to compose a letter to exact revenge on a woman whom the neighbor says did him wrong. Vengeance seems an appropriate reaction to Mersault, so he writes the letter. Subsequently he hears its result through his wall: the woman arrives, and the neighbor beats her. Another neighbor abuses his dog, Mersault tells us. He doesn't intervene nor form a judgment. Marie asks him, \\"Do you love me?\\" Mersault replies that it doesn't have much meaning, but he doesn't think so. He then agrees to marry her when she asks. Our first neighbor, rumored to be a pimp, who has beaten a woman, invites Mersault on a trip. Sure, he'll go. He goes where the tide takes him.On this trip, the \`thugs' behind the event with the woman arrive. While alone on the beach, unprovoked, Mersualt shoots one of them - once, then four more times. Why? He was not asked to nor provoked; in his mind he was, in short, being himself, though he has a hard time articulating this as a courtroom defense.The prosecution shows Mersault as an unfeeling callous person who premeditatedly murdered. He didn't pre-plan; we know this of Mersault. He did commit homicide, unprovoked. Now we have societal questions: is his personality, or philosophy of life, relevant? Does his past behavior, that one could interpret as callous, have anything to do with murder? No tears at mother's funeral, behaving in concert with a man in a manner that results in harm, then befriending the man and taking the fateful trip with him. Legally (another topic entirely), no. The event on its own and his defense, as he sees it: is it valid or is there a point when one has the \\"right\\" to judge another? If the other's actions do harm--murder--what should we do?Mersault is Mersault. Camus places this existential character in the most questionable circumstance. His personality caused the death of another person. And that's the book. Mersault has thoughts and opinions; not many, so he doesn't speak much, but he knows who he is and is never dishonest about it. The back cover of the edition of the book I hold tells me Mersault is a victim. Is this true? Or is there not an answer to that question? What does society do when someone commits murder for no reason other than he is who he is? The penal system (another different topic) is atrocious - but that isn't what the book is about. So if an existential, easy going life leads to behavior that is complicit in events that hurt or kill others, do we switch the \\"ism\\" to a judgmental word - in the book, amorality (his atheism plays role as well in others' judgment of Mersault); in psychology, unsafe to others; in culture, a threat to society.In my opinion the book asks us to think about these questions and answers. Perhaps it gives us its answers but, more importantly, it is to us to think of them. When is existentialism nihilism, and when is nihilism \`wrong' and what should, if anything, society do about it? I personally found Mersualt 'strange' at the start, then uncaring about the ills of others, and finally a murderer, which, to me, is a horrid thing regardless of the philosophy that led him there. I found him interesting, but I can not condone his actions. However, I think the point is more that Camus gave us this extreme example as a demonstration, and I think that's what to walk away with.Last, I loved and admired the way the first few sentences, which are brilliant, come back later to tie the entire book together. A short, simply stated book extraordinarily well-handed to us as food for great thought."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is the haunting story of a young man mindlessly going through life. He seems neither happy nor sad, just pleased to live another day. The protaganist, Meursault, goes about his everyday life in a kind of haze. Even when his Mother dies, he simply accepts it. All the characters around him have a purpose and he drifts along with them until one day he finds himself killing a man.Even as he sits in prison, he lives a life of happenstance, to him all life leads toward death it doesn't matter whether the journey is long or short, it all ends the same so why not make the best of each day. Simplistic as this seems, the writer, Albert Camus, pulls you into the mind of such an ordinary man in an extraordinary and absurd situation.This is by far, the best novel I have ever read and it's only 123 pages."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When first assigned to read this book I wasn't happy. But after reading it I appreciated its realist philosophy and the way Camus used beautiful language to express the unemotional state of Muersault's mind. I would definately recommend this book if you are willing to have an open mind and see the message of this book, which is live your life now don't wait. You should also examine Marie using feminist analysis. I found she doesn't have a voice and you have to create her yourself using descriptions from the book but also try to see her point of view."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"&quot;the stranger&quot; is OK, more, a great novel. However, i expected more form a nobel prize. In a book labeled as &quot;existentialist&quot;, (as this one) the book quality is strongly related to the personality of the main character. That's beacuse most of the book is composed by thoughts of the protagonist or his feelings towards somebody or something. Meursault (this book's main character) is complex and interesting, however, in my opinion is far from reaching the deepness of other famous characters such as Dostoievsky's Raskolnikov; Hesse's: Emil Sinclair or Harry Heller; or even the one from Sabato's &quot;the tunnel&quot;. Meursault is portrayed as somebody who doesn't have much feelings towards anybody or anything. Inside him there are no internal conflicts or doubts or questions about something. That's Ok, Camus makes it interesting anyway...Good book, definetely worth reading, but forgetable in some degree."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"THE STRANGER is one of those timeless classics sure to disturb new readers well into the next millenium. Albert Camus is dealing with truth here, and truth, like life, is not for everybody. And neither is this book. I wouldn't have it any other way. Camus' pitifully honest anti-hero Meursault finds himself on the wrong end of French justice following a carefully plotted train of carelessly indifferent but seemingly innocent decisions culminating in one senseless murder that is the real mystery of the book. Why did he do it? Who is Monsieur Meursault, really? Naturally, the reason supplied by the author is strongly provocative and certainly unsatisfactory for most if not all. The writing is terse, economic, exact. A wonder, really. Readers should note what is not said as well as what is. This book did what few books can. I was left in a state of aesthetic arrest, neither drawn to nor repulsed by story or character, a sort of neutral zone where all fear and loathing have been replaced by pure wonder--much like Meursault himself. THE STRANGER only confirms for me what I have always suspected: in the hands of a master, writing is the highest form of art. What Camus achieves in a few pages most modern authors would spend chapters doing."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger, like most of Camus' works, focuses on the soul of man, and its reaction to certain situations. This book, I felt, was extremely depressing due to its truth of how the protagonist ends his life in a sense, making himself believe in his guilt to overcome the fact that he ruined a, more or less, wonderful life. Read this to gain insight. Warning: NO FAIRYTALE HERE"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In a beautiful blend of contrasting elements and brilliant integration of circular symbolism, Albert Camus paints a picture of life and human nature in his existentialist novel The Stranger. This story is that of an impassive man who is convicted of a capital crime because of his indifference on trial and elsewhere in the novel. Meursault, the man whose major crime is his inability to express, murders a man on a beach. Feeling uncomfortable and oppressed by a blinding sun that &quot;shatter[s] into little pieces on the sand and water&quot; into his eyes, Meursault accidentally pulls the trigger of his readied gun, killing the man brandishing a knife at him. The striking feature of this novel lies in Camus' ease in completely incorporating the major motif of the novel: circularity. Circular symbols permeate its every aspect. This circle technique allows the book to comment on life, paradoxically conveying its message through an examination of death. Sun and water themes circulate around each other and are accented by the circular structure of the book itself. These themes also serve to emphasize the motif of contrasting elements that makes this book so complete in its integration. A simple writing style serves to illustrate the simplicity of the novels concept. Working similarly to Hemmingway's style, Camus writes in an extremely fluent way, which also suggests the symbolism of water. This book is one of the best out their. With an interesting plot line and amazing ability, it succeeds in most ways to explain one of life's truths."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read the Stranger (actually i read the translation entitled The Outsider, but it's the same thing) in my grade 11 world literature class. The book revolves around the main character named Meursault. The novel, deep rooted in its existentialist theme, is one of the most mentally stimulating books you will ever read. Albert Camus suggests that the pinnacle of hypocrisy in society is its quickness to judge people upon appearances or behavior, versus its apparent incapacity to judge people upon fact. I will refrain from making any conjectures about the novel, its theme and message, because that is something you must do for yourself. After reading the novel, dont rush to the internet to read essays and reviews about the novel. Instead spend some time contemplating the book yourself. Then open yourself to the opinions of others. It is one of those books that you will never forget, and will change the way you see things, at least temporarly."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This novel came highly recommended by a friend. I bought it at a used book store, fearing the worst and then regretting paying full price for a work of trash. Boy, was I wrong! The Stranger is one of the best books I've ever devoured. Albeit, it could have gone into more detail, given the story and the characters more 'meat', however, I can't complain about it's poignant quality.Mersault: idiot? victim? extraordinary? This is left up to the reader to decide, which I loved. Mersault's actions made me think of the isolation that comes with being different and indifferent. Mersault did not CHOOSE to be indifferent, he was naturally. Or so I assume, because there never was an explanation for his decidedly rotten behavior toward the people close to him.I think this book's length was a factor in letting the reader make their own judgements regarding Mersault and his place in the theories of nihilism and existentialism. I STILL, after having read the book months ago, haven't made a definite decision. Hopefully, the conclusion won't come any time soon. I'm enjoying mulling the story over in my mind and talking about it with my book-loving friends.I recommend this book to anyone who is beyond the idle fluff of such writers as Dean Koontz and Jackie Collins. Feed your brain some oxygen. You'll never think the same way about life again."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":".In the story of the Stranger, one finds the lead character, Meursault lacking creativity and of passions within oneself, of the depth of conflict that burns in one's center that moves with chaos and value-positing; none of this can be found in Meursault. He is matter of fact in everything. True, his acceptance and passionless being allows him to under go his ordeal in subdued emotion and unenthusiastic plight, yet this groundlessness and existential being does not excite in living, but simply goes along in existing.Even in Meursault's act of killing, there lacks any real passionate fervor. His pulling of the trigger was just that; an easy act of the finger and no real understanding, that is, no depth in comprehension of the act itself, but merely a nonchalant action that seems to have been the best alternative of action at the time of occurrence. And yet, the lack of alternative actions is the problem.In each and every situation in Meursault's life, from the death of his mother to his sexual relationship to his befriending his neighbors, all is performed as a cog in a machine. As each piano key is hit, only to be in succession of what is already programmed on the sheet roll of music. The \\"last man\\" mentality of the Lockean view of self-preservation dominates Meursault's life as the bourgeois in existential nothingness and mediocre existence.Should Meursault suffer as he did for his actions? Were they really so evil? Were his actions simply the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or in this case, befriending the wrong person who caused these thugs to appear for Meursault to confront? If life can be reduced to existence over conflict then certainly Meursault could be pardoned. But the one must ask if Meursault's action, the act of murder, not of self defense, can ever be excused, simply for the fact that the man who committed such did so from a lack of inner conflict and passion, from an act that simply called to be for the moment it presided in.The answer to Camus' Meursault comes from our view of subjectivity or objectivity. The Stranger places us in the former as we are personally involved as we read the story from the inside view and thus we side with Meursault. Yet when we are able to detach ourselves and look objectively, we gain a higher perspective and thus a different viewpoint.Robert Shattuck, from his book Forbidden Knowledge, remarks on The Stranger with the following point, that knowledge can be double bound; subjective or objective;:\\"The closer one approaches to an event or to a person, the less securely one seems to know it. The trees obscure the forest. The more one knows, the less one knows. Perception itself requires a certain distance. Empathy hides more than it reveals.\\" p. 162Our closeness brings empathy, which distorts our power of observation and obscures the facts. That appears to be the case in Camus' The Stranger."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I first read The Stranger (Albert Camus: L'&Eacute;tranger) in French Literature class in school. I recently re-read it in English, specifically the first (and it would appear from much feedback, the best) English translation, by Stuart Gilbert (The Stranger).

Meursault, the main character, kills an Arab in a confusing situation and ends up being judged by this crime. The absurdity of human life, the arbitrariness of justice and the importance of phisical experiences are depicted in an exquisite yet profound way.- THE ALTERNATIVE REVIEW: don't expect any intrigue or suspense from this pretty dull book. Mersault, the main character, is a man who doesn't really know what to do with his life and kills an Arab in a beach because the sun was annoying him (this is what \\"the absurd\\" is all about). The so-called arbitrariness of justice is nothing but a proper trial. Only in the last chapter did I find some interesting thoughts but I could have saved my time and read just that. Surely won't change your life...I have mixed feelings, I couldn't decide for one of both reviews."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book certainly rings as true today as it did when it first came out, as our society produces more and more non-heroes like this, dulled to most everything.

The sheer immediacy of the tale changed that. This book is philosophical to the hilt, questioning the general concept of reality itself.

A true revolutionary novel and one of the best written, ever, hands down."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is a masterpiece. I liked it more than any other book i've ever read. While many critics say this book is unrealistic, it is actually quiet the contrary. The simple fact that it tells of the simple and unambitious life of a man is realistic. The fact that it portrays the benign indifference of this world is very realistic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is a masterpiece.

The story of Meursault is an existentialist battle cry, just as Sisyphus is doomed in his struggle against his fate, so are we condemned to death by a banal society.

To never confuse life with death. To never allow passing time to escape. To break forth into the world with every ounce of aspiration and energy, the only inspiration inside yourself. To know that you are alive at the very least.

The Stranger is a modern masterpiece, a superb literary and philosophical work. The current translation by Mathhew Ward is the one to read."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The book that inspired the debut single from seminal British band 'The Cure,' Albert Camus' 'The Stranger' is a great primer for anyone at all interested in the literary context of this controversial song. The story of Meursault is a harrowing one, highly intellectual and thought provoking. A great introduction to Existentialism as well as an expansive literary work, Camus' \`The Stranger' will intrigue generations to come. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Yes- This is fantastic writing. Yes- The pacing, style, etc. are all great. I guess the idea is that you're supposed to see a bit of yourself in Mersault. I just don't. Yes, I understand that he doesn't live up to societies expectations. That can be admirable. Most literary heroes are outsiders to some extent. The trouble is not that Mersault has no respect for society's rules. The trouble is that he just doesn't care. About anything. I care about stuff, therefore, I cannot even begin to identify. Maybe Camus couldn't either. Maybe he just found the whole thing really funny. Maybe this is just one novel-length riff from the world's most misunderstood master of black humour. That, I can identify with."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This Book was very interesting and kept my apt attention. At points I could not put this book down. I would recommend this book to many people."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This bizarre little novel was recently named one of the 100 best of the century. If there were (a la Ayn Rand) some philosophical speeches, perhaps this could be redeemed, but it is very difficult to find sympathy with a murderer, even one condemned for the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus has a point to make in this book, but sometimes he makes it hard to find. True, it is unfair to judge a man because he fails to live up to societal standards and not because of the crime he commits. The fact remains, though, that Meursault DOES commit murder. That he does so for no particular reason (the sun gets in his eyes?)only makes the act more unthinkable. Shouldn't we be more afraid of a man who kills another man randomly than one who does so with some sort of motivation?Since the book is written in the first person, Camus obviously intended for this story to come across as the oft-told tale of the ordinary man caught up in a world gone mad. However, I came away from this book with the impression that Meursault was the one who was mad. Or perhaps he was simply autistic. Either way, he neither understands the system nor operates within it, and it is this failure that causes his downfall, not society."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"You may find a certain comfort in The Stranger: even the story's clever syntax and person, its cause and effect staccato prose, help define our underdog hero, Meursault. He exists only in the immediate present, falls prey to no abstractions, politics, or even remorse for the inevitable. But his indifference may also irritate you, as it does the Law, or better, those who pretend to adhere to the law's democratic handling of even the most detestable characters. But the law hates Meursault, who never openly grieved his mother's death, and for such a travesty, must be punished. Mersault can barely understand anything abstract, let alone display it publically, but now, Camus has set this view as our own, and his indifference will be his undoing, and create a tense paradox for the reader. The author is talking about science: the world known through abstractions. Hitler and Stalin used abstracting to murder millions. And Meursault will perish for the abstract concept of what l! awmakers deem proper behavior. In prosecuting Meursault, this Stranger to society, they reveal their own insane abstractions. Meursault will not be punished for what he did - self defense on a sun beat beach in Algeria - but for what he didn't do - comfort society..."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When reading this book for my boring french class I never knew I would come to love it. This book, along with Cumus's other novels and essays truly helped me define who I am. I highly recomend that it be read and reread adinfinitum!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The &quot;Stranger&quot; by Albert Camus is the greatest work of its' time, which rivals the works of nearly all 20th century writers (of whom I have read, of course, which is admittedly not much after only 2 years of high school). It is great in terms of, both its' ideology and writting mechanics. I bought my copy of the novel in the school book store several months ago, after a recomandation by a good friend. Soon after I took a trip to Los Angeles. While on my trip I read the novel and had a revelation. I realized then, how disconnected I was from those around me. I could draw far too many comparasions between my relationships and those of the personea. Furthermore, the novel(along with the philosophical essays of Sartre and Marcel) helped develop my intrest in existentialism and romanticism. Truly, a must read."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The use of character was fantastic. I've reccomended this book to everyone I know who enjoys to read. It's short, sweet, and to the point. Camus doesn't waste any words and does a fabulous job in the last 5 pages."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is an extraordinary book. Camus is very entertaining, and he draws a picture of his philosophy with every word...from the blunt, uncaring language down to the names of each and every character."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I have read this book twice, so far. I loved it. Camus has created a character who's behavior is so antisocial that his actions, to us, seem almost incomprehensable. One cannot help but be struck be the completely relative way the Meursaut relates to the world. With simple, straight forward narative, Camus sends his message straight to the heart of society. I loved this book and i recommend it to any one. Also, if you liked The Stranger, check out Native Son, by Richard Wright, another existentially driven novel which is very good."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is perfect. It show you the truth, and hit you in the face. It hurts. It makes you think different about life, friend, words, everything. And, like said H. P.

That's all I say about the world after reading this novel. If you read between the lines well enough, you'll begin to see why the world is so absurd. How society is absurd, how people pretend to live life to its fulllest when in fact they are living like dead people. Justice,society, people: it's an absurd world we live. This is a MUST read for anyone who has read The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, and to anyone with an open-mind about the world."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is the kind of book that you can easily miss and if you do, it really doesn't matter. But once you've come in contact with it, if you get nothing out of it, you're actually worse off. This book is translated from French, but please don't hold that against it. This book is dry, but not boring. Philosophical, but not elitist. I give it a gold (but not the shiny gold, the kind of gold that's been handed down from generation to generation and is all tarnished...) star."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Matthew Ward's translation provides a better reading experience than Stuart Gilbert's; nuances, subtleties and other details of character and dialogue are mixed and seasoned better into the broth of the story, a story about Meursault, a man alone but not lonely, who views with dispassion the alternating streams of tenderness and brutality that form human experience. His earthly incarnation seems only a vehicle through which to observe, to keenly catch fine points of gesture and expression in a context of non-judgment. And so he can view with equal dissociation the brutal mistreatment of an intimate partner and the play of the setting sunlight on street scenes below his apartment window. For Meursault, each is a series of fascinating images created by the impersonal, moving physicality of the universe.I enjoyed the novel and have enormous respect for Camus' talent in translating sharp observations into stimulating prose. But in my own writing I chose an abrupt departure from one aspect of Camus' character: likeability. Meursault, though fascinating, interesting, and intellectually engaging, doesn't feel, doesn't empathize, doesn't cry, and so I'm challenged to truly like him. Despite this, Camus has given us a readable, instructive, engaging and provocative novel that forms a literary nexus between fiction and philosophy. I read it twice."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"\\"The Stranger\\" is one of those novels that operates on multiple levels. On the surface, it is the brief story of Meursault, a man who attends his mother's funeral, meets a new girlfriend, goes to work, helps a neighbor get revenge on a bad girlfriend, then ends up murdering a man and going to jail and trial. It is an easy to read little book written/translated in an efficient Hemingwayesque style. In some ways, not much happens. In other ways, quite a lot happens. But throughout, the reader keeps wondering just where the story is goingOn the next level, the book is about Meursault's existentialist view of life. From his point of view, everything that happens to him simply happens. When his mother dies...she dies. If his girlfriend wants to get married, it is ok...they can. If his boss transfers him to Paris, so be it. If incarcerated, he will pass the time studying stones or watching the sky. If he is sentenced to death....well, he dies. Nothing is important. Nothing really matters.There are other levels as well, including one in which the story is an allegory for the European imperialist presence in Africa. And so on.....I was intrigued by this book. Though short and easy to read, it provides a wealth of food for thought and discussion. It is not, however, an uplifting book. And frankly, I remain unsure about exactly why this book earned Camus a Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book, at first, seems plain. The simplicity and clarity of the writing is what makes the book unique. The main character does this and that, describes what is, objectively, and goes about his life. He is detached, content, accepting, in touch with life as it is and doesn't taint existence with novel interpretations. Rather, he doesn't interpret anything. He is never swayed by what he views as pointless, although he does look for reason in what others are passionate about. He admits that he has considered being less honest to appease others, but decides against doing so.I read this book because I am interested in existentialism. I found that it helped me understand the philosophical movement better. Also, this book has helped me feel that my logic makes sense, and is shared by others after all.I definitely recommend this book to anyone who values rationality, objectivity, simplicity, and loathes senseless novelty."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is one of those nobel-prize-winnnig books you see mentioned every now and then, but you don't know if you'll really ever read it yourself. It's such a simple story, but it's so profound and thought-provoking. Basically, a guy kills another guy in self defense and goes to trial over it. That's really all there is to the story. But what makes it so thought-provoking is the personality of the guy. He sends his mother to a nursing home, doesn't cry at her funeral, smokes a cigarette and drinks a cup of coffee immediately after the funeral, and gets a new girl friend the day after the funeral. This makes him suspect. The mob thinks that maybe he has no feelings. They think that maybe he's an awful man that isn't fit to be in public. They think that maybe the murder wasn't in self-defense after all. It's scary to me that people could think a man is a callous monster just based on the feelings a guy did or didn't have for their mother. What's the real line between civilized and savage? Is a person not civilized just because they are less demonstrative about their emotions than most people? Is it a crime to sleep with a girl you just met just because your mother was put in the ground the day before? It's just shocking to see how small of a thing can demonize a person in the eyes of a mob. I think, however, that the most shocking thing to me about this book was to realize that in 1942 France, the death penalty was still beheading by guillotine."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I think to say some one doesn't like some one because they can't REALLY grasp/understand it is one of the most arrogant things some one can do, usually; but in this case its necessary. The Stanger is nothing short of life-changing. Simple fact. People that don't admit it are either too stupid, too jealous, or too afraid to come to terms with it.I say too afraid because of the implications of a philosophy so obviously true. I say too jealous because most of this book seems like things a lot of people think but never end up saying and, well, getting so much credit for. And I say stupid because this book is great and screw them."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Fast shipping and the book was in excellent condition for what I paid for.

If you are not one of the following, I would highly suggest joining the crowd on this one and reading this incredibly short novel of 123 pages (that's right, just 123 pages).Dealing with the death of his mother at the beginning of the story, we show that Monsieur Meursault is not a very emotional person and does not express signs of sorrow or weakness as he loses someone who should reasonably be an important person in his life. His life takes an unexpected turn when he engages in a shooting on a beach for no apparent reason, though there is a chance that he could have been threatened by the alleged victims knife. His emotion and his faith are put into question throughout the remaining half of the book.\\"The Stranger\\" is bound to make you think. You wonder about the enigma that is Meursault and why he thinks the way he does, why he is not an emotional individual, and why he shows no faith in God. There is even a bit of comic relief in the story with the character of Salamano and his dog, both of which are blind. Definitely check this book out if for some reason you were not introduced to it in high school."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The story line sneaks up on you and the author abandons all the rules! It is a very quick read.Dr. Dotty Heady"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"It has been over 50 years since I read The Stranger, and having read much about Camus recently, I decided to re-read some of his works that are now seen as classics. The descriptions of the life of the French colony in pre-WW11 Algeria are interesting pictures of a way of life that is no more. The plot, if it can be called that, is the tale of a man's anomie or estrangement from society leading to his death. It raises philosophic questions, but I don't know that those questions are seen as being as pressing today as they were in the post-war period. As a warning about the effects of indifference or detachment is is an almost a polemic. Had the \\"hero\\" shown more concern for his fate and been a bit more engaged, the text would have shown less inevitability and more complexity.If you are looking a book to provoke thought rather than entertain, this is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book felt like Hemingway wrote Holden Caulfield, and so something bad happened.It was very much a product of its time (1946). We have a totally detached, unemotional hero smoking and shagging and observing sad people. It was frustrating to watch his lack of eloquence and charisma destroy him and the character was not at all sympathetic. I am pretty certain that this was the point. It was very successful at what it was trying to be, but that something is not my kind of book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book was very misleading but always interesting.

I probably wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A story needs a hero. Camus tells a story well enough, and I have no real faults with the translation, but the protagonist, Meursault, is no hero. This book has been over-reviewed, but I am adding to the plethora of comments anyway.Reading this book as an adult, I can only conclude that the author and the protagonist were both quite functional though severely depressed, and as this book is a part of our education system from high school to college, I hope readers have the sense to realize that, and not merely think \\"ooooh, iconoclasm and nihilism and sadness -- how smart and profound!\\"The only way Meursault could have been the way he was, was not so much his being a sociopath, but rather because of an overriding, long-term depression. He was sensitive, yet insensitive. Self-absorbed to the maximum, yet a participant in life as a social being. Kind and polite, yet apathetic to the point of shooting someone dead because the sun was too hot and he wasn't feeling quite well, and not experiencing any pangs of conscience later.Those who cling to the idea that Meursault was evil have their points, but I stick to my depression diagnosis (as a non-psychologist!) noting his conversation with the priest near the end, as he was coming near his date with the guillotine, and Meursault burst out with a rant including, basically, saying \\"life is terrible and everybody knows it\\". Looking at the story as a whole, that was how he always felt. That expression really becomes the basis for the book, but not as a vaguely Buddhist realization, but the final \\"tell\\" that this man always felt this way, and it was the overwhelming, chronic sadness that made him who he was, and do what he did. Was he sad at his mother's funeral? He was sad all his life, or at least all his adult life, so why would even a loss that profound register? The man was just gone. He tried to be a nice guy, and was somehow functional. He worked. He was never belligerent. He sought happiness in the one basic way that was left to him: the company of a woman. But he was clearly warped into super apathy by his disorder.Meursault's (Camus's) conclusion was acceptance and defiance in the face of the misery of life, as he planned to march to his death and hope there was a big crowd to see it and cheer for his blood. An Existentialist might pick up on this as a call to arms, to be stoic if not aggressive in the face of the pain of life and spit in its face; but the fact that this story was expressed to the public, and the public accepted it as literature and philosophy rather than a cry for help, was nothing more than a sort of reification of the cliche that misery loves company."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus' work is altogether phenomenal, but this book did something extra for me. The Cure even made a song about it. Meursault is one of the most intruiging characters i've ever come in contact with. The death of his mother, the love that his &quot;girlfriend&quot; Marie showed towards him, and his own crime never moved Meursault to express or acknowledge any remorse or loving. Camus wrote this in first person, so it was fabulous to be able to 'read through the eyes of this so-called madman. Meursault was persecuted for being misundertood and unremourseful, displaying the only &quot;human&quot; qualities he knew of/cared to express.

He doesn't have the sense of fear to death, and that's why he considers believing in God is bored and unecessary. He can't comprehend love, the most complex emotion of humans. So, the only thing bothers him at his mother's funeral is the heat of the sun, and he promises to marry his girlfriend only because he feels that it is okay to him. He doesn't have the sense of honor, humiliation or guilt, and therefore, he doesn't feel sorry for killing a man, either premeditated or accidentally. He could do anything that other people tell him to do if he feels comfort or it doesn't matter to him. You can't find any virtues or values in him except animal's instinct, biological function and his alienation toward the man's society. And naturally, this person can't survive. If he does not end up in execution for his crimes, he would be terminated by other tragic means. Acutally, it is not his fault. His existence in the society is just a matter of his bad luck. He does not belong to the society that is bound by moral and law but the savage life may make more sense to him. It is a extremely stunning book, but behind the fascination, there is a theme poisted by Camus: strip the armour of the civilization, a man is basically an animal. ."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I have read a previous translation of The Stranger, and was deeply moved.

In the beginning, he finds out that his mother has died. He isn't sure exactly what day she died, or even how old she was and it doesn't seem to matter much to him. He confesses that he wasn't sure if he loved his mother and shows no appropriate emotions at her funeral. Soon after he admits that, he's not so sure he loves his girlfriend either. He thinks that at one time or another, all normal people wish that their loved ones were dead. He tells a friend that it is his nature to let his physical needs get in the way of his feelings. What feelings? Then claims that he is like everybody else.?Near the end of the story he declares that he has never been able to truly feel remorse for anything. It is only in facing his own demise that he displays any emotion.Okay, so Albert Camus is trying to communicate his belief that there is no absolute truth, that everything is relative and that reality is only found in those things that we experience physically. I can buy into everything is relative theory, but without emotions, feelings and spirituality, is there any such thing as physical reality?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is about a brutally honest man who subconscioulsy commits a meaningless murder and comes to the realization of what his own life is truly worth. Although this novel is worth reading, it does contain some flaws. Due to the complex structure of the narrative, The Stranger is a book for the strong minded. The lack of dialogue makes it bland at times; furthermore, Camus' attention to detail can befog the reader. However, the positive aspects outweight the negatives. The philosophy behind the book makes it thought provoking and characters in The Stranger relate to every reader. Camus' profound use of imagery appeals to the senses. This novel is recommended for aspiring philosophers and intellectuals alike. Don't be discouraged, anyone is capable of understanding The Stranger by Albert Camus."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I won't go so far as to say that this book changed my life, but it sure put things into perspective...I first read this book at the age of fourteen, just a year after my father died.

I had never read a book in one sitting before (I know, it is short, but I do have a short attention span...) but it hit me like the proverbial ton of bricks. I recommended it to everyone that would hear me. I read everything that I could get my hands on by Camus. It remains a favorite.If you are happy with your life, and I mean pathologically happy with your life, you might want to avoid this book because it will make you think and re-think. It is so simple, but that IS the beauty..."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"After reading &quot;A Happy Death,&quot; Camus's first attempt at The Stranger, I've come to appreciate this book much more. The narrative style is much more effective for Camus in developing themes of personal alienation, as it was for &quot;The Fall.&quot; Also, I've found The Stranger to be more Kafka influenced, and the parallels between Joseph K. and Mersault are very apparent -- its clear that the model of K. was used to clarify the position of Camus's absurd hero.This book is not really a portrait of atheism, as some say. Its more a description of man's struggle with his own superfluity and his final reconciliation with his indifferent universe. Mersault is not a contemptible man: he is a rational man, only even he does not realize why. Through him we are meant to explore the distant vegetation of the absurd man, the climate of his universe, not its details.Not a somber novel; a beautiful one if read correctly. One of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"What a dazzling book.A profound and heartfelt statement on the nature of man against a society who condemns him because he is different, because he cannot find it in him to lie or be false to his own moral code so he is punished for it and his punishment finds his freedom. The book is a haunting testament to our world nowadays and will be forever remembered because some essences of societies never change and the one in this book accurately shows that.along with being a masterful tale, a perfect introduction into Camus's theories of man and existentialism which set the movement in motion with Sartre, the novel can be read by any lay person but only the inclined mind or in this case, the stranger who reads the book will understand the value of its extreme importance and the values it preaches and the absurdity of life.Mersault is a young man who remains unaffected by events around him, even his own mother's death. why? Mersault is different, its not that he doesn't care or has no sense of emotion or feeling but its because he lives moment to moment instead of jumping back and forth between present and future....This is a must read for any serious reader or person interested in philosophy or the essence of man. this book is greatness pesonified in the magical pen of Camus."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Okay - I somehow managed to make it past high school and college without ever reading The Stranger. Being an English major, I'm not quite sure how that happened but nevertheless it did. So, whilst in the bookstore recently, I had to pick up a copy. I had prepared myself for a boring read but I was pleasantly surprised to find a very good challenging story.The first thing that really jumped out at me was Camus' writing style. It took time to develop a knack for reading the short, abrupt sentences. The feeling was akin to sitting in traffic - from 50 miles and hour to a full stop repeated over and over again. But I warmed to the style of writing and soaked in the language, the story and the setting.I now understand why this is considered by many to be a cornerstone of European literature.

Simply reading it on a literal level will do wonders only for your sleeping. Essentially, its merely a novel observing the life of the very passive and boring protagonist who lacks what one would normally consider a personality. However, on the figurative level, this book is filled with metaphors and deep statements about society. The Stranger is an existential and absurdist novel, featuring the &quot;absurd hero,&quot; Meursault. The story takes place in Algeria in the 1940s. After his mothers death, Meursaults life goes on as it had before. His interactions and opinions of people remain the same - nearly nonexistent. As his &Ograve;go with the flow&Oacute; attitude leads him into the public eye, he is scorned and shunned, and this leads to what I would describe as his &Ograve;triumphant downfall.&Oacute; This book is great for book groups, class discussions, or just those of us who enjoy reading a book full of philosophy and metaphors. It seems that almost every event and character can be analyzed. The statements made in this book are so profound, that I felt the need to reanalyze my life, even the parts that were previously concrete. This book also sparked my interest in philosophy and existentialism, and has inspired me to read more books on the subject. If you enjoy philosophy, existentialist works, or stories of rebellion, I strongly suggest The Stranger by Albert Camus."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The stranger is a book made to be read more than once. Although it was written simply, the underlying substance is utterly compelling. Read it over once again and you'll see."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Of course The Stranger is a brilliant novel, better than 99.9% of anything ever written, but readers should not think they know Camus because they've read it. I read it in English and French, and if you can read French don't bother with the English (Matthew Ward's translation is fabulous, but you'll get so much more from the French. And don't go anywhere near the Stuart Gilbert translation!) Anyway, the rest of Camus' work is so important also, notably &quot;The Plague,&quot; an utterly betraying work of seminal brilliance, &quot;The Fall,&quot; a mordant first person narrative seething with wit (Sartre's favorite), his novellas in &quot;Exile and the Kingsom,&quot; especially &quot;Jonas.&quot; Camus was also involved thoughtfully in world affairs, and the essays in &quot;Resistance ,Rebellion and Death&quot; are timeless and provocative, and Camus also wrote for theater. His &quot;Caligula&quot; is at the top of my list for the best plays of the century with &quot;Endgame&quot; by Beckett and Sartre's &quot;No Exit.&quot; &quot;Caligula&quot; explores the phiosophical roots of tyrrany with insightful and clever banter and action. Finally, there are those brilliant larger essays &quot;The Rebel&quot; and &quot;The Myth of Sysphus&quot; to add to the list. Perhaps the most personal of his wrtitings if &quot;The First Man,&quot; a semi-bitter and pensive evocation of a stark childhood, the manuscript of which was found in the car which Camus was accidentally killed in at Sens in 1960. &quot;The Stranger&quot; should never be seen as required reading for school, because by essense it is so much more than that, but people should also see that Camus was so much more than &quot;The Stranger.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book brought me a chilling and troubling nightmare of what it means to live without hope, which according to Camus, is a positive expression of the freedom of pushing a mute rock up a hill forever in joy as he explicates in his discursive book, The Myth of Sisyphus. But when a spiritual and religious person reads this 'fiction', she will recognize the truth that Camus' work never ceases to entrap itself in death-glorification, even, as in the final paragraph of this book, the stranger finds himself 'as having been happy and happy still', at the thought of the advent of his death, taking joy in the expectation (which, ironically, is a betrayal of Camus' conception of loss of hope as being a positive thing) of the spectacle of his death of execution and the jeers of the mob of spectators as they see him killed. The 'protagonist' of The Stranger is a cold-hearted emotionless character, and throughout this whole book of 'fiction' he turns the stomach. Read it only if you want to be that spectator of a man who willfully denies having hope, faith, and love, making a spectacle of himself for all to see, in that old literary post-modern fashion. I didnt have any kind of guidance when i first read it, someone to tell me that to read Camus was a taking part in the spectacle of a hopeless death, which again, is a good thing for him. He make take joy in hopelessness and the loss of God...Oh its such a twisted vision, one thinks. What freedom it is to rebel against freedom! How free must i be!!!! So, in all seriousness, perhaps one could read it to be more informed about hopeless and selfishly joyful atheism, but only to use your criticism available and valuable to others who are truly inquiring into what life is and what it is worth, to expose the unfortunate cowardliness of Camus, The Stranger."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I was forced to read this book and I still hate my teacher for it. Its about about a man who doesn't care about his mother dying, he doesn't seem to care that he hung around the wrong crowd and killed a man in self defense and he ends up paying for his carelessness. Good for him. I am still angry that I had to read this crap."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The book The Stranger I thought was the worst book I have ever read. The whole book was pointless. The end was very dumb, after the whole book he ends up have feeling and being happy but thinks oh well its to late Im going to be killed. The end killed me it was very bad!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Personally, I didn't think this book was very good. The whole concept of writing a book about a faceless man just doesn't appeal to me. I know that all of Camus books are strange but this one just wasn't one of his better books. The book just didn't have enough going on in it. The entire book was about the faceless man killing someone and then getting executed. I think the book probably would hae been more interesting if maybe the man fell in love before the execution. It also would have been better if at the end of the book, he actually wrote about the execution instead of just letting us hang, not knowing about what happens at his executon. The exection probably would have made the book alot more exciting too. So if I were you I probably wouldn't read the book unless you are into really wierd, boring books."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"First of all, yes, this is a fantastic and worth while book. I wish that other raters/reviewers would PAY ATTENTION to the difference between providing ratings for the book as opposed to the seller. This book should always be viewed as a classic and a five star or at least 4 star. I read this book some years back but this tale of absurdity and murder and detatchment/alienation of the main character delivers some stimulating reading. Ambiguity makes this book what it is. I found this to be my favorite Camus novel and that is saying alot because his books are typically pretty good. So I won't give away too much but I will remind people to be aware of what you are rating because this book deserves a little respect beyond 2 ratings of one stars it was given."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot; has to be one of the most solid pieces of literature in existance today. I have read this book a second time, and it was even better the second time than the first. In my second reading, I have a new theory on it: Meursault is detached from the events in his life -- his mother's funeral, his love for his girlfriend, and even his trial, for one reason, and one reason alone: he does not feel as though he is in control of the events around him. Events control Meursault, not the other way around.There are few certainties in Meursault's life. He does not like the idea of getting married because that brings about more uncertainty. He does not like the idea of waiting for his appeal, so what does he do: he creates certainty--he ends the appeals process.The only thing that Meursault can be certain of is the sun rising each day, and perhaps this is one reason why his focus is centered so strongly on the seasons changing and the sun rising each morning.This is absolutely one of the most remarkable books in literature, and I urge everyone to buy at least one copy.How far are we willing to try to control our own destiny? That's the question this books asks of you.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"As with most great literary works, there appears to be endless interpretations of this brief but strangely compelling novel. My own reading of it came while listening to a Teaching Company course on Existentialism. My take on the book will undoubtedly reflect my own prejudices and biases. Nevertheless, here it is.I find I must disagree with the many reviewers who describe Mersault as an \\"existentialist\\" character. Far from it; indeed, Mersault seems the opposite of the existentialist ideal. Nietszche would have despised him for his lack of passion. Kierkegaard would have rebuked his unwillingness to take a leap of faith. Even Sartre would have found his inability to take responsibility for his actions despicable.Existentialism is far more than just \\"gloominess\\" or being fashionably depressed. It is an outlook on life that admits the ugliness of the world and still urges us to take hold of ourselves in the face of all the apparent reasons for despair. In this sense it is a very empowering and positive school of thought.Mersault is the opposite of the existentialist ideal. He eschews passion in all forms. Love, moral discernment, even opportunities for self improvement are nothing to him. He finds an odd sort of comfort in his nihilism. To him life holds no meaning, and this belief shields him from the sting of grief at his mother's death. It enables him to use Marie for his own pleasure while feeling no obligation, no inconvenient emotions, towards her. It allows him to overlook the shady character and misdeeds of his \\"friends.\\" Even murder is a passionless act to him, one he regards with no more thought than taking a breath.The only time he displays strong feelings is when confronted by the chaplain. He flies into rage at the priest's compassion and belief in an afterlife. Such ideas threaten the relentless despair that comforts him. In the end he rejects with finality all forms of hope and takes solace is his belief that the world just doesn't give a damn about him or anyone else. It is this atttitude that not only enables him to think about being beheaded but to look forward to it.Camus, while not a believer in God, nonetheless had faith that life in worth living, that good and evil exist, and that the good is worth fighting for. In all of these things Mersault is his opposite, and is thus a poignant example of what existentialism has to offer. It is by rejecting his nihilism and passionately saying \\"Yes!\\" to life that we find the sense of meaning he so fervently dreaded."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"No one can deny that the Stranger is a modern masterpiece. This review deals not with the merits of the work, but with the merits of the publication policy that forces teachers of this classic to adopt a new translation of stop teaching the classic.One can also not deny that the Ward translation offered to us by Vintage as the only available translation of the classic is competent. This review is also not meant to be an attack on Ward's translation. It is, however, in my view, markedly inferior to the previous Gilbert translation as a work of art and in conveying Camus's spirit and intentions to modern readers. I recognize that this evaluation is open to debate among intelligent readers. The point of this review is that scholars and teachers of the book should be able to make the decision as to the relative merits of the translations by themselves, for reasons germane to the artwork, not publishers for reasons that have more to do with money.When a publisher comes out with a new translation of a classic, they have an obligation to leave the old translation in print, or allow it to be published elsewhere, to allow readers to choose for themselves.It is a travesty that a generation of readers instead of feeling the power and strangeness of the opening lines of the novel, \\"Mother died today, or maybe yesterday ...,\\" will instead wonder what Maman is and what a strange word it is to American ears.It is an even greater travesty that the publication of classics in translation has become like the publication of other textbooks, with a new edition forced upon us every few years for monetary reasons. The fans of Ward's translation should not be happy about this trend either. When the expiration its copyright appears on the horizon, or when too many used copies of it accumulate in college bookstores, we can expect it to share the same fate as Gilbert's.Faculty teaching this classic, no matter what their choice of translation, should not stand by and allow their choice of texts to be taken out of their hands."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I have never felt the need to comment on reviews posted by others on this site, but I feel that Ted Rushton's review (below) of The Stranger is a disgrace and I am amazed that Amazon have seen fit to publish his offensive and ill-informed half-witted drivel. Anyone who can use the moronic term &quot;surrender monkeys&quot; in a review of a book should confine themselves to the latest piece of trash by Frederick Forsyth and steer clear of authors of the calibre of Camus, whose ideas are clearly beyond him.Even if Mersault could be seen as exemplifying the attitudes of the French people - and he clearly exemplifies nothing of the sort - Mr Rushton's anti-French tirade crumbles when you consider some facts he omits to mention. Firstly, Camus himself was active in the resistance during the war and also edited, at considerable risk, the clandestine journal Combat. Secondly Camus' The Plague is an allegory of occupation and resistance and, despite Mr Rushton's assertions to the contrary, exhibits considerable moral bravery. Then he should consider Sartre's Roads to Freedom trilogy, three books which concern themselves unflinchingly with issues of engagement, commitment and resistance.In any case what philosophy could be more brave than existentialism, a philosophy that rejects the safety net of God and all other transcendental metaphysical fairy tales and insists that man is morally responsible for his own actions and the consequences thereof?And by the way, as an Englishman who has travelled in France I can assure Mr R that the French do not hate the English and we - apart from a few tabliod reading idiots - do not hate them either.The Stranger itself is one of the great books of the 20th Century: a masterful study of a man who refuses to conform to the false values and hypocrisy of mass self-assured organised society and ultimately pays the consequences for his bravery in refusing to &quot;fit in&quot;. The court room scene is one of the finest pieces of writing you will ever come across, and the book as a whole is beautifully written, intensely moving, and ultimately uplifting.Buy the book and ignore Mr Rushton's vile &quot;review&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I usually don't write many reviews, but I felt an exigency to write one in light of some of the reviews on The Stranger. Even those who have praised it seem to have missed out on Camus' message, the message which revolves around all of his work. Mearsault is not meant to symbolize some sort of alienated, misfit, product of society like many have said. Camus is not Kafka and Meursault is not Gregor Samsa. The \\"indifference of the world\\" is not something which is holding Meursault down, but rather showing him the true naked beauty of the world- one with lack of explanations and reason. The absurd is what arises when man's search for meaning in life is met by the truth that there is no meaning. This is not bad and it is not good, it simply is. Perhaps, a read of the Myth of Sisyphus might help make these ideas clearer and make The Stranger truly appreciated."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The North African sun flashing off an Arab knife. The whole book has the feeling of being a delirium though a lucid minded one, in the same way Kafkas stories combined those two (usually) inconsistent qualities. The main character seems overwhelmed by the world. He is a kind of victim of circumstance. The circumstance of being on the beach when the blade flashed in the sun which he felt threatened by and perhaps misinterpreted but also the circumstance of living in a world that makes no sense to him. Like Kafka before him Camus uses remarkable experiences to show the ambiguous nature of existence on every level. The courts themselves are senseless, arbitrarily handing out judgements with no real understanding of what occured either on the beach or in the lead characters head. The courts processes do not lead to understanding, that is not even their goal in this book. Camus shows that it is more important for civilization to retain a certain semblance of order in the face of chaos than to really offer a true order based on any true understanding. A brilliant book. The stars may look down indifferently on what we do here on earth but that fact and this book just make you realize how tricky and important a thing order, and justice can be. Lacking any absolutes to go by man exists in a world he can only partially comprehend. It is hard enough to comprehend who we are and doubly difficult, if not impossible, to comprehend another human . All systems of knowing and judging are flawed. Though Camus brilliantly shows society trying to deny this fact. Society persecutes, villifies, what it doesn't understand. All in the name of order."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is a story of a young man who has committed a pointless murder. Monsieur Meursault tells his own story of a young man living a comfortable life in Algiers. He drifts through life, working everyday at his office job and enjoying the pleasures of life: smoking, eating at restaurants, dating his girlfriend Marie, swimming at the beach, and people watching. He is a easygoing, untroubled fellow who lives in the now and is not concerned about the past or future.His mother dies in a home for aged persons and he travels to attend her funeral. He feels no grief but just observes the proceedings of the funeral and then journeys home for a weekend of swimming and going to movies with his girlfriend, Marie. Marie wants to get married and he agrees; but when she asks him if he loves her, he says no, but he will marry her if she wants to get married. He doesn't seem to have any deep feelings or emotions. He has no ambition or direction. He is a sensual, feeling, person who likes to observe others.He is kind to people like the neighbor who has just lost his dog. He inadvertently becomes involved in scheme of a pimp named Raymond whom he has befriended to punish the pimp's girlfriend. This leads to Monsiuer Meursalt senselessly killing the girlfriend's brother. He is imprisoned and tried for the crime. Oddly enough, he is prosecuted more for his amoral character than the crime he has committed. While lying in his cell, waiting for either his execution or appeal, he continues to think only of himself, not worrying about dying, just watching, feeling and observing the things around him.Mersault is an honest, but shallow and ordinary man who is also an atheist. He believes only in what he can see.I liked this book although it was sad and bleak. The plot is very simple and the writing style is very smooth and expressive and interesting enough to keep you reading until the end. It was interesting to read about what can go wrong when a person just drifts along with life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Other reviewers have disregarded Camus and his works as inferior imitations of Kafka, Dostoyevsky, and Satre. This is utter nonsense. Such derision neglects the nuances of Camus' absurdist expositions in both the Stranger as well as the Myth of Sisyphus. In fact, anyone remotely familiar with Camus (hell - check out his wikipedia article) would know that neither he nor his works fall neatly under the umbrella of existential philosophical traditions. Having said that, I would like to share some thoughts regarding his most famous book.In The Stranger, Camus presents the tale of a protagonist who is an organic vacuum - bereft of objectivity and purpose - Meursault - a government worker in Algiers whose life transpires in a succession of indifferent and quotidian occurrences. Quite simply, Meursault consumes his life in a psuedo-nihilist malaise. Unflappable to the vicissitudes of sorrows and joys, no larger purpose (be it ethical, professional, etc.) commands his action. The death and funeral of his mother inspires only feelings of agitation and inconvenience (due to the oppressive heat), while is ultimate incarceration and execution induce only the sensation of annoyance. His life in general is aimless and arbitrary, dictated by pragmatic whims for impulsive gratification (drink when thirsty, have sex when horny, sleep when tired, etc.)Hence, Meursault befriends his scumbag neighbor Raymond - a woman beater and criminal - simply because he offered him dinner and Meursault was hungry and didn't want to cook. This indifference permeates Meursault's consciousness, and results in the climax of the book - in which Meursault murders an Arab on the beaches of Algeria. While this constitutes the most punishable action one human can commit, Meursault never acknowledges any sort of gravity in murdering the Arab, because as he conceives no purpose in his life, no action means more than the next. Consequently, while many scholars and readers have tirelessly examined the events of the book leading up to the murder to understand 'why', the no less important question is 'why not'? In the pivotal moments on the beach before he unfurls the gun and kills the Arab, Meursault comes to a crucial epiphany: 'It was then I realized that you could either shoot or not shoot.\\" In a purposeless existence, what is the difference?The rest of Meursault's life can not instill in him any purpose or meaning. While Meursault admits he committed a crime which deserves punishment, his admission does not effectuate any revision in his worldview. Murder and execution is his fate - and this fate is no more nor no less significant. Without any external absolute to instill meaning, man can live his life how he pleases. Since meaningless spares no space of the universe, no place nor condition is better than the next. While Meursault is supposed to feel unhappy in prison - it is a condition to which he grows accustomed, and he even says:\\"If I had to do live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowering overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it. I would have waited for birds to fly by or clouds to mingle, just as here I waited to see my lawyer's ties and just as, in another world, I used to wait patiently until Saturday to hold Marie's body in my arms.\\"Even in a life in which (for example) love, liberty, morals, etc. exist, Camus (through Meursault) indicates that death - which unilaterally negates all - renders them meaningless. In terms of love, while Meursault has feelings resembling affection (one might argue intimacy) for his coworker Marie, he abstains from designating such feelings as love, claiming it doesn't mean anything. As he contemplates his imprisonment in jail, he does not consider prison any more confining than the inherent vertical bars of space and time that circumscribe existence into the curt contours of a human lifespan. Obviously, morals too convey no authority for action. For even if humans possessed rational objectivity to formulate a scheme of 'good and 'bad' - this framework is also negated by a finite existence which does not concern how or why we act.Claiming a certainty in metaphysical nothingness would misrepresent Camus and correlated beliefs. However, Camus does suggest that man and the universe that keeps him is utterly incapable of educing any meaningful metaphysical reality or truth. In the wake of such impotence is an implicit nothingness. The nullity of metaphysical reality, therefore, is incapable of providing some sort of guide as to how one should exercise his existence or interpret its meaning. All that is left is an immutable nothingness that cares not how we enter it.Even if Meursault repented for his murder, retained his freedom, and sought to find purpose anew - nothing would change. Meursault indeed imagines a life emancipated from the Algerian prison (\\"a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual\\"), only to deduce that the world in itself constitutes a terrestrial prison - and prior to the transient human concepts of 'justice' and 'punishment' that sentence him now - he was already sentenced to die by an existence that summons down the guillotine to us all in irrevocable finality - this is the \\"implacable ritual\\" that we can not escape. Hence even with another episode of existence by mercy, fortune, or even reincarnation, Meursault concludes that \\"I would just be caught up in the machinery again.\\" His only destiny would be to die once more - by the pronouncements of human justice or the mandate of material reality - it matters not.Camus' (through Meursault) nihilistic disregard for conventional feelings regarding life and morals alarms both the characters and reader alike, but he would argue that he is confronting existence with an honesty few do. Through this honest prism - existence reveals itself bare, naked, and most of all, absurd. The chasm between what we want to know (all-knowing) and want to be (all-existent), and what we can know and what we can be, is a gulf so tragically vast as to approach humor. While other individuals attempt to abridge this gulf by the 'leaps' and 'hopes' of theological, ethical, and spiritual purpose, Camus has his protagonist revolt against both the gap and the leap by living without hope or belief in reconciliation of the vast gulf. The consistent theme of the sweltering heat and sun represents the oppressive and omnipresent 'absurd' that weighs down man's existence (it is this dogged heat/angst that is the critical impetus to Meursault's murder as well). As such, it is significant that in the torrid courtroom, while the court occupants vigorously and fruitlessly attempt to cool themselves by waving fans in their face, Meursault simply suffers the insuppressible heat with no attempt to repel it.Regarding the charges that his philosophy and his book are 'dangerous', 'depressing', or 'scary', Camus would argue these characterizations are apt for a society which stubbornly continues to deny the absurdity of existence with one leap after another. The title itself, \\"the Stranger\\", perhaps does not refer to Meursault but to 'man' collectively. He is an organism whose consciousness necessitates some sort of purpose - and the universe can not provide him with the answers he needs to be content. Whether one chooses to designate himself as 'strange' or 'special', the fact remains that we are the only beings who are inevitably bothered (hence the angst) by our existence, and whereas everything can just be, we strive for 'place' in a universe that could just care less. This is why some existentialist readers consider Meursault a hero: he has transcended the angst, and he is not bothered enough by existence to resort to sophistic illusions of meaning and purpose. Whether on an Algerian beach, in a sweltering prison, or the trunk of the tree, he will get by just fine.Many people label the Stranger as dangerous (in its amoral implications and nihilistic message) and condemn Meursault's disposition as frightening. Indeed, life as finite and meaningless: how many of us as conscious beings who enjoy existence are willing to accept such a proposition? Personally, it is difficult to accept such an unequivocal abdication of purpose in our lives as humans, and to do so bears some serious implications. If one does do so, there is absolutely no principle nor external force/being to dissuade someone from acting just as Meursault does and killing someone just for laughing in the sun. There are a plethora of religious, spiritual, and ethical works and authors who explicate our meaning as humans and merit our attention as readers. But in the discussion of metaphysical meaning, Camus's captivating novel deserves our attention as well. In it, readers subscribing to existentialism and/or nihilism will find a masterpiece and a hero."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"So said Janis Joplin. She could well have been describing the freedom of this book's protagonist. One can read it as death by apathy, suicide by executioner.It starts with Meursault tonelessly addressing the facts of his mother's death. Even before that event, Meusrault had become anhedonic, judging the world in terms of its cost to him, not its value. Yes, he had straitened circumstances of a sort, but not dire. For whatever reason (and the irrelevance of that reason is itself striking), the scene opens on a man whose emotional fusebox is a scorched ruin. Whatever had once driven him, had long since burned out. In that state, even moral imperatives become mere habits - the cruise control of a mind that's lost its moral, feeling guidance. Then, possibly for valid reason, he kills a man.Racial politics of the 1940s could be invoked, or valid self-defense. It seems likely, though, that Meursault shot him, repeatedly, because his deadened mind could think of no reason not to. His thoughts had shrunk into such small orbits that they no longer encompassed any sense of future or any sense of person, even his own.A bizarre trial follows. The charge is murder, but the prosecution is about emotion. Meursault can not mount even his own defense in this capital case, to convince the jury that he is a feeling being. He is convicted, and awaits his transformation under the guillotine's blade. One last, devoted defender of faith and scourge of reason visits him in his cell. That final voice, entirely in tones and clothes of black and white, tries desperately to strike a spark on Meursault's sodden mind, and fails.All that's left is all that's left. I guess that's true for anyone, though. If you see more, it's because you see what's in you. Meursault saw what was in himslf, and just didn't care.Just couldn't care.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is a haunting, challenging masterpiece of literature. While it is fiction, it actually manages to express the complex concepts and themes of existential philosophy better than the movement's most noted philosophical writings and almost as well as Dostoyevsky's Notes From the Underground. This is a new kind of literature. The story in and of itself is rather simple, but the glimpses into the intellect and feelings of the protagonist are the sources of the magic of this novel. M.Meursault is a normal man in Algiers, France. When we meet him, he is on the way to his mother's funeral, where he says very little, expresses no remorse over her death, and immediately returns home. The next day, he goes swimming, meets Marie, takes her to see a comedy that night, and spends the next few weeks living his normal life and occassionally seeing Marie. He ends up getting indirectly involved in a dispute between his neighbor Raymond and a girl who did him wrong, and the conflict culminates in an encounter on the beach between Raymond, Meursault, and the girl's Arab brother and friend. Raymond is cut with a knife, but the whole episode seems to be resolved. Meursault, though, decides later to take another walk on the beach because he is too worn out to go inside and rejoin his friends, and somewhat inexplicably he ends up killing one of the Arabs. The second half of the novel examines Meursault's thoughts in relation to his trial and sentence; interestingly, he is prosecuted as much if not more for his moral character than for the crime of murder itself.Basically, Meursault does not care about anything, does not feel anything for anyone (including himself, for the most part). He looks at life objectively and determines that it really doesn't matter whether he does something or not in the overall scheme of things. When Marie expresses her love for him, he tells her he will marry her if it will make her happy but that he cannot say he really loves her. He expresses no remorse for killing the Arab because it just happened; he had no intention of doing it, but the fact is that he did, so there's little point in dwelling on it. He cares about the present and, to a lesser degree, the future, but the past is meaningless for the very reason that it is the past. Meursault sees things as they are; rather than rely on flights of fantasy and imagination (the typical tools of the Romanticists), he deals with facts in the here and now rather than run from them and has no problem admitting the seemingly obvious fact that man is a creature of utter depravity. He rejects religion; since each man must eventually die, what does it matter what he does while on earth. It is a man's hopes and dreams that weigh down his very existence; Marsault can only find happiness by cleansing himself of all such illusory notions.Needless to say, this is not an uplifting book, but it is an engaging, thought-provoking one. While Camus cannot be called a true existentialist in his own philosophical outlook, his fiction does epitomize many existentialist ideas. Marsault is a protagonist like no other in literature--you cannot like him, he is obviously guilty of killing a man in cold blood, and he is of a cold-hearted nature, yet you do understand some of his thinking, find yourself more and more interested in his dark outlook on life, and have to admit that much of what he believes makes sense."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I first started reading \`The Stranger' by Albert Camus it seemed rather dull. It's a first person account from a somewhat bland character named Meursault, the titular \`Stranger'. While working my way through the book I had to wonder if an alternate translation, \`The Outsider', would be more appropriate for \`L'&Eacute;tranger'. Meursault is a Frenchmen living on Algeria but in no way is he a stranger. He has a circle of friends, a job and even a girlfriend. What sets him apart from humanity is his possibly pathological indifference to just about anything whether it be abuse of a dog, abuse of a woman or even the death of his own mother. Not that he engages in abuse it's just that he seems unaffected by the suffering of others. Other descriptions I've read on this book have described Meursault as honest to a fault with this being his downfall. I'm not sure that gives people the correct impression. Meursault's honesty is not the kind where you tell a fat woman she's fat. His downfall is more his inability to feign sorrow, regret or empathy. When his girlfriend asks if he loves her he considers it and answers \\"no\\" without any thought that the answer might be painful to hear. About half way through the book, in a bizarre set of circumstances, Meursault ends up killing a man and when asked by the police if he feels regret he says he never looks on the past with regret and in this case feels only vexation. There is no evident malice only utter insensitivity.Philosophically The Stranger is one of the most intriguing and moving books I have ever read particularly the final act where Meursault confronts the priest who attempts to lead him to the Christian God in the last days before his execution. Despite the perceived indifference he exhibits throughout the book Meursault has a consistent and well defined philosophy of existence. In this moment Meursault disgorges everything he has on the hapless priest and lays bare his soul (so to speak). Knowing that his death is but weeks, days or perhaps hours away, he achieves a moment of clarity seeing his place in the universe, a universe even more indifferent than himself. Camus never absolves him of his crime but in a sense Meursault rises above the simple act of killing a man, above his imprisonment and above life itself. He achieves full acceptance of his existence and place in the universe and in that moment transcends life and God. I\`m genuinely saddened that I'm not able to read the final chapter in its original French. If the translation is this good I can hardly imagine how amazing the original must be.This is the kind of book that one could read and ponder over and over again and I have a feeling I will. There is a considerable amount of symbolism throughout particularly the scorching sun which seems to continually oppress Meursault until he can take it no more. It starts off very slowly and builds throughout. I've never been on trial and certainly never been on death row but Camus gave Meursault an inner dialogue that rang so true it felt more real than any other portrayal I've seen or read. Despite his crime and often callous view of the suffering of others Camus created a character so real and open to the reader that I couldn't help but pity him terribly for his situation but in the end Meursault found peace regardless of the outcome. If you haven't read this book you really should and it's a short read so if you don't find it as profound as I did at least you wont have to endure it for long."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Although Albert Camus had achieved some fame as a journalist in his native Algiers in the thirties and as a writer for the French resistance during WW II, he first achieved an international critical reputation with the publication of this classic novel in 1946. The portrait of the detached, unfeeling, uncommitted, amoral, perpetually abstracted Meursault is one of the most haunting in 20th century literature. For many, it is the supreme 20th century literary depiction of nihilism. Unquestionably it is one of the premier literary efforts of the century, though Camus managed several other books just as powerful and superb in their own way, in particular THE PLAGUE, THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS, and THE FALL.Meursault reminds me so much of figures from the paintings of Manet. In painting after painting, Manet depicted individuals alone in crowds, failing or refusing to interact or even acknowledge the others in the frame. In one famous painting, a lower middle class girl sits alone in her own little orb, sitting beside an upper class gentleman, neither acknowledging the existence of the other, both self-contained, seemingly detached from the busy world surrounding them. Behind them, a barmaid drinks a beer, equally oblivious to everyone and everything around her. They might all be on separate desert islands. Manet repeats this in painting after painting. Meursault seems almost as if he had stepped out of one of those paintings. He can at least communicate with others, socialize with them, but he cannot express strong moral sentiments or develop affectionate (as opposed to sexual) attachments.This is not a happy book. The story deals with Meursault's almost accidental killing of an Arab whose sister had been harmed by one of his acquaintances, but the novel trivializes everything--the killing, his subsequent arrest, his imprisonment, his trial and conviction, and his sentencing. The closest the novel comes to a happy sentiment is near the end when Meursault imagines how much nicer it would be to witness an execution rather than be executed, to have to puke in revulsion than to literally lose one's head to the guillotine.Camus would never write such a despairing book again. THE PLAGUE the next year would come close, but not close, while THE FALL would seem almost optimistic and upbeat in comparison. But for those who want to find perhaps the quintessential expression of what we like to think of as existentialism, this could stand as the premier literary instance."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger was the first novel of Camus' labeled &quot;absurd,&quot; and it defines Camus for most Americans. The plot is quite simple, with none of the diversions common in popular literature. The main character is not a hero, has no &quot;true&quot; love affair and the pursuit of money and power never enters the story. The Stranger is an honest atheist, waiting for life to happen.The title l'Etranger, has been poorly translated. The U.S. title, The Stranger, implies that the main character, Meursault, has been viewed as a &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;odd&quot; person for some time. The other possible meaning is that no one knows him. Meursault is a stranger even to those who think they know him. These definitions do not seem adequate. The U.K. title, The Outsider, only serves to confuse readers even more.Meursault is the archetype of a middle-class man. He works as a clerk, rents an apartment and draws no attention to himself. He is, if anything, very ordinary. Meusault might even be boring. He lacks deep convictions and passion. If he is estranged from any aspect of French society, it is religion--he does not believe in the symbols and the rituals of faith.Estranged? &quot;Cela m'est &eacute;gal.&quot;Along with the title, Camus took care in naming the main character. Meursault's name is symbolic of the Mediteranean sea. Mer mean &quot;sea&quot; and soliel is French for &quot;sun.&quot; The sea and the sun meet at the beach, where Meursault's defining actions occur.Meusault is an anti-hero. His only redeeming quality is his honesty, no matter how absurd. In existential terms, he is &quot;authentic&quot; to himself. Meusault does not believe in God, but he cannot lie because he is true to himself. This inability to falsify empathy ultimately condemns him. Meursault has faith only in what he, himself, can see or experience with his other senses. He is not a philosopher, a theologian or a deep thinker. Meursault exists as he is, not trying to be anything more or less than himself.Why did Camus' readers recognize Meursault as a plausible character? After two World Wars and much suffering, many people came to live life much as Meursault does. Or at least they tried to do so. These people lost the will to do more than exist. There was no hope and no desire. The only goal for many people was simple survival. Even then, the survival seemed empty and hollow. We learn how empty Meursault's existence is through his relationships. He is not close to his mother; we learn he does not cry at her funeral. He does not seem close to his lover, Marie Cardona. Of her, Meursault states, &quot;To me, she was only Marie.&quot; There is no passion is Meursault's words or in his life.What sets Camus apart from many existentialists and modern philosophers in general is his acceptance of contradiction. Yes, Camus wrote, life is absurd and death renders life meaningless--for the individual. But mankind and its societies are larger than any one individual person."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Without a doubt one of the most important books of the 20th century, The Stranger is a classic piece of literature and one of the literary pillars of existentialism, a movement that continues to color the way we see the world.The storyline is very simple: a young and aimless Algerian immigrant to France, Meursault, unmoved by his mother's death, becomes involved in petty events beyond his control and ends up killing someone. The trial is a ridiculous farce, and the real art comes from the way Meursault dispassionately describes the events overtaking him: the funeral, the trial, the sentencing. The story is at once beautiful and unsettling.Of course, none of this is anything that hasn't already been said among the other reviews here. What prompted me to write a review about this now (after all, I had first read this story more than 20 years ago and have only re-read parts of it recently) is the new and much-heralded translation from Matthew Ward. Mr. Ward's work has been almost universally praised by critics, who have called it an essential update and a production that will make the book more accessible to American audiences.That may be so, but I can't escape the feeling that it also cheapens this great book. I realize that some traditionalists will always accuse a modern translator of a classic piece of literature of tampering with art. But even if I keep that in mind as I read The Stranger in its newest form, I still get that sinking feeling.Take the opening paragraph, for example. I have always considered the opening lines in The Stranger among the best in the western literary cannon, and they seem to lose firepower in Mr. Ward's version of the story: \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe. I don't know. I got a telegram from the home: \`Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.' That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday.\\"Compare that to the classic Stuart Gilbert translation that is familiar to most English speakers to have read this book: \\"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says: \`Your mother passed away. Funeral tomorrow. Deep sympathy.' Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.\\"Don't the short and choppy sentences of the telegram contrast strongly to the emotionless as-a-matter-of-fact narrative from Meursault in the second example? And isn't that lost in the newer version when both Meursault and the telegram have the same tone? The Meursault from Mr. Ward's translation always talks that way, giving the impression that he actually puts a bit of thought into what should be his dispassionate commentary, rather than just speaking in meandering run-on sentences as someone simply going through the motions would (and the way author Albert Camus described Meursault in later years).Also, who is Maman? I'm not sure I would recognize the word as a form of \\"mother\\" if I weren't already familiar with the story.In sum, the value of The Stranger is beyond doubt. But consider the issue of the translations strongly, and, if possible, consider one of the older translations that create a story closer to what I believe Mr. Camus intended and not something that may have been crafted to subtly reshape the story for modern audiences."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I love this book. I have read several translations of The Stranger. But I returned this copy the same day it arrived in the mail. This translation by Matthew Ward, for the Everyman's Library, is the absolute WORST translation of The Stranger I've ever read. It takes all of the teeth out of Camus' masterpiece. It makes the book into a sloppy, uninteresting mess of colloquial language. It completely obfuscates the meaning, it gives the narrator an unintelligent and boing voice, and it doesn't even \\"Americanize\\" the narrator (which is this translation's claim to fame). Just consider a comparison of the opening sentences. The Matthew Ward translation:\\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know. I got a telegram from the home: 'Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.' That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday. The old people's home is at Marengo, about eighty kilometers from Algiers.\\"And the far superior Stuart Gilbert translation:\\"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.\\" The Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers.\\"How is the Ward translation (the Everyman's Library translation) Americanized? In what regional dialect of America are mothers referred to as \\"Maman\\"??? None that I have ever heard. Or the sentence \\"That doesn't mean anything.\\" It's completely ambiguous. What doesn't mean anything? What are you even talking about? Next, compare the last sentences of Part I, this translation:\\"Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.\\"to the Gilbert translation:\\"But I fired four shots more into the inert body, on which they left no visible trace. And each successive shot was another loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing. \\"Compare the grand \\"loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing\\" to the spineless \\"knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.\\" Matthew Ward probably never got past high school French. The list of passages that are mangled by Ward goes on and on... This translation suffers terribly from its translator. This translation doesn't do Camus justice. Don't get this translation - get ANY translation besides Matthew Ward's.Otherwise you'll be left with the impression that Camus was as bad a writer, and that The Stranger is as bad a novel, as Matthew Ward is a translator."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The plot of this novel means very little. The focus is really on the main character's arguably detached point of view, which personally, I found galling. His near-autistic lack of identification with anything--hence, I suppose, the title, makes one panicky by the book's end, as if one has just spent the day in a locked, sterile room with a dead man.Ironically, it's his lack of any detectable neurosis that ultimately is so disturbing....he's TOO Zen for comfort...It might help if he could muster sympathy for anyone, including the various victims of abuse that he encounters, or substantial feeling for the woman he is to marry, sadness at his mother's death, or empathy for the man he defensively (but pointlessly) shoots five times. The author seems to be making the point that he gets persecuted for not EXPRESSING emotion, but I as the reader was hard-pressed for proof that he FELT one.This lack of empathy becomes contagious to the reader; by the time he is sentenced to die, it is impossible to feel sorry for him. It is almost, in fact, a pleasure--for it gives hope that he might yet \\"shatter the bell jar\\" and break through his wall of apathy. But no, all he feels is a vague sense of disappointment that he will no longer know the pleasures of freedom (although pleasure in this book is a relative term). When ultimately he finds something he can identify with, it is nothing less than the \\"benign indifference of the universe\\", something he can connect with at last, as he gazes into the night sky, awaiting his execution at dawn.Galling but enthralling, \\"The Stranger\\" is a short and sweet read, deceptively simple, and despite itself, poignant. The protagonist's existential point of view--the axis on which \\"The Stranger\\" turns, will provide the reader with philosophical food for thought and--undoubtedly-- fodder for infinite debate."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The other reviewers base their interpretation of this novel on the belief that Camus was an Existentialist and that Camus presented Meursault as a hero. Concerning the last point, nothing could be further from the truth. Before interpreting &quot;The Stranger&quot;, one should first read Camus' essays on his own personal philosophy of &quot;The Absurd&quot; and how he relates it to the myth of Sisyphus. These essays reveal that Camus' personal philosophy was distinct from Existentialism in that he imagined that Sisyphus could be happy even though he was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in Hades only to have it roll down again on nearing the top. Similarly, Camus believed that people could be fulfilled by searching for the meaning of life even though they know they will not be able to discover it. Consequently, Meursault is not a hero in Camus' eyes because Mersault has given up trying to find meaning in his life and accepts without struggle the lack of emotion and spirit in it. In other words, don't trust everything that was written on the back cover of the american paperback edition of this novel. The back cover contained incorrect information that misled many readers, including myself, about the true meaning of this work. Read Camus' &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays&quot; before interpreting &quot;The Stranger&quot; and new meaning will become apparent from this excellent and frightening novel."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is as beautiful as any work of art can hope to be.It is in the latter parts of the book, where Mersault's words have a lyrical power not seen previous, that the English translation achieves the haunting effect that must be even more prevalent in the French. The first thing readily obvious is that the character has no emotional connection to what he experiences; he simply experiences. Thus, Camus utilizes an American style, terse and detached. Some reviewers were off put by this. \\"How could he not care that his mother died? \\" Attaching immorality to Mersault merely shows a total misunderstanding of the book.Camus believed in \\"absurd freedom,\\" life has no inner value and is futilely cut short, but it is up to us to determine our life in such uncertainty. If one doesn't interpret life, emotion doesn't exist. But the values that society has incriminate you if you don't conform. They make you strange. They take no account of individuality.That is the peril of the main character after a bizarre series of events on a sun drenched beach.The power of Camus is that even though he creates such a bleak, hopeless human situation the characters still go on as best they can, perhaps even attaining happiness. \\"One must imagine Sisyphus happy,\\" to quote The Myth of Sisyphus.That is also the power and beauty of mankind."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"If you don't know anything about existentialism before you read this book, you will after you finish it. Existentialism is basically the idea that life boils down to nothing more than existence. One lives their life while they are alive and then they die, and in the grand scheme of things none of it really matters. Existentialist, whose greatest representative is Camus, do not generally believe in an afterlife, spirituality or deeper meaning to life. For just over 100 pages, you are hit in the face with these ideas while reading The Stranger.The plot of The Stranger could be summarized easily and completely in a single paragraph. It is really not a plot driven book, although it does have a few moments of suspense. The pithy prose is concise and eloquent in the style of Hemingway, but does not rival him (at least in this translation). The text itself reads quite easily, and you will probably find yourself flipping through pages faster than you usually do.Overall, The Stranger is a modern classic and well worth the short amount of time that it takes to read. One of the reasons I may not have loved this book is because it is not in anyway uplifting. The book really leaves you with a sense of emptiness as you turn the last page, as it's meant to, so reading it might not be an enjoyable and light-hearted experience. Those interested in reading Camus for the first time may also want to consider The Plague as a first read. The message is slightly more subtle in its presentation and the story is probably more interesting."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I really liked the book &quot;the stranger.&quot; and i think that all the flaws that people point out in it are the very things that make this a great book. i recomend listening to the song writen about it by the cure called killng an arab. excusite"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Meursault, a frenchman living in Algeria (poor guy) lives a normal life. His mother died (does it mather?), he started dating Marie (don't speak of love) and he helped his &quot;friend&quot; Raymond when some Arabs wanted to attack him. He is a complete stranger to others, you don't know what he feels. All you know: he hates hot and sunny places and doesn't understand what he can't smell, touch or eat. Then he kills and is sent to prison. There he finally understands lifes meaning, the absurdity, what it all ment. Is it too late?I was agreably surprised when I read this book. Usually, what we read in French Litterature is horrible (like Zola, Maupassant, ...) but this was quite nice, perhaps a little boring at times. The story is short and you read it very fast. The characters are quite sympatic, even if Meursault is a little strange.It's really easy to analyse after you've understood how it works. I got the best marks when I analysed it at school. It's funny to read it after you've analysed it, because the story is much more deeper. It's a fine base for a philosophical debate on the absurdity of life and Camus has got some interessing ideas.You should really read it in French like I did, it's a lot better and the traslation is sometimes weird.If you're a teacher and want your class to read something more enjoyable than Zola, choose this book. Some can enjoy it (not me)."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I think it would be fair to say that this book is an important work in the world of letters that emerged after World War I. The \\"Great War to End All Wars\\" was a watershed in history because as \\"total war\\" it involved the civilian population as no previous war had. And because of the many new weapons of mass destruction that were used for the first time, ten million persons died and millions of others were wounded and mutilated.Albert Camus' father, Lucien, was killed in WWI, and I think it would intuitively be realistic to think that this had a profound effect on the thoughtful youth living in straitened circumstances in Algeria. In most cases, the death of a parent will take some of the glow out of childhood. Thus, we see a man who was personally affected and wounded by WWI and a Europe in the throes of disillusionment and recovery after 1918.To many, WWI was the straw that broke the camel's back. Why didn't God prevent the war with its enormous suffering? How could a just and good God allow man to be ruined not only by poverty but also by the havoc of the war machine? Why would a civilization governed by the rational ideals that reason and goodwill could work things out fail so miserably? Was the world, and the West in particular, not shaped by the idea that responsible action governed by the moral sense would create and ever-evolving, more perfect world? And was this not all a wretched lie?Surely then, we can begin to understand how Camus and others began to believe that they were living in an absurd world, a meaningless place, where, nonetheless, one had to go on living, and by one's choices create one's life and, in concert with others, the life of social man.Thus, out of the existential crisis of the moral and economic collapse of WWI, mankind, and European-kind, would rebuild its future out of the welter of lived experience, not on preconceived principles or models provided by religion or \\"bourgeois morality.\\"Thus, we see Camus' development of the absurd. In The Stranger, Camus uses the term only one time and seems to pass over it lightly giving it relatively little significance. He says, \\"What few people were about seemed in an absurd hurry.\\" However, his biographer points out that the entire feeling and mood of the novel really gives us the feeling of the absurd.\\"There is an irreducible difference between the notion and the experience of the absurd; indeed, \`The Myth ofSysiphus might be said to aim at giving us this idea, and The Stranger at giving us the feeling'.\\"How does the absurd arise? We have already suggested that WWI was the defining event for Camus and many others in bringing meaninglessness to the forefront of consciousness, but this is not to exclude many other elements.\\"The feeling of the absurd can arise in a variety of ways, through, for example, the perception of Nature's indifference to man's values and ideals, through recognition of the finality of death, or through the shock caused by the sudden perception of the pointlessness of life's routine.\\"Because life has become absurd, and because no eternal principles apply to direct this society, then the ultimate question becomes, \\"Why live?\\" And, if we choose to live, then we must reach some conclusion about how to live, how to move forward day-to-day.\\"Camus is well-known for his statement that \`there is only one really serious philosophical problem, that of suicide. To judge that life is or is not worth the trouble of being lived, this is to reply to the fundamental question of philosophy.'\\"However, Camus does not believe that suicide is the answer. He believes that man can devote himself \\"in a self-sacrificing manner to the welfare of his fellow man....if he does so without hope of reward and conscious that in the long run it makes no difference how he acts....it is possible to be a saint without illusion.\\"The idea of man in the absurd is only partially revealed in The Stranger, but becomes clearer if one reads, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Rebel, and The Plague. In these works, and others,\\"Human pride and greatness are shown [not] in surrender...but in living in the consciousness of the absurd and yet revolting against it by man's committing himself and living in the fullest manner possible.\\"Now, returning to the work The Stranger, we are in a position to answer a number of questions: Has Camus depicted an absurd world? Is the absurd a satisfactory alternative to the world of reason and morals that the absurd seeks to replace? Are any of the characters \\"living in the fullest manner possible\\" or on the road to becoming \\"saint[s] without illusion?\\"It is apparent that The Stranger does indeed express the feeling or mood of the absurd. The sense of meaninglessness is palpable, and the pathologies and criminal tendencies expressed in the various characters and relations among the characters are presented without any sense of judgment of their behavior. They are portrayed as though they are \\"just folks.\\" Indeed, that is the height of the absurd. On the other hand, the justice system with all its preconceived judgments about Meursault, about personality, and about sin or right and wrong is portrayed as expressing just so much hot air. The absurd life for Camus is simply accepting life as it is lived whether or not those lives are or are not being lived according to our preconceived judgments about how life should be lived. Life cannot be judged. It cannot be under-stood \\"from the outside.\\" Indeed, it remains obscure to those living it, but live it they must!Thus Camus draws a line in the sand. Which is real life - the lives depicted throughout the book or life seen through the prism of the moralistic magistrate, prosecutor, defense attorney, and prison chaplain? For this writer, although Camus might wish otherwise, Camus has depicted the problem, but not the solution. There is clearly a crisis of meaning in the modern world, and I would even state that I think it has reached to a deeper and more critical mass, so to speak, than when Camus was writing. We have lived through even more horrors than he, and the sense of meaninglessness, even nihilism, is more pervasive than ever. I even saw a young person with a T-shirt that read, \\"Whoever has the most things when he dies wins.\\" It would be fair to say that he was proclaiming an absurd view of life.I do not see any affirmation of \\"saints without illusions\\" in this particular work, and since Camus drew a line in the sand, it is my considered view that the Algerian court system with its perceived anachronistic morals and values is actually closer to truth and \\"reality\\" than Meursault or any of his cohorts.Camus has not confounded religion with his feeble and spurious unwillingness to repent or believe. In fact, insofar as we have been given the opportunity to get to know Meursault better than the prison chaplain, we can see that Meursault is far more darkened and hardened that the chaplain might have imagined.Nor has the novel revealed that middle-class values are empty. Indeed, the bourgeois goals of the American and French revolutions to provide every citizen with a fair trial exemplifies the inherent kindness and striving for justice that marks the post-Enlightenment, democratic civilization of Western Europe, and, in a different way, the United States of America.Yes, the crisis of values truly exists. It existed in 1940, and it exists today. Far too many have rejected the middle way of Aristotle's virtuous man, the \\"golden mean.\\" Far too many have rejected our institutions as based on lies, and unreal assumptions. Far too many have rejected faith in the true and living God, the redemptive power of the Cross of Christ. Yet, giving in to a tidal wave of meaninglessness is not nor ever can be the answer. The Stranger accurately suggests the parameters for understanding the absurdity of our times, but it does not even begin to suggest an answer that will transform a negative consciousness into a hopeful and happy one."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A short read (one can read it in a couple of hours or less), this is a book that I encountered in the same way that perhaps millions of others did, as prescribed high school reading (in my case in the mid-1980's). I remember being moved by it as a teenager; I re-read it again this week and found it an even more resonant and disturbing read as an adult.Because this is written from a first person perspective, the story engenders a level of sympathy for what is really an unsympathetic character; one who acts without forethought, passion, or regret. The central character, Meursault, is carried along by those around him, and seems to have an emotional void when it comes to his recently deceased mother, his loving girlfriend, and his own feelings. He eventually kills a man, and is charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to the guillotine. Despite that fact that the murder is not in dispute, the trial is prejudiced by character witnesses who provide information about Meursault that really has no bearing on his actions.The novel left me feeling unsettled towards a man who seems not to act in a way, or believe in those things that society deems conventional (ie. to express grief, to fall before God begging forgiveness for his wrongful deeds, to express any kind of remorse). Society rejects him because of this, and that fact alone made me feel sympathetic to him. The prosecutor calls him a monster. This is no monster; certainly no serial killer.The morality is murky here. That is why it is great fiction, and why it will continue to be pondered and discussed for years to come."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Philip, I really appreciated your review.

From reading low-rated reviews, I can easily say that none of these people can even understand the depth of this book. It is the eternal struggle: an outsider, who is persecuted because he is different. Anyone who thought this book was bad is a complete moron, it is a deep social commentary, which those ignorant fools will never understand."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is one of my absolute favorite books. I read it the summer after my grandmother died. I did not cry at her funeral, nor did I feel particularly sad--old people die. My friends noticed a smiley face on my calendar. I told them it was an unhappy face that marked the day my g-mom died, because I thought I'd forget otherwise. Their reaction to this shocked me; it was as though I killed her myself.Then I read The Stranger. Brilliant. The opening lines resonated: \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know.\\" Everyone seems to mark it as a disturbing book, but I cannot imagine a truer, more honest book. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has ever felt betrayed by society's judgments."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Absurd, in the sense that Camus uses it, has less to do with the everyday notion of \\"ridiculous\\" or \\"non-sensical\\" as some reviews here suggest, but with the idea that we seek some universal, transcendental meaning for Life in a universe essentially devoid of meaning.That Meursault is defined by many readers as \\"insensitive\\" or \\"bizarre\\" or \\"abnormal\\" simply reveals a basic need to categorize Meursault in a value system. However, this is precisely what Camus puts into question: assuming and applying values in a universe where values have no place or meaning is absurd. It is a futile gesture. This is what makes the court scene the absurdity it is, as it confronts someone who is evidently amoral and then condemns him in the name of all that is right and decent in society. \\"Right\\" and \\"decent\\" are the precious ideas we collectively fabricate for ourselves and maintain in order to help us feel that there is an essential order and justice in the universe and that there is a \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" distinguishable to all. But Camus book suggests--without denying the usefulness of such ideas--that this is a human thing: Meursault's actions (killing an Arab, not crying at his mother's funeral) are devoid of meaning ...from a universal perspective.Everybody dies anyway, so what difference how and whether sooner or later? That's just the way things are.Now, a thought experiment for those who keep Camus and his ideas at a safe reading distance: imagine witnessing a car accident...where children are involved. This happened to me in Madrid over 8 years ago, where I witnessed from a distance one maniac car tearing right through the car of a lone mother...with kids. The ramming car didn't stop: it just tore on. I shan't give any more details, as it is too painful. Now think, for a split second, how every feeling of horror, distress, and ultimately anger...the awfulness of it all. Then consider, if you can, the comforting stories offered by priest or psychologist to the remaining family. Perhaps you are the remaining kin. How profoundly inadequate and futile these must seem to cover one's sudden, naked exposure to the obvious indifference of the universe. Any attempt to give meaning to the event seems completely at odds with what suddenly, inexplicably happened. It just happened. That is all. The universe remains, unchanged. The word \\"tragedy\\" may provide an inadequate handle on events. But the senselessness, meaningless of it all has been glimpsed."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I havnt read this book. Ill buy it perhaps and put it on theshelf. Perhaps Ill add it to my wish list and leave it there.Whats the point. Or better yet-- Camus, Whats he trying to prove. I gave this book a four because 4 stars lined up look ok. I find it somewhat hypocritical that Camus would write this book to influence others. If he wrote it to publish in order to pay his rent, thats believable.. But if he thought to write a clever well written book to impress others... well it seems rather nonsensical. If he'd thought the joke was on us... he'd be wrong. The jokes on him.. and his pointless wasted life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Although Camus' The Stranger completely goes completely against my entire belief structure; it is a simple masterpiece of human indifference. It illustrates how many people in this world think, react, and feel about the purpose of life and whether any of it has meaning. The Stranger explores issues such as irrationality in the universe, the meaninglessness of human life, and how important the physical world is. Camus was himself a proclaimed atheist and these bleak issues shine through in the most haunting way.The Stranger is told in first person by a character named Meursault. He is attending his mother's funeral. He really doesn't care too much that his mother has just passed away. Merusault has a cold indifference concerning everything around him. He feels nothing most of the time, but he still feels very much like a real human being and not a cardboard narrator. On the day of the funeral, he mostly notices the weather and how hot it is, instead of what he should be focusing on: the death of his mother.The day after the funeral, life is back to normal again. Nothing has changed for Meursault. He meets a girl, takes her to a movie, and spends the night with her. This is a key sequence describing how logic never seems to grab hold of him. Where did he develop this attitude from? The novel never really explains, but our belief structure can never totally be explained.Meursault, soon after, develops a friendship with a man named Raymond. Raymond has a furious temper and has been known to assault women. On one occasion he beats up his Arab mistress rather badly. This leads to revenge that is attempted on him and Meursault later on in the novel by the mistress's brother and his friend.The climax of novel occurs on a sun drenched beach. Raymond has invited Merusault and his girlfriend Marie to spend the day there with a couple of friends. The morning starts out well enough. This small group of people goes swimming, talk, and eat a pleasant lunch together.After lunch Merusault, Raymond, and another fellow named Masson decide to go out walking. They spot the Arab brother of this mistress Raymond assaulted. He is with a friend, walking towards them. As they grow closer towards one another a fight breaks out, Raymond is stabbed, and the two Arab's flee. It turns out Raymond didn't suffer any major blows, however, and his is patched up at the hospital within a couple of hours.Later on that afternoon, Merusault and Raymond spot the two Arabs again on the beach. They stare at each other coldly, but no outbreak occurs and the Arabs walk away, Raymond and Merusault continue walking and Raymond decides he needs a rest. Merusault asks him for his gun and heads back in the other direction.Merusault soon spots one of the Arabs lying down on the beach, and in one of the most explosive and tense scenes in all of literature, guns him down.Part two of the novel deals with Merusault's time in prison, the trial of his crime, and the delivery of his sentence. This is philosophical section of the novel and possible the finest. Merusault is left alone with his thoughts which become increasingly urgent with impending doom weighing down upon his mind.The tone of The Stranger is appropriately detached and empty, much like its narrator. Notice how Merusault doesn't acknowledge anything by using judgment or emotion.He simply points out the \\"physical\\" things that people do around him. The weather being hot... the nice skin on a girl...the sand on the beach. He never states emotional things such as: I really loved being with her.....I liked the way she made me feel.....He had a good personality. Things like this are not noticed. Only the physical aspects of the world around him are. This is an underlying symbol of his detachment with God and the emotional side of the world he lives in. Merusault never breaks character. Camus molds him into the symbol of his own beliefs and never once strays from that path.It ironic that at the moment Merusault gives up all hope is the moment he is at peace and happy. As long as he clings to hope he is miserable. There is a key sequence at the end of the novel between him and the Chaplin. The Chaplin cannot accept that Merusault will not turn to God in his hour of need, but Merusault cannot understand why the Chaplin can believe in something that is illogical and unreal. When we die, that is all there is. Human life has no greater meaning.That is the central issue of the novel. There is no logic in the universe. There is no God, no higher being, no fate, destiny, or any outside force acting upon us. We are simply creatures of chance and coincidence. Personally, I feel that is a very bleak way to describe the world, but nevertheless it is a view many people believe in.The Stranger didn't change any of my beliefs, but it gave me a greater understanding into the minds of others. It unflinchingly went against all that I hold sacred. But it made me think long and hard. It helped shed some light on why people are the way they are, and at the same time strengthened the beliefs that make me who I am. That is one right we all have and no one can take from us: our beliefs and values. I felt like I was right there with Merusault in his hopeless little world he lived in. What makes a novel great is not whether or not you agree with the issues presented by an author, but rather the way the author presents them....and there aren't many greater at doing that then The Stranger.Grade: A"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Since Nietzsche announced the death of God, few novels have expressed the absurdity of the continuing life of faith in morality and moral responsibility as well as this compact little novel. Meursault is the ultimate enemy of society, from the opening chapter where he fails to hide the indifference he feels at the death of his mother, to the last pages where he faces execution at the hands of the judiciary, knowing that society cannot force him to play a game that he has had the courage to recognise as absurd."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Welcome to Camus' world as he bares his soul open to the benign indifference of the universe. Camus immediately captures our attention with the first three sentences of the \\"Stranger\\". Camus masterfully interplays his character's seemingly cold and unfeeling perception of life's events with his unwitting innocence. The psychology that abounds this story is amazing.I highly recommend this classic book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is a short novel that is fascinating as a character study. The protagonist is a young man, Meursault, who has a strangely detached, and yet benevolent, way of looking at the world. Mostly, he lives moment to moment, resigned and seemingly unmoved by most of what happens around him (including his mother's death). After a series of unfortunate events, Meursault finds himself on trial for murder, and those responsible for his fate mistake his detachment for evil and callousness. This novel shows how society treats people who are different, and how people are all too quick to label people &quot;evil&quot; that they don't understand."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus's Stranger is justly ranked among the greatest materpieces ever written for its simple style fused with an earth-shattering philosophy(Existentialism). This deceives the unread/untrained from considering the multiple layers of interpretation. (Who could ever forget the ending?) Calling The Stranger another book is like calling the the Mona Lisa another painting. You simply need to research the topic and Camus to comprehend the enormity of what is being presented (God, Man, Hope, Reality, Life, Absurd, time). Camus shows Hope and choice in Man are ineradicable, they are Forever! To quote Oedipus &quot;All is well&quot;.

In other words, we all got dirt in our past; I don't care, if you ARE the spitting image of Ghandi or Mother Teresa. Innocence simply does't exist. And, \\"democracy begins only when we all realize that we are guilty.\\" The point is: it isn't anyone's business what you think, do, or are. Herd instinct triumphs in this novel, alas! But, this book will make you want to fight for your individuality, overthrow the system, be who you are. And, it will make you detest the injustice that plagues the world. Get it and read it religiously. &lt;&lt;The Plague>> is also very good, adding another flavor of intimacy. Watch for the special parts where Camus lays out his interpretation of events- at the end of The Stranger- as this is where the madness of the injustice is explained. Forget &lt;&lt;The Fall>> unless you are reading for the existentialist philosophy, but still it isn't too hot. But, even in the good novels suspension of disbelief is a useful tool; use it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"No one was more responsible for the nurturing and development of the existentialist philosophies than Jean Paul Sartre. That said, Sartre's words simply lacked the power and more importantly the compassion and understanding of Albert Camus. Camus starts his text, The Stranger, with the literary equivalence of a powerful punch. He ends it with two punches. Despite my disagreement over key elements in his philosophies, I am nonetheless more than impressed with his concise voice and storytelling. The Stranger is not only a must read, but a mantra to many bearing the angst of irrelevance. I highly recommend \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" for further insight into this wonderful text."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"growing up, my last name was frequently misspelled as the author's last name. after 31yrs (no age jokes please), i figured it was time to read a piece penned by a man with whom i share many consonants and a vowel. i was not disappointed. mr. camus' story is easy to read and moves quickly (it's only 123 pages). mr. meursault is a man who seems to live his life on an even keel. he rarely feels or shows any emotion and other people find this odd. he seems indifferent when: his mother dies; his neighbor beats a woman in the apartment downstairs; his other neighbor abuses his dog; the woman in his life proclaims her love; the incident which lands him in trouble; and the subsequent debt he owes to society. the lack of passion and compassion in his psyche makes it impossible for people to understand his actions in the incident which lead to his trial. there is more to this but i won't spoil the ending for you."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A veces al caminar por la calle yo tambi&eacute;n he sentido esa desaz&oacute;n, esa falta de ra&iacute;ces en el mundo y pese a tener padre y madre, hermanos y esposa, siento que no pertenezco a este mundo, que yo tambi&eacute;n como el personaje de Camus, soy un extranjero en este mundo, que solo estoy de paso y que no importa lo que haga para cambiarlo siempre ser&aacute; as&iacute; y jam&aacute;s ser&aacute; de otra forma.

I was still searching for the meaning of life (still do) , my place in the world and also a light at the end of the tunel that I could follow. And man, what a blast..... It took me half a year to overcome it. I lost interest in life, I became so passive and numb that nothing really mattered. I almost dropped out of school. Camus book reveiled to me that there are really no answers out there, no purpose , no treatment and for that reason NO ACTION should be taken.All of our agonies and strugles for the truth of our existence that we desperetaly radiate to our universe just simply bounce back. There is noone out there to answer.And for that reason our existence itself has no meaning. It is absurd (paralogos in Greek) !I guess I took every word of the book literally. Now, after many years from the first reading I have come to terms with the absurdity of life, I know that there is nothing that I can do, but at least I will try to live a good life whatever that means. The book in retrospect made me a little bit wiser but I cant afford to follow it. It is self destructing.So be careful with this book, it could be a time bomb.

Meursault guilty of taking another man's life, unjustifiably, and with intent. I agree (some other reviewers apparently don't).Mersault is sent to prison awaiting execution. He doesn't seem to mind very much. His long term future certainly looks bleak since he has decided that there is no God, and he is scoring near zero on the repentence meter. Yes, he is an existentialist and a nihilist.So much for the renowned Albert Camus. Technically, this book is well written. However, I found it boring, only marginally believable, and generally depressing. For me, it was no more \\"thought-provoking\\" than observing someone in a cycle of picking and regrowing a scab (inexplicable, but not interesting). There is NO REASON for the acclaim that this novel has garnered (except perhaps that there are academics out there that wish us to believe that this philosophical tripe is truth).This is an unlikable story about a small unlikable man.

That much is clear.But, when one reads a novel, you expect the events in the novel to bring about some sort of change in the character. You expect the protagonist, at the very least, to be changed, for better or worse, after living through certain events in the novel.Here we have Meursault attending his own mother's funeral, a woman who has declared her love for him, and a murder that he committed, and none of it seems to have had any major impact on his way of thinking.For me this made this sparse novel a bit of a \\"why bother\\" read. Why do I need an entire novel, some 124 pages, to tell me that someone was completely unaffected by a few events? I find it a waste of time.And let's take this discussion one step further. If this is a novel about Meursault, who is not effected by the events that take place in the novel, then why even have Meursault in the novel at all?Glad I read the book.

Mr. Mersault encounters the horrors of life with a malaise of the unconscious. Camus brings together the complexities of life with simplicity and crisp language use (now seen by American eyes with recent better translations).

While Mersault comes across as pathetic, empty and lifeless, the listening reader will find himself in its pages."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is an extrodinary story that makes you think and wonder. Its detail and emotions make you want to read on forever. The book really effects your thoughts and it allows you to see human nature easily,"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger, written by absurdist philosopher and (obviously) novelist Albert Camus, is quite unlike any other book you will ever read: but do not mistake this originality for any innate worth.Indeed, if one were to draw worth from this novel, it's that it shows the logical and psychological consequences of accepting the absurdist idealogy, which states that Life is entirely absurd and pointless, and what one does makes no difference at all. The only thing precisely comparable of which I am aware of is, perhaps, Notes From Underground, although there are still many notable differences. Within the framework of this desolate philosophy we are witness to the tale of Meursault. I won't regurgiate the basic plot line here, as the other Amazon reviewers have kindly taken it upon themselves to state it as such from every different angle.The one thing I will vouch for in this book is his use of language. It is clear, cold, objective, and precise; it lacks entirely any notion of passion, desire, or even life. Why then, would I praise it? Because this style allows us to see the world as it is through the clear, dead eyes of Meursault; what we see in the book are his impressions entirely sifted through the filter of his philosophy on life. It's difficult to write prose that is both passionately eloquent and precise, and yet its even more difficult to write something with no passion or beauty at all, yet with a barren eloquence and precision that is the mark of the most disciplined type of mind. The feeling it gives me is the same feeling I have when I read The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles. Hopelessness prevails in this cruel universe of his. I can say that I don't share his universe, but I can certainely empathize with it, for I see it all around me every day. Perhaps there is no better work to show the emptiness that has prevailed in the 20th century.Why, then, the low score? Because this book has little if no positive worth at all. It's extremely unenjoyable to read, and one isn't able to catch a grain of meaning in this work... although, to be fair, it is a work about the nonexistence of meaning. It does accomplish what it sets out to accomplish, but what is the point of a book like this? Some books record the prevailing feeling of an era and some books wallow in it. This book wallows in the meaninglessness of Meursault's life, with no attempt to rationalize or justify this horrific mindset: why, at the very least Notes From Underground is used to depict what happens when man is abandoned by God, and the author's vision grows to offer a solution to the ailment afflicting all underground men in his later work; indeed, within Karamazov's Alyosha there grows a hope to escape the isolation surrounding the characters and their essential time period. Camus does not see this mindset as an ailment, however. He sees it as the natural state of existence. Now, it's certainely his right to believe whatever he wants and to write about his beliefs, but I can see very little reason to read this novel independently unless you're seeking to read well-written books, regardless of their meaninglessness.A classic indeed, but not all classics are good works of literature."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I think that The Stranger is a great book. Not only is this book an excellent departure from typical modern writing, it is also interesting in its own right. Meursault is one of the most interesting and well-fleshed-out characters I've ever read, and the book stays succinct, never becoming overlong or drawn-out. I actually felt Meursault's agitation on the beach, in the heat, with the light shining in his eyes; his annoyance in the cell with the chaplain. This book represents, to me, what can be done with a character if he's handled correctly, and even only as far as that this book is worth a lot. But it's interesting, too, which is definitely a plus. Overall, this book, short though it may be, is a welcome and worthy addition to my bookshelf.Textually, l'Etranger is quite a strange novel. It defies many typical writing standards, while putting exceptional emphasis on others. The novel is truly a character study, with the only world-building included solely to enhance the character. As such, the book probably won't be a favorite of the general populace any time soon, with the need of most people for description, details and heroes, characters that can be cheered for. Meusault, in any event, is certainly not much of a hero to root for.Reading The Stranger, I found myself wondering what kind of person Albert Camus is (was?). I haven't read any of his other stuff, but I find it unlikely that he is much like Meursault in attitude, or the novel would never have been written. On the other hand, how did Camus delve so deeply into the mind of such a man if he's never experienced a similar mindset? Is Meursault an embodiment of Camus' fears for the human race, what with his passivity and easy acceptance of everything, or is he an embodiment of the author's hopes, in his simple honesty and navet&eacute;? It would be interesting to find out where Camus got the idea for this particular personage.In closing, I would just like to point out a couple of things. First, I do know that this is regarded as an existentialist, modernist classic piece and whatnot, but I decided to judge it against other contemporary fiction because I don't really know much about that other stuff. And finally, this is definitely a book worth reading even if you don't end up liking it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I purchased this thinking it to be the american translation because the cover was the same.

Or would a white man really have been executed for killing an Arab (Moor)in N. Africa during what I presume was the late 1930s? The book first appeared in 1942. Had the setting been the USA during the same period, Meursault would've probably never even gone to trial. Maybe this says something about the difference between the colonialists and the racist slave holders in the USA."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":".In the story of the Stranger, one finds the lead character, Meursault lacking creativity and of passions within oneself, of the depth of conflict that burns in one's center that moves with chaos and value-positing; none of this can be found in Meursault. He is matter of fact in everything. True, his acceptance and passionless being allows him to under go his ordeal in subdued emotion and unenthusiastic plight, yet this groundlessness and existential being does not excite in living, but simply goes along in existing.Even in Meursault's act of killing, there lacks any real passionate fervor. His pulling of the trigger was just that; an easy act of the finger and no real understanding, that is, no depth in comprehension of the act itself, but merely a nonchalant action that seems to have been the best alternative of action at the time of occurrence. And yet, the lack of alternative actions is the problem.In each and every situation in Meursault's life, from the death of his mother to his sexual relationship to his befriending his neighbors, all is performed as a cog in a machine. As each piano key is hit, only to be in succession of what is already programmed on the sheet roll of music. The \\"last man\\" mentality of the Lockean view of self-preservation dominates Meursault's life as the bourgeois in existential nothingness and mediocre existence.Should Meursault suffer as he did for his actions? Were they really so evil? Were his actions simply the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or in this case, befriending the wrong person who caused these thugs to appear for Meursault to confront? If life can be reduced to existence over conflict then certainly Meursault could be pardoned. But the one must ask if Meursault's action, the act of murder, not of self defense, can ever be excused, simply for the fact that the man who committed such did so from a lack of inner conflict and passion, from an act that simply called to be for the moment it presided in.The answer to Camus' Meursault comes from our view of subjectivity or objectivity. The Stranger places us in the former as we are personally involved as we read the story from the inside view and thus we side with Meursault. Yet when we are able to detach ourselves and look objectively, we gain a higher perspective and thus a different viewpoint.Robert Shattuck, from his book Forbidden Knowledge, remarks on The Stranger with the following point, that knowledge can be double bound; subjective or objective;:\\"The closer one approaches to an event or to a person, the less securely one seems to know it. The trees obscure the forest. The more one knows, the less one knows. Perception itself requires a certain distance. Empathy hides more than it reveals.\\" p. 162Our closeness brings empathy, which distorts our power of observation and obscures the facts. That appears to be the case in Camus' The Stranger."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I found this book to be interesting. The main charater, Meursault, seemed so apathetic about life, I had to continue reading. But his apathy was very suffocating to the reader. I found the direction of the book odd; the outcome was definitely not what I expected. I suppose that some of the writing probably would have sounded different if it was in the original French. Overall, I think the story was well written and well developed."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I'm a psychologist, so I especially like this book for Camus' portrait of psychological alienation from society. Also, I thought I might not like having a new translation of this classic text, but I find I do like it. Camus was influenced by Andre Gide, and I think Gide's Immoralist and his Lafcadio's Adventures both complement the psychological themes in Camus' stranger, so I pass those recommendations along. If you get into the Stranger, reading Camus' earlier draft version of his first novel, published as A Happy Death, is an interesting undertaking that I enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is Camus at his most accessible...his thoughts are clear...the sentences short...the beauty and pain is apparent in every line...He does not miss a beat...The book is flawless...and beautiful"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"this was the first camus i read. the language is interesting and the story is compelling. quirky with meaning."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus in my mind is a phenominal storyteller. Though most would like to label him as a philosopher, Camus sparkles as a novelist. It may be his tone or apathy, I cannot yet tell, but this work is a guarenteed enjoyment. A life of apathy is not one to be lived by all, but if you ever had the urge to sit around doing nothing but couldn't take time out of your busy day, live vicariously through Mersault, the main caracter in this apathetic novel. I don't want to ruin the plot, so I'll just say that it will leave you thinking."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I feel compelled, on behalf of all of those interested in existentialism, to add my threnodic voice to all the other numerous and predominantly ebullient reviews of Albert Camus' *The Stranger*. As. I have stated in my summary, there is better existentialism to be found. If I wished to be rude, I would say that Albert Camus is just a Dostoyevskiy/Kafka 'wannabe'. I do not so wish it, so I will merely state that this book does not suffice to place him in the same catagory as those masters. If you really enjoyed Stranger, then *Crime and Punishment* will blow you out of the water."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"M. Camus has presented in his short novel an eye-openingly graphic portrait of one M. Meursault, a man wholacks an understanding of life. He is resigned to being anirrelevant force in the universe, having seen how littlecontrol he can actually excercise over the events in hislife. In listening to the case made against him in court,that he was a criminal by nature on account of his behaviorat his mother's funeral, his belief in his insignificanceis greatened. However, in the final pages of the book, hediscovers that he is what he does, for there is nothing elseto his being. Camus implies that this discovery is made byall people as they approach death, if not sooner.The basic tenet of existentialism, that our actionsdetermine the quality of our being, and that this is whatour free will is, is put forward very effectively in TheStranger. Meursault's dreary life, of which we are onlyshown a short time, creates an intense contrast against thepassion which he has for his last action: his death.A subtler means to this end is the use of time. Thestory moves quickly so long as the first person is acting.Once he is imprisoned, however, M. Meursault's existence isdevoted to remembering his life as it was, causing theaction to slow to a near standstill.This novel is perfectly representative ofexistentialism, embracing the importance of acton. Whileit focuses less on the interaction between people, as manymodern writers have done, the reader is spared the extremecynicism that Camus has proven himself to be capable of."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is the story of an &quot;average&quot; man who gets swept up into rather unfortunate circumstances. He kills a man in self defense, but is charged with pre-meditated murder. Camus uses this discomforting tale to explore the framework of 20th century existentialism.No doubt this is a post-modern work. The extraordinary degree of apathy demonstrated by the persona is something that reminds me of the blandness of the characters in Earnest Hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot; Nothing means anything to him. Not life. Not marriage. Not the death of his mother, and not his own execution.Reading this book, one becomes transfixed with the horrible plight of this miserable man. We sympathize with the absurdity of it even as we shake our heads at his deplorable character and lack of judgment.This novel is terse, but it is powerful. The power is not lost in its brevity, but rather focused in it. I would recommend that it be read alongside the short story &quot;The Wall&quot; by John Paul Sartre. Both are what I would call trademark works of existentialism."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read The Stranger as a class assignment with a group of fellow classmates. We chose The Stranger from a selection of the AP works of literature. To be honest I wasn't really sure I would enjoy this book. The description given to me was seemed very heartless and dispassionate. Not the type of book I would see myself pick up as entertainment. The first couple chapters reminded me of this boringness I had thought existed from the turn of the first page.I soon found myself caught up in Meursault's, the protagonist, dull and emotionless world. After going to his mother's funeral and not showing one sign of misfortune his world started to become filled with bad events turning even worst when his violent human nature had become more present with each new page. This Algerian Frenchman gets caught up in a meaningless relationship in which he doesn't give a hoot if he gets married or not; become aware of an abusive relationship involving a friend who will later laugh about the hits and blows to his girlfriend; and will in the end find himself in jail after killing a man simply for the hell of it.Meursault seemed to make the killing just another thing. To me murders aren't just another thing. Every series of unfortunate events seems to roll of his back and he moved on like nothing ever happened. Sometime I wondered if he made the things happen....? Never the less this book as confusing from the start and never seemed to \\"tie the knots\\".The boringness yet still vaguely interesting flow of Albert Camus's The Stranger would not be one of my favorites. But seeing another world through the eyes of a killer does caught your attention for 20 or so pages while making you eyes close for the next 30. Even though this book kept me entertained in and out till the end I would say it wasn't all book motivated. After all this was a class assignment.Caroline CannSophomoreLandrum High School"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"L'tranger is Camus' most linguistically straightforward and seemingly accessible work, yet translating its startlingly simple French into English is not a straightforward task. This translation is diferrent to that with which I grew up (published by Penguin as \\"The Outsider\\" in the UK, with the same translation being sold as \\"The Stranger\\" in the US), but no better. Both are, in many ways, very good, but neither really gets what Camus was saying in French. I suspect this is partly because simplicity and clarity of expression have been mainstream in English for generations, while such an approach taken by a pied noir Frenchman (already known as a bizarre philosopher among the chattering classes thanks to the \\"Mythe de Sysiphe\\") was actually pretty revolutionary.A wonderful novel, one that is seemingly easy to translate, but one that really must be read in the original.Translating this book is like translating a haiku. Not something that the smart would attempt."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This novel begins with the main character's mother dying. He describes with dispassion the funeral and his lack of feeling about the whole thing. This lack of emotion is the main characteristic of this man as we follow him through his ordinary, uninteresting life. He has a girlfriend who he admits that not only doesn't he love her, but thinks the question is meaningless. He agrees to mary her if that's what she wants. He befriends a man in his apartment building who leads a seedy life as a pimp and admits he has no reason to be his friend but also no reason not to. Eventually this leads to a confrontation with some Arab men who are after his friend and he shoots one of them. The second half of the book describes his time in jail and with his lawyer and his trial.This book is basically Camus's philosophy of life in novel form. He does not believe that God exists, so therefore our lives are based purely on our actions. We have complete control over whether we do something or don't and either way there is no meaning to it. If you subscribe to this thinking, you would probably enjoy the book. For me, I couldn't get much joy from it because I disagree with the main character's thinking. There is so much mundanity in the book. I'm sure it was written this way to show you the meaninglessness of this man's life, but it doesn't make for interesting reading.

His calm and cool demeanor during the all-night vigil and subsequent funeral surprise and repel the residents who knew his mother. Dazed by lack of sleep and dizzy from the long walk to the village church in blistering heat, Meursault says little and remains outwardly unemotional.Back in Algiers he spends a pleasant weekend with his casual girlfriend and agrees to help an acquaintance from his building write a warning letter to his unfaithful Moorish mistress. The plot is barely visible up to this point, when the gender and racial feuds become a serious vendetta. Emotions escalate as tropical passions erupt in both premeditated and implusive violence.If Part I may be called The Crime, Part II proves the Aftermath. The unnamed anti-hero can be described as the prisoner and later as the defendant. His vauge, controlled responses confound his interrogators and dismay the earnest Catholic chaplain. More concerned with adjusting to the harshness of prison life, Meursault devises a mental stategy to cope with deprivation: women, cigarettes and personal freedom.Even hs court-appointed defense council often despairs of him during the long months before the actual trial.This novel provides interesting contrast between French and Americancourtroom prodcedure. But why is the strange prisoner--almost outside the pale of normal human emotions--really on trial: for the murder of an Arab who was stalking his friend, or for not being a good son? Was his &quot;Crime&quot; against society in general more shocking than a beachside shooting practically in self-defense? Narrated in the more intense first person, THE STRANGER offers insights into social (or emotional) deviants--examining how civlization seeks to justify or punish them. Camusdeliberately ends his story prematurely--leaving readers to fill in their own denouement. Is society truly in danger from the dark tides of one man's soul? How could this Sizzling Sands murder have been prevented? Just what has the prisoner learnedfrom his experience with French Justice?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I personally view this book as a character study of an extremely self-absorbed individual. It's fascinating how differently the main character sees events from that of other people as a result of his extreme propensity to look inward. Overall, I get the impression that Camus intended to warn readers of the dangers of worshipping individualism by showing an extreme form of it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A good book. Sometimes Mersault seems so cold, but I can't help but have sympathy for the guy. One idea I liked is, is our existence based on who we see ourselves to be, or by how others view us? Sadly, Mersault was judged and condemned for who people thought he was. Maybe this should open our eyes to be more understanding of the people around us. Anyways, it's an OK book, and I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The magic Camus works with this novel is not entirely within the plot nor the ending, but rather in the cumulative emotional effect. Its funny to read some of the other reviews, calling it &quot;too depressing&quot; or &quot;odd.&quot; This isn't a trashy dime novel to be taken on the same intellectual plain as Danielle Steele or Olive Ann Burns, but rather a serious philosophical work in the style of Derrida or Sartre. If you liked this, try Derrida's The Postcards."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is the first book I read by Camus and it inspired me to read more. If you like books with lots of plot and little introspection this is not for you, but it is the short plot that makes it more interesting I think. Mersault lives in an algerian town in the 1940s and this book describes his life and a crucial event in it. The point of the book was to show us how our actions and thoughts are dominated by society's expectations. In it Mersault is presented both as a conscious human being whose actions we (as him) understand but also as the monstrous figure he presents himself as to society, re: attitudes to his response to the death of his mother, the way in which he treats Marie. I was struck by this book because not only could I see myself in Mersault re his sensualism, and selfcentredness, but also by the way in which I as part of society condemn the actions of others.It is a simple book to read, but one which will make you think, so I recommend you try it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I am currently reading this book for my AP English class. At first I didn't have a damn clue what the hell it was talking about. But like they always say try try again. The Stranger is about a man named Meursalt who is expected to go by what society expects everyone to live by. When his mother died Meursalt showed no emotion and with that, society thought of him as a selfish and cold-blooded man. After he killed the Arab he was sent to jail. At his trial they brought up his mother's funeral and the way he acted. Then they brought up the way he has no remorse for killing man. I think this book is a great example of Existentialism because it shows how society makes up who people are and what they must become. I recommend this book to whoever is patient and is perseptive."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is very easy to read, but very hard to read well. It was amazing!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The only part that is worth mention is the simple manner in whcih Camus writes... the message is somewhat worthwhile.

It staggered me when I first read it in high school, and I continue to return to it again and again. The prose is startling in its purity and sharpness, the characters are memorable in their seeming bare bones simplicity, and the message is one to live by, even though carrying it out requires a lot of courage. Camus was a truly great man, and this short yet metaphysically stimulating and emotionally draining book is his masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This was a wonderful book. It is a great example of exstatentialism(sorry about the spelling). It was well translated, but Ihope to read it in french someday.

I give it 5 stars:)"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I read this book, I felt a connection with Meursault.

Let me tell you one thing about Albert Camus: he was definately a genius. Let me tell you another thing: Meursault is not a genius. I agree, he doesn't &quot;play the game&quot; well, but doesn't he eventually learn how to play? It's a psychological masterpiece but it's not for your every-day-Joe. John-Henry-next-door probably won't appreciate Albert, but your brainiac second cousin might eat it up.

The translation of it is not; Stuart Gilbert's translation of the _L'Etranger_ is worthy of five stars."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A lot of people are confused and have wrong notions about what The stranger is about, here's what Camus himself said about it, and is in my opinion the best explanation, &quot;...the hero of the book is condemnd because he doesn't play the game. In this sense, he is an outsider to the society in which he lives...you must ask yourself in what way Meursault doesn't play the game. The answer is simple: he refuses to lie. Lying is not only saying what isn't true. It is also, in fact especially, saying more than is true and, in the case of the human heart, saying more than one feels. We all do it, everyday to make life simpler. But, contrary to appearences, Meursault doesn't wnat to make life simpler. He says what he is, he refuses to hide his feelings and society immediately feels threatened.&quot;Albert Camus, January 8 1955"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Compared to the &quot;otherr&quot; essential existential text: Nausea, this one is the heads up winner. I have been a study of existentialism for four years and I have read each work twice and presented a paper over the poor quality of Sartre's attempt at the existential novel (not to say his other works are not worth the time, quite the contrary, &quot;No Exit,&quot; in my opinion, is one of the geast works ever put on the stage). Rather Camus' work encompases the wholeo f exsistential theory without dragging the reader down into his political ideologies along the way. This is a true masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"existentialism brokered to fit a minimalistic nature within a man, a detailed foray of the solidarity that each person invariably edges towards."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"First of all, I don't think Meursault is a human being. He is much better than a human being for his lack of consciousness, will and desire. These are the factors that make human beings suffer and commit crimes, and reasons people are fear of death. Meursault doesn't. Although Meursault has no love, humanity, he doesn't have hate, resentment either, which is the worst, the most pathetic, evil emotion of human beings. The origin of the murder is the resentment between the Arabian and Meursault's freind. They are the people should be condemed. Meursault just serves as a medium. Meursault himself has no intention to kill the person. The reason why he made another four shots to the dead body is to show he's responsible for his role. Moreover, he refuses to argue to beg for a life or lies to himself to believe something he's not sure of, he takes everything quietly instead. This makes me think he behaves like a Jesus, or, from an oriental point of view - a Buddha. When Meursault takes the gun from his friend, it gives me a feeling that he is saying, &quot;My friend, your resentment is evil, you are the one who's guilty, but I'll bear it for you.&quot; Just like a Buddha says, &quot;If I don't step into the Hell, how can the Hell be empty?&quot; Anyway, a very good book to read. I suggest don't treat Meursault as a human being. No human being can be as great as he is."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"An honest human being who is responsible for his social role and being executed for unwilling to accept any pre-defined social values that he doesn't believe. A good book for any real human beings. We are not able to and have no right to judge the moral issue in this book. But we have to think about life honestly when facing ourselves. Something exists with thoughts alone and nothing to do with any sensation or materials. This book definitely helps us to think.Those people who contempts this book have no serious thoughts about the real life and real value. It's not much difference of they never read this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus' novel is built around a very interesting man, M. Mersault. His philosophy in life is probably very different from the reader's, but the fact that he hangs on to this philosophy through all his trials and tribulations forces the reader to seriously consider his way of life, its advantages and its disadvantages. The book is short enough to be fairly entertaining, and the plot easily draws the reader into the &quot;stranger's&quot; life. Try it, especially if you are looking for some food for thought."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"sentiments that i have always felt, but have never had the language to articulate. i know how the stranger felt and thought, but have always failed to communicate them. i am the stranger."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is a pleasent, if not disturbing read. If pleasent and disturbing can agree this book is where they would meet. As a non-philosophy student, I can boldly say this is a good existential read. It is often superficial in plot . However, Camus does a splendid job in portraying a life of a static character. the stranger does not have a rueful bone in his body, yet takes responsibilites for his actions.I partically enjoyed this read. It was fascinating to see philosophy in action. When you read this you can pick out all the things the stranger partically enjoys. One that any human does: good food, sex, warm sun, the summer evenings. I thought him complaining about the wet towels in the bathroom was great!!! Who doesn't like dry towels at the end of the day."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The prose of this book accurately portrays the diff. moods &amp; settings that it implies,for good &amp; bad,narrowing into the silent &amp; dark window within Meursalt's mind.The short &amp; stiff sentences of the first part actually left me drained,stunted &amp; exhausted as if I were actually transported to the sweltering heat of the day that Meursalt's mother was buried.And the second part lossens up to longer more lyrical passages that give height &amp; drama to the transfixing &amp; bizarre ordeal that the main character had gotten himself into.I do not agree with Camus's brilliant(but false)statement that this book is about the &quot;nakedness of man faced with the absurd&quot;.On the contrary,Meursalt couldnt have been more clothed in preparation against the icy blizzards of life's unexpectancies.His detached &amp; unsentimental regard for life's superficial perks of inspiration has steered him away from further horror than what was actually afforded to him.And his reaction to the judgement that was so unfairingly decided on him is the perfect enscapulation of the pure enlightenment that a human being could ever achieve in this life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Boy, did you ever just want to shake some life into someone? Camus' character, Mersault is like a walking zombie; everything he does is predictable and then surprising. The short, choppy style of writing in Ward's version is also a paradox. Ward takes you on the straightest, yet most exciting roller coater ride you've ever been on considering the fact that his character doesn't seem to give a darn about most things. You have never met a more honest character than Camus' Mersault. Perhaps this is why Mersault becomes somewhat of a hero rather than just another plebeian character. Camus asks through Mersault, how are we to be significant human beings is we are all supposed to be like one another? Read this book and you'll find out how Mersault knocks off the chains of society. It may be dark, but none the less it is thought provoking and even humorous."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A terrific read. Very dry, engaging, and clips along at a good pace. I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage. M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of &quot;getting by.&quot; Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life. &quot;Effect&quot; instead of &quot;Cause.&quot; The story begins with a death, and ends with a death. In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's &quot;fiancee&quot; or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes. Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon. Be &quot;Cause.&quot; Not &quot;Effect.&quot; Get out and LIVE. Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply &quot;getting by.&quot"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is exremely well written. The language is descriptive and the words are chosen with care and knowledge. Lines like th end of part one where he describes his shooting a gun as the loud rapping &quot;of fate at the door of my undoing.&quot; You can't beat stuff like that. But as existential novels go, it is not the best, yet it is one of Camus' better works. It took me two hours to read the entire book, but I am still thinking about it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus' captures the essence of existentialism through style and tone in this masterpiece of modern narration. M. Meursault's summarized tale raises questions of motivation, existance, religon, etc. This ambiguous narrator tests the context of a life so absurd that the novel will have you pondering for days! A halmark novel that deserves attention from any bibliophile"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus has written a story in the simplest form to investigate an extremely complicated side of human nature. Every word uttered by the narrator causes even the most apathetic human to read it twice, constantly asking how he could so callously brush off every event in his life. This is a book that not only asks, but demands to be read several times"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I first started reading it, or rather, more precisely, about 3 quarters of the way through it, I was somewhat puzzled, hoping that each new page I turned would reveal something that would point to the actual PURPOSE. I didn't think it was necessarily a BAD book, simply that i didn't see any real point to it. 'Why would anyone write a book like this?' i thought to myself. 'I mean this M. Meursault is just a comnpletely self-centered loser, indifferent to life itself.' By the last chapter, however, when he is thinking over his ever-looming beheadment, the writing and descriptions of the concept of life and death to an ordinary person with no real biases whatsoever, was so thought-proking and beautiful that i could've cried. After finishing it, however, i was still a little confused as to what the point was. About 3 days later, i was still thinking about it, mulling each chapter over in my head--a definite sign of a good book. (After all, even if one can read a book, give it a shallow label of &quot;good&quot;, but never thinks about it again or probes it for meaning, how good was it?) Finally, (I think) I came to a conclusion: M. Meursault's thoughts as he was awaiting his execution finally resulted in a basic gist of &quot;well, we all gotta die sometime, so really, no big deal.&quot; I think the contrasting, implied meaning that Camus was trying to bring out was, &quot;yeah, we all gotta die sometime, THUS, it's not death--how it's carried out, or when it occurs--that's important, but rather, what you do on this earth in LIFE.&quot; I believe M. Meursault's last remark, &quot;For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration&quot;, summed that very idea up well, indeed. It sort of leaves one (or at least ME) with an impression that M. Meursault has one last resolve to make something memorable and extraordinary out of his life, if it be only his execution; one last attempt at trying to live out the life he remained passive and indifferent toward during his time on earth"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Is the protagonist a sociopath, a retard, a genius? Camus does an incredible job of letting the reader decide if Mersault is guilty or not. You can even blame the sun for the murder. This book has no fat and leaves you thinking"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is a surprisingly deep novel where nihilism, existentialism, death, life, accepted values, personal values, irrationality of nature, and common tendency to search for purpose in life are all interlaced. Through Meursault [indifferent, not hedonistic or emotionless, but responsive to physical pleasures], Camus shows how intolerant society is to alien points of view, and how it tries to intergrate the unknown into its rational system of values. By showing that life is purposeless and everyone will die at some point, Camus suggests that the &quot;evilness&quot; or &quot;goodness&quot; of an action are all the same. The ultimate triumph is the realization : &quot;So close to death, Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her.&quot;; in two words- Amor Fati. [Love of Fate]Many will unhesitatingly place this novel in the top ten books in human writing history- it doesn't all have to be Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus himself termed The Stranger, \\"The nakedness of man faced with the absurd.\\" I'm not sure that's my immediate perception of this book, but it's an accurate enough depiction of one perspective of it. When Camus was in his early 20's, he wrote A Happy Death, which is apparently a precursor to this idea that murder ultimately leads to the murderer's freedom. At face value, the idea is absurd. After thinking about it more, it's still absurd.Granted, my agreeing with this sentiment neither makes this book better nor worse for it. The book is intriguing, written in a direct & simple style that Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace would do well to copy. There is little which the reader needs to assert for himself, at least regarding what is said and what is meant, since there is little need for interpretation. What lies beneath, namely the main character's fragile and fractured psyche, is another story altogether.In this we are led through a life, an unfeeling and direct life of mild observation and little action. Observations are made through a pane glass of unfeeling, that nothing matters. Clearly this reflected a lot of Camus' own opinion on life, as his books often explore the theme of life's uselessness. The main character is an epitome of that opinion, which we see flood through in the book's final pages.This flood is one of pent up emotion, a flood which I did not anticipate. Through this release we see the freedom that Camus refers to elsewhere, that the condemned is the only one who can truly be free. Conversely, he intones that all of us are condemned. Thus the question is begged, are we not all capable of this same freedom which the imminently condemned grasps?These are questions in a vacuum. Perhaps the Camus scholar has been through these questions and surmises that he or she knows the answers already. Or perhaps Camus suggested the answers in other books. I offer these thoughts in ignorance of alternate studies and sources. I offer these thoughts in my own space of having read this book - not as a scholar nor a Camus expert, but as someone who reads and came across this book through a book store clerk years ago.The book is good, not great. The themes are dark, mired in the head of the depressed. It's not a book anyone can enjoy. There is no happy ending, and little laughter. It's a morose treatise on the pointlessness of life. Regardless of your agreement with it, it's still a good read so long as you keep a certain perspective."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I picked up The Stranger expecting the worst. With a sigh I sat down to read it, and about an hour later, I put it down. I sighed again, shrugged and then ate lunch. At dinner, I told my father that I had finished reading it, and my reaction to the text. He grinned and waved his fork. &quot;That's exactly what Camus was writing about.&quot; Confused, I read the book again. And this time, I liked it. The more I read it, the easier it was to understand. I felt connected to the characters, and sympathized with the events in thier lives. The Stranger nows has a special space in my bookcase."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Meursault, the protagonist of Camus's &quot;The Stranger,&quot; is a forthright man living in a society that insists on putting up facades, which he is unable or unwilling to do. He would just like to &quot;be.&quot; His troubles begin when he learns that his mother has died and attends her funeral, showing no remorse for having been inattentive to her during her final years. Through a series of events, he arrives at a situation where he murders a man on a beach, an action seemingly provoked only by the sun. The tone of the book is such that Meursault is not meant to be judged for his actions, just observed.The supreme irony of &quot;The Stranger&quot; is that Meursault is as honest as a person can be, yet it's because of this honesty that he is ultimately punished. The problem (or is it a problem?) is that Meursault is honest not only about what he does but about what he feels. Society's sense of decency is offended by the fact that he would not show any emotions at his mother's funeral and shortly after would go swimming and see a movie with his girlfriend rather than spend some time in mourning. His prosecutors in the murder trial use these acts as evidence to establish his character in the minds of the jurors as callous and decadent.Like Franz Kafka's &quot;The Trial,&quot; &quot;The Stranger&quot; questions the individual's ability to control his own fate, with the additional idea that one person's fate is no more or less preordained than another's. Meursault acknowledges that he had lived his life one way and yet could have lived another just as well: Does it really matter?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"That's what Mersault (the main character) seems to do. He just lets thing happen. &quot;The story of an ordinary man who unwittingly commits murder?&quot; No.&quot; The story of a man who unwittingly wakes up, walks on the streets, helps a friend, eats, drinks...&quot; Committing a murder is just a detail. This is about a man whose indifference about the word makes him either too different or too ordinary. Depends on how you look at it. Things happen. You don't want to miss this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The novel The Stranger by Albert Camus is a deceptively simple story by the Nobel Prize winning existentialist author. In narrating the story of Meursault, a seemingly ordinary man, Camus separates his readers into two categories: Those who follow his beliefs, and those who do not. Due to the absolute natures of both sides of this discussion, there can be no median. If one stops to reflect on the circumstances of our existence, a startling decision is to be made. As emotion clouds our judgement and batters us with the possibility that there is no reason for us to be here, we run. We run towards religion or a belief in a higher force that validates our lives. In the end, this is the ultimate weakness that diseases humanity. The main character, Meursault, embodies the true existentialist hero. In the beginning of the story, he does not have a full understanding of the &quot;gentle indifference of the world.&quot; However, his completely unemotional demeanor paves the way for his eventual enlightenment. While considering his predicament, he cements the realization that there is no inherent meaning in, of or for life. As people confront the possibility that their lives are merely inconsequential specs in the universe, they fabricate homilies and tie themselves to these descriptions which amount to little more than the multitudinous myths of cultures in existence at the dawn of humanity. In The Stranger, Camus tells readers that gaining this existentialist insight is fairly simple. One must open ones mind to the more reasonable possibilities which explain our universe."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Many people complain that The Stranger is a boring or maybe depressing book. I can see nothing depressing and if the book makes you think, how can it be boring? This book made me think, what is the meaning in life? What can we do to attach meaning to life? Is the way I lead my life the way that I would like to in an ideal situation? This book is essentually about society and those who are the most ingrained and dependant on society are those who will have the stronger reaction to it. Meursault, the main character, is a rebel to society, not in any exiting way but in that he refuses to fake emotions that he does not have. It is a rebellion in direct contrast to our society. If a murderer shows no remorse for the slain he is more likely to be locked away for ever or put to death. It is that exact emotion that is not felt or faked by his emotion that leads to his downfall. For those of you who like activism and/or satire their is plenty. The justice system is poked at as well as society. Finally I must say that the language is absolutely beautiful. Especially if you can read it in the original French. In his simple style Camus wins my praise for &quot;talks least, says most.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I would have to say that Camus' The Stranger was one of the most boring books that I have ever read, but the point that he was trying to make was a good one. I thought that despite my dislike of the protagonist, I could still relate to the point that Camus made with this novel. Part One of The Stranger was the more interesting of the two because there was more action and more going on. Part Two was just the trial and the jail, which got repetitive after while. Although Part Two contains the essence of Camus' message and Part One is mainly to set up the second half, I most definitely enjoyed Part One more. To me, Part Two was basically hearing the same stuff over and over again, but with slightly different words each time. And this does get Camus' point across, but I got bored with it about half way through. I have read some of Camus' work before, and enjoyed most of it. I must say that I did not like this novel as much as some of his other works that I have read, but I did enjoy it more than other existentialist literature that I have read in the past."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I know that I should be all for expanding my literary horizons, and usually I am, but Camus' The Stranger is just downright boring. Sure, it made me think and that's great and all, but the story wasn't interesting to me in the least. The only reason I got a lot out of this book was because of the interesting class discussions that we had about different parts of the book. These discussions tended to drift away from the actual plot, which is one of the reasons that they could hold my attention more than the book could. Not to say that this book wasn't worth reading. It was a short book and it honestly made me think about my life and how I relate to the people around me. Also, since I was assigned to do the creative commentary on this book, I got more involved with it than some of the other members of my class. My creative commentary focused on the personality of the lead character, Mersault. He is compared to all of the other characters in the book who are flat and only there to bring out the absurdity in Mersault. This book also helped me to better understand existentialism. I had read works by both Camus and Kafka before, but this was the first one i truly understood. I think the class discussions may have played a role in that, because my teacher helped to explain the parts of the book that were unclear to us."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I chose to read this book for my AP English's 'classic novel' project. This book is simply phenomenal for me. If you take this book at face value, it will appear quite stupid and somewhat pointless, as the plot isn't exactly stellar excitement and characters simply are not too vivid. However, as one reviewer stated before, you must read this book at a higher intellectual plane than other pure-action books. The power of this book comes from its overall effect, not any specific part. How will Meursault react when he is faced with our absurd society, and all its subsequent requirements, expectations and judgments? Read and find out...."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Through the main character's experiences, Camus brilliantly forces us to think about the way we live our own lives. Essential reading, if only to make one aware of how sad it can be to just let life pass you by without an attitude."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is an exploration of absolute freedom and the indifference of existence to human desires and preconceptions. Whether you like M. is not a central point (although it could affect your enjoyment of the book, certainly). He does not really &quot;not care about anything&quot; - he just doesn't put value on anything beyond immediate sensation, and in the end he becomes passionate about the value of sensation. Can we obtain wisdom from this odd fellow?In the end he is alone in a jail cell, awaiting certain death, with nothing but his solitary mind and memories. That's where he was in the beginning, and where everyone in the book and the world really dwells; he has just been more acutely aware of it than others. His life at the end has no more or less &quot;meaning&quot; or even pleasure to offer than it ever has, but he has awakened to the immediacy of life and experience.No one else in the book accepts these facts, and they all spend time pursuing &quot;greater&quot; concepts to avoid M.'s reality. That is why he is judged and condemned, and that is why it doesn't matter. They have taken nothing from him, and they just merge with the rest of the indifferent and absurd world. This is the vision I took away from the book, anyway.Needless to say, I find this disturbing. I'd really like to say M. and Camus are wrong, but some of these propositions are ring true. I will remember this book forever, I'm sure. I can't give anything higher praise (certainly not in my limited absurd sensory universe)."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"one of the most brilliant author writes about the extreme solitude of a man...the isolation and self-absurdism..which only allows a man to rediscover himself from prison cells...the joy and the happiness apart from the surroundings' noises are rediscovered, refined and re-absorbed..fascinating how a man become free...indespicably defiant of social standards, and judgement.."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In Camus's L'Etranger you have the absurd murder and you have the official murder,you have lived experience,and the official account of that experience,the inadequacy of language and the absurdity of the world.Meursault is the poor man stripped naked who lives in the present,for the here and now with intensity,immediacy, spontaneity,pleasure and happiness.He does not sacrifice the pleasures of today for an imaginary future or another world.The words \`guilt' and \`sin' mean nothing to him,the language of the court and the chaplain,the word \`love' likewise is something he doesn't understand.He has a lucidity and awakening in the presence of the imposed sentence of the court,in the presence of death,that he is fundamentally happy.The murder he committed is understandable if not excusable,it happened by chance;but the judicial crime of execution is inexorable,put in place by social mechanisms that pay no heed to Meursault's feelings,that commit rational murder.It was human justice-for not crying at his mother's funeral-that had condemned him not divine.Mersault says he did wrong and was paying for it and there was nothing more that could be asked of him,he won't feel remorse nor guilt,nor believe in God.The story's opener is one of the all time classic openers:\\"Maman died today,or maybe yesterday,I don't know\\".The climax of the novel is the best ever written:\\"The sea carried up a thick, fiery breath. It seemed to me as if the sky split open from one end to the other to rain down fire. My whole being tensed and I squeezed my hand around the revolver. The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside of the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafening at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off the sweat and sun. I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I'd been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness\\".The cruelty in the heart of nature animates Meursault.This is a tragedy of Sophoclean intensity.The narrative has the incarnation of a myth to give testimony of his strangeness,the strange enigma of truth,his admissions as shocking as they are reserved.His attitude to life of non-attachment,looking from the outside,death only rouses him to a passionate outburst,it doesn't awaken him to genuine self-hood.Camus somehow through the use of lyrical writing gets the reader to think, when Meursault kills the Arab on the beach,he is somehow not guilty,it was chance,the trigger gave way,it was because of the sun,the sun glinting on the knife,the heat makes Meursault shoot as a reflex action,then shoot four more times into the dead body.Camus stresses in the first part the banalities and routines of existence,the social pantomime of funerals, marriages, wakes. He seems to exhibit no feelings of empathy, grief, or love in situations in Part 1 of the story.Then in the second part is the parody of the trial,a real fiasco,where what seems to be on trial was Meursault's character.He is a \\"stranger\\", not caring what society expects from him,wanting to be greeted with cries of hatred at his execution. On the social fringes of existence which Meursault inhabits,\\"he laid himself open to the benign indifference of the universe\\".Can any individual alone give meaning to the absurdities of the world or needs he to absorb the social structures of his world and the historical sequence of which he is a product?Camus writing has learned the simplicity of Hemingway's prose.What is missing is the subtext:the plight of the Arabs.We know Camus felt their mistreatment in the colonialist set-up in Algeria.That a French Algerian would probably have been acquitted of the murder.Instead Camus doesn't name the Arabs but he does have Meursault facing death by guillotine.'But one must do \\"as if\\"',Camus(The Myth of Sisyphus)."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Honestly one of the best books I have read. You might think that the first half of the book is going nowhere, but it all comes around in the end. Everything in the book has a purpose. Some may say that the main character is insane, but I actually thought his apathetic lifestyle was close to what most live today. And Parts will just make you say WOW. 5 Stars."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"On the surface 'The Stranger' is the story of Meursault, who after attending his mother's funeral embarks on a series of events that ultimately lead to murder.The genius of this book is the first person narrative, offering a 'personal diary' of the character, a man struggling with a disconnect from society. He encounters people and situations that should inspire feelings in him but he recognizes they do not. Much like Nabokov's Humbert in 'Lolita,' the madman begins to convince his reader that he deserves sympathy, only to demonstrate to you yet again why he does not.At 117 pages it may be tempting to devour this book in one sitting, but I think it is well worth the time to comb these pages meticulously. The psychological depth of Camus' work truly lends itself to patience.I would strongly recommend this literary classic. You might also check out Arthur Koestler's 'Darkness at Noon,' a lesser known novel of a former revolutionary leader caught up in Stalin's purges. Its insights into the mind of a condemned man are also astounding."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"At the beginning of the novel Meursault the main character - who lives in Algiers - gets a message from the home where his mother reside that she passed away. Meursault doesn't show any feeling at all. And during the voyage to that home, the wake and the funeral, and the voyage back home, it's as if his mother never existed or that she's a perfect stranger to him. He spends not a single thought about her.It's a novel about the absurd and the meaningless but also about the indifference of an individual who lives alone, doesn't have any real friends, who knows no happiness and no grief, who really doesn't care about anything or anyone. Though he has a kind of sympathy for a few people he knows, it doesn't mean much because he's a stranger about social life. But he doesn't care about himself either and this is maybe the strangest thing in this novel. He refused an important promotion at his work. It made no difference once again.When on a hot sunday afternoon he walks with a friend along the beach, two Arabs are walking toward them in a hostile manner. Meursault shoots one of them. \\"I don't know why I did it, it had no importance at all\\".From now on his life will take dramatic changes..."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"L'&Eacute;tranger was written and first published in 1942 (in French). 1946 was the year of publishing the first English translation by Stuart Gilbert (who despite his French-sounding last name was a British author) - The second English translation was undertaken by Joseph Laredo and published in 1982. - In a very different style. This is the third translation By Matthew Warde... It would be interesting to read all three versions and debate whose version gives back Camus's words the best....From what I hear it'd worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The StrangerThe Stranger is a novel by Albert Camus; the novel is a perfect example of existentialism. The main character is a Frenchman Meursault, one of the first things the reader will notice is that Meursault is detached form the world, on hearing his mother's death he does not break down into tears as most people would. Rather he sees it as just another event in his life, as if he ordered some coffee. The behavior of Meursault is classified as existentialism, being non emotional and being a man of few words, Meursault is the perfect anti-hero. The novel is separated into 2 parts. The first part describes Meursault's interactions with his friends, having sex with Marie, drinking with Raymond, watching Salamano with his dog and eating food at Celeste's. Meursault shows no ambition and no emotion in his everyday life. When at his mother's funeral he just walks and proceeds with what is necessary, he does not even know her age. At the end of part one Meursault murders an Arab while taking a walk on the beach. Part two consist of officials attempting to convert Meursault to Christianity. They say if he shows some sign of remorse or converts then they will set him free, yet he refuses. And at the end he is finally executed with no remorse, he does not have any feelings for his actions.The Stranger is a different type of read form most novels. The heavily laced existentialism causes the main character to react to his surrounds with no emotion. The beginning of the novel is seemingly dull, as he has zero emotions or concerns and talk in short sentences. The initial thought was extremely boring and not at all a good read. But after a few paragraphs, the reader realizes that the novel is not like any other, the main character is more of an anti-hero, he does nothing brave. He turns down any chance to advance in his career and just enjoys the physical things in life. The first couple of chapters are there to setup Meursault's behavior, his way of life and his embrace of the physical things in life. The murder of the Arab is the climax of the story, although he could be let off easily Meursault refuses to take the easy way and remains true to his ideals. There in that aspect Meursault turns form the anti-hero into a hero. Staying with his ideals, Meursault is like every other comic book hero, despite the danger he still remembers his ideology and sticks with it. The usage of the short sentences and the lack of emotion in the book enforce the existentialist idea. Although the novel is a different style of writing, it still is a very excellent read. Meursault depicts a man that has no cares in the world, I see Meursault as what would happen if humans retained no emotion. This book gets a thumbs up and I recommend it for a light read, it's short and simply phrased yet the meaning of the book is deep; the dark side of the human soul with no emotion or ambition."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I acquired The Stranger with no background knowledge of the book or the author. Although at times it is apparent that the book wasn't written originally in English, noticeable mainly through lack of sentence variation, The Stranger is very interesting and tells an intriguing story. A must-read for all Camus fans!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus could sweep through a volume of philosophy with one razor edged sentence.I may not agree with all his perspectves, but I do give him the credit of genius.This september (not january) 1954 'Vintage Books' edition has gained a collectors cult following (If only for the haunting cover). But the reason escapes me. certainly the disaffected void hangs heavily throughout this story. It's unrelenting grip of dread holds the reader tightly. But personally I feel this translation lacks the true Camus ambience."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The edition of THE STRANGER I own is an old Vintage paperback, with a \\"V-2\\" Vintage designation in the lower-left corner and a $1.25 price tag in the lower-right corner. The translator is Gilbert Stuart, not Matthew Ward.This is the third or fourth time I have read the Stuart translation of THE STRANGER. (I really don't care which translation is better; by now the Stuart one is for me definitive.) When I first read THE STRANGER, in my teens, it was obligatory reading for the young aspiring intellectual and I am sure that my response to it was heavily influenced by what I understood to be the received wisdom. When I read it about ten years ago, I was put off by the self-centered indifference of Meursault, and I tended to think the novel was intellectually puerile. (For years, after all, I had been hearing that Camus was over-rated.) Now, frankly, I am impressed by it. The tale is deceptively simple, yet upon analysis, the novel becomes surprisingly complex; it is almost mythical in its potential interpretations and \\"messages\\".As a parenthetical, I also am now struck by how colonial the attitude of the novel is. Not only do the Arabs appear in stereotype as the menacing \\"Other\\" and not only does Meursault more or less cold-bloodedly murder one. But - something that hadn't registered on me before - not one Arab is called as a witness at Meursault's trial. In pre-WWII French Algeria, the Arabs were indeed a sub-class, part of the fauna of the territory, and Meursault truly is sentenced to death for not displaying conventional grief upon the death of his mother rather than for shooting a human being on a stiflingly hot, blindingly sunny beach.Although THE STRANGER is not a perfect novel, it is somewhat astonishing to realize that it is the work of a 29-year-old, and it need not give anyone pause to see it listed as one of the seminal works of literature of the 20th Century. Indeed, it is one of those books that might profitably be read every 15 years or so, to help the reader judge how he is coming to terms with his place in the universe."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The thoughts captured in this narration are eternal, they are not bound by space and time. The mind, when captured by the simple description of Camus, without delving into psychology and philosophy, gives a reader an adequate opportunity to build an opinion for himself. In short, this book is a spoon full of potion, which carries one to that corner of human mind, which perhaps one would never be able to experience even in imaginations, in his lifetime."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The first novel which Albert Camus (1913-1960) fully and maturely stated his philosophy and created his alienated outsider, (the original title of this 1942 work being L'Etranger, meaning \\"The Foreigner\\" or \\"The Outsider\\") was this great short novel, the cornerstone of existentialism in twentieth century prose; the first words being, \\"Maman died today, or yesterday, I don't know\\" along with the first words of Kafka's The Metamorphosis are some of the most memorable openings ever written in the history of the short novel, novellette, nouvella, whatever you want to call it.The character Meursault is a strange, zombiefied, indifferent man. Throughout the novel, he hardly ever shows any emotion, and seems to just drag himself through life, indifferent to everything. Even when his girlfriend, after making love, asks him if he loves her, he replies that he doesn't and says that it doesn't really matter.The Stranger, since it takes place in Algeria, near Algiers, and it is French Existentialism reminds me of some sort of avant guarde French film of the fifties and sixties, something by Jean-Luc Godard, with the scene of the murder of the arab in the scorching hot sun being a scene exhibiting modern art with many cuts and you see weird things like in the movie Don't Look Now when Donald Sutherland is being killed by the midget, there are many cuts, one of them being Sutherland embracing and kissing a statue. As Meursault cringes and can't stand the heat and lifts the gun, you see a guy with no teeth scrunching up his face, then a door opening to a woman, racked by sorrow, somberly looking up at you with her sick husband dying on the bed next to her, then a small child of four or five lifting a revolver up to their temple with a twisted smile, and with the shots fired, a twisted piece of Johann Strauss' The Beutiful Blue Danube playing over Soviet and Nazi troops marching and Stalin and Hitler looking on approvingly.If you are still reading this \\"review\\", I humbly thank you, dear reader, and recommend this book to you, if you are a Literature buff like myself and if you want to discover the 1957 Nobel Prize Winner for Literature, Albert Camus."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is a great book and you don't need to hear another praise or exaltation of its message. Suffice it to say, in its depth the author condemns emotions. Camus asks one simple question - if emotions are removed from humanity then what is the outcome of human existence? I can't ignore the fact that this book is inevitable tied with another - the discourse of Simon Cleveland in his book 'Existential Meditation'. Cleveland's analysis on the meaning of time, consciousness and the development of the essence doesn't stray away from Camus' own conviction that emotions are the downfall of humanity. Of course the absurdity of immortality is a whole other issue."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Often those works of literature that are labelled as classics by the cultural and academic establishment are simply not accessible to the lay public. \\"The Outsider\\" (or \\"The Stranger\\") by Albert Camus is an exception. This is a very easy to read book and yet it is not so easy to read. Camus lays his themes bare in a simple plot about a very ordinary man. Yet beneath the surface of ordinariness lies an extraordinary story. I believe that its impact as a philosophical and moral tale owes much to the raw and unpretentious presentation of the author in this case.I shan't reveal the plot yet I will say that other reviewers' appraisals of the protagonist Meursault are interesting to say the least. To claim that he is unlikeable or evil is short-sighted and ultimately untrue in my opinion. In fact I felt compassion for Meursault and could identify with some of his psychology, which was brilliantly portrayed by Camus. One of the things that struck me most profoundly about Meursault is his rather dry penchant for calling a spade a spade and telling life like he sees it. He agrees to help his neighbour Raymond, for example, because he sees no reason not to. He is a loner but fundamentally a decent person. He is an outsider to social conventions and in many respects I applaud him for being so. I for one do not consider him guilty of anything other than being true to himself. Ultimately this is one reason why this book is so thoroughly thought-provoking. It will keep you thinking about it long after you have put it down."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I have often heard that in a translation, part of the story is lost. I could not help feeling this as I was reading this book. Although I feel as though I have missed a few things in Camus' message, the novel offers interesting (and sometimes bizarre) insights on certain subjects such as death, love, and religion. The grotesqueries in the book are often behind great thought, and because I read this in a day, a deeper analysis of the book might help in understanding some of Camus' intents. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick (but long lasting in thought) reading."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"If you want to get into Existentialism and absurdity, this is the plave to start. This book is an excellent character study on Mersault, an indifferent character who pretty much sums up the absurdist philosophy. Camus is an excellent writer and philosopher and if you enjoy this book check out his other ones, especially his philosophical articles. I have just started reading this book again for the 3rd time and i am enjoying it just as much, and I am moved just as much as I was the first time. Definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book opend my eyes to other peoples ways of showing emotions and their troubles in life.

Overall, I recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a book that confronts human nature from many angles."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read this book once when I was young and then again two years ago. Two different translations: the first one I read was called The Outsider, the second one, The Stranger.Now we are reading it in French and discussing it in class. The writing is much more beautiful in French.In year 2000, there was a survey amongst 6000 French readers. The question was: &quot; Which book, do you think, is the best of 20th century? &quot; French readers picked L'&Eacute;tranger. I agree. The Stranger is, in my opinion, the best book written in 20th century. The complexity of human nature tackled with the simplest of writings. It is beautiful to read, heart-wrenching to contemplate.And which book has ever been able to beat this opening line:&quot;Aujourd'hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-tre hier, je ne sais pas.&quot;(&quot;Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know.&quot;)If I could compare this book (and its protagonist) to any other book I've read, I would choose Graham Greene's A Burnt Out Case and its architect Querry.We are not very good at dealing with the different, the outsider, the stranger. And since there is more of us, we find a way of making them miserable, not letting them be, forcing them to be like us, trying to neutralize them, to make them ordinary, to reduce them. When they slip, we use the opportunity to get rid of them for good. (In the case of Graham Greene's Querry, he didn't even have to slip. We can always make things up.)Meursault killed a man. In his trial we say, in fact try to use it as evidence, that he did not cry in his mother's funeral.We are merciless when it comes to the different. I know, by first hand experience, how cruel we can be when we encounter the stranger."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is a book I thought I should read, but did not particularly expect to enjoy. And many of its elements are not what I generally look for in a novel: almost entirely unsympathetic characters, an extremely slowly-paced story and an almost nonsensical plot, a worldview with which I profoundly disagree in some important respects. None of those things by itself necessarily makes for a bad novel, but all of them together? By all rights, I should have hated this book! And yet...I didn't. There is something about Camus's use of language, the structure of the story, that pulls you in almost against your will. I found myself deeply absorbed in this strange character and his stranger life, unlikable as he may have been. And at the end, I found myself satisfied with the conclusion. On reflection, from a certain standpoint, Mersault's final change in his fundamental outlook on life and attitude toward existence doesn't seem to make much sense...but as you're reading it, in the context of the novel, it makes for a powerful esthetic experience. If this review seems a bit inconsistent, it's because I really can't explain my reaction to this novel. All I can say is, I liked it, even if I don't know exactly why. Maybe that isn't entirely helpful, but who knows? even if you think you won't, give it a try and you might like it, too."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is interesting in spots. Its portrait of a disaffected \\"outsider\\" whose emotional responses are shallow, whose sense of morality works against self-interest, and who focuses on trivia seems to have influenced other writers and works (I'm thinking \\"American Psycho\\" and \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", particularly).The sequences about the old man and his dog are the strongest, very poetic. The whole portion around those dealing with the protagonist's last days of freedom are evocative and well-written. The rest slows down. I think that I understand Camus' intentions and subtext, and they're interesting, but the book is hit-or-miss."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In this 128 page book we glimpse into the world of the absurd. Not absurd because of far-out fantasy but absurd because the story depicts the lack of meaning of life from an existential perspective. The picture of existence is brought forth as individual data bits of life. Nothing seems connected; there is no thread of meaning. The protagonist Meursault fits in with this ridiculous picture as he simply reacts to the stimulus of existence without adding anything of value. He reacts like a brute animal. Meursault attempts to come to peace with this thought while facing his death. For the reader, there is no peace.I am reading this book from a Christian perspective. In this story I see a picture of the natural world without God. Camus has the courage to take this worldview to it's logical and meaningless conclusion which most are not willing to do. For this reason I would recommend reading this book. However if God is, then we are not doomed to nihilism but to the meaningful. We are not a vapor but we are connected to an eternity of significance. We are not trapped within the absurd but live united to the Logos"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I greatly enjoyed this short novel, my first experience with Camus. I believe it works on multiple levels.It is great on a pure storytelling level. Camus's detached and cold style of writing really works here; it creates an interesting and unsettling mood. And the story, while short, is highly entertaining.The novel also works as a reflection of the legal system. The flaws that are allowed in the protagonist's trial are flaws that, while perhaps exaggerated, can often creep in the American and other legal systems. The second half of the novel serves as an apt demonstration as to why criminal defendants should be judged on the merits of their cases -- not on their personalities and histories.Finally, the novel works on a philosophical level. Much in the same way that I find a Dostoevsky novel intellectually stimulating and satisfying, the existential questions raised (and answered) by this novel serve as a springboard toward discussion and deep thought.Overall, highly rewarding and easy to recommend."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I believe the last time I read \\"The Stranger\\" by Albert Camus was approximately 33 years ago. It was a joy to do so again. As a writer Camus is simply interesting to read. If you per chance have never read this work or it has been decades since you have I would strongly recommend doing so again. I think you will find it fascinating.As you are probably aware it was a philosophical stroke of genius at the time of it's publishing. What I did not know was even though the book and it's author are both celebrated for their elucidation of both existentialism and nihilism, Camus eschewed them both. And yet it was Sartre who gave the book it's greatest publicity by an essay he published.The story is quite compelling in it's mundane reporting of extraordinary events and the emotionless response of the narrator. We pick this up in the very first line of the book:\\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know. I got a telegram from the home: 'Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.' That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday.\\"Or when Meursault's (the protagonist) lover, Marie, asks him if he would like to marry her: \\"I said it didn't make any difference to me and that we could if she wanted to.\\"The reader finds the very same tone being maintained whether the subject is death, abuse, love, sex, murder, or execution. It is as if the protagonist is viewing a play about himself from a distant, objective position and has little interest in what transpires. Interestingly enough the one subject in which we see Meursault get exorcised is religion. While the atheism of the protagonist is somewhat understated throughout the novel he has nothing but disdain for the chaplain, and, as it were, explodes on him.One might think that is what would be expected from Camus, but he did not divorce himself from the religious to the extent that one might think. Leland Ryken points out that, \\"in an interview on the occasion of his receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, Camus said, 'I have only veneration and respect for the person of Christ and for his life. I do not believe in his resurrection.'\\" It seems this is indicative of a spiritual seeking that went on for much of his brief life.\\"The Stranger\\" is a very brief book (a mere 128 pages of text) and easily read but full of material to reflect on and even possibly discuss. Remind yourself of this very important philosophical classic."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger was recommended to me by my sister. It is a short book that I was able to finish during one airplane ride. It was very slow at the start and parts were quite confusing. Once the story line picked up, I couldn't stop reading. It was a great story, and I appreciated the reality of it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This was a novel I purchased for my English class.We were instructed to choose one of nine different perspectives to read from, I was assigned sadness.This novel encompasses many more different aspects, but from the view I had taken, this proved to be a great novel with the contemporary spin on religion and how the human conscience adapts to prevail over everyday struggle. I greatly enjoyed reading it, about a two hour straight through session of reading! Very worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is a thought-provoking story that highlights some of the facets of \\"Existentialism\\" as viewed through the behavior of some of the characters.

It's a classic. The end."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I think everybody should read this who likes existentialism. it is a very quick read though. i think it would make a very great movie."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The other reviewers who mentioned that this book is dreary reading with an unlikeable, inwardly dead protagonist have hit the nail on the head. Though the book is short enough to be fairly easily read in one sitting, I found it impossible to identify with the soulless protagonist, and the dreary story seems to last much longer than it does. It wasn't until I started to write this review that I began to understand what I believe the book's lasting appeal to be.That appeal, I believe, lies soley in the main character. Camus does an amazing job of putting his reader inside the head of the ultimate amoral, cold-blooded sociopath and passes no obvious judgements on his lack of emotion or values. Camus takes many of the abstract quandries of an existentialist, absurdist view of life and gives them flesh and speech. In doing so, he (perhaps inadvertantly) points out all the unsavory problems with this philosophy, which go far beyond the mere rejection of traditional morality and values and extend into the rejection of what we think of as humanity itself.It's an interesting, enduring book for that reason. Hell of a dreary read, though. If you examine the ideas behind this book, you'll definitely think. Just don't expect to feel anything, except perhaps disgust."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus' debut novel is brief, skimpy on plot, and written in the simplest and most direct manner possible, but this is as effective a piece of literature as any because of the brilliant mind behind it. Camus was a great philisophical and literary mind, and his books were always infused with a profound concern for the desperate, desolate human condition. The power of such a little volume as \\"The Stranger\\" lies in the very uncomfortable truths that it manages to uncover - truths which reverberate through the reader because of the spare prose that they are presented in.'The Stranger' is deeply depressing, and for paradoxical reasons: it is depressing because we are able to identify with the protagonist, Monsieur Meursault, and empathize with his misery, even though he is barely capable of emotion and murders a man for no real reason, remaining remorseless to the end. The story of Meursault's meaningless life and the pointless crime that inevitably leads to his downfall will leave readers distraught because Camus is not simply writing about a sick man; he perceives Meursault's emptiness and nihilism as the mindset of any man who comes to understand the indifference of the rest of the world to his plight, and in turn becomes indifferent to everything he once found pleasurable; a romantic relationship, a good meal, a social outing, a swim in the ocean, and eventually life itself.What hope is there for Meursault in the last days before his execution? He knows that there is no afterlife and he has no interest in reliving his experiences in his mind or pondering them, so what will he do with the little time he has left? Will he count cracks in the walls of his cell for a few hours of the day and sleep for the rest, or will he look for something else? \\"The Stranger\\" ends inconclusively, allowing us to ponder the question, and leaves us sick to our stomachs at the possibility that Meursault has reached a dead end (and I was literally nauseous at the end of the book).Camus calls on all of his readers to use what imagination they have to make their lives bearable, and I think that this is what ultimately makes \\"The Stranger\\" so powerful. It's an important book to read in our high schools as well, especially for a generation of youth that indulges itself in the vacuous entertainments of the television and music worlds that do nothing to improve their minds or characters. It's not a morality tale, but a provoker of thought; it asks us: how close are we to being Meursault?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"If some of the other reviews metion this work as \\"Masterful\\" and as \\"a character study\\", that is true. The first thing you could think of after completing this book is: \\"What a character!\\" Meursault is quiet a creation. He begins and remains a man unaffected by life and the genius of Camus lies in presenting this authentically. Even as he is enjoying a holiday at a beach nothing, beyond the fulfillment of the moment, can give Meursault any satisfaction, nothing seems to affect him. Reading this I am reminded of Dostoevsky's Underground man and Kafka's K., from his \\"the trial\\". With this story Camus takes a step further from Dostoevsky and Franz Kafka. Unlike K., Meursault is prosecuted for a crime that is clear, but the feeling of a man against the system remains. You do feel that he has been given a raw deal but even so somehow his fate seems for the better. Meursault himself shows some affectedness towards the end, but quickly reconciles himself. Here we have a glimpse of the process of his character formation, someone who looks at death as an inevitable consequence and hence reconciles to his fate without complaining. This is novel at its best as an art form, it is interesting and it is food for thought. You are interested in his fate as the judge hands out his sentence to Meursault and then later, muchlater, you wonder about the person, his philosophy and its effect."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is a quick read about a man who is condemned by the fact that he is different. The society around him, and unfortunately many who simply read the book, do not even try to understand him.He appears to be an emotionles man without morals, yet upon closer inspection it is seen that it is not that he has no morals or emotions, it is just that his interpretation of the world is different.Though he commited a murder, the trial ends up being more about him as an individual, and in this respect it is unjust. They refuse to try to understand him, even though he tries repeatedly to explain himself. In a rampage toward the chaplain, Meursault wonders, \\"Couldn't he see?\\"This is a sad story about the narrowmindedness of society and the unfortunate individual who gets caught up in it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is very strange, since it tells a series of terrible events that change the life of a man forever. However, it is not the events that make the book, but the reactions and thoughts the different characters have.The main character, Mersault is simply intriguing... you learn about his life, his thoughts, his feelings... and yet, you know nothing at all... in my opinion, he is one of those characters that grows on you and in some instances you can even feel identified with him, but in the end he is a Stranger whom you dont understand.The plot itself is not very interesting, and it is a bit depressing, starting with a funeral and then moving on to a murder and finally a trail and life in jail... still it keeps you reading... I know, it is hard to explain, and I guess that is exactly what has made this book a classic, it is impossible to categorize, analyze or even try to make sense of it.... but it is also impossible to put it down."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A great book, the new translation may be more &quot;American&quot; somehow, but many of the most important parts seem much more clunky than in the original Stewart Gilbert translation. Some magic was lost, especially in the ending, the part where Merseault observes the people from his balcony, etc. Just get the other translation, it's easy to find used. 5 stars for the original translation, 3 for this one."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A quick and very light book to read...I liked Camus style of writing and the way he delivers his message to the reader. His writing makes you think of what exactly the characters are going through, why do they act in certain ways, and how similar are we to all that...The book takes you through bizzare situations, each one is unique in its own way, but each one has a lesson behind it..."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Remove this book from the constraints of the ideological paradigm it has been placed in, either by its authour, or by subsequent intellectuals or book lovers, and see it as a story that happens every day amongst and between people in this modern world. Conformity, guilt before the trial, assumptions and presumptions, the multifacted nature of an action- no one truth but rather dependant on the angle and experience of the observer. This is what Camus's book offers to the modern reality.There is no discernable hero in this book- either one admires the main character for the 'realness' and truth of his actions and the envious unblemished connection that exists between his feelings and his words and deeds; or one pities him for not being able or willing to play the game of human and societal expectation. For in the end he is but the only one that really admires his propensity for raw honesty and individualism- or is he even capable of that?In the end he is not able to save himself from the prison sentence and is it not an even more horrendous act to be publicly castigated for a misread crime, than to somewhat compromise ones ideals and 'play the game' in an effort to be saved- to be free? Especially in this case where the main character's actions and apparent amoral position seems to be less of an honourable position and more the reality of a tired -almost broken -man.Maybe something was lost in the translation but I was not as moved by this book as I anticipated. Despite its existentialist label, it would still have been good for the book to leave you with some semblance of feeling that you had to search to find hidden meanings- the prose is simple (though not simplistic), and very transparent- but as i said- I think i may have expected a bit more."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"My mediocre rating is for the translation - not for the novel (which is magnificent). Matthew Ward's humdrum translation makes me prize all the more the original, Stuart Gilbert, translation, which I grew up with and which became so indistinguishable from Camus' own voice. Ward is an American, which is somehow an explanation for his nondescript prose. Robert Frost, who penned the title of this review, was also an American, capable nonetheless of writing slendidly and evocatively. I know that Camus tried to flatten out his prose, but I cannot believe it's as flat as Ward's."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A great novel about a normal man that is imposed upon difficult situations that one would never be able to prepare for. The lathargic caring that he has for his mother's death and for his own show that even though he was placed in a stressful situation he didn't change. That is what was so great about Mersault, he didn't change. He was different thn others in society. He wouldn't turn to god at any point in the novel showing an inteligent stubborness. A great novel that should be read by everyone to give them insight on what some people might be thinking."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I've taught this book on numerous occasions over the years. In the 60's and early seventies, Meursult had a lot of sympathizers. More recently, students have begun to trash him.I still am intrigued by this book, but have begun to wonder about the relevance of much commentary on it. For instance, we might ask whether a character like Meurault, who is apparently writing this version of his life after his arrest, isn't so crafting it to make a sort of defense of his actions. If he is, he's certainly inept at it. Why doesn't he simply claim self defense? Why, doesn't he tell us everything that's going on at that trial?Well, we might say, it really doesn't matter; what REALLY matters is that Meursault is condemned to die not for the murder of an Arab, but for being who he is imagined to be. How, finally, can anyone claim to know anything about another character when we see how ludicrous the court's image of M is? (Both prosecutor and defense attorney may! have goofy images of M. And how dare that priest plead that there is a transcendant reality that must be acknowledged, when these dunces can't even figure out this poor little guy whom they &quot;see&quot; right before their eyes?Readers migfht be interested in reading Roger Shattuck's treatment of the book in FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE. It does force you to reevaluate it.Camus' preface to the American edition, which appears in his Lyrical Essays, is also worth a read."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"the previous review just got me riled. the whole thing about existentialism is that it's the philosophy of no philosophy, \\"existence precedes essence,\\" etc. life is implicitly meaningless, the individual honestly confronts the abyss and creates his/her own meaning. as kierkegaard wrote, \\"all truth is subjectivity.\\" meurseault is the quintessential existential character because he exists \\"beyond good and evil\\", in the \\"teleological suspension of the ethical\\", and ignores established morality. basically, any individual philosophy that is honest and stays true to concrete facts, without dreaming up alternative realities but rather confronting the present, is existential. and this book is very that. in a realm where \\"god is dead\\", the individual is everything: the foundation of a new ethical standard.any true existentialist wouldn't call themselves \\"existential\\", since it's not a category. it's the category of those that refuse categorization."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Goddammit, I LIKE this translation! I wish people would stop putting it down. Although it has none of the poetic beauty of the other main translation, that is the WHOLE POINT! Read it in the French or have someone translate it for you (for the French- impaired, like me) and you will realize that part of the book's power is the stark, straight-to-the-point style of writing. Camus is a genius, and this translation is truest to his original words. Prepare to be shocked, entertained, amused...and ultimately to see yourself in this book. (Or worse, NOT to see yourself...) This is most definitely worth your money and your time."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The main character in the novel (hero or anti-hero) is someone that its not attached emotionally to the world or anyone in it. He is more concerned with himself and his physical sensations. At the beginning it may sound just like a selfish person, but when we start to understand his nature things get so clear that we start to wonder about the way we lead our lives.The hero(?) doesn't believe in God, the end is the end, so why live this life, which is the one we are sure we have, thinking or acting in behalf of some after life that might as well not exist? Why be attached to people when they all will die? Why not live fully and try to get the best for us and us only? Why worry about details when the final plan (death) is already laid out? These are all questions that we seem to ask, and in the end the character in neither strange nor selfish, but in a way a reasonable human being with a naked view of life - what turns out to be mind boggling.He is a stranger in the sense that he doesn't quite follow society's \\"games\\" or predetermined line of conduct, he is truthful with above all - himself, and does not bother in justifying his actions or telling lies. And off course he has a huge lack of interest as if he were only a spectator of his own life (in a sense aren't we?) so his decisions really didn't matter. In the end he is judged by not (re)acting as he is supposed to, and things that are at first looked rather without importance are turned into a question of life or death..."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I think many people are missing the main point and don't understand why Camus created Meursault. When I read this book as a high school student, I thought Meursault was a &quot;stranger&quot; because his morality and conscience were paralyzed. But now, I realize that I was wrong. He is a &quot;stranger&quot; because he is the only honest one; he does not lie. In other words, if you don't lie, you are idetified as a &quot;stranger.&quot;I came to this conclusion after reading The Myth of Sisyphus. The stranger is not a denial of life, and Camus was never pessimistic about life. He rather had passion for living, and he says that our pride and passion never let us throw everything away but make us work and struggle toward absurdity. Camus says that Meursault is not a moron, but he is a passionate man who loves the sun that leaves no shadow.There is no God, and we have no other life but the ones we live now. What, then, can we do? Although the society is absurd, we shall never let go of our pride and passion for living and shall give the best of ourselves to whatever comes before us.The Stranger is a good read, but you have to read Camus's other novels in order to understand it. Read The Myth of Sisyphus and A Happy Death."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus did a good job doing about two things in this book; capturing you and confusing you. The Stranger is one of those works that for a minute excites you and then for the next 20 pages makes you yawn. Meursault, the main character, is a young Algerian Frenchman man who leads an ordinary, dull life. When he receives news of his mother's sudden death, he goes to the funeral and sheds not one tear. When he returns he goes on with his life like it never happened.The way he is emotionless really depresses you and darkens the mood of the book, almost to where it hurts to go on reading every next misfortune. The book really shows you how upside down your life can get, and how fast it can really happen. It's easy to relate to if you don't care about your mother and if you would kill a man for no reason. But I speak for most of us when I say that I'm sure this isn't the case.Overall, this book isn't horrible; it's just not my favorite. In my opinion it goes where no other book goes, to the soul of a heartless person and his random act of murder. Another problem is that while reading this book and witnessing his crime, you want not to hate him... and that scares me that I could ever side with a killer. This book challenges the ordinary plot of most books and opens up new ideas, even if they're not positive. Even though it's a great work of literature, I can't make myself like it.Emily ReederSophomoreLandrum High SchoolLandrum, SC"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"To the people who gave this book 1 star, I must say that none of you have the faintest idea of the true meaning of the book. Most people claimed it was depressing and lacked emotion. Well news flash, a book isn't good just because it makes you feel happy, and the converse is true as well. The main character lacks emotion for a reason, that is the key to Camus' theme. In his final moments of life, Mersault realizes why his mother became engaged in the twilight of her years. It's because she realizes that she cannot be phased by death. It is predestined that life will come to an end for every human being, and we must learn to shed the false hope that we will live forever. Only than can we truly be free."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In the forward to the Mathew Ward edition of this book there is a comment by Camus in which he says that in writing The Stranger he was attempting to write an American book. By that comment, Camus meant that he wanted to write a novel that was easy to read, fast paced, but at the same time full of meaning along the same lines as most of Hemingway's novels. Well, he was definitely successful in accomplishing these goals with The Stranger. Through his character Meresault, Camus is able to make the reader truly see the absurdity of our existence, and he gets us to thinking that maybe, just possibly, we live finite lives. The Stranger though is much more than just a work of existential philosophy, it contains one of the most gripping court trials in literature, putting it on a par for suspense with most present day legal thrillers. Camus is not an author who is going to make you happy to be alive, but he will definitely make you think more about why you're here."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Camus develops moves further away from earlier works, in which he himself was too involved in the story. His newfound literary &quot;distance&quot; moves his writing towards the level of his later works, though still mired in a &quot;nihilistic&quot; indolence that characterized his earlier philosophy. The book is written without reference to cognitive states, thoughts, but speaks through its prime symbols, the sea, the sun, and death. In Camus' &quot;A Happy Death&quot;, the main character is named &quot;Mersault&quot;-- reminiscient of the sea, like Marie's hair, and where many of the important events in &quot;The Stranger&quot; take place. However, Camus decided not to publish &quot;A Happy Death&quot; and changed his characters name to &quot;Meursault&quot;--'meurs' being the imperative of the french 'mourir'-- 'to die'. Death itself becomes a central and recurrent theme, the book beginning with one of the most famous lines in modern literature: &quot;Mother died today&quot;. The Algerian sun plays counterpoint to the human absurdities that continue unabated beneath it: funeral processions, murders. Meursault's only defence is of the sort that 'it was hot outside', thereby tightening the circle of absurdity and the feeling of utter pointlessness which pervades so much of the novel. Camus moved on to other and more poignant themes, such as human solidarity, in his later works, but &quot;The Stranger&quot; stands as the expression of an entire country's sense of helplessness during and after the anti-climax of the second World War, and further, as an authentic and original expression of an author's convictions through the medium of literature as can be found anywhere."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus' \\"The Stranger\\" provides an interesting view of the world through a slightly more curved lens. The book plots out what it would be like to live life fully realizing the frivolity of it all. Stripping away the personal meanings behind love, friendship, and death leaves the reader engrossed in looking at the world through a different light. Through this book it is easier to understand just how short each man's share on earth is and see how little it truly impacts the universe. To quote Carl Sagan \\"We are but a motes of dust suspended in a sun beam.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I think that this book reveals to us the utter conditioning of society. We are all expected to act and think and feel in certain ways in certain conditions. Most of our actions have to fall in the narrow field of acceptability and if they don't then we are looked at with supsicion and mistrust. Just consider if you should stop and stare at something in the street particularly beautiful for more than a moment. Those walking by would regard you as a little odd and possibly dangerous. Not just acts either, our values, our beliefs, our desires. Who is this man that doesn't feel as he should we ask of Meursault.Meursault is a man who rejects the conditioning of society and dies for it. He doesn't feel, but does he have to? He is his own man. Is not a man ultimately accountable only to himself? Meursault knows this and tells us in the last part of the book as he prepares himself to die. Yes he killed without regret but he also killed without malice. Killing is definitely wrong and should be punished but the trial reveals to us how we are all essentially slaves to a system not of our own design or even approval. Meursault is an amoral man living in society but not of it. Must we punish each man as one? Does not society enslave us to a system that in many ways for many people is not suitable?That, I think, is the message of this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This excellent novel is essential reading for students and lovers of literature; especially for those interested in Western philosophy. The Stranger, the first of Camus' three major novels, was written in French in 1942 and first translated into English in 1946. His other two major novels are The Plague written in 1947 and The Fall written in 1956. Camus also wrote numerous essays, plays, short stories, and letters that have been published. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957.Among all his works The Stranger remains his best known and most widely read work. However, it should not be understood as the culmination of Camus' philosophical thought, but rather as a relatively early iteration in its evolution. Likewise, it is not a definitive presentation of existentialism. Rather, The Stranger and his other writings represent Camus' particular existential philosophy; and his view sometimes conflicted with those of others, such as Jean Paul Sartre.The Stranger's greatness does not lie in the beauty of its prose or in the vividness of its description; but rather in its superb construction, symbolism, and profound philosophical message. The novel is tightly crafted, mostly simple in language and sentence structure, sparse in description, and even sparser in the thought and reflection of its characters. But it does paint a stark picture and creates a disquieting mood in the reader's mind of a world that presses itself into one's senses. The sun and heat are prevalent symbols in this novel. They press against the main character, Meursault inescapably, inexorably, yet indifferently. They symbolize the whole of reality; aspects of which are continually present in our thoughts, feelings, and senses, sometimes pleasantly, sometimes unpleasantly, but always with \\"benign indifference\\" and without meaning.Meursault is also pressed by people and events that are random, meaningless, and absurd. And due to his own indifference Meursault rarely acts, instead he reacts to their wishes and to events happening around him. He even agrees to get married just because his girlfriend asks him in this excerpt:Marie came that evening and asked me if I'd marry her. I said I didn't mind; if she was keen on it, we'd get married.Then she asked me again if I loved her. I replied much as before, that her question meant nothing or next to nothing - but I supposed I didn't.\\"If that's how you feel,\\" she said, \\"why marry me?\\"I explained that it had no importance really, but, if it would give her pleasure, we could get married right away. I pointed out that, anyhow, the suggestion came from her; as for me, I'd merely said, \\"Yes.\\"Then she remarked that marriage was a serious matter.To which I answered: \\"No.\\"This is not just empty-headed indifference. It is indifference with a cause. If life is meaningless, even worse than that, is absurd, how can a person care about the pointless activities of people? To ascribe meaning or significance to anything, especially abstract things such as love of another person, is delusion, ignoring the absurdity of life in which death is the only final outcome.Near the end of the novel Meursault is faced with his own impending death; and he hopes, absurdly, for a way to avoid what is unavoidable. Then when pushed by a priest to turn to God for solace and to save his soul, Meursault, in a fit of anger, has an epiphany. His thinking crystallizes. He sees clearly the inexorable yet benign indifference of the world, his own indifference, and his appropriate intimate connection to it. Thus, he concludes, happily, the way he had lived his life and his view of life are justified and correct. Unlike the priest, Meursault is deeply connected to this world, to reality, and to the present moment. He is not living as if already dead, neglecting the present reality while hoping to live in some abstract future afterlife. Further, abstract ideas and other delusions about reality (e.g. sin, love, etc.) do not determine his choices nor cloud his view of reality.So, as a result of his epiphany, Meursault is now \\"on the brink of freedom, ready to start life over again\\" in each moment of life remaining. And when death does come, with its final absurdity, one may assume he just might die with a smile on his face after all."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This work is a fundamental piece of 20th century existentialism, and has survived its time because evidently man still suffers and does some very silly things. To those who criticize the artificiality of Mersault's lack of emotions, the materiality of its existence or the absurdity of the novel, I extend my congratulations, because they must surely live a full and emotionally nurturing live, maybe pursuing actively the American Dream. If you fit in this description, you may want to read a book that makes common sense, like a thriller or Harry Potter. OTHERWISE, READ THIS BOOK IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS a masterful depiction of the alienation of the modern human being, the anguish of existence and the absurdity of nothingness (maybe the gentlemen of the Nobel prize board didn't miss this point)."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This novel came highly recommended by a friend. I bought it at a used book store, fearing the worst and then regretting paying full price for a work of trash.Boy, was I wrong! The Stranger is one of the best books I've ever devoured. Albeit, it could have gone into more detail, given the story and the characters more 'meat', however, I can't complain about it's poignant quality.Mersault: Idiot? Victim? Extraordinary? This is left up to the reader to decide, which I loved. Mersault's actions made me think of the isolation that comes with being different and indifferent. Mersault did not CHOOSE to be indifferent, he was naturally. Or so I assume, because there never was an explanation for his decidedly rotten behavior toward the people close to him.I think this book's length was a factor in letting the reader make their own judgements regarding Mersault and his place in the theories of nihilism and existentialism. I STILL, after having read the book months ago, haven't made a definite decision. Hopefully, the conclusion won't come any time soon. I'm enjoying mulling the story over in my mind and talking about it with my book-loving friends.I recommend this book to anyone who is beyond the idle fluff of such writers as Dean Koontz and Jackie Collins. Feed your brain some oxygen. You'll never think the same way about life again. ..."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Well, I always feel uncomfortable about writing reviews for classics, so I will let my inferiority complex kick in.

Read the book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus' \\"The Stranger\\" was interesting. The different sentence structure, indicating a man of simple education, made the book easy to read. However the concepts and ideas presented in the text were those that cannot be taken lightly.The absurdity that reoccurs throughout the book brings to light, my opinion of, Camus' meaning. Traditional Christian values are not always substantial enough for the modern man. The main character Meursault is not punished severely for his true crime but for his lack of emotions. As the modern man Meursault found nothing to believe in, his actions are based purely on his senses. He will do whatever gives him physical pleasure.The absurdity of Meursault's trial and of Meursault himself shows Camus' belief that the modern man has become more detached from himself and his emotions. The examining magistrate is also absurd in his idea that if Meursault does not believe in God his belief in God is invalid. There is no reason for another's belief to affect your beliefs. This absurdity shows Camus' disillusionment with religious fanatics.\\"The Stranger\\" raises interesting questions about the absurdity of people's ideas and of life itself. Why do religious fanatics act the way they do? Why would someone develop into an apathetic, purely sensual person, when they had a seemingly normal life? Meursault may be a phenomenon or the first in a newly emerging class of apathetic people."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus primarily explores two issues in THE STRANGER. These are the \\"gentle indifference of the world\\" and the element of the absurd--that is, A could occur and your life would move of this path; or B could occur and your life would be completely different.These issues are embodied in the experience of the Meursault, the narrator of this two-part novella. In Part I, Meursault appears oddly detached from life. He is distant and unemotional at the wake and burial of his mother, does not mourn her death, and has superficial social interactions. Then, when walking with two men who he barely knows, he participates in a brief brawl, where one of his acquaintances is knifed. Meursault and his acquaintances leave. But he returns to the scene of the fight where he, perhaps inadvertently, encounters the perp with the knife. For a moment, anything might happen. But then, the immediate contents of his life--the death of his mother, his anger at the fight, his need to defend himself, and the bright and brutal sun of North Africa where he lives--explode in his act of murder, which is sensationalized in the newspapers.In Part II, Camus explores what has happened. Is the murder the action of a detached psychopath, as the prosecutor contends. Or, is this the act of an ordinary man, who in an emotional outburst kills someone. As Meursault's lawyer retorts as the prosecutor builds the case against his client, \\"...everything is true and nothing is true.\\"Meanwhile, Meursault's acquaintances testify on his behalf, credibly attributing the murder to chance or bad luck. And, Meursault, alone in his jail cell, begins to reveal a sensibility that, while apparently detached from life, also richly values the commonplace qualities of mundane experience. He is a lover and poet of the ordinary, who like the world, is \\"gently indifferent.\\"The final chapter of THE STRANGER is absolutely great, with Meursault affirming his commitment to life's beauty and gentle indifference, not capitulating to pressure to endorse Christian dogma to lessen his ordeal.Not a thought out of place and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Our society has a weird setup, which is something that i realized a few years ago. It's one that has morale, values and belief systems that practically everyone accepts in one way or another, but often contradicts. although the fact that moral is a belief is something that we should all get credit for. so what happens if you have a disaffected, amoral non-believer present in the society? that's the question that camus examines in \\"the stranger\\" and gives its readers an answer i don't think many were prepared for.the novel has a pretty simple plot. it's about a young man named mersualt who has a job, lives in a flat, has a girlfriend, and committs murder by accident. he's sent to trial and the jury decides to execute him by guillotene.that's the book on a shallow front but it really folds into a character study of a young man who has been abandoned by morals, values and traditional views by standard society. mersualt is concerned mostly with the present and not thoughtful about the future. he gets excited over jumping on a car, but turns an opportunity to get married, change jobs and move. his concern is mostly over physical sensation and morals take a backseat. he is observant and at times self centered. he doesn't reflect on his views and values until he's forced to and his physical desires are left empty.camus does a great job in \\"the stranger\\" because it examines part of our value system and demostrates that some people may be closer to being amoral than they want to think. when i first read the novel i was about 15 and i thought it was cool odyseey into a character who reveals thoughts and does things that i don't think many people have the gaul to do. i read it a second time in my English class and a lot of people had adverse reactions to it. most people were stuck on the murder, his language, and how dare he hang out with pimps and talk about his girlfriend so carelessly! where are his morals! so during a discussion i happened to say that the character just didn't have a concrete view on what's good or bad, nor were his values determined by society's standards. for example, he doesn't cry during his mother's funeral. well, i didn't cry during my father's and i was 10. does that mean that i am an example of evil? no. mersualt (and i) both see death a natural act, although it's standard convention for someone to be extremely mournful at a funeral. in other words, common morals are sort of a way to bond people and add value to life. if people at least have the belief then they are still people, right? mesualts views are determined by his own standards, and he didn't really have a reason to be concerned about other people and their current state until his life depends on it.the reason why the stranger was such a profound book is because of the reaction that it got out of people. i can say this, because most of my classmates were disgusted with mersualt and i had to say that people treat others like this all the time. and it's also an examination of the concious that a lot of people are unwilling to admit to. mersualt is not sugarcoated by society's standards, although he is broght to trial for that.the other characters are central to the story as well. marie is devoted to sensual pleasures as much as mersualt, and the pimp (sorry, i forgot his name) sees mersualt as a good person. other characters saw him as weird. their interpretation of mersualt, who demonstrates camus' rule of absurdity is a representation on society's interpretation of the rule itself.the stranger is all too familiar in our society and presents an alternative in the rule of absurdity which could be accepted with a few changes. the stranger provokes, assualts and challenges the belief systems of current society, which is a question that will always remain contemporary although the book is about 80 years old. i tip my hat off to camus. this book is not a must read that can easily be discarded. it should be required of everyone in order to gain insight into our world, the validity of our beliefs and understanding of ourselves."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"One of the very, very few literary works I'd read, in or outside of class, that has significantly changed how I view the world. Or, perhaps, this is inaccurate, for it seems as if I've always viewed the world from a vaguely existentialist perspective but have been unable to articulate it - that feeling of being trapped inside my mind with a ceaseless internalized monologue, of having no &quot;identity,&quot; only continuous reactions to events - before reading the book. Only after having read it, however, can I truly appreciate or even notice the amazing phenomenon of being conscious. That I am not strictly defined or limited by any master plan, that, really, nothing else exists except that internal monologue, seems much more miraculous and much more comforting than any religion."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Two strangers, sitting at the same table in a restaurant one evening for dinner. They only encounter one another because there is a lack of available seating, yet the direct contrast between them is beyond comparison. These two people are Monsieur Meursault and the women who becomes known to him as \\"the robot lady\\"; two characters in The Stranger by Albert Camus.From the moment the robot lady enters the scene, it becomes clear to the reader that she exists solely to give contrast to, the protagonist, Meursault's character. Her personality immediately exudes organization and regularity as she scans the menu, orders her food all at once, and immediately calculates the bill, plus tip, and places it on the table. During the meal, she proceeds to decide, in advance, what radio programs she will listen to each day of the coming week. Meursault describes her as having \\"a voice that was clear and very fast at the same time.\\" He also notices that her movements are \\"jerky\\" and \\"robot-like\\" turning her into the epitome of everything he isn't.Unlike the woman he is seated with, Meursault does not exude any form of organization, and is certainly not one to go about preplanning his life. His character is easy-going and almost lethargic at times. He lives each moment for what it is and even edges on the point of hedonism. While the \\"strange little woman\\" makes her way through life with \\"incredible speed and assurance\\", Meursault is content to spend an entire day peering out of his balcony at the world below.It can be inferred that the robot lady would have a hard time accepting change or any sporadic event that chanced to disrupt her lifestyle or her schedule. Meursault, on the other hand, could care less about change. In essence he is absolutely indifferent to anything and everything that does not relate to his five senses.Yet Meursault and the robot lady do have one small thing in common: regardless of how they live their lives, they both live them only for themselves. The robot lady took no note of Meursault at the table, and though her peculiar nature temporarily aroused his interest, Meursault soon forgot about her too. This overlooked aspect is what ties the robot lady into the theme of the work. The world is indifferent Meursault later discovers, and just as his life meant nothing to this woman, to the existentialist mind, his life means nothing to the uncaring world either."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I'll keep this short.

The critics say it is a brilliant insight on the personality of the absurd, and they believe that Camus is amazing. Please. Camus could not decide what kind of character he wanted Meusault to be. One minute M. didn't care about anything, while the next he was absorbed in Marie's smile. I did not find the book insightful at all, and I honestly feel it is a waste of time to try to find deep meaning in it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is short. It's simplistic. This book would make excellent toilet reading if only one could resist the persistent urge to drop it between one's thighs.When reading a novel, a good indication that you are insensitive to art is if you overemphasize the themes, or ideas. Art is not concerned with WHAT is said, so much as HOW and HOW WELL it is said. From an artistic perspective, the style and execution are what count---not the subject matter. And so, the literary, or artistic, value of this book and its philosophical value are two separate issues.While I understand its emotional appeal to adolescents, I never found existential philosophy (\`a la Camus and Sartre) to be very appealing on an intellectual level; and, I find fictionalized walk-throughs of philosophical ideas to be dreary without exception. Real artists do not generalize human experiences and reduce them to vague, overdrawn abstractions. And so, I would object to this book if it preoccupied itself with philosophical ideas; but, there is nothing as concrete or thoughtful as an idea in this book. Still, the characters are contrived, forced to act out Camus' whimsical &quot;existential&quot; formulas like stiff-jointed marionettes in the hands of a club-fisted puppeteer.From an artistic perspective: the plot is impossibly dumb; the structure is a trivial linear progression of (non)events; the characterization is almost entirely absent, and the characters are uniformly vacuous and wooden; the settings are barely even sketched; the narrative style is that of a mildly retarded six-year-old; the descriptions are banal and monochromatic; and, the dialogue is imbecilic. This book isn't even bad literature---it is perfectly inartistic! On the positive side, because the writing is so simple, it makes good practice reading for those learning French (I have to justify that star).While I'm profoundly indifferent to this book, I recommend it to professors of litterature and philosophistry, and to others who splash around in the shallow end of the intellectual pool and pepper their conversation with verbal baubles like &quot;abyss&quot;, &quot;void&quot;, &quot;Nothingness&quot;, &quot;absurd&quot;, and similar gibberish. If you fall into this category but want to be cured, start by studying &quot;Lectures on Literature&quot; and &quot;Lectures on Russian Literature&quot;, both by Vladimir Nabokov; and &quot;Western Wind&quot; by J. F. Nims. For the philosophically inclined, start with Copleston's &quot;A History of Philosophy&quot;. Study them---but beware, you may end up agreeing with me.If you insist on stories with similar themes, try these:* &quot;Cancer Ward&quot; --A. Solzhenitsyn (Bethell &amp; Burg translation)* &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilych&quot; --L. Tolstoy (Edmonds or Maude/B.G. Guerney translations)* &quot;The Dead&quot; --J.

That's the plot. Gee, I hated this book. Hated it. The main character's behaviour and atheistic beliefs slightly offended me. Don't waste your time on this. Read Ionesco's 'Four Plays' instead. Then again, I might be wrong. After all, a critic's review is based solely upon his or hers personal opinion. It could be a wonderful novel, but not bloody likely.

The poor, pathetic and dated &quot;existentialists&quot; base a who literary school on an outlook that is a mere passing shade of thought to me. The writing style, which some call &quot;stark&quot; and &quot;uncomprimising&quot;, is simply void of artistry, and highly unoriginal. People don't read books like this for the pleasure of an amazing story, or beautiful imagery, rather Camus is read by psuedo-intellectuals searching for a witty and stark outlook on life. Notice how nobody talks much about the story but rather &quot;what Camus is trying to say&quot;. He is not saying much and I did not need this story to illustrate to me an outlook which I experienced as early as the age of 13. Also anyone can write about &quot;big ideas&quot; because they are simplistic and easily grasped by anyone. It takes a true artist however to create the magic of a mood, the enchantment of an image, reality of a gesture and on and on. Camus is no such artist and is hopelessly mediocre as a writer and thinker."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I was required to read this book for my english class.

When I read it the first time, I just wanted people to think I was smart since I was reading Camus.Time went by, and I found myself reading this book again and coming to the conclusion that it is neither really about the murder (that became a song from the Cure later on, if nobody has written that yet), nor the stranger, nor his trial.The book can be interpreted as an allegory to the European presence in Africa. If your heart is socialist enough, you can interpret it as an allegory of the European arrogant presence everywhere in the World.In my view, it is not his best work (I like The Fall much better) but it is a must, no questions asked."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A man is punished and persecuted for taking life at face value. There's also a murder, and some beatings, and a really horrible case of animal abuse, but Camus's narrator takes it all in stride. A fact, that in the end, could kill him.Unfortunately, the main character's nonchalance translates into the readers' boredom at times. There's nothing particularly astounding of fascinating in this novella, and some parts of it seem rather unrealistic. However, the book does have some interesting comments on life and priorities- particularly towards the end. And the narrator's eyes are an interesting pair to see through for a short while."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Camus's The Stranger. It didn't take that long to read, but gave me many interesting things to think about long after I had finished it.Although some see The Stranger as an \\"easy to read\\" novel, the depth of the main character is astounding. Camus uses Meursault to express his questions about how societies come to be, and how they are allowed to exist. The society in The Stranger condemns Meursault for his crime based off earlier events that do not reflect his real character, and are unable to judge his actions properly. It is also thought that Meursault doesn't have any emotion, which is proven to be untrue on many occasions, such as the courthouse scene and the last scenes of the book. If the reader is simply taking every word for its literal meaning, the book is indeed quite simple. However, on closer analysis, the novel contains Camus' questions about society, as well as the analysis of a character that is more unique than any other.The only downfall to the novel is that most people only read the translated version of the book, which cuts out some of the original ideas Camus may have wanted to use. Overall though, the novel is definitely more complicated than meets the eye, and invites the reader to experience something completely different from other novels."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"With this first novel of his, Camus coined the theme of this book, into one, simple phrase: \\"The nakedness of man, faced with the absurd.\\" That man comes in the lead character of this tale, Monsier Mersault. He's an average, normal man, like any old average, normal looking guy off the street. He has a normal job. He looks normal. He has friends, some not so normal. He is in love with a girl who is a co-worker of his, Marie, who also shows affection back. They start dating, and soon can't help but want to get married, but that is mostly Maries want and decision, not Mersault's. He's overall fairly normal, but theres one possible exception. Mersault is an emotionless man. Even at the beginning of the book, where he is explaining his mothers death, he shows no sign of grievance or sadness. Even when faced with the big decision of marriage, and proposal, Mersault does not show any emotion or feelings at all toward it. He is not a man of morals or without morals; he is amoral. Life is pretty good for him, actually.But when he gets involved with a senseless murder, he all together finds himself a completely different person, a stranger, in a strange, confusing world. You must read this book to truly understand the theme Camus meant to put out in this book, and succeeds soaringly at: \\"The nakedness of man, faced with the absurd.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The stranger is more of an epic describing Camus \\"absurd\\" man. It goes through his mind, transcends his soul and at last introduces us to his wavering thoughts.Mersuault is a depressed existentialist who sees no meaning in anything around him, however he believes that there can be something interesting about every minute thing that can make you happly-or at least not sadly- go through every single moment. He possesses the same qualities; the same approach that Camus describes in his philosphical essay about the mythical figure Sisyphus.Mersault is condemned by people who don't know him because of his carelessness. He reminds them of their predominant dark sides and their weakness and inability to face the truth. His friends and acquintances look upon him as a mere person who managed to get along with them fine because of his passiveness and indifference. He yields to all their requests. He doesn't counter-argue. He is more of a friendly intelligent pet. The main theme of the novel, however, stems from Mersault's view of himself. He doesn't understand anything whether relating to him or to the world around him. He is a stranger in his own eyes who moves as a stranger between people unaware of anything except for his existence and insignificance.At the end of the story, just before his execution, Mersault realizes that he has no other opportunities in this life he didn't live trying to understand. He wants to embrace his last moments by becoming worth of anything, even if it was people's hatred or disgust.The stranger is one of the most intriguing novels that artistically describes an existentialist and confused mental state."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger Review by Sade McFaddenWhen I read books, I must be honest, I look for characters who are exciting,dangerous, or outgoing. Camus' The Stranger, has none of thoes, how ever it was very much of intrest as if it were a book such as Carl Webbers' Baby Mama Drama.We have the main character who is just \\"Bland\\". He cares for notthing, never showing the list bit of emotion. He's mother dies and does he cry... not at all, but he does want to go to sleep. He's so sleepy...yet after the funeral he goes to the beach, the movies, then to his house where he has sex with an old friend...or is she more than just a friend.Next there's Raymond, a \\"pimp\\" who wants revenge on his \\"mistress\\", in which he beats the hel out of. Now from there on \\"mr.thoughtless\\" Meursault helps him by writing the letter to lure the mistress. Then he testifies for Raymond to relive Raymond of his charges.Now don't get me wrong, but doesn't it seeem ironic that Raymond never helps out in any of his little attempt to get revenge. He just leaves Meursault to do all the work. Meursault kills the Arab on the beach leading to his fate. Emotionless...no stupid, Meursault ends up on trial when it should have been Raymond.Oh and lets not forget sorry old Solomon, that has been with his dos so long that now look exactly alike. He shold just get on his hands and knees, bark, and marry his dog. He beats the life out of his dog and mistreats it, but when it leaves he's crying why... um hello.Now in the end of the book if you have any bit of religion in your soul, your faith might just be tested. So Meursault does not believe in GOD..but wait he does believe in life after death. So he thinks he knows himself so well... then why doesn't he know what he wants.

Originally written in French and published in 1942. Although it was then translated by Matthew Ward and was published in 1988. I describe this book as philosophical crime fiction, in that it makes you really think about what's happening. Understanding it is difficult because of the actions that the characters take and which come off very mysterious. With 123 pages, no pictures except the ones you can imagine in your head.Three people that really stand out in the story are Meursault, Raymond Sintes, and Marie Cardona. Meursault is a type of person who lives for the day and tries to make it as wonderful as possible. Knowing him, he doesn't worry about the future to much or think before he takes action. As for Raymond, he beats his mistress and her brother becomes a conflict. Raymond is the cause of Meursault's downfall, because he gives him the gun that later kills his mistress's brother. Originally Raymond just wanted to use Meursault, but in the end they ended up trusting each other, which they both gained a friend. Marie is in love with Meursault. Inside she wants to marry him, although he feels indifferent about it but that doesn't run her away. She remains loyal to him even when he goes to court. She is known as the mixed blessing in his life.The main problem of the story is a murder. It starts out with Meursault receiving a telegram explaining that his mother has died. He travels to Algiers, to attend his mother's funeral but he doesn't remember much of it. The day after the funeral he goes to the beach for a swim and runs into Marie Cardona, a former co-worker. They make plans that evening to see a movie, then they stay the night together when he awakes Marie is nowhere to be seen, so he sits on his balcony and watches people go by. The following day he returns to work, on his way home to his apartment he runs into his neighbor Raymond, he invites him in for dinner. Over dinner Raymond brags about beating up his mistress because she cheated on him and he got in a fight with her brother. He wants to torment her more but he needs Meursault to write her a letter telling her to come back, so he agrees to do so. Marie later comes and visits Meursault, they hear shouting and the police show up and arrest Raymond for beating his mistress. Raymond asks Meursault to testify on his behalf so he agrees to do so.Marie asks Meursault if he wants to marry her and he replies indifferently and says if you want to we can so they become engaged. Bringing Raymond with them to a friends beach house, where they run into the Arabs, one of which is Raymond's mistress' brother, a fight breaks out and Raymond gets stabbed, they leave to go treat it. When returning to go find the Arabs again Raymond thinks about shooting them but Meursault stops him and takes the gun. Meursault then returns to the spring to cool off when he shoots Raymond's mistress' brother for no reason. He's then arrested and thrown into jail. Meursault is heartless. He is asked to put his faith in God but refuses to do so. Adapting to prison life pretty well he keeps his mind of the things he always had. Usually by sleeping most of the day.Meursault is taken to court. During the trial the subjects shifted from the murder to a discussion of his own character. Many people were called upon to testify, although they all attested to his lack of grief and tears. Because of his lack of moral feeling threatens all of society the prosecutor calls him a monster. Sentenced to death by beheading. He is given one more chance to turn to god but gets angry and refuses to. Believing he is right in living in a meaningless world. For the first time, Meursault truly embraces the idea that human existence holds no greater meaning. Which he abandons all hope for the future and accepts the \\"gentle indifference of the world.\\" This acceptance makes Meursault feel happy.As we look back on this book it didn't really have a great meaning to it. Although it kind of did. It's sad to think that many people in our world think this way. Life is meaningless and they can just kill anyone who makes them upset, but you can't do that. We need to learn to tolerate people, you can be sad or mad but you just can't take it out on people who have done nothing to you for no reason. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this book to teenagers because they could think wrong about it. Besides that I think it is a good book that you really have to think about and understand the concepts."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger by Albert Camus is about one man's journey that takes a troublesome turn that brings him misfortune. We find him going to his mother's funeral where he expresses no remorse, says very little and returns home. He then goes to see a comedy with a girl he met named Marie. Meursault who is spiritually bankrupt gets involved in a killing. They prosecuted him more for his moral character than for the actual murder itself."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The theme of a universe formed by the absurd and incomprehensible--a universe and its societies that claims to respect and embrace truth, impassive justness, and simplicity, yet, at the same time, condemns people that personify and act as paragons for such ideals, thrusting them into a life of ignominy--this theme has not been lost since 'The Stranger' made its first appearance; and, I dare say, in this world of reemerging religious idealism in the form of Evangelical Christianity in America, Islamic terrorism throughout the world, manipulation and adulteration of Buddhist principles in Burma, pious clashes in Darfur, equally idealistic atheism/secularism--I dare say that the message is still as relevant as when first presented, if not more so.

He also does not care of the consequences or immorality of roaming the beach in search of someone to kill. He is mildly interested in sex. However, the woman whom he shares a bed with is viewed only as a means to the eventual end of satisfy his base needs.

One could call it a nice intro to existentialism or an addition to your goth music research, cuz you know you love to research music."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"\\"The Stranger's\\" theme is that from the moment we are born we are already fated to die and there is no escaping this, so life is largely pointless. Yes, this book is a classic European existentialist-angst downer. The main character, Meursault, is one of those too-cool-to-live guys that just sits in a chair all afternoon and smokes cigarettes blankly--as he does in the book.Meursault, however, is a post-war Western man. This description may not have been Camus' intention. But the lack of feeling or concern for anything, whether the fact that his \\"Maman\\" (a term of affection?) just passed away or that a girlfriend loves him enough to think of marrying him, clearly crosses the line into sociopathy. Meursault goes wherever the events of the day may take him. It might be sitting on his balcony all afternoon or working or shooting a guy to death on a beach. Either way, it doesn't make much difference to him.Camus' \\"The Stranger,\\" after this first reading, seems to be an introduction of Western man's inner self after World War II: shiftless, unbelieving (in anything larger than himself), devoid of any intimacy or emotion; utterly uncaring about anything around him. The theme of \\"we're all dead anyway\\" is clearly revealing and is much food for later thought. \\"The Stranger\\" is a book that will require lengthy revisiting despite its brevity. Just don't revisit it during the holidays."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"thought provoking, well written.short but excellent read.great to discuss with others with more than half a brain."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I first read this book, I hated it. I was in high school, so I didn't think it was important. Even though I only read it once, years later I still remember it.I only remember two scenes in particular. I remember how the main character kills a man for no reason. He's just standing outside in the sun with a gun and decides to shoot a man he doesn't even know.I also remember when the main character is being interrogated, and the person interrogating him shows him a crucifix, asking him how he can be an atheist and not believe Jesus died for him.The main character seems calm and collected, even until the point of his death. He's rigid but not passionate in his atheism, and he's almost like a machine. He's mechanical, with no feeling. He just goes through the motions. It seems like he has no regrets over what he has done. He threw his life away over nothing, but I guess he thought it didn't matter.I think this book shows that anybody, ANYBODY could end up like this guy. Anyone could just one day shoot someone for no reason. Anyone is capable of murder. Pretty dark stuff. I guess this is what happens when you don't have any feelings. You become cold."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"&quot;The Stranger&quot; is such a powerful book, that you won't know that you're questioning everything life has to offer, until the very last sentence. Translator Matthew Ward has helped give us a powerful piece of literature. Author Albert Camus wrote a sensitive story about the purpose of life, and why we bother trying to live. In the end, our fates are all the same, whether we succeeded in life or not. The sentences are simple, but the meanings behind them are passionate. Whether you've thought about your objective on this planet or not - this story will provoke questions within your brain.

These are the opening words of The Stranger, which I found to be one of the most interesting and psychologically challenging books I have read thus far.The book begins with the stranger attending his mother's funeral and displaying a puzzling lack of emotion toward his mother's death.I loved reading this book. There were times when I could not put it down if I tried and other times when it was difficult to get into. The main reason why I enjoyed reading this book is because of Albert Camus' unique style of writing. He adds such meticulous character descriptions and detail to every aspect of the book it never really gets boring, even during less interesting sections. The storyline is somewhat difficult to follow. For those who have seen Seinfeld, I would relate this book to a Seinfeld episode: lots of jumping around from scene to scene and many complicated situations. This sense of chaos adds to the intensity and nature of the book itself.I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy an intellectual challenge and also to people who enjoy learning about different cultures. This book will open up even the most closed off mind."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is a very unique book. Mersault, the main character, is an amoral person, who floats through life as things seem to happen to him without plan or purpose. He eventually commits a murder, in a manner that it is not clear why.To me, it was a tale about sense and judgment. The author created a microcosm, inside the character, of what the world would be like if there were no morals. The bonds existing between human beings are removed, and all that is left is an empty and unemotional person.I highly recommend it, as a picture of where the world would be if we removed the shared experiences of humans."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The title of this book is called \\"The Stranger\\", and for me, it certainly lives up to its title. By the time I finished the book I felt I hardly knew this character any better than when I first began it. I can appreciate the \\"existentialist\\" writing of it, but I found the book to be on the verge of depressing.Camus' style didn't sit well with me either. It read too much like journal entries or stage directions. The narration was very clipped for my taste. The storyline got very muddled and weird when it dealt with what happened to Mersault and the murder. The reasoning he gave for doing it was just unbelievable and dry.The book was an interesting change from the norm however. I did feel my usual reading spectrum was broadened and refreshed by this book. If you want a look into unconventional human reasoning, I suggest you get this book. If you do not like unconventional (and sometimes depressing) glimpses into the human pshyche or practically non-existant dialogue, I suggest you do NOT get this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This short novel is a classic of existentialist literature. The novel is divided into two parts. The first part takes us from the death of Meursault's mother to his killing a man. Throughout Meursault is quite indifferent to whatever does not directly effect his physical comfort. He is largely unmoved by his mother's death. His girlfriend asks if he loves her, he responds that he doesn't know what that means, but he doesn't think so. Meursault becomes friends with a shady character named Raymond almost as if he has nothing better to do at the moment. At last he kills a man on the beach apparently for no other reason than that the sun hit his (Meursault's) eyes in a certain way.The second part of the novel takes us from Meursault's arrest to what is presumably a point near his end. The entire novel is in Meursault's voice and he is still in his cell at the end. He does not take us all the way to the guillotine. Throught the investigation and trial, Meursault is brutally honest. The trial takes on Kafkaesque tones when the prosecution is more interested in his indifference to his mother's death, his affair and shady friends than the actual killing. Self-defense is never suggested by the defense even though the man kill did pull out a knife. It is only in this part that Meursault is at all reflective upon his life, only when it is about to end. And it is only at the end that we see any emotion from Meursault. At the very end, he snaps at an unwanted priest's efforts to bring him into the fold before he dies."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The first time I read this book it had a strong impact upon me. It is a short book but tells much; but so many short books have so much to say. This is a compacted way of writing, but this is a great book.The story begins when Meursault gets news of his mother's death in a Home for Aged Persons where she has been for three years. Her son never visited. He hated to lose his Sundays travelling back and forth.This trip would take him two hours one way. But Meursault didn't do anything on Sundays but walk up and down in his apartment and watch passersby in the street from his window. The book is set in Algiers, North Africa, a land of dazzingly bright sun, and hot weather. The story is told by Meursault himself. His apartment is located in a lower class section of the city. He is an office clerk, bored with his job, bored with life in general. Meursault and his mother never had been close, just two roommates who live together to save money. He is devoid of feelings. He is concerned about his employer being upset about his having to take off to go the his mother's funerals.Ash Wednesday Prayer: From dust you came, to dust you shall return.Existenselism: I exist, therefore I am.Stoicism: Studied indifference.Meursault meets Marie Cardona who had been a secretary for a short time in his office. The two begin dating, sleeping together. Marie wants to get married, Meursaut is indifferent. Perhaps this is the thing to do. He can care less one way or another.There is an elderly man in the apartment, Salamano by name. He has an old dog he beats and curses regularly. The dog and the old man war with each other. Then one the dog dog runs away, probably tired of being beaten. Old Salamano weeps. The dog is never found though the old man looks all over for him.Meusault becomes friends with another man in his apartment, Raymond Sintes. For a man with no feelings Meursault goes out of his way to get in good with Raymond and does his bidding. This is where all his trouble begins. Marie, a pretty girl, wants to get married. She loves Meurault. His employer wants to promote him and send him to Paris. But...Raymond is a pimp. He has a mistress, an Arab girl. He beats her up. Her brother and his friends are after Raymond. Meursault loves the ocean, loves to swim. Raymond invites Meurseult and Marie to a little bungaloo on the beach belonging to a friend. The friends go to visit. The Arabs follow them. Then, in the heat of the day, Meursault shoots and kills the Arab with a gun belonging to Raymond. This man has done nothing to Meusault but has a vendetta against his friend. Meursault is sentenced to death by a public guillotine execution.He languishes in jail. He doesn't mind. It's all the same, work, jail. Then Meursault thinks about his love of the ocean, his love of the city of Algies, his favorite time of day, his mistress and her love. And he realizes he will miss all this. But he doesn't believe in God. His mother didn't either as far as he knew. But at the end she wanted a church funeral. She made friends in the Home for the Aged, had a boyfriend and a woman friend who wept uncontrollably at the funeral. She never made friends at the apartment. She felt the freedom ofleaving this world, not being tied to a body, to existence, to break the bonds of humanity. Her son realized he was happy even though he waited for his execution. He knew how she felt for he felt the same way.The universe looks down on earth and her people with indifference. All born must share the same fate, all must die. And that's the way of the world."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"If you're thinking about getting this book, do it.

Strange little book. My first Camus but quite enjoyable. It will probably make you want to read more."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Meursault, Camus' protagonist in 'The Stranger', is an alienated, anonymous man of no apparent consequence who feels part of nothing, believes in nothing, and stands for nothing. At the start of the 'The Stanger', Meursault's alienation makes him appear cold, unsympathetic but largely benign, however as the plot develops it becomes apparent that his only conviction - that nothing matters - incrementally affects others with ultimately tragic consequences. Although Camus leaves the inner thoughts of his other characters unsaid, presumably the girlfriend of Meursault's petty criminal friend does not wish to be beaten by Raymond and then see him protected by Meursault's false testimony, just as being shot dead on a beach is of some consequence to Meursault's Arab victim.A lesser writer would have made this a simple tale about the perils of alienation in modern society, or railed against the apparent injustice of Meursault being sentenced to death not so much for killing a man as for his apparent lack of contrition. Camus' sparse, direct and deceptively simple writing manages to pose more subtle and penetrating questions through opening doors, even though the reader isn't led through them by the hand. Is the casual yet ultimately cruel indifference of a Meursault the inevitable result if a society tears down traditional (if admittedly imperfect) values and conventions and fails to replace them with anything better? How do we reconcile the right of individuals to see the world and act as they see fit (even if they consider nothing of value) with the right of others - who may consider things important - to be protected from the results of indifference?Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert's Masterpiece is an excellent example of the absurdist point of view...benign indifference. my favorite part of the novel is when she asks him to marry her and he says it doesnt really matter. it is both comedic and a serious read.

With towering power and a conundrum of ambiguous nature, Camus weaves such a beautifully orchestrated character study that studies more than the mere character of one man but the character of society and, in the end, the character of character itself. Yes, without saying much at all, \`The Stranger' says more than most by asking the right questions and underscoring the right themes.The basic plot is rather simple. A young man, living in France, wanders aimlessly in his own life, almost entirely complacent in his own apparent apathy until a relationship with a violent neighbor puts the young man in a perilous situation. When faced with fear and blinding light (the sun), poor decisions are made in haste and soon our protagonist is standing over the dead body of an Arab. He is arrested and tried and ultimately sentenced to death. It is in these final moments, the last ten pages or so, that the whole story comes to completion and we can see the soul of what Camus was trying (successfully so) to enliven for the reader.In the final chapter, Camus spins a web of questions that shed light on the protagonist's situation and the complexities that lie in deciding his guilt. I think that is what makes this novel so profound and so respected. It manages to speak to the heart and soul of all who read it because it dissects injustice in a way that is less manipulative and more intimate. As the story comes to a close (the finale being an open end) all that came before it makes more sense, especially in the development of Meursault (our narrator), a man who was devoid of emotion and suffered the consequence of such self-denial.Now, many have gripped as to the translation. Ward's is the only translation that I have read, but I hear that this is inferior and in reading some of the side by side comparisons to Gilbert's translation, I can see why many are upset with this. Gilbert's translation seems far more full bodied and even feels like a completely different book in some parts, which is striking and somewhat sad. The translations should NOT differ so much as to completely change to structure of a sentence, and yet that seems to be the case here. I want to read Gilbert's translation now. Still, this story is sensational and from the eyes of a first time reader, Ward's version was just fine."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Great book about society and absurdism. Very reasonably priced. A quick and worthwhile read that I enjoyed and reconsidered my values and how they relate to those of society's."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Quite often people do not understand what \\"the Stranger\\" is about. In my opinion, Camus has summarized it best by saying: \\"In our society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death. I only meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game. In this respect, he is foreign to the society in which he lives; he wanders, on the fringe, in the suburbs of private, solitary, sensual life. And this is why some readers have been tempted to look upon him as a piece of social wreckage. A much more accurate idea of the character or, at least one much closer to the author's intentions, will emerge if one asks just how Meursault doesn't play the game. The reply is a simple one; he refuses to lie. To lie is not only to say what isn't true. It is also and above all, to say more than is true, and, as far as the human heart is concerned, to express more than one feels. This is what we all do, every day, to simplify life. He says what he is, he refuses to hide his feelings, and immediately society feels threatened. He is asked, for example, to say that he regrets his crime, in the approved manner. He replies that what he feels is annoyance rather than real regret. And this shade of meaning condemns him.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"... \\"The Stranger\\" is a pleasant breeze in literature but an endless moral debate.

By this, i mean that what this book is known for and was written for, namely, to &quot;demonstrate the absurd&quot;, is found as much in the Tone of the writing as in any plot development, etc. And, it seems that (at least in the first half of the book) the short, frank sentences, as well as dialogue, convey Camus' message perfectly. This is because Camus is attempting to give us a character who has &quot;no illusions about the world&quot; to cover up the fundamental absurdity, he lives strictly by way of bodily pleasure/ pain, taking the path of least resistance. Thus, in order to convey such a message, long and elaborate sentences probably wouldn't work. Hence, we are given a character who not only supposedly has no illusions about the world, but also doesn't try to burden the reader with complex words. The frankness of the writing provides for funny moments depending on your given sense of humor, such as when Mersault, the main character, discusses marriage with his girlfriend, confirming to her that indeed he would marry anybody and that it really doesn't matter. In addition to Mersault, the &quot;absurd hero,&quot; there are of course those characters who live by fantasies about great illusions, working towards some greater good and justice. These characters are mostly found in the second half of the book. Mersault never changes his philosophy about life, which is basically &quot;go with the flow&quot;, however, whereas the first half of the book this philosophy gains him friends and sex, in the second half, in the hands of &quot;the law&quot;, gains him the reputation of a hardened criminal. It should also be noted that those people who think themselves to be farthest from the absurd (those in the court, police officers, etc.) are usually presented as those who in fact are most absurd and behave most ridiculously. Overall, this book makes for good discussion and a most enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is one of the better works of existentialist fictions, as Camus illustrates the absurdity and senselessness that we meet in life without shoving overblown philosophical tenets in the reader's face. With deft subtlety and conciseness, Camus manages to say so much in 100 pages, and from a literary standpoint, is much more enjoyable than Sartre's &quot;Nausea.&quot; I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus' novel 'The Stranger' certainly makes one ponder the meaning of life. The main character is a lost, hopeless, and amoral individul who trudges through life day by day. In the end, he discovers his life has no real meaning. Like Sisyphus condemned to endlessly roll a huge boulder to the top of a hill--only to have it roll down again, the protagonist goes through his daily routine, even though he realizes his actions will lead him to no end or conclusion. The frightening aspect of this tale is that while this book was written in 1942, one could argue that there are many of these individuals in today's society. Many more than even the existentialist Camus could have imagined."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger, by Albert Camus, is a good book that was originally written in French. Any book that is translated into English is almost always a good book. In this book you read about a man named Meursalt that is almost indifferent on every subject in the story, and you really start to notice it as you read further into the story. As you read The Stranger it seems as if Meursalt isn't even perticipating in the world around him, it seems like he's just watching.Through the book I noticed that Albert Camus gets into a lot of detail in The Stranger. Albert Camus describes every action that Meursalt goes through. An example of this is when Meursalt says I smoked a cigar in my mother's living room. Again, this statement is one of indifference. Infact, many of the statements in this book are like this one. Very few statements in this book are either positive or negitive. I believe Albert Camus does this for a reason. I think he does it so you can find out how you think.This book was written in 1946 and is considered Albert Camus' one masterpiece. Even in today's world it still holds social significance. It gives the reader an insight on how he or she thinks through the neutral character Meursalt. Nearly sixty years later Albert Camus' masterpiece is still read by people every day. It is even part of the high school reading criteria.Even if your not that entranced with The Stranger it will still make you think. Even if the thoughts aren't positive. There are parts in this story when you think, \`Why would he say that.' Or, \`Now why would he get involved with him.' Like any books though I think there are some flaws. Sometimes he does things that seem to have no meaning except to further the plot. In fact, the plot itself doesn't seem to show itself until halfway through the story. In the end though this is still a book you should consider reading. It is an interesting book and after reading it for a while you will start getting into the plot."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is certainly one of the most powerful of the last century. It is a product of a philosophical movement which is sweeping in its scope and depth. This book is interesting in literary terms, but probably should not be studied without some knowledge about the existentialism of Camus and Sartre. Highly recommended..."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus' The Stranger is classic existentialism. The lead character, M. Meursault, epitomizes indifference, and his responses towards life are the essence of the author's underlying existentialist beliefs The story is divided down the middle into two parts, the punctuated by the murder of an Arab on the beach by the lead character. The first part of the story mainly introduces the character of Meursault, by showing his interactions with his fellow characters, also including the death of his mother and the new romance between Meursault and Marie, which blossoms the day after Meursault returns from his mother's funereal. The second part is Meursault's trial, which is largely like the final episode of 'Seinfeld,' as all the characters are called up to testify on Meursault's personality. Condemned to die, Meursault has a revelation about life, which is the key theme in the book Faced with non-existance, Meursault realizes that there is no outer meaning in the universe, and that is the most imprortant message from the work."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"At the end of his life, Meursault completed something that brought him back to the beginning of his life. Everything mentioned in the story has some relevance to the meaning of the book. Otherwise, Camus wouldn't spend anytime writing it. This, in a way, contradicts his whole intent of The Stranger's actual meaning...well shall I say meaningless belief. I thought there was some purpose for Camus to point out the only memory Meursault had of his father. He thinks the only thing interesting to a person is to watch an execution. Just to point out, this is what he believes from growing up knowing only this of his father. Nearing his own execution, he relates back to this vague memory and it brings him a sense of comfort that he could be the one for his father to watch. (Not to analyze this story anymore but) Growing up without a father and with this execution story as his only reliance, Meursault's perception of life became very tainted. Meursault seems focused on his beliefs/non-beliefs through most of the story, but in that sense, to be extremely driven at his existentialistic thoughts, he shows himself insecure and unsure. For example: he is bothered that the scaffold is not risen to a higher level, that he could not \\"mount the scaffold, going right up into the sky.\\" He wishes there were some way out of his death. As if there was a heaven for him to grasp or at the least tease him proving that there could be a chance for his life to be spared.Meursault experienced emotion more in part two. \\"I would wait frantically until I heard the sound of my own breathing, terrified to find it so horse...and I would have gained another twenty four hours.\\" He searched for an answer. After the pensive time in his prison cell, he could not find anything to answer his meaning of life. His whole beliefs up to this point had been so uncompromising that his reaching for an answer in life was hopeless and too hard to change his past feelings. He died without his hopeful (at that one inspired moment that he searched for it) answer. That might be the most absurd thing about Meursault. \\"I said I had been looking at the stones in these walls for months. There wasn't anything or anyone in the world I knew better. Maybe at one time, way back, I had searched for a face in them. But the face I was looking for was as bright as the sun and the flame of desire...I had searched for it in vain. Now it was all over. And in any case, I'd never seen anything emerge from any sweating stones.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The title of the novel The Stranger by Albert Camus describes Meursault relationship to society. He acts in a human situation as though human relationships, and therefore responsibilities, do not exist. He is a stranger to society, because he refuses to make any concessions whatsoever to its codes and rituals. He sees no relation at all between his mother's death and seeing a comic film tow days later, and establishes none. And, seeing it through his eyes, we are almost in complete agreement. He is the man who refuses to lie. Camus uses this piece of writing to satire society in regards to our complacency and to ridicule our smugness. It is not, however the satire of a society and the miscarriage of justice that give the tale its fundamental significance. With the shooting of the Arab, Meursault tells us &quot;everything began&quot;. The revolver shot jolts Meursault out of his negative state. After his imprisonment, Meursault discovers three inexhaustible but completely closed subjective worlds: the world of memory; the world of sleep; and the world of human solitude. To him in prison his face is now that is a stranger, an exile. The final revelation comes with the chaplain. Here he is jolted out of his apathy and into a state of rage. He realizes that this crime and revelation are as one. He destroyed and is destroyed. There is no excuse, explanation or compensation. Meursault becomes a sacrificial victim, his end is apotheosis. The stranger has found his kingdom on a prison bed. Every moment of the life of a human being who by inexplicable decree of fate is destined to death. Meursault disappears with this revelation. It is clear that Meursault initial mental attitude proves inadequate to cope with even the simplest of lives. The very existence of the absurd in his case is that out of indifference he linked to forces of violence and death, not with love and life. He fails to ask any questions and thereby errs."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Jean-Paul Sartre suggests in his essay on Camus' The Stranger that, \\"For him, neither love nor individual loves exist. All that counts is the present and the concrete\\". For Meursault, every experience has the equal importance. Therefore, his past and future don't have any particular significance in his life. He just lives the present and he \\"recreates himself\\" every single day. He neither benefits from his past experiences nor invests on his future. When his mother dies, he can continue his life as if nothing has happened. When he is asked whether or not he loved his \\"Maman\\", he replies that he probably loved his mother but it didn't matter to him. In the general course of the novel, he is portrayed as a man who \\"has no desire to know these noble, continuous, completely identical feelings\\". However, there are some remarkable scenes that mark slight departures from his \\"existentialist\\" personality which is depicted in the novel. By means of these scenes, Camus portrays a character whose lifestyle and actions are closer to the principles of \\"existentialism\\" rather than a person who qualifies himself as an existentialist and lives accordingly.In the second part of the novel where he is put in prison as he has killed an Arab, it is possible to see some changes in his views which have been depicted as indifferent, passive and silent before. His expressive silence with short and simple descriptions turns into more complicated and abstract descriptions of his condition in the prison. In these descriptions, it is possible to say that he mentions more about the psychological aspects of his situation such as happiness, hope, boredom and even hatred. The last scene remarkably deviates from the \\"existentialist\\" course of the novel although it still has the qualities that affirm the principles of Meursault's existentialist personality explored by Sartre.In the last scene, it is apparent that Meursault doesn't feel any kind of remorse for his murder during his imprisonment. He explicitly remarks that his \\"debt owed to society\\" doesn't have any significance for him. He even thinks of any possibility of escape that can free him. But later, he gives up this idea as everything outside is designed to condemn him again. Later in the scene, he starts making up new laws that \\"give the condemned man a chance\\". Since the laws of the society that he has rejected long ago are not valid for him, he doesn't think, even for a while, that he is guilty as he has killed a man and he deserves to be punished due to his crime. Each commitment plays the same role in his life. Therefore, nothing needs to be limited and regulated by laws and rules. And this affirms Sartre's analysis that \\"everything is lawful\\" for Meursault.In this scene, the aspects that depart from the general principles of existentialism are remarkably distinguishing the scene from the others. First of all, as Meursault suggests in a former scene, he has to benefit from his past not to get bored in the prison. Because he doesn't have present activities any longer such as swimming and dating with Marie to fill his every present day. That's why, he often remembers a story told by his Maman, which is about his father whom he has never known. He has to feed on his memories to live in the prison although he is regarded as a man for whom \\"all that counts is the present and the concrete\\". As he has suggested in a former scene, there are two things that he knows in the prison: \\"yesterday\\" and \\"tomorrow\\". He has to fill his present day with the memories of the \\"yesterday\\" and has to wait for \\"tomorrow\\" to fill it up with the past again. There is nothing to do for a man who doesn't have anything new and concrete for the present although he is supposed to be a man \\"having neither past nor future\\". The other distinctive point in the scene is that his feelings start to come to the surface as opposed to the other scenes that portray Meursault completely indifferent to any kind of feelings. When he comes closer to death, a struggle starts between his rational and indifferent side that goes parallel with the principles of existentialism and his other side which is completely human and reactive to death. This struggle constitutes the source of his hope, sensitivity and eventually hatred. His rational side which reigns in the novel insists that to die sooner or later doesn't mean anything as \\"life isn't worth living\\". However, his sensitive and human side keeps on imagining that he is pardoned. At these moments he feels such intense emotions that he is receding from his rational side and it becomes harder and harder to calm himself down: \\"The trouble was that I would somehow have to cool the hot blood that would suddenly surge through my body and sting my eyes with a delirious joy. It would take all my strength to quiet my heart, to be rational\\". As can be seen in the quotation, he can't help having a strong desire to live no matter how much he tries to make himself believe that to die or to live \\"doesn't matter\\" to him. At the very end of the novel, it is possible to infer that a strong hatred lies in him, which constitutes the main source of his indifference that rules the novel and of his intense feelings emerging against his rationality. It is this hatred that has emerged in the years of his education for all mankind, social norms, rules and traditions that have disappointed him; it is this hatred that has turned into his indifference to the whole world; and it is this hatred that is eventually vomited forth by a man whose last wish for his execution is \\"a large crowd of spectators\\" meeting him \\"with cries of hate\\".Camus' The Stranger gives the reader a portrait of the man, which is analyzed within the framework of existentialism in Jean-Paul Sartre's essay, and Sartre regards the novel as a complete affirmation of existentialism. However, when the novel is analyzed in a complete sense including the parts which deviate from its general \\"existential\\" flow, it is quite possible to conclude that Camus is not taking \\"existentialism as a position\\" with its full sense, and creates the hero of his novel according to its principles; instead, he is exploring and testing its principles through Meursault. As it is seen in the last scene of the novel, Meursault is a character who has feelings and certain reactions when he comes face to face with the natural needs of his humanness. Emotions are indespensable parts of his nature as a human being. His feelings from which he can escape in a life of passivity become inevitable when he has to face with death."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is one of the best reading experiences I have ever had. This is the first book I have read by Albert Camus, and in fact I am not even aware of any of his other works. However this book was enough for me to realize that he is truly a gifted writer. The way he developed his characters really intrigued me. I found that I was almost able to feel what Meursault was feeling, his frustrations, and his happy moments. Camus did all this without rambling on and on with too many adjectives and other modifying phrases that just makes a story seem muddled. I was also happy to see that he kept the entire novel relatively on the short side, making it enjoyable for someone, like myself, who just does not have the time to dedicate to reading a long drawn out book. It's hard when a person can only find time every couple days to read and I think we should all thank Mr. Camus for writing a book that even with that little amount of time we have to read, we are able to enjoy it to its fullest.The way Camus develops this story makes it that much more interesting. Meursault, who has sort of the \\"anti-hero\\" role, manages to get himself entangled with the wrong group of people, and for no apparent reason, he senselessly kills a man. Meursault is then imprisoned on murder charges and after a while is brought before a jury for a rather absurd trial. The proceedings are mostly nonsense, and are based upon technicalities and other worthless information, rather than the facts of the crime. The end to the trial and the jury's sentence, which I will let you read for yourself, just further shows the absurdness of the entire trial.Toward the end of the story it becomes even more apparent how Meursault has become the \\"stranger\\" to society through his complete disassociation with the rest of the world. Yes, he seems to show some emotion, but when it comes to anything deep, he shows none. His girlfriend wanted to know if he still, or if he ever loved her. The only thing that he can seem to come up with is, well maybe. Maybe I never did. He also showed little or no emotion for the death of his mother, finding peace in a few comedies, instead of showing signs of depression, anger, frustration, or even shedding tears. These emotional and psychological issues show to me that there was obviously something deeply wrong with Meursault and that neither he nor anyone else was going to do anything about it. Meursault is one of the best-developed characters that I have ever read about. In fact it made me wonder if there was not someone in Mr. Camus's family that possibly had similar psychological issues to Meursault, and if so than that would explain how Camus was able to develop this character so well. If there was no one that he knew first hand, than Camus deserves even more credit for developing a character was such great depth.I would have to say that some people may not find this book that interesting to them, some parts are a bit ambiguous, but if you think about those parts you find them clear enough to get through. The characters, as I have said before, are described and developed so well that you will feel like you are one of them, along with what I felt was a fairly interesting story line. Even if you don't like the book you should be at least able to appreciate how well written this novel is."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"We are taught, at least through western institutions, to apply sense in everything that happens around us and to us. The \\"sense\\" of things is of course there to begin with. By trying to \\"apply sense\\" to them, that is, to make our own sense of them we might be not seeing them for what they really are.The Stranger is a person who is literally watching his own life unfold without taking any passionate or particular emotional interest in it. It is as if he is having a peculiar out of body experience without being in a trance.Many of the people who've read this book find it absurd (as is evident by the reviews of it here in Amazon as well). That's because they do what i mentioned above, they try to apply their own sense to it, and that is the real absurdity.Life is not one path and it's not monodimensional. The \\"logic\\" that one person applies might be sheer madness for the next and so on. Camous's hero is a person detached from his surroundings. He finds it hard to understand why some people think this or the other thing, he finds it equally hard to share emotions that qualify as \\"normal\\". He is comfortable in his own world of indifference and becomes uncomfortable when the worlds of others interfere with his. That's what he is or how he is.When the Stranger becomes a murderer it really comes as no surprise really considering the process via which this happens. Anything could happen to him as he doesn't resist the flow of things, he avoids friction and paradoxically this avoidance of friction that he so intensely pursues leads him to direct confrontation with his environment because of his crime. And this crime is dealt with by the Stranger the same way he's dealt with everything else: he is a spectator of that too.Camous uses the trial of the Stranger brilliantly. The trial is of course nothing more than a platform the author utilises to bring across a clearer image of the Stranger. And as the final curtain is about to fall the reader is subjected to a very controversial view of the world. Which is? It's just \\"let me be\\"...I think that the reason The Stranger maintains its charm and importance even today (which means that it still touches the pulse of the times) is exactly because our societies are increasingly becoming full of Strangers, full of Spectators, and those who deny it should be accused of hypocrisy. This is not accidental. And, exactly because it is NOT accidental this book remains as important as the day it was first published. Why are we like this? Why have we become what we've become? Is this really our potential? Indifference? Is this all?Existentialist rhetoric and questions some might say. True, but defining our existence is something most of us are not good at. The questions might be old but they haven't been answered, not in the past 50 years, not in the past 20 centuries. The Stranger asks them too. He's not the only one."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is a book I recommend to anyone who claims they liked &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Camus acheives the same sort of antihero in this novel, the detached, dispassionate protagonist that intrigues and mystifies us.This book should be read by all purely for the experience, for it is so much unlike the typical or popular styles that it is good exercise for the mind; in addition, it's a great story, and a classic. Go get it!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When you finish this short classic you ask, &quot;What was it about?&quot; The fact that you ask is one of the reasons it's a classic. Another reason is that, like all classics, it's about the human experience. A 50+ year old book tackles themes still relevant today.A young French Algerian man, Meursault, kills an Arab for little reason and is tried for murder. The book is an examination of a dispassionate killer that doesn't seem to care for anything, even whether he lives or dies. Is Meursault is a typical sociopath or just an indifferent slob getting by? I was taken by how his lack of passion was read by every character in the book differently. He seems cold to the funeral director when his mother dies. But his new girlfriend is attracted by the same lack of passion. His boss sees him as a good employee though odd. Ultimately the court sees him as a mad killer. They all see what they want to see.The lack of any human feeling was ultimately the demise of Meursault. He could have done all of the same things, but if he had only shown some emotion, he would have survived. I find this very true in life. Our emotions are read for the good and bad. We are expected to be dispassionate when we're professional and passionate when we're in love. The deviation from those expectations many times leads us to trouble even when our actual actions are appropriate. Meursault's actions are questionable, but it is easy to see that with a little charm and personality, he could have easily talked himself out of all of his troubles.Of the 20th century classics, it is certainly one of the shortest, and it has plenty to say. I liked it enough that I will attempt another Camus in the future."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger might be a book that you've always heard about and never settled down to the actual joy of reading it. Now is a good time. It's fairly short weighing in at 123 pages but the awesome power of Camus' artistry is that he accomplishes exactly what he wants efficently. It is the story of Monsieur Meursault, an office worker in his 30's whose mother has just passed away. As the book opens he is travelling to the nursing home where she died. Much has been said of the coldness of the character but he feels guilt about his mother. Throughout the novel there are hints that he believes he killed his mother by putting her there. Meursault seems to have lost his connection with humanity. He behaves more like an automaton that a man. He goes to work, he makes friends, he has sex, but he does these things on automatic pilot. Who knows why he kills the stranger on the beach? Meursault would probably say &quot;what difference did it make if I killed him or not?&quot; Good and evil have become irrelevant to him. I do not see why on the back of the novel and in some reviews I have read it is said that he is drawn UNWITTINGLY into a senseless murder. I believe he did it to wake himself up from the big sleep he had sunk into. If he killed a man, it would prove he had an effect upon the world. He could wipe out a life. In these days when we have to put up with OJ and Timoty McVeigh, the trial scenes written in 1946 seem very prophetic of times to come. The lawyers are more interested in appearances and drama than they are in prosecuting or defending the accused. All you would have to do is include TV cameras in the courtroom scenes and substitute lethal injection for the guillotine and this novel couldve have been written in 2001. It would still have the haunting power. It is a beautiful book. I don't know if its one of the greatest ever, but it is great. One of the other disturbing images in here is an old man that lives in Meursault's building who owns this mangy looking mutt that he is always beating and cussing at. When the dog disappears the old man loses all purpose in his life. In his own way, he was showing love for the dog by torturing it. It's just another way of showing the lies we invent to hide the truth from ourselves. I think Meursault was the biggest liar of all. Brillant translation."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The darkness and simplicity of this wonderful book are frequently misunderstood. Many readers find Merseault cold and emotionless, but this is not the case. Merseault displays emotion in his argument with the prison priest, and (big surprise) his feelings toward his mother.Although he is put on trial for killing an Arab, Mersault is actually condemned for failing to grieve for his mother in public. Have any of you been to the funeral of an elderly realative? Sometimes, despite the emotions you feel for that person, the experience of the funeral is flat, meaningless and logical. All of the love came before the event and will come again many times later. But somehow a funeral leaves one dry and plain. Mersault experienced his mother's death for what it was: a dry and uncomfortable event. He did not put on a show for the people involved with the funeral or those who knew the deceased. His actions were plain and honest.But Merseault does have feelings for his mother. When he learns much later that she had a lover in the elderly home she occupied he feels glad for her. That moment of empathy if an extrordinary act of comppassion. It is also a private one.&quot;The Stranger&quot; reveals many simple truths about the kind of people we are and it raises questions about the inegrity behind our thoughts and actions. It is a wonderful book whose value is easily overlooked by people who only put stock in a verbose work."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"For me, The Stranger, is one of those books of which I have heard and read much about, but which I have never actually read from cover to cover. The fact that the book now appears in an &quot;American&quot; translation encouraged me to finally pick up the book and read it. From its famous first sentence through Meursault's final musings as he awaits execution, I was totally entranced. Several times I castigated myself for not reading this book sooner, because I think that it is an important statement that is as relevant now as it was when it was first published.Meursault goes through life dispassionately, seeing the choices of his life as being of no importance, and never concerning himself with social conventions. He has only one credo: to be honest to himself and to others. Ironically, this normally admirable quality often offends those around him and brands him as being immoral. Therefore, the fact that he does not cry at his mother's funeral is seen by his prosecutors as being just as criminal as the pointless murder Meursault commits &quot;because of the sun.&quot; While most existential literature is cyncial and pessimistic, The Stranger offers readers a semblance of hope in facing the &quot;benign indifference of the universe.&quot; Meursault realizes at the end of his life that he has been happy and that his death, just as his mother's, will not be greeted with tears."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"All I can say is that this book is simply fantastic. Despite its brevity and spareness... the essence of it, and all the concerns that it addressed remain deeply relevant today. It changed and challenged many of my views and perceptions on life, God and redemption. It was one of the best books I've read so far."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Though Camus is an exceptional prose stylist he is no thinker and this is never more clear than in The Stranger. Walter Kaufmann has noted the general vacuity of Camus' thought in his (Kaufmann's) prolific criticism on existentialism. Philip Freund, in his meticulously long essay &quot;Albert Camus and Symbolism&quot; (in The Art of Reading the Novel) has convincingly demonstrated the alarmingly weak structural integrity of much of Camus' fictional work. I recommend The Stranger as an experiment, as it incidentally yields some intriguing insights; but I qualify this recommendation as, architectonically (inclusive of plot execution, coherence of symbolism, philosophical cogency) The Stranger, largely, is a failure."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This short novel by Albert Camus was written in 1946. It's about a young Algerian Frenchman, Muersault, who works at an office job and lives a dull ordinary life. He describes his mother's funeral with clarity and dispassion and, as the story unfolds, the reader sees that this detachment is the general theme of the book. He doesn't love his girlfriend but it makes no difference to him whether he marries her or not. He helps an acquaintance commit an aggressive act because he just doesn't care enough one way or another. And, eventually, he commits a murder and is arrested. The trial then focuses on this disaffected aspect of his character. The conclusion is inevitable.I found this book quite uncomfortable reading. As Muersault observed the world around him, I was caught up in it, found myself seeing it all through his eyes, trapped in his inertia. I entered his world and felt a weird kind of sympathy as well as identification with him. This was very troubling. The little book packs quite a wallop.Yes, I do see this book as a work of art. Every word resonates with double and triple meanings. And every word is like a hammer blow. I read it fast, trying to shake off its impact. That didn't work, however, because &quot;The Stranger&quot; will linger long in my mind. This is the philosophy of essentialism and the book is a classic. I just can't help the fact that I hated it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger was the first novel of Camus' labeled &quot;absurd,&quot; and it defines Camus for most Americans. The plot is quite simple, with none of the diversions common in popular literature. The main character is not a hero, has no &quot;true&quot; love affair and the pursuit of money and power never enters the story. The Stranger is an honest atheist, waiting for life to happen.The title l'Etranger, has been poorly translated. The U.S. title, The Stranger, implies that the main character, Meursault, has been viewed as a &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;odd&quot; person for some time. The other possible meaning is that no one knows him. Meursault is a stranger even to those who think they know him. These definitions do not seem adequate. The U.K. title, The Outsider, only serves to confuse readers even more.Meursault is the archetype of a middle-class man. He works as a clerk, rents an apartment and draws no attention to himself. He is, if anything, very ordinary. Meusault might even be boring. He lacks deep convictions and passion. If he is estranged from any aspect of French society, it is religion--he does not believe in the symbols and the rituals of faith.Estranged? &quot;Cela m'est &eacute;gal.&quot;Along with the title, Camus took care in naming the main character. Meursault's name is symbolic of the Mediteranean sea. Mer mean &quot;sea&quot; and soliel is French for &quot;sun.&quot; The sea and the sun meet at the beach, where Meursault's defining actions occur.Meusault is an anti-hero. His only redeeming quality is his honesty, no matter how absurd. In existential terms, he is &quot;authentic&quot; to himself. Meusault does not believe in God, but he cannot lie because he is true to himself. This inability to falsify empathy ultimately condemns him. Meursault has faith only in what he, himself, can see or experience with his other senses. He is not a philosopher, a theologian or a deep thinker. Meursault exists as he is, not trying to be anything more or less than himself.Why did Camus' readers recognize Meursault as a plausible character? After two World Wars and much suffering, many people came to live life much as Meursault does. Or at least they tried to do so. These people lost the will to do more than exist. There was no hope and no desire. The only goal for many people was simple survival. Even then, the survival seemed empty and hollow. We learn how empty Meursault's existence is through his relationships. He is not close to his mother; we learn he does not cry at her funeral. He does not seem close to his lover, Marie Cardona. Of her, Meursault states, &quot;To me, she was only Marie.&quot; There is no passion is Meursault's words or in his life.What sets Camus apart from many existentialists and modern philosophers in general is his acceptance of contradiction. Yes, Camus wrote, life is absurd and death renders life meaningless--for the individual. But mankind and its societies are larger than any one individual person."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus finished his first novel, \\"The Stranger\\", when he could not leave Paris during its first year of occupation by the German army in 1940-41. This was France's darkest hour, especially when right-wing collaborators betrayed many other French citizens to the evil Gestapo.Hitler and his Nazi hordes seemed poised to rule all of Europe, plunging it into a new dark age. How could anyone cope with living in a world like this? It seemed impossible for decent people to believe in anything at all.\\"The Stranger\\", an allegory, does not directly address this crisis. Camus instead tells of a man in Algeria, the narrator, who appears to care nothing about anyone or anything. He tells us of his indifference or boredom to nearly every situation.The tale begins, for example, when his mother dies alone in a retirement home; he seems only annoyed that going to her funeral ceremony has disrupted his weekend. Later, when his mistress asks him if he loves her, he comments that \\"it really does not matter if I love you or not, does it?\\" He observes a lonely old man frequently beating his only companion, a scrawny dog, and reacts to this pathetic situation only by wondering why they put up with each other. Why doesn't the miserable old man get rid of the dog? Why doesn't the dog run away? Why do they need each other so much?His only real pleasure, going to the sunny beach, is disrupted one weekend by a fight arising out of a misunderstanding with two Arabs. This somehow leads to his killing one of the two with a knife in apparent self-defense and his arrest for murder. The tale moves rapidly through more and more misunderstandings and absurdities before, during, and after his court trial.I should not, of course, tell how the plot is resolved but urge you to find out for yourself. Anyhow, what's really important in \\"The Stranger\\" is how he finally becomes aware and how to cope with his aimless life and with the suffering surrounding him but simply did not know how to cope with these absurdities.At the end, he finally finds peace of mind. He says he has learned to welcome the cold indifference of the universe. The stars do not care one way or another how he thinks or acts, so he is free...free at last...to do what he chooses.At this time Camus's publisher also released his famous essay, \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\". He tells how the gods had punished Sisyphus, a titan, for having defied them by bringing fire to humans. He is forced every day to push a huge rock up a steep hill, knowing in advance that just before he comes to the top, it will plunge back downhill. Yet, he does not despair. The gods have not defeated him; he is not a dumb animal but is fully aware of the absurdity of his plight. At the end of each day, he is consoled with these thoughts as he walks downhill. Camus tells us that \\"we must imagine Sisyphus happy\\". Yes...happy!!\\"The Stranger\\" and \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" brought relief from despair for many French and other Europeans. They learned that they were at least free to think what they liked. The gods could not take that away from them. They were free to hope and, whenever they chose, to act. We, too, can rebel against the gods anytime we choose."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus gave birth to a character whose apathy seems to be thefruit of pragmatism and a desire for simplicity. Meursault iscursed with hyper-sensitiviy to the people and elements aroundhim. He becomes exasperated when others say things that he has noconcern about. Whatever palpable enthusiam he once had has beenreplaced by the need to sate physical demands and momentary lapses of curiosity. His unrestrained stolid demeanor infuriateshis employer who perceives it as a lack of ambition. It hurts hisgirlfriend's feelings when she ask if he loves her. Meursault'scold response isn't filled with malice, just honesty about hisindifference. If he were simply selfish he'd tell her what shewanted to hear to ensure she'd stay in his life. His actions andrationalizations are of a man in a phantasm aware of his pillowreality. From that vantage point what does morality, remorse, andlove have to do with anything? Whether the sleeper does good orbad he'll wake-up just the same. Meursault is eventually beseigedby people who implore him to capitulate to god, and remorse tospare his body and soul. They may even care more about being hisheroic redeemers in the tragedy more they than empathize with his plight. His ceaseless resistance denies them the chance tobecome transitory deities. Meursault is a man sinking in quick-sand who spits at the ones holding branches within his grasp. Hisdefiance damns him in the eyes of his peers more than any crimeever could."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Somehow, despite majoring in French literature and getting a Ph.D. in French history, I missed this one until I decided to read it recently. Now I'm about to have a full-fledged Camus obsession because I've never met anyone who so well captures the absurdity of existence and the powerlessness of all of us before the inevitability of death. Also, it is such a fun read. It's unsettling, but also entertaining and the protagonist is extremely likable. I love Camus!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus' novel The Stranger is a wonderful piece of literature that takes you into the depths of a human consciousness that embodies the essence of existentialism. Meursault's, the main character, plight is caused by his obvious differences with society and societies morals. Society as a whole has a belief in a divine being that guides their life and gives bounds to their actions. They believe they are here for a reason and this keeps them sane. Meursault does not share this belief and he believes that life is meaningless and therefore he believes it does not matter what he does, he can either do something or not do something. If you like book about spicy love affairs and books that require little though this book probably isn't for you. If, however, you like a book with a clever idea written by one of the literary worlds great writers then this is the perfect book. The Stranger is an absurdist work that shows us a person who is so immersed in existentialist beliefs that he actually feels no emotion; he lives solely for physical pleasure. This lifestyle is only not hedonistic because Meursault doesn't really care whether or not he does something. He can either go to the beach or not go to the beach, either way he is fine. The reason for this behavior is that Meursault believes that life in meaningless so it really makes no difference in the scheme of things whether he does one thing or does something else. This entire thought-provoking concept creates a great novel that people of all beliefs will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In sports, to examine the action closely, they do a slow-motion instant replay. The Stranger by Albert Camus is slow paced; there's one scene in the beginning where the main character, Meursault, describes in full detail his day, in which he looked out the window. That was all, Meursault just talked about the people who walked by that day. However, this single fault the book has is necessary in order to understand and accept Camus' existentialist message. Like a slow-motion replay of fast action, only when Camus slows down the life of Meursault does the reader see the entire picture. The famous image of the novel is Meursault shooting an Arab man on the beach. A fast paced action novel would not have given much detail-- which would have missed Camus' message. Saying that Meursault shot an Arab does not tell the reader anything, but having Meursault describe in full detail the unbearable nature of the heat that day, about the sweat running down his forehead and the sun pounding on his back, and by leaving out any thoughts about the morality of his actions, only then do we understand Camus' message. There is no God out there who care, he could shoot or not shoot, it would not matter either way. What drove Meursault to kill the Arab was not distorted morals, that it would be right for him to kill the Arab on a spiritual or vengeful level. Rather, Meursault killed the Arab because it was hot that day. He is driven by honest emotions only, and Meursault will be persecuted for this later on. Slowing down the pace also makes the story seem that much more real and detailed. I imagined the bullets Meursault shoots at the beach in the same slow motion style that was used in The Matrix. Also, the scenes in which he breaks his placid persona, such as the one in which Meursault attacks a visiting chaplain, are heightened dramatically by the slow pace. The outburst of emotion is far more exciting with a low key atmosphere surrounding it. This is important because the scene with the chaplain, where he discovers his own beliefs (existentialism), is one of the key parts of the novel. Normally I do not like a slow paced novel, but I'm willing to make an exception with The Stranger. By slowing down the action, the theme becomes easier to understand and the images become far more absorbing. Oddly enough, it would appear that the book's only inherent flaw makes the novel better on the whole, and therefore I would not be exaggerating if I said The Stranger was flawless."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"&quot;The Stranger&quot; by Albert Camus is an allegory of our times. A young Algerian, Meursault, commits an absurd crime one hot day on a beach. In a world without meaning, he commits a meaningless act. The retribution, however, for murder is profound and so is the walking philosophical problem that Camus has created with his character, Meursault. The reader waits for a logical conclusion but is confronted only with larger questions. &quot;The Stranger&quot; is a definitive Existentialist text because it enacts a conception of the problem of existence and proves its own point via anti-climax. Only Sartre's &quot;Nausea&quot; really compares to &quot;The Stranger&quot; in its impact on Existentialist fiction. It is a critical character study in the psychology of loss for modern times. The Algerian Meursault lives his life as if inside a house-of-mirrors and his pointless crime brings his chimerical existence into sharp relief, exposing the false reflection of his ominous life. With &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Camus paints a convincing portrait in a terse style with believable characters who act out the psychological problems we all must eventually face."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger, or L'Etranger, has indeed been a staple of high school literature classes in the West for a very long time, and for good reason. Its main character, Meursault, is a young man with quite a blas&eacute; attitude toward the trivial things in life and is generally disinterested with the contrived conformities that society imposes on people. Even-keeled and even affable, Meursault enjoys interaction with people a great deal; in fact, he thrives on it. But since he sees all things as mere absurdities, he bores with the things of this life very easily. This is a guy who's truly detached from his emotions; as such, he has difficulty feeling, expressing, or even identifying the existence of emotion within himself. Seen through his eyes, there is no grand purpose in life. There is just existence and the experiencing of that existence. He has passion for nothing and lacks convictions of any kind. Regardless of what occurs in his life, \\"It's all the same to me\\" he says. In today's Western culture, Meursault would almost certainly be categorized as having been afflicted with Dysthymia, a condition whose effects are known all too well by many young people.The Stranger begins as Meursault hears word of his mother's death. He makes plans to go to the home for senior citizens where she had lived for a few years to fulfill the duty of attending her burial. Meursault is noticeably lacking any feeling one way or another about his mother's death, and he is generally disinterested with the whole affair, more or less pressing through it begrudgingly. Unbeknownst to him, this lack of sympathy will actually come back to haunt him and ends up contributing to his demise. When Meursault returns home from the funeral procession, he continues to live moment-to-moment as he always has. The choices he makes from here on out have a spontaneous vigor, but they only serve to worsen his fortunes even more. There are unplanned consequences for Meursault's actions in the near future.As the story moves on, Camus further demonstrates that Meursault isn't really a misfit, as some readers have come to mistakenly believe. Nor is he the product of an indifferent society; rather, he is an original thinker, a free spirit, and an individual who deliberately marches to the beat of his own drum. He doesn't consciously make a choice to be an outcast from society, nor is he rejected by society. He is merely a regular guy who accepts whatever the moment brings, goes about his life unconcerned with trivialities, and doesn't allow the uncontrollable circumstances of life to move him one way or another. He's at ease with that which is, and will continue to be, unknown. Meursault has faith in nothing except that which he experiences and senses. To him, the beauty of life is its absurdity; the illogical events of life and the lack of explanations behind them are embraced without fear or wonder.From the opening gates, The Stranger champions existential themes, and Camus is very effective in delivering this philosophy with poignant virtuosity. Among the advocates of Existentialism, Camus (along with Sartre) was one of the most important existential authors and thinkers of the 20th century. Well-known for his spirited, concise, and austere style, Camus was soon recognized among erudite circles around the world as a major literary figure. His belief that life's/mankind's condition is absurd clearly identified him with the Existentialists. He was a proponent of the idea that life, in-and-of itself, is meaningless; thus, life's meaning is solely dependant on whatever meaning we attach to it. Camus' writings are chock full of classic representations of Existentialism, which are embodied in the fictional personas or characters he writes about. The Stranger is no exception, as it plainly represents classic Existential themes.In fact, Meursault himself IS Existentialism manifested to its core. Camus takes great effort to focus on Meursault's uniqueness, indifference, and isolation in a hostile environment. Meursault is unconcerned with notions of morality. For him, the issue of right and wrong is quite relative to each individual's perspective on the matter; but more to the point, Meursault doesn't see things in the context of being moral nor immoral. In fact, he has no use for morality really; consequently he is decidedly amoral. There are no particular categorization, limitations, or boxing-in of possibilities. Indeed, for him, one man's horror is simply another man's delight and vice versa, nothing more, nothing less. Furthermore, because of the fact that Meursault sees the world in these terms, he is absolved from feelings of guilt or remorse. He's able to exist in almost any situation with the same nonchalant, careless manner and laissez-faire point of view on life. His modus operandi represents freedom of choice, regardless of societal principles or views of those choices, with an acceptance of accountability for their consequences.Though I enjoyed Camus' writing and lucid style, I did find much of the story to be pointless; which is precisely the point actually. Yet, I personally don't find much pleasure in delving into the type of premise that Camus chooses to explore with his philosophy on life; but that doesn't diminish the book itself. It's certainly an important read and much can be learned from it; in particular its themes are deeper understood once you've begun reflecting on it. If you're new to the Existential perspective, The Stranger is a good place to start getting acquainted with it. Even if you don't agree with the philosophy of Existentialism, you'll learn to understand it better and see things from a different perspective. As I see it, having a broad understanding of many things is key to developing an astute intellect and sound discernment.Take the time to enjoy this book for what it is. Just don't expect a fairy-tale ending. Once you've finished The Stranger, it almost certainly will provoke you to reflect further, but it will not lift your spirits and is as anti-climactic as life itself."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Although not strictly an existentialist novel, \\"The Stranger\\" delves into the philosophies of life and meaning, concluding that there is no rhyme or reason or higher plan for human life. Indeed, the chilling realization that life serves no higher purpose directly contradicts the most precious of human ideals - that one's life serves a higher purpose.Camus tells the story of Meursault , a French colonial living in Algeria. An otherwise unremarkable individual, Meursault lives life for the moment, and does not dwell on the past for future. His mother's death is a non-event, as he views it as an irksome distraction. However, he is not cold-hearted or immoral, but he is merely an indifferent, apathetic man who sees no purpose to life. Thus, if there is no purpose to life, then his mother's passing has no greater meaning than the daily routine of one's job. It is just an event to partake of.Throughout the novel, Meursault espouses Camus's \\"absurdist\\" philosophy. That is, that human existence is absurd in that there is no higher meaning or moral value to it. It is this lack of morality and meaning that makes Meursault alienated from the society he lives in. Without any moral compass, Meursault is gloriously indifferent to his fellow beings. Friendship, marriage, and even murder have no higher meaning for Meursault .Although his murder of an Arab has no meaning for himself, his adversaries and friends attempt to assign meaning to his actions at his trial. Meursault loses when the Prosecutor attempts to assign a rational meaning to his actions, subject to the accepted rules of society. Indeed, it would appear that Meursault is a cold-blooded criminal, one who didn't even shed a tear for his departed mother. Yet, if one were to understand Meursault , he is no cold-blooded killer, although that certainly doesn't justify his actions. His final self-realization is that society loathes him and his actions. Although he cannot change society's views, he becomes comfortable in his own views and looks forward to the day that onlookers will applaud his execution."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I had to read this book for a test I am having in Honors English tomorrow. The book made no sense and was all out depressing. I don't know why anybody would want to read it let alone deem it as a classic."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large). Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there. So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning. And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously. So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight. Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in. I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.But you can guess how this ended up. I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it). And I never finished the book since it was ruined.But! I liked the parts I read \\"okay\\" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half. Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you \\"keep on keepin on\\" like they say."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"If you are looking for a book to put you to sleep, look no further. Here it is. This is the most pathetic book I have ever read. And not only was the book boring, the main character, Meursault, was an emotionless, hopless, and disgusting human being. His views on women and relationships are no less than vile. He does not even remorse over the death of his mother. He then says that he no emotional attachment to Marie, the lady that he is sexually active with. Thankfully, he commits a cold blooded murder and is put to death. And at his execution, he says that he wishes there be \\"howls of execration.\\" It is amazing to me that an individual can want there to be people cursing him on the day of his death. Bottom line, this is not woth the time for you to sit down and read it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is awful. Truly terrible and distructive. It took me years to figure out why and how to explain it and after a nightmare I had last night, I somehow thought of this book and now i know how to put it into words.Basically, if you liked this book, then I feel bad for you and the rest of society. If you didn't like it, then this is why. In order to like the book, you had to empathize with the main character and think, poor guy, not his fault. That was basically the only way to like it. Disliking it meant you were thinking, what the freak, what the freak is wrong with you. Somethings wrong and i cant explain it.What this main character is, is a psychopath. Not the slang term but the medical, murderer term that we use for people like Bundy and Dahmer. Think about it. He doesnt care about anything. He doesnt feel for anything other than a sort of detachment, and when he sort of just kills that guy for no reason, he doesnt even feel bad afterwards. And the only time he shows any emotion is when he's about to be punished and put to death for it.Good. Thats what you do with psychopaths. You punish them and keep them from hurting little kids. If his type of thinking is okay, \\"as long as I explain why i killed him and it was me not paying attention (apparently the sun was in his eyes as well and he couldnt find a way to word it), then I shouldnt have to die cause now i'm scared.\\" Why dont we let everyone in teh whole world accept that as a valid excuse. We'll let every single person on earth go around shooting people for no reasonand say, well, as long as he wasnt paying attention. No. We call those type of people unstable and crazy.Now, if the writer had made clear somehow from the very beginning, \\"I present to you my friends, the innerworkings, of the mind, of a madman\\" then i would say, amazing. Great. Good book. I was terrified. You win. Instead, the writer spends the entire time trying to say, no, uh, hmm, he's, like, the average joe but he just thinks... kinda... like wierd and stuff... and so i really want to like... justify when he does something... kinda crazy and stuff.... you know? and make people... think its okay to do that kind of thing.... for no reason... cause it'll cool... just watch.Like I said, this book is terrible. And it scared people that kind of said, uh oh. There've been times when the sun was in my eyes, and yeah, that really irritated me. Sure I didn't kill anyone but... oh shoot, I'm scared now and I dont know why. And people that thought, huh, sometimes... I guess I feel detached. I mean, I still have emotion and care about people and fall in love and feel all those other human emotions people feel but I mean... is this... something I should have looked into? cause what if I'm as crazy as this dude here.Someone that doesnt care about anything. Kills for no reason. Doesnt love or feel and thinks only of simple things and of himself. and only feels fear just as they're about to put him to death, and yet doesnt even regret that he had just ended another's life just as easily and just for the sake of it. A psychopath. So please dont feel bad for him. And as I said, the only way to like this book, is to do just that, because that's what the whole things about. Let's feel bad for the crazy guy cause he just didn't know any better."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I thought this was a very UNREALISTIC BOOK.

I found after a few pages that I didn't really care what happened to the main character any more than he seemed to care what happened to himself.

UGH."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"it is no surprise to me that Mr.Camus chose to write this book in the first person, allowing us the opportunity to view this eccentric first-hand. Meursault, like very many single middle-aged men, have a tendency to live very simple lives after nearly a half-century of traumatic experiences. He wakes up, goes to work, drinks coffee, makes love to women and goes back to sleep. surely, any man in his right man would see this lifestyle as luring and provocative, yet essential. Compared to any married man's it is disgustingly envious. Meursault has no care in the world but excepting EVERYMAN's THEORY of &quot;basic survival&quot;: which states that before happiness and success there is the need to eat, sleep and have sex. We read about a man who is caught up, more than anything else in life, with surviving. He is no genius, or skilled tradesman. He works at an office, and finds it troubling when asked to work an extra minute than he has to. Mr Camus is very effective in this study of a &quot;naked man.&quot; For me that has always run hand in hand with a man who is convinced that responsibility is the root of all depression. If I could quote my own lyrics for Meursault, they would be meaner words like, &quot;lazy and sloppy like a tired dog.&quot; Nevertheless, Mr Camus's story is very effective. Either we love or hate Meursault, and any reaction to a character, whether it be bad or good, is positive for the writer. I suggest reading this book if your in trouble with life's daily rituals because it will show you what a ridiculous life you live. If you come to the conclusion, after reading, that Meursault had wasted his life living, this is a good indication you better start looking at your own. thank you"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I like this book.

The story is asimple novel about a guy named Meursault, a shipping clerk in the North African city of Algiers. He seems to be a very superficial person in all his actions. He finds out about his mothers death and when he goes to his mother's funeral, he isn't in the least bit devastated by her death; this is because he just sees death as a part of life, in my opinion. He finds himself hanging out with some new friends and while \\"Backing up\\" one of them, he shoots and kills one man. He is now in jail and is facing the death penalty, hoping and praying for parole. Then he is visited by the county's chaplain, who makes him realize just how important life is to him.Meursault is a very unique individual that sees life in a very different way, rather than judging someone, he tries to find out why that person acts that way. The things that he holds dear and cares about are a little different also, he cares a great deal about the little things in life, like swimming and running, instead of things like a big house, or a nice car. Another thing that is a little \\"off\\" that I find is that he doesn't think about how his actions will affect his future life, he kind of \\"lives for the moment\\" instead of planning for the things to come. The last that intrigues me about him is that he doesn't have that much emotion for the things that are going on around him, I think this is because he doesn't want to live up to societies' expectations that everyone behaves a certain way. I think that the reason why he doesn't have everyone else's emotional habits is because he sees things as they are and that's it, he doesn't think about what the outcomes means to him.I think that the title, The Stranger, refers to the main character Meursault. The reason why I think so, is because throughout the whole book you learn plenty about him, but he always seems so very distant to me. The question that arises from this is \\"Why?\\" Why would the author write an entire novel, giving minute details about his train of thought, and his emotions (when they arise) and give obvious effort to keep the man a mystery? I think that the reason is because he wants the reader to relate to Meursault, and learn from his experiences. Another reason that could be the answer is because the author wants the reader to be jealous of him. The grounds that I say is on how everybody wants act without worrying about what everyone else thinks of him or her. Meursault doesn't have a care in the world about how anybody else thinks of him, which is why he finds no need to comply with societies' unwritten laws. This makes people either like him and value his friendship or opinion, or they think he's an insensitive guy.The reason why I picked this book is because my partner, Ray, chose it. The reason why I read this book is because Meursault intrigued me and made me want to continue on and read the book. When you have a character like in The Stranger, by Albert Camus that makes you think it would be great to be able to trade places with for a day, then you can't help but not put the book down. That's what happened to me and that's why I think it is on the honors reading list."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Meursault is a sociopath with narcissistic traits who is incapable of having feelings for anyone. I read a previous post which stated that Camus wrote this book during Hitlers occupation of France, is it possible that Camus was writing a basic version about Hitler's mental state and how he was negatively impacting Europe and the rest of the World just like Meursault negative impacted Marie, his mom and the rest of the characters in the book? After all Hitler was a sociopath with narcissistic traits."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger by Albert Camus is not a typical book you would read in a Catholic school. I discovered this book in my religion class and it has become one of my favorite books. It is so unlike books you would read in school today, it doesn't tell you how to feel it simply tells you about an atheists mans life and doesn't sugar coat anything.You first meet Meursault as he is on his way to his mothers funeral. He doesn't talk about his emotions for his mother but simply complains about the hot weather. He later has sex with a random girl he meets at his hotel and feels no emotions towards her. Throughout the book similar events like this happening and he simply has no feelings about what happens to him or others around him. He cares about the present and, to a lesser degree, the future. Everything he does doesn't have a purpose and he doesn't care about the decisions he makes. In a way I admire Meursault because he goes through life as it comes, not thinking about his future. You would think he would have no purpose or feel unimportant but he is content with the way he lives his life. There is no happy ending, or epiphany, just Meursault living his careless life.This book is not up-lifting, but it is an engaging one. I admire this book because it so different, a man is being completely honest about his life and feelings and leaves you thinking. Merusault is not a hero but he is simply an average man that you can't help but to admire."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger, translated by Matthew Ward, was not a great story, but it was easy to read and slightly interesting enough to continue on with it. Although in the end I did feel like it had been a waste of my time. I would love to have read this story how it was originally intended as written in French. Not as someone else's translation. The book is entirely written in short choppy sentences. There are many instances of information being given that is unnecessary... \\"After lunch I was a little bored and I wandered around the apartment\\". We read every thought going on inside this man's head.... \\"My cigarette tasted bitter\\". \\"I was tired\\". In a way I liked the narrative of his life and would almost like to see it used with another story. But it also got very tiring reading about the mundane things that were not relevant to the story. I thought that this story was more interesting in the beginning. The story didn't flow as well and became more confusing by the second half of the story. The character was very passive and could care less about everything, which made you wonder how he could get involved with the pimp in the first place. Obviously I did not get \\"it\\", whatever \\"it\\" is that I was supposed to get from this book. I think this is one of those books that are heavily blown out of proportion and given accolades that aren't well deserved.

Since it's only about 123 pages long, it is definitely a quick read. The storyline goes at a good pace and there's just enough happening to keep you interested in the plot.Most people I've talked to about this book didn't care for the lack of details. That didn't bother me so much. The only reason that I am not giving this book a better review is because of my frustration with the main character. If Mersault would just CARE about something, anything, the outcome of this story would be so much different. Sure, this is the point the author is trying to get across, but still.

He knows nothing and cares for nothing but himself. At his mother's funeral, he finds it impossible to show emotion. But in one premeditated gesture of self-liberation, a gesture by which he breaks the social bonds that submerge his individuality, he kills an Arab on the shore - in cold blood and seemingly for no reason - by firing five shots into him and thus fully realising and concretising himself as an authentic being in control of himself. This is the premise of the novel, an existential classic, on a par with Kafka's &quot;The Trial&quot;."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"My reading of Camus' The Stranger triggered a dual response. It caused me to harbor a great contempt for it as well as a respect for the thought-provoking mastery of its message. This reaction was precipitated by a feeling that Camus, through the voice of Meursault is incredibly arrogant. I believe that atheism is as hypocritical as religion. Either extreme requires a confidence which no man can truly possess. Either is a denial of the doubt that makes us human. It is the questions that we cannot answer that make us who we are. An acceptance of the \\"benign indifference of the universe\\" only brings happiness in its finality. It closes the question of death and the unknown, ending the accompanying fears. It is man's futile attempt to grasp the nature of existence by denying its significance. People have a similarly feignedly apathetic response when greeted with a question of trivia that they cannot answer or answer incorrectly. They simply say, \\"It doesn't matter.\\" Another hypocrisy in this book is the presence of a so-called existentialist hero. If man defines his existence individually why does he need another man to be his hero and the exemplar of his beliefs? In fact, if it is true that there is no meaning in life, then why does it matter that Camus' message be heard? He must record his message because he cannot deny his humanity. It is his humanity that makes him ask \\"why,\\" and feel compelled to share it with the world. He cannot be the true existentialist. No man can. It is just as true that no man can truly believe in God without consciously deluding himself. He is aware of his doubt at every step in his life, and blinds himself with affirmations and professions of his faith. However, all these ideologies must be respected and are popular in literature for the reason that they attempt to answer the unanswerable question which is the most important in our lives, \\"Who am I and why do I exist?\\" Everything we do is connected to this question, all of our decisions and all of our thought. We continually ask, \\"How do I fit into the system? What is my role in the community? Where does my community fit into the world? Where does my world fit into the universe?\\" The human race is incurably narcissistic and homocentric. It may seem cynical to believe man incapable of ever comprehending the universe. On the other hand, this seems to be a tenet of many religions and a truth to most atheists. Agnosticism is the only logical conclusion we can draw from these realities. Who can say with certainty what is and what is not? There are over 10,000 species on this planet alone, and things change every day. Science can test the physical and conclude on temporary truths, but the spirit is un-testable. Reality exists for each of us in relativity. But these relative truths are not absolute reality. It is an aphorism that this truth must exist, for the universe does not only exist in our minds. When a tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it, it makes a sound. However, knowledge and comprehension of this absolute reality is beyond our reach. As Albert Einstein once said, \\"Nothing in science is final, but the truth is real.\\" Science here can easily be substituted with life. Our minds are but the imperfect lenses through which we see the universe."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I, myself, did not like this book but I can see where others would. It's deep and thought provoking. However, I think people try to read a bit too much into it and it clouds a lot of the simplistic and obvious symbolism. It is not exactly edge of your seat. In fact, it's rather dull and predictable as a rising action/climax/resolution novel but it is quite philosophical."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In the book The Stranger, the main character Muersault has no feelings for the world around him. I really did not like this book as much as others because I did not like his attitude. When his mother died he acted like he did not care and regretted to go to the funeral that was held for her. When he gets back into town, his girlfriend ask him if he loves her and he says yes then he says I am not sure all the way about that. He just thinks that love is a name for something and does not believe it is there for him.During the book there is violence. For example, there is a man that owns a dog and walks him past the restaurant, that Muersault eats at and when the dog walks too fast for the man or too slow then he curses and beats the dog. There is a guy that beats his girlfriend and does not even think twice about beating her. He says that she deserves it and continues repeating that. At the middle of the book which would be the climax, Muersault murders a Arab man and gets caught for it. Muersault thinks that he did not commit a crime for what he did because he has no feelings.Even though I did not like to read this book because of the character's attitude for life, you might like it. I think you should be happy with your life and the things around you.Ben PaceLandrum High SchoolLandrum, SC"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus' \\"The Stranger\\" was a good novel, yet because it was hyped up so much, I think I expected more. Before reading this book I had read, and thoroughly loved, Albert Camus' philsophical work, The Myth of Sisyphus. His writing was so beautiful and lyrical that I assumed his literature would be the same. Yes, I agree with all those reviews that tout the plotline- Camus explores a subject that many are incomfortable to talk about- human indifference and apathy. Nonetheless, what I was dissapointed in was the style of writing. The writing in The Myth of Sisyphus was so powerful and direct and literally took one's breath away. The Stranger was a lot subtler and therefore the writing is not as poetic, but more every-day. Actually the writing fit in very well with the plot of the novel-it was written in a very nonchalant way to express the personality of the main character. In conclusion, it was a good novel but perhaps I just missed the emotion that was so vivid in The Myth of Sisphyus that was lacking in this novel."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The minute I heard \\"existentialist literature\\" I was rather fearful of this book. I took it on vacation recently and read it cover to cover in about five hours. It is interesting because the main character, Monsieur Meursault, is absolutely detached as a human being. Typically, I would find such a concept rather boring, but somehow his ideas and actions are such a train wreck that I could not tear myself away.In a rather small way, it reminded me a bit of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky in that a man murders another, and pays the price, yet never understands the magnitude of his crime because he believes \\"nothing really matters\\" in this world. Meursault's is a rather frightening philosophy, but somehow just disturbing and seemingly nonchalant enough to keep one poring over it until the end is met (in more ways than one).This was a book that read rather like a movie playing in my head, and though it's far from \\"charming,\\" it certainly does make you wonder at the foibles of man. If you are like me, you will be shaking your head and saying, \\"No Way!....Better him than me!\\"It is a quick read and one that is heavily prescribed in high schools and colleges nationwide. Give it a try! It's a classic."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger, by Albert Camus, focuses on the life of a French office worker named Mersault. Mersault lives in the city of Algiers and enjoys mild popularity. His \\"best friends\\" include a pimp and an abusive pet owner. He has what one could call a love interest, but he is not truly interested in her for more than sexual purposes. He is a man living life with a silent apathy, almost detached from the world around him. The story is told through his eyes, and even with his viewpoint, one can see how cold a man he is. In the height of an unusually warm day, he kills an Arab. He is then jailed and put on trial, but the question Camus leaves with readers is whether or not he is being tried for murder or his inability to show feelings? Camus's novel is an exposition on the theme of alienation, but with a twist, the alienation is brought upon by the main character. The Stranger is a worthwhile read that examines what happens when \\"man is stripped naked in the face of the absurd\\".Camus employs several literary techniques to convey his overall themes in the novel. The first, and most noticeable, is the characterization of Mersault. Mersault is a character that most can relate to. He holds a job, has a few friends, lives in an apartment complex, and holds what would seem to be an ordinary life. However, when one looks deeper into his personality, one can see some glaring defects. The book opens with him attending the funeral of his mother (referred to as Maman in the translation). Instead of being struck with grief, he is indifferent. \\"For now, its almost as if Maman weren't dead. After the funeral, though, the case will be closed, and everything will have a more official feel to it\\" (3). Rather than be stricken with grief, he is more indifferent to his mother's passing, with no hint of remorse. The oddity of his behavior is further explored when we get a look at his romantic relationship with Marie. Marie is highly interested in Mersault, but it does not seem he wants her for more than pleasure. \\"A minute later she asked me if I loved her. I told her it didn't mean anything but that I didn't think so\\" (35). He is reluctant to admit any feeling he may have for her, revealing his immaturity as a human being and the under-development of his emotional skills, this is even further displayed in another discussion with Marie regarding marriage. \\"Then she pointed out that marriage was a serious thing and I said no. She stopped talking for a minute and looked at me without saying anything. Then she spoke. She wanted to know if I would have accepted the same proposal from another woman with whom as I was involved in the same way. I said sure\\" (42). Mersault does not know what love is, and is incapable of reaching to Marie or anyone else around him, in a world of humanity, to many, he appears peculiar for this reason. His inability to show remorse will ultimately end up costing him.The other tool employed by Camus is his use of language and syntax within the novel. In the notes of the translator of the novel, Camus admittedly tried to employ a more American style of writing, trying to adopt the Hemingway tradition of short sentences. He ultimately achieves this goal, as can be seen from the following passage.\\"We just sat there like that for quite a while. The woman's sighs and sobs were quiting down. She sniffed a lot\\" (11). Camus uses this \\"American system\\" of writing for to reasons. First, he does it to convey the dialect of Mersault. Mersault is a man of few words, and most of his dialogues consist of \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" responses. The second is to make the novel more accessible to the public. The text is admittedly simple, but the themes and questions it raises are not. Thus the intent of Camus through his diction is to make his book accessible to all but be understood completely by few.Overall, Camus does a fine job of introducing themes in the novel, though most truly come to be near the end of the text. One of the first themes is insensitivity used as a crutch to protect oneself. This occurs all throughout the novel, but in particular, the first chapter dealing with Maman's death is the best example. \\"Then I felt like having a smoke. But I hesitated because I didn't know if I could do it with Maman there. I thought about it; it didn't matter. I offered the caretaker a cigarette, and we smoked\\"(8). Another theme is the idea of a man's lack of sensitivity costing him his freedom. Most of the basis for the prosecution's argument in Mersault's trial relies on the fact that Mersault is insensitive. Another theme is alienation. Mersault, while awaiting his trial, is seated in the court room and realizes, \\"I couldn't make out a single face\\" (83). Mersault begins to realize just how different from everyone else he truly was. In many cases, he is a martyr because of these differences. Immaturity is another theme. When Mersault thinks of women he thinks about women in the sense of sexual pleasure, not in the sense of commitment. Camus hits every theme that could be imaginable when thinking of \\"man's nakedness when faced with the absurd.Although a short read, Camus's Stranger is a simply written text with a complex main character and overall theme. Mersault's immaturity makes one pity him, but his insensitivity is so grossly pronounced in most situations that one cannot help but want him out of existence. In many ways, Mersault is a carbon copy of Scott Peterson. Though their crimes are entirely different, both men suffered a serious mental deficiency when it came to showing emotion. Eventually, for both men, their cold hearts led to their ultimate demise, which begs the question, is emotion the only thing that separates man from monster?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger (or the Outsider depending on translation) is a novel that will make you question your life, how you live it and the reason for it. Although written in the 1940's its content is still totally relevant today and allows the reader a bitter- sweet read through Camus' use of simple yet decadent language.The main protagonist Meursault lives his life by the sun, but circumstances push him closer to the death that he has spent all of his life living for. The novel is entirely ambiguous but this is what makes it such a fascinating read as each reader interprets the text differently to satisfy their own personal self. Camus leaves us questioning all aspects of life including mortality, nature, religion, society, love and hate with all of these themes combining to make The Stranger a thought provoking yet depressive novel that must be read."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"A guy is determined to live an honest life and express his thoughts to the world.

I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist, Muersault. Forget existentialist - this man was depressed. He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence. It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently not in good health and they weren't close. But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed. It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder. More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood. There were some serious mental health issues that this man had."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I loved Camus's attention to detail in this book.

Whichever may have its own value.Just like what existentialism sees in life.The beauty of ascetic life echoes A.Camus words:In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger, written by Albert Camus, is a novel that focuses on the bizarre qualities of human behavior. Written for readers who enjoy books presented as out of the ordinary, the author fulfills his purpose by playing upon the absurd. I fully enjoyed this novel because of its unique, baffling quality, and recommend it for those in search of a truly perplexing read.Translated from French, The Stranger is about Meursault, a Frenchman much detached from society. The novel starts out with Meursault receiving word that his mother recently passed away. While seemingly a grievous time, he remains unaffected, stating, \\"Maman was buried now, I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed\\" (24). From this point onward, the reader sees how Meursault is quite different from the rest of society. He finds no wrong in a friend beating a lover, and is even indifferent in his feelings toward another woman, noting, \\"She asked me if I wanted to marry her. I said it didn't make any difference to me and that we could if she wanted to\\" (41). This simple story quickly becomes intricate through Meursault's complex character. Eventually he finds himself on trial for murder. Although the average citizen would be fearful for his life, Meursault feels no apprehension, but rather interested in witnessing a real court proceeding. In fact, he is more questioned about the relationship with his mother than the actual murder, as his careless feelings come back to haunt him.This polished novel is truly reflective of the author's genius. The way Camus leaves the reader mystified in the end allows him to achieve his goal of unsettling confusion. The main character's qualities; indifference, detachment, and carelessness, highlight absurdity as the main premise of the novel. Camus leaves the reader with only one question unanswered: Why does Meursault act and feel the way he does? The question is up for speculation because Camus only tells of Meursalt's apathy towards life, and not of its origin. I believe the author left the question unanswered because it is unimportant to fully understand Meursault. This way, absurdity can remain supported through irrational behavior.Camus controls certain literary elements to strengthen his work. Aside from the main character, the author gives true personality to each of the other members in his story so as to define Meursault's apparent hazy qualities. The indecisive language he uses is key in developing the abstractness in Meursault's character. Short, choppy sentences help provide for confusion throughout the novel. Finally, apathy is the overall feeling that contributes most to the revolving theme of absurdity. These elements all molded together form the backbone to this vague and elusive account Camus has created.Altogether, The Stranger is a remarkable story that can be described as anything but normal. This curious depiction of indifference crosses the line between the strange and the downright absurd. Because it is unlike anything I have read I take immediate interest to the idea of viewing abstractness as a new norm. I praise Camus' somewhat lethargic depiction of apathy in society, and its effect on others. I recommend this novel to those with abstract ways of thinking, and interested in experiencing the truly abnormal."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The book provides a philosophical view on society and life during the French rule over Algeria, while enticing the reader with precise descriptions. It follows the thoughts of a young man who is accidentally caught up in a ruthless murder, while leisurely spending his time on a deserted Algerian beach. Throughout the book, the reader is able to visualize the main character's predicaments. Through visualization, one can vicariously feel the same emotions as M. Meursault. His affectionate feelings towards his girlfriend are expressed through simplified sentences that allow one to establish a connection with what is said (for men at least). This book gives me a succinct and effective view on how other people might see life and its values.Although short, the book is an accurate account of how arduous, yet unhurried, life was during the time when France ruled Algeria. In the first half of the book (the book is split in two parts) the author gives a relaxed and laid back aspect of life. The book moves along at a walking pace; halfway through, no significant event has occurred and the climax is not apparent. Camus must have been falling asleep for the first half of the book, then all of sudden was awakened by the realization that his boring book desperately needed an exciting and persuasive conclusion. Like a child looking for the toy in a cereal box, the reader first reads the tantalizing beginning searching for something dramatic, then is disappointed with the climax.The second half of the novel portrays a side of life, which has rarely been depicted in books I've read before. The knowledge of imminent death is presented through M. Meursault's actions and thoughts. It is absolutely astonishing to see what M. Meursault thinks about his life and civilization in general.The story could be extended and become more evocative if Camus had described the murder scene in more depth and given M. Meursault's closest friends' points of view. It becomes a one way tunnel of death for him as he establishes his psychological view on how life is meaningless, and by Camus' esoteric statement, \\"[How] the nakedness of man faced with the absurd.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I would like to refer to Matko Vladanovic's review. Like he said, this book left nothing in memory after the read. Nothing to discuss, not much vividness about anything. That's what Albert Camus was trying to put to us wasn't it? Why and what do we exist for? We go through life, just living, not knowing why or what we are here for. Like the book, most of our life just passes us by, not much thinking about it is there?From home to work or school, back home, then to work or school, perhaps a few hobbies in between. Some of us understand the need to WAKE UP! But most of us don't. We live life just like the book, not much to think about after it has ended. Read the book just to reflect on this point, about why it feels so drab, like it NEVER EXISTED. I took the book from shelf, read book, put back onto shelf, forgot about book. Is it still there? Do I care? Ha, sort of like life really."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger was a summer reading assignment for my senior year of high school, and I devoured every word of it. Albert Camus should be read by every student of literature,history, and philosophy. His prose is fluid, his style uncompromising. He reflects the lack of definite meaning that life sometimes has. Camus earned his place in the French literary canon. It is time that the American literary canon adds him among their elite as well. I hope to read this novel again, but in French."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus is brilliant. I've read this book 4 times, and only after taking a course in existentialism have I realized it's full importance."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Without going into the sundry possible interpretations of Camus' existentialist novel about a young French Algerian's struggle between repressing and coming to terms with his entire life, suffice it to say this story will keep the reader riveted to the book until every single word is read. This is what literature is all about."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Mersault is a \\"stranger\\" because his brain is not infected by the idea of morality. He allows neither the consequences of his actions or society's reception of them to affect his decisons. He indulges his every desire without question, and can go to the scaffold unrepentent, satisfied with his hedonistic, nihilistic life. Such a character, in this world as well as in literature, is regarded as insane or \\"evil\\" (a subjective word with no place in reality) because he does not restrict that which comes naturally to him. To those that condemn such a man, I ask \\"Why is he wrong/evil/insane/(insert dismissive label here)\\" The man he killed would have died anyway. There was nothing in nature, save the sharpened blade of moralizing men, to stop him from killing the man. Punishing him would not erase what was done. Weeping over a dead mother is pointless, and denying one's ... urges because the said dead mother expired earlier that day is equally irrational. So why is Mersault \\"wrong?\\" Answer: There is none. There is no objective way to determine the correctness of one's actions, and religion and government (the two distributors of judgment and retribution) are simply manmade institutions that are forged only of human opinions. One can allow the subjective morality of the majority to rule, or one can choose to be a god himself and allow his own opinion to be law. Mersault was such a man, and he died a hero's death. This was, of course, all my opinion. Nothing more. -Joseph \\"God\\" Jordan"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In my opinion, The Stranger was a very weird novel about a man who goes through life seeming not to care about many things. The novel starts off with the line, My mother died today, or maybe it was yesterday. He doesn't have any emotion what so ever, even towards the sudden tragic death of his mother. After the funeral, he meets a guy in his apartment building named Raymond. Monsieur Meursault and Raymond become good friends after talking for some time. Monsieur Meursault becomes involved with a girl named Marie. After a while of dating, she asks him if he loved her, and he responds by saying no. Then he says I guess when she asks him to get married. This is such an important step in someone's life, and he doesn't even care about just jumping into it so soon. He doesn't even love this girl, but still he decides to get married. One day Raymond asks Monsieur Meursault if he and Marie want to spend the day with he and his friends at the beach. Meursault gladly accepts this offer. Little does he know that what happens today, will change his life forever. At the bus station, Raymond spots one of his enemies, standing near by. He is an Arab, that had got in a little heap with Raymond a couple of weeks ago. As Raymond spots him, he says nothing and quietly gets on the bus. When they get to Masson and his wife's house on the shore, Raymond sees the Arabs on the beach, sitting behind a rock. He tells Meursault to hold his gun, just incase something the Arab tries something slick. Sure enough the Arab pulls out a knife and stabs Raymond in the arm. Meursault did nothing to help his friend, but take him to the house to get him cleaned up. As he was sitting there, thinking about what he should have done, he decides to go out and confront the Arab. Instead of talking it out, Meursault does the stupid thing, and shoots the Arab point blank and kills him. The story ends with him going to court, and being sentence with the death penalty. The author doesn't tell you what happens to Raymond, Marie, and Masson. The tone was very passive about many things. Many of them would have a great effect on normal people with emotions. The main character, Meursault is the same way the author is, with the way he doesn't care about things. Overall, I thought this was very different from most others that I have read. This story takes place around Paris, France. In some parts of this novel, it tends to become redundant. Everyday he goes to work. Then he goes out with a friend and then he goes to bed. After a while, the reader gets to know his daily life pretty good. Maybe the killing of the Arab was good for him, that it was something different and exciting for a change."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"un hombre joven que vive sin sentimientos, un extranjero de su propio cuerpo y de sus sensaciones, no le molesta en lo mas minimo matar o ser ahorcado. es el nihilismo llevado al extremo. el enajenamiento que produce la falta de raices, la falta de creencias, la anomia del siglo.todas las cosas entendibles y no entendibles.el parece un hombre perdido , pero ni siquiera en si mismo...."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"It's a shame that not everyone can read it and understand it; i'm not even speaking of the french version. the extent to which camus crafted Meursault's character displays his amazing abilites as an author.

Unlike a truly great novel, it does not merit re-reading at different passages of life. The style, as spare as Hemingway's but even less resonant, has no extensive passages of lyric beauty; the characters, even the eponymous protagonist, remain essentially ciphers, dim images about whom the reader can scarcely be compelled to care; even the existentialist theme was more vividly communicated in Camus' essay \\"Le Mythe de Sisyphe\\". The Stranger is gratifyingly brief, and it is only this brevity that saves it from being banal.In almost precisely the same manner as the dramas (?) of Beckett, this novel is deemed valuable not by anything contained within it, but by the protracted labors of a half century of existentialist afficionados, in both the literary establishment and Academia, who were marked by the absurdist ethic in some inchoate fashion that was unigue to their times. Auschwitz, Hiroshima, Mutually Assured Destruction, gave existentialist questions an intellectual cachet that struck a certain chord in a 1950's America essentially middle-brow in its cultural aspirations (much like Zen with the contemporaneous Beats), but the absurd hero has less to say to a world that worships the new gods of the global marketplace.The novel is not particularly realistic, more like the hazy dream of an opium smoker than a genuine portrayal of reality. What defense attorney, or judge, would allow the defendant's behavior at his mother's funeral to be entered into evidence at a capital trial? This element of absurdity or ridiculousness emphasizes the theme, but it also transmutes The Stranger from a novel into a fantasy, an unrealistic fable with a doctrinaire, existentialist moral.

Its themes were hardly evident. The storyline is meaningless and depressing. Mr. Meursault appears to be content with his repetitive and insignificant lifestyle, providing readers with no initiative to read on.

It states that your time on this earth is pointless, and no matter what you do, you will end up going to hell and be considered a sinner. The main character in this book can approach existentialism in 3 different ways. He can give in and live his life of sin and be doomed to hell, but he will be carefree and worry about nothing he does. The second is he can stand on the edge so to speak, and live his life the was he thinks is good, and laugh in the face of existentialism. The third is he can say forget this , and not even believe in it , and live a happy life , with the false idea that in the end he will go to heaven and be loved by god. The main character takes the first route, and lives his life without care or guilt for his actions, even when he commits a senseless murder on a deserted beach. He shuns love when it comes his way, and he doesnt really think too much about his actions.

It is a case study in alienation. The anti-hero and narrator is a man living in a moral and social vacuum. He has essentially no meaningful connections with the world except for some transient sensual experiences. Virtually everything that happens to him, the death of his mother, his work, his affair with an attractive woman, his murder of another young man, the prospect of execution, are received with indifference. In The Stranger, Camus presents a universe devoid of intrinsic meaning and with no special place for humanity. The life and plight of the anti-hero are told extremely well and this book has an impact completely out of proportion to its length. Camus' ability to describe this state in unsentimental terms and his pursuit of this idea to its logical conclusion are powerful. It is important to realize, however, that The Stranger presents only a part of Camus' demanding but ultimately rewarding view of life. Related themes are explored in the less successful The Fall and the positive aspects of Camus' version of existentialism are explored in The Plague. The anti-hero of The Stranger is the counter-example of how life can be lived properly and Camus does believe in alternative and meaningful ways of living. I recommend reading this book in conjunction with The Plague."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This powerful, disturbing book was better served by the eccentric translation English readers were used to than it is by this parched new one.There are passages where this translator is so literal, he literally takes the French grammatical structure and dumps it into English with no filter, when rearrangement would actually make the point better. You just want to strangle him sometimes. He took a fine wine and turned it into a raisin.--And no, it doesn't read like that in the original French."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The stranger is a novel of a man named Meursault whose only motive in life is to live from day to day. He is not motivated by love, money, or power, but only the next day. Unfortunately, his senseless murder of an Arab will end his living from day to day. He could escape death from this murder he openly admits to have committed, but refuses to lie. He might easily have been left off if he would have admitted to there being a god or that he was religious, but Meursault does not believe in god or religion. He will not lie about what happened or his beliefs or lack of beliefs the case may be. He acknowledges his murder of the Arab, but not till it is announced he is to be beheaded aware his life is over. He unfortunately had no hand in the deciding of his fate, thus death. He murdered the Arab out of pure chance. If he had not walked back down the beach or had the sun not been so intense, he might not have shot the Arab with Raymond's gun. His punishment, though, was absolute in the fact that he would be punished through death no matter what. His not crying or morning his mother, going on a date the night of her funeral, and helping an established pimp beat his ex girlfriend did not help his case. Instead of people realizing how he believes things happen and to just live for the next day, they perceived him as a senseless human being who was motivated to murder. His carefree way of life to live from day to day in the end ended his life leading to his execution. This is a good book and worth reading. It shows you a different way to think about things."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Un libro magn&iacute;fico, que retrata aquellos excepcionalmente las sensaciones de aquellos que nunca se dejaron llevar demasiado por lo que dicta la sociedad."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus' &quot;masterpiece,&quot; The Stranger, falls short of expectations. The second half of the novel gets repetitive and tedious, as Meursault's prison sentence seems to drag on forever. This book's message was interesting and worthwhile, however Camus draws it out, with a anti-climatic conclusion. Although, I did not feel that this book is too interesting, it does deserve to be read, as it is a classic. Camus makes good points about the absrubness of life and the hopelessness of mankind. There is a good use of literary devises in this satire and translator Matthew Ward did an excellent job of bringing this story to English from French. In addition, the sentences seem simple when first read, however their hidden complexity does add some interest to an otherwise dull story. Book can lead to interesting discussions and thoughts, However at times the story is confusing and seems outdated. Meursault's personality is very hard to grasp and he seems often times seems almost inhuman. Weak suspense near the end of the story. Nevertheless, it should be read once by everybody, however don't expect it to be a sensational novel, as it may fall short of expectations."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger is a very interesting story. It is also quite strange as are Camus' other books as I have heard. It was a great book to read. I personally thought that it was very good. Things just seem to happen that are unexpected. Mr. Antichrist, the main character isn't developed very deeply, but we, as the reader, know how he is feeling. We also learn about France more that 50 years ago. While reading the book I thought that it seemed like it took place in the present day, until the end. But the story relates very well to today."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"this is the existential bible. i am so fulfilled by this novel, words hardly express my feelings towards camus' masterpiece. mersault is a hero, despite what others call him. i don't know what to say - this is a beautiful novel, brilliantly written and extrememly effective. perhaps it is most mistaken b/c many readers do not understand existentialism and its beauty. perhaps many fail to recognize the literary devices present in the novel, including foreshadowing, irony, symbols, irony, absurdities, irony. as camus said, &quot;a man is sentenced to death for not crying at his mother's funeral.&quot; the absurdities of life and irony society is wonderfully presented through the stranger. i recommend it to all who are willing to dedicate time and effort to understand and realizing its beauty."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is one of the most disturbing books you can ever read. Basically, it can be interpreted from two extreme points of view: either you think that Meursault is a man minding his own business and focus on how people who don't even know him judge him morally, or you think that he is a hollow man, devoid of any feelings and so barely human. I personally think that the first stance is almost impossible: Meursault DOES fail to care for his deceased mother who dies completely lonely in a nursery, and he kills a man without feeling any remorse. Plus, he goes to bed with women without giving any further thought to the experience. I am not a person proned to moralizing about other people's lives, but here it is impossible not to be astonished at the total lack of empathy Meursault has towards his fellow human beings, including his mother.Don't get me wrong: the book is not only a gem but also a very important one to be read, especially by young persons. It is very good that someone took the effort to face this modern attitude which many young people have been compelled to adopt during the last two centuries. One could go on rambling about how the modern world has dehumanized us, how individualism has depraved us from a sense of community, etc. etc. In the end it all comes down to the human being and the moral courage we need in order to survive this admittedly hard world. The fact that the story is so appalling shouldn't discourage anyone from picking up this short but important book and give it a minute of reflection. Are you living your life the Meursault way?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I didn't know it at the time this was assigned to me, but I was bound to hate this book. Correctly called an existentialist masterpiece, the book runs in circles. You cannot identify with this character because he is so detached from his existence. The only 'moral lesson' to be had seems to say that existence has no objective meaning, only that which you give it (an existentialist tenet) and if you give it no meaning, it doesn't matter any way (point of the book).As an Objectivist, I just can't identify with or support that in any way. The book gets 2 stars because Camus' use of language is wonderful, but it is a talent wasted on a pointless book. If you want to read a book with purpose instead, pick up Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Although her use of language is not as fluid, the themes of her books make much more sense."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"this book makes me tingle all over. i'm glad to see that so many people have read this book, but i feel that many miss the point. unlike many, i was not disturbed by this book. i felt very comfortable with camus's writing and with the main character, meursault. in fact, i completely fell in love with meursault. to some (especially religous people, christians), his outlook on life was very frusterating. but to me, it was mysterious and simple and i loved him for it. meursault completely makes this book worthwhile.now that i have declared my love for meursault, i'll try to clarify things but this book is so profound it is sometimes hard to put into words. first of all, meursault is no idiot. the best way to describe meursault is that he just IS. he never thinks of why or how, he just is, he just does. his only motivations are physical needs and pleasures. meursault is an existentialist, but he does not know that because a true existentialist would never say \\"i am an existentialist.\\" they would never even give thought to such things, they just ARE, like meursault.meursault stands in contrast to society. when he is on trial for killing the man, the courtroom represents society. the trial is moreso a trial of meursault's morals and beliefs than the actual crime he committed. if meursault had shown remorse, he probably would not have given the death penalty and he would have lived, but this would have resulted in society's defeat over meursault because he would have changed his ways for society. during the trial meursault does show some confusion and frusteration and fear, a sign that society may win him. however, in the end he accepts the indifference that he knows as the world and he knows it is who he is and it is ok. for this he is given the death penalty, but for sticking to his views, he has won out over society. in this way, he wins his trial.i know that sounds confusing, but if you read the book, it will make sense if you think deep enough. also, note meursault's references to the sun and the heat. these images play a constant role throughout the story.did anyone else note the similarities between this book and the movie garden state???"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The characters in this book make my skin crawl. Salamano beats his dog, Raymond beats his mistress, Meursault kills a man for no reason, and then a bunch of stupid court officials try Meursault for his character instead of his crime. Meaursault himself seems psychopathic. As someone who has been diagnosed with moderate recurrent depression, I have felt miserable for long periods of time, tried to disengage from life, and believed that existence has no meaning. A lot of people have had these thoughts, because life is cruel and unfair. And yet, unlike Meaursault, we haven't killed anyone.Maybe if it were the first existensialism I'd ever read, I would have been impressed. As it is, I just think The Stranger is a bleak book about a bunch of terrible people."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read this book in High School and I hated it. Even to my young 17 year old brain, the concepts of philosophy seemed ludicrous. I guess I must have understood them on some basic level, because like I said, I got an A. But it was a shock to me as well! I understand why a book like this is in an Honors English class. It may be more interesting in the original French."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I sometimes wonder, why assign this great novel to high school children? It's a handbook of perversion, in a sense. That's not a bad thing in and of itself, but how many nowadays have read the book? No wonder there are incidents like Columbine every day in the papers. Young boys (sadly, they are always boys) read THE STRANGER and decide, if Meursault could commit a murder in far off Algeria, why can't I do the same here in snowy Colorado (or wherever).We all suffer from existential angst, sad to say, and this book cleverly pins down the five points of fear, the points by which a good school psychologist should be able to recognize that a potential Columbine is likely to happen within a year's time. The five points include-look at the way Meursault deals with Marie, his lovely and complaisant girlfriend. Although he says he is attracted to her, he often leaves her for long stretches of time. He is disaffected, as the psychologists say. Camus isn't writing a medical textbook, more like a novel, so much of this ennui is a product of his own literary imagination. A few years later Roland Barthes took pen to hand to compose WRITING DEGREE ZERO, in which he famously divided the author's tools into three broad sections-language (for we all must write in language), style (which individuates us from our peers), and what he called \\"ecriture\\" in response to Sartre, Camus and other existentialist novelist for whom modernism was a disastrous wrong turn in humanity's social progress toward the Good.Another of the five points of fear comes in Meursault's interaction with his neighbor, Raymond. Is it me or do these guys seem more French than Algerian? Today we would recognize THE STRANGER as an example of the colonial system gone berserk. If you are living in occupied territory, you can't expect to feel very stable. Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, telling the story of POLTERGEIST, picked up on some of Camus' themes when they set their poltergeist-rocked suburban home squarely on a forgotten Indian graveyard. What is difficult for Meursault is to make a decision. In this he reminds us of Hamlet, and as we know, the stature of Shakespeare's Hamlet was at an all-time high in the immediate postwar era, what with the Olivier film, etc. His eternally questioning figure rang a bell with veterans and citizens weary of endless war. For Meursault, to act or not to act are pretty much the same. How to detect a difference? Often we look for signs from the outside world, for example, watching a fly cross a table. If it zigzags this way, we pull the trigger. If it flies away, lives are spared. Think of Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST as another cinematic analogue to Camus' STRANGER and its five points of fear. Just the fly creeping around Jack Elam's face in the opening sequence gives you the creeps, for violence and terror depend on which way the fly falls."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Please let shoppers know who the translator is. It makes a difference. If you want the classic Stranger, don't buy this edition. This is translated into \\"American.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Though the Myth of Sisyphus is the essay in which Camus best expresses his philosophy of Existentialism, he is most familiar to many of us through this short novel. Influenced by American hard-boiled fiction and film noir, it tells the deceptively simple story of a young French Algerian named Meursault. As the novel opens he announces, in one of the best known opening lines in all of literature: &quot;Maman died today.&quot; (In the most widely read previous English language version, by the great translator Stuart Gilbert, the line was rendered: &quot;Mother died today.&quot;) Meursault travels to the nursing home where she is to be buried, but mystifies the staff and his mother's friends by his failure to react emotionally to her death. He does not cry, does not ask to view the body and leaves immediately after she is buried. At the close of the day he observes:It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over, that Maman was buried now, that I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed.This establishes him as an Existential hero, someone who recognizes the futility of human existence, but continues on even in the face of it's fundamental absurdity.In the ensuing days he interacts with the other tenants of his building, including Raymond Sintes, a pimp, and with his coworkers, including Marie Cardona, actually a former coworker with whom he starts having an affair. He further demonstrates his indifference to mundane concerns in a couple of episodes. He angers his boss by not responding with sufficient enthusiasm to a promotion:'You're young, and it seems to me it's the kind of life that would appeal to you.' I said yes but that really it was all the same to me. Then he asked me if I wasn't interested in a change of life. I said that people never change their lives, that in any case one life was as good as another and that I wasn't dissatisfied with mine here at all. He looked upset and told me that I never gave him a straight answer, that I had no ambition, and that this was disastrous in business. So I went back to work. I would rather not have upset him, but I couldn't see any reason to change my life. Looking back on it, I wasn't unhappy. When I was a student, I had lots of ambitions like that. But when I had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered.And when Marie asks him if he wants to marry her:I said it didn't make any difference to me and that we could if she wanted to. Then she wanted to know if I loved her. I answered the same way I had the last time, that it didn't mean anything but that I probably didn't love her.Eventually he gets drawn into a violent dispute between Sintes and a gang of Arabs. There is a knife fight on the beach one day and Meursault ends up with a gun. Later, walking by himself on the beach, he meets up with one of the Arabs and shoots him, then shoots him four more times after he's fallen to the sand.In the second half of the novel he is put on trial for murder. Everyone from his own attorney to the judge is mystified, even horrified by Meursault's indifference to his own actions and to the proceedings which will determine his fate. During the prosecutor's summation, Meursault reflects:I was listening, and I could hear that I was being judged intelligent. But I couldn't quite understand how an ordinary man's good qualities could become crushing accusations against a guilty man. At least that was what struck me, and I stopped listening to the prosecutor until I heard him say, 'Has he so much as expressed any remorse? Never, gentlemen. Not once during the preliminary hearings did this man show emotion over his heinous offense.' At that point, he turned in my direction, pointed his finger at me, and went on attacking me without ever really understanding why. Of course, I couldn't help admitting that he was right. I didn't feel much remorse for what I'd done. But I was surprised by how relentless he was. I would have liked to have tried explaining to him cordially, almost affectionately, that I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything. My mind was always on what was coming next, today or tomorrow.He is convicted and sentenced to the guillotine. While awaiting execution he entertains one fleeting dream of escape:The papers were always talking about the debt owed to society. According to them, it had to be paid. But that doesn't speak to the imagination. What really counted was the possibility of escape, a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual, a wild run for it that would give whatever chance for hope there was. Of course, hope meant being cut down on some street corner, as you ran like mad, by a random bullet. But when I really thought it through, nothing was going to allow me such a luxury. Everything was against it; I would just be caught up in the machinery again.And so, having accepted his fate again, Meursault finally has a moment of apotheosis. A priest is trying for the umpteenth time to counsel him, when:Then, I don't know why, but something inside me snapped. I started yelling at the top of my lungs, and I insulted him and told him not to waste his prayers on me. I grabbed him by the collar of his cassock. I was pouring out on him everything that was in my heart, cries of anger and cries of joy. He seemed so certain about everything, didn't he? And yet none of his certainties was worth one hair of a woman's head. He wasn't even sure he was alive, because he was living like a dead man. Whereas it looked as if I was the one who'd come up emptyhanded. But I was sure about me, about everything, surer than he could ever be, sure of my life and sure of the death I had waiting for me. Yes, that was all I had. But at least I has as much of a hold on it as it had on me. I had been right, I was still right, I was always right. I had lived my life one way and I could just as well have lived it another. I had done this and I hadn't done that. I hadn't done this thing but I had done another. And so? It was as if I had waited all this time for this moment and for the first light of this dawn to be vindicated. Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew why. So did he. Throughout the whole absurd life I'd lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future, across years that were still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the time, in years no more real than the ones I was living. What did other people's deaths or a mother's love matter to me; what did his God or the lives people choose or the fate they think they elect matter to me when we're all elected by the same fate, me and billions of privileged people like him who also called themselves my brothers? Couldn't he see, couldn't he see that? Everybody was privileged. There were only privileged people. The others would all be condemned one day. And he would be condemned, too.Exhausted by this outburst, Meursault sleeps and when he awakes a calmness has settled upon him:For the first time in a long time I thought about Maman. I felt as if I understood why at the end of her life she had taken a 'fianc&eacute;,' why she had played at beginning again. even there, in that home where lives were fading out, evening was a kind of wistful respite. So close to death, Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her. And I felt ready to live it all again too. as if the blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself--so like a brother, really--I felt i had been happy and that I was happy again. For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there was a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.So ends the novel, with Meursault having become a nearly Christlike figure, with grace descending upon him as he awaits execution.But, of course, the message here is anything but Christian. Meursault's passivity in the face of life and his indifference to the quality of his own actions, up to and including murder, are the inevitable culmination of Existential philosophy. For if it's true that nothing matters, why regulate your behavior? You may as well act on your every impulse. The irony is that Camus used this as the jumping off point to try to reconstruct morality, but on a Godless basis. Unfortunately, experience demonstrates that this task is impossible, not because of any intrinsically religious quality of God, but because it removes the concept of the absolute and necessarily replaces it with the relative. And once morality is deemed a relative set of principles there is no"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I read this book because I found a reference to it as something relating to existential philosophy. I currently understand existential philosophy as a doctrine that views man as responsible for his being, for his nature and every act he performs.The main character throughout the novel shows his indifference to everything. He is responsible for everything but yet he does not care? Surely it won't make any difference to the universe, but it will make a difference to him, which is all that matters.I for one did not find the book amusing."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The book is very short and very simplistic; I felt that not Camus, but the one who translated it did not do a good job. It is a bit confusing because Meursault starts out as not caring about anything, but then he seems so infatuated with Marie. So it was a bit hard to decide what kind of character Meursault was supposed to be, although it does in a way show us that humans are not logical beings. On the intellectual level this book was not very appealing at all; most of Meursault's experiences were generalized. I have to say that the book only gets interesting in the last 20-30 pages, that is where the action starts to happen. Everything else before that is vague and garbage, it only talks about this guy who does not have feelings, but wait he does have feelings, or maybe he doesn't. If I were you, I would save the time and read another more interesting book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I love this book!Well-developed characters and an underlying unanswered question take you on a ride you won't soon forget.I really appreciated the visual imagery as well.

It deals with man's greatest sin...lose (or the absence) of soul."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I think this book was not amuzing in any such way. It made me feel disgust for the narrator. Especially with the fact that the story begins with \\"Mama died today- or maybe yesterday.\\" Through out the whole novel he does things that are not humane and his actions are presentable. Even though this book is short and not detailed I think there was more meaning behind it though."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I thought that the book The Stranger was a book that could have been better. The book was not suspensful, and I really did not enjoy it. It had no climax, almost no plot, and the action was not built up at all. However, in this book, the author Albert Camus makes a few good points about our society. The book started with the death of the main character Meursault's mother. Meursault went to her funeral, which was at the nursing home in which she lived. He showed no signs of sorrow over his mother's death, and even fell asleep during her vigil. When Meursault returned home he concluded that \\"really, nothing in his life had changed.\\" The next day Meursault went to his neighbor Raymond's house for dinner. Raymond was a pimp, although he told people that he was a \\"warehouse guard.\\" Raymond explained to Meursault the problem that he was having with a girlfriend of his who he said \\"did him dirty.\\" He asked Meursault to help him out with his problem, and when Meursault said yes, Raymond stated that he considered them pals. Meursault's life went on, with nothing eventful happening until Raymond invited Meursault and Marie, Raymond's girlfriend who was considering marriage between the couple, to his friend Masson's bungalow. Meursault accepted the invitation, and went to the bungalow. However, right before they left, Raymond informed Meursault of a group of Arabs that had been following him ever since he had tried to resolve the conflict with his ex-girlfriend. The Arabs followed them to the bungalow, and through a series of complications, Meursault ended up shooting and killing one of the Arabs. The rest of the book is about Meursault's time in jail, and his court hearing, in which he is sentenced to the guillotine, and his reaction afterwards. Although I don't think The Stranger was a good book, I can make one positive observation about it. The author, Albert Camus, did a good job in this book of using indirect characterization. He did not tell us that Meursault was a man of little or no feelings, but left us to figure it out for ourselves. As the book moved on, we became more and more aware of the fact that Meursault was a shy, quiet, disturbed character. I stress the fact that I have several legitimate criticisms of this book. First, the book didn't really have a plot. It did have a series of events, each related to the next, but the plot was not built upon itself. This relates to my other point, which is that the highest point of drama, the climax, was not near the end of the book where it should have been, but in the middle of the book, making the ending long and drawn-out. I think that the theme of this book was that everyone should enjoy life. Don't take it for granted, every new day could bring something unexpected. No one should go through life as Meursault did, lazily, boringly, lifelessly, and blankly. We should get out, enjoy life, and make the best of it. This may be what Albert Camus is trying to tell us in his book. The tone that Albert Camus took in this book was one of pity and shame. The author pitied the way Meursault went through life, and he was ashamed of it. By taking this tone, Camus was able to make us aware of the theme of the book. In this book, Meursault symbolized many people in life today for two reasons. First, many people take life for granted, just as Meursault did. Also, they don't take any pride in anything that they do. Second, Meursault committed a \\"pointless crime\\" for apparently no reason at all. Many people today are guilty of those same pointless crimes. All in all, this was a fair book. I did not enjoy it, but if you read between the lines like I did, you can see that Camus is trying to give us a few important messages. However, the book was written in 154 pages when it could have been written in 80 and been just as good."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus' tale, The Stranger, reveals to its reader how important life truly is. The novel revolves around a man suffering from the recent death of his mother. However, it appears that his way of coping involves not feeling anything at all.

In this dilemma, one has to lose his chastity of emotions- there is no other way out. Camus does not make a didactic mess of his character and his protagonist heartedly demonstrates callousness without any soul-wrenching confessions to assuage his conscience.

In other words, your own actions and emotions fulfill your spiritual needs. Religous codes and values hold no meaning to an existensialist, he or she woulld derive all of their spiritual satisfaction from simply living life. Albert Camus' The Stranger is comparable to a passage in the Bible - the Bible relates tales about people whose stories have a theme that reflects the Christian ideology. Camus' Stranger is the tale of a man named Mersault, whose experiences in life reflect Camus' existensialist ideology. At the start of the novel Mersault is passing through life with utter indifference. He is unaffected by such events as the death of his Mother, brutal beatings, and evenually ends up committing a homicide himself. While in jail for this crime, religous values are continually impressed upon Mersault by judges, chaplains, etc. He rejects these values with the only passion he shows throughout the whole novel. He finds his true peace in looking at the stars, listening to the sounds of the night, and reflecting on pleasures and memories he has lived in his life. His tale is a simple one, reflective of the existensialist view of rejection of religon and concentration on the pleasures of life itself."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Even though this was mandatory reading for me, (which usually means I hate the book) I found it enjoyable, yet instructive. Even though there were some boring parts (my friends say the whole thing was boring) I found that once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I think that I liked the book so much because it was so easy to understand the diction of the protagonist. When I started to read The Stranger it seemed that his diction was overly simplified but now I see that it just contributes to the book. It showed me that the protagonist really didn't have emotions, and that he just lived the way he wanted to. I also think that the message of the book is a very important one, but we all need to find it for ourselves. My favorite part was when he killed the man and you could tell that he really didn't think it mattered if he killed him or not, the imagery in that part just stuck with me. This book also helped me to understand existentialism because all I had read in the past was Catcher in the Rye and Bartelby and I was confused at the author's point in both of those. But this I felt was a lot clearer and helped me understand these other novels better. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I feel that The Stranger by Albert Camus was a pretty good book. I have heard many times that is was very boring, but, regardless of those reports, I found it quite interesting. I could not tell you exactly what it is that got my attention. Maybe it was Meursault's very relaxed outlook on life. Or maybe it was the lack of unimportant, boring descriptions of his every emotion. Actually, the fact that he had no emotion appealed to me. Reading this story by Camus opened up a whole new existentialist window to me. It was something new. Maybe that is why I found it interesting. I always thought that if life had no meaning, which would be bad. But reading it from Camus' point of view, it did not seem all that bad, and in fact, seemed to make more and more sense as I kept on reading. I read this book for english class. Normally, I do not find books this interesting that I am forced to read. This book is definetly different than any other book I have read. Especially for educational purposes. Speaking of educational purposes, I am still puzzled as to why we would be forced to read about book whose theme is \\"there is no meaning to life.\\" I guess it does not really matter."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I had to read The Stranger by Albert Camus for my IB English class.

Meursault, the main character, finds himself at his mother's funeral not knowing the people she lived with in her last days and having no visible forlorn reaction over her death. Yet, in scattered points in the novel she is mentioned especially at times of trouble and concern. The story unravels into the life of this tactile-living, impersonal man and the absurdity he faces after the death of his mother. His mother's funeral seemed to be a burden on his life. \\"Maman was buried now, that I was going back to work, and that really, nothing had changed.\\" The next time Meursault thinks of his mother is at a time when he hears his stern-faced neighbor crying over the loss of his dog. Meursault had often observed this man, and was perplexed at the maltreatment he showed but still could not live without his dog. \\"And from a particular noise coming through the partition, I realized he was crying. For some reason I thought of Maman. But I had to get up early the next morning...I went to bed.\\" His train of thought went from the crying neighbor to the loss of a loved one to his mother. She, although he packed her out of his house, left an impact on his life. It might not of been strong enough for him to cry at her funeral, but proves the inkling of memory is with him. \\"He realized that some people in the neighborhood thought badly of me for having sent Maman to the home, but he knew me and he knew I loved her very much.\\" The dog-owning neighbor points out his concern for Meursault and to the audience his understanding for Meursault's love. Marie, his lover, came to visit him in prison. Meursault became distracted by the mother and son visiting near him. When it was time to go, he could not even focus on Marie but watch as \\"he said \\"goodbye Maman,\\" and she reached between two bars to give him a long, slow little wave.\\" He was caught up with the tie between this mother and son and their extended separation. Near his execution, he thinks of his mother. He reminisces about the only story Maman would tell him of his father. His father had seen an execution (the theory Meursault thinks he was there was of enjoyment) and returned home throwing up for the rest of the day. In this, Meursault finds comfort that his only memory can fulfill the absence a father figure. He thinks the only thing people are interested in are seeing an execution. Now, he is on the other side of it. He is the one whom his father would watch. \\"Maman used to say that you can always find something to be happy about.\\" In his frantic last thoughts, he reached for an answer and a comfort for death. They were announcing departures for a world that now and forever meant nothing to me. For the first time in a long time I thought about Maman...Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her. And I felt ready to live it all over again too.\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When I read the first half of The Stranger, like most people, I thought that Meursault was unfeeling, like a sort of beast. Then my opinions of him changed when I read the second half of the novel. Meursault became almost human, and I began to understand him and what he was talking about more. During the first half of the novel, Meursault seemed inhuman. He had no emotions: he didn&#8217;t care whether or not Marie married him, and he didn&#8217;t care that his mother died. He killed one of the Arabs that had threatened his friend Raymond without much of a reason but that the sun was irritating him. Yet this all changes in the second part. In the second half, the reader sees a different side of Meursault, the one faced with death. Meursault&#8217;s beliefs are revealed, too. And I tend to agree with a lot of them. I agree that the universe is meaningless. There is no god- our purpose on earth is not to earn our place in heaven. However, I disagree with Meursault when he says that we have no meaning to each other. That may be true concerning complete strangers, but no with our family and friends. When I read all about Meursault&#8217;s beliefs, I began to wonder whether I agreed with him or not. I found that sometimes I did, but often I didn&#8217;t- nonetheless, Meursault brings up some interesting points just before his death."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"In regard to Camus' prose, it seems to allow the reader to project and assemble Mersault as his society did. Readers seem to make infinite constructions of Mersualt, who is as organic as an auto-trope. The stripped bare bones of existence, without the drama of King Lear. Camus wanted to strip down his character's life, to outline our time of &quot;The Failure of the Enlightenment.&quot; Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God, now the unbearable heaviness of being falls on our shoulders, devoid of comforting &quot;truths&quot; of the universe. Camus seems to be saying that when faced with the daunting prospect of death, the end of a finite existence, man and woman feel the acuteness of themselves. Here, we must affirm ourselves and prepare to affirm whatever we have ever done, without looking for redemption through God's grace. Why delude yourself about the finiteness of your own life? Society needs its applicable &quot;truths&quot;, filled with essences of morality. Mersault makes himself incapable of fooling himself."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I agree with the reviewer a few back who says that there is better existentialism to be found, and that the reading of Crime and Punishment is a bigger and more rewarding experience. But a part of Camus' appeal is his simplicity and straight-forwardness, and the fact that he does not soak his narrative in philosophy. They are philosophical stories, in a sense, but the philosophy is left in the background, the subtext, only surfacing to the forefront at key, carefully controlled moments. I admire Camus for his restraint and aesthetic tactfulness. However, at the same time I'd like to point out that I also think he's sometimes grossly overrated. Aesthetic restraint and the ability to struture a story evenly are only worth so much. Big-time Camus fans seem to enjoy knocking Sartre; but sometimes flaws, personal idiosyncracies, and a certain sense of admittedly pseudo-intellectual adventure can actually make a book more rewarding and human. Camus' deliberate sterility of style is something I can respect, and certainly something I find interesting, but it isn't necessarily the most commendable literary trait in the world."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I must start this review by saying that this is my favourite book ever. You can read it just as a simple story about a man that kills another in a stupid way. There are great chances of you to enjoy it. But you can also read it as a story of a man in an absurd world...the same world we live in. I recommend for anyone who reads this book to re-read it. And again. And again. The more you read it, the stronger it is."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is one of the best books of the 20th Century. Let Camus blow you away with his philosophical simplicity and texture. The first line clues the reader in immediately about the nature of Meursault. This is truly a book for our times."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Awesome! This book will make you reevaluate everything you have ever held as true. Your assumptions will either be reassumed or they will disintegrate before you and the text. Camus goes deep into the heart of things and takes a serious look at what is occuring. He shows you things you have never seen. The best part is that they have been there the whole time."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is the single most brilliant work of literature (or art, for that matter) ever created by human hand. I'm refering to the book by Camus by the way; not the Amimorphs paper back that is apperently getting its reviews crossed."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. You really know what it's like to feel alienated from an uncaring society. By the way, I felt kinda sorry for Meursault in the beginning."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I recently read this novel in my IB Junior English class. Half of the class hated it, and the other loved it. I was among the latter. This novel opened up new doors into the world of existentialism for me. Meursault is both horrifying and fascinating in his complete lack of &quot;morality.&quot; He blew open the hypocrisies of his society and our own."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"OK, listen all you guys. I've read this novel in french and let me tell you - it isn't all that fun. I appreciate Camus' genius in writing such a fulfilling plot - if you like that sort of thing. If you want to make reference to another novel in any of your essays or you wish to read another book that's quite similar but, if I may add, not quite as good, read Mauriac's &quot;Therese Desqueyroux&quot;. It's much more complicated but still worthwhile. Anyway, back to old Camus. I used to be really interested in reading French literature until I found Camus. It's all together quite daunting now. So, if you are intending to read this book as a form of leisure, I suggest getting your hands on a translation. GOOD LUCK! Oh and by the way, if anyone could offer me a second-hand copy of any translation of l'Etranger I'd be extremely grateful. Cheers folks! HAPPY READING!!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I absolutely loved every page of this book. I have read it in both french and english. Camus stunningly captures the struggles of a young man Maursault, dealing with the pressures of conformity in French colonial society. Meursault is forced to death, for refusing to show remorse over the killing of a man. The paradox is vivid throughout, and typical of Camus' style: a man struggling with his emotions, against an institution that refuses to understand his &quot;rationalizing&quot;. Indeed a magnificent piece of work!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Yeah, i have a great prejuice against Camus to deny this book the 5 stars. The book is brilliant, it describes in my concept a caracter without psycology. Its a guy that lost his hope and faith in the world ( i don't know the reasons) and that acts mechanically always. He is incapable of having a behavior practically, cause a behavior implies a psycological background. In fact Mersault is an ideal character cause a human being could never be mechanicall as Mersault is. I will not imagine why Camus wrote the novel, but Mersault, as a carcater lacking of humanity, show us exactly what we are, the biased of our perceptions and predjuices ( which is usually represented in a moral standard). I must apologize for my english, i am from Colombia."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Upon starting this book I thought it odd that a person such as Mersault could not shed a tear at his own mother's funeral. Our A.P. English class read this together and only 2 people, myself and another, I think actually enjoyed this book. When we discussed it, everyone had comments against it, but I stuck in there and supported it. This is a wonderful, eye-opening novel. I never really understood existentialism, but when I started this book I researched the subject on my own and found it very fascinating. Camus did a beautiful job writing this and I applaud him. Mersault begins as an empty, emotionless man and transforms, be it late, into a man with emotions pouring out of him."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The translation from Justin O'brien, i felt, was the better translation;however, this translation is not bad. There are not enough words to express the way i felt about this book. The way Mersault went about life gave the whole novel almost a serial atmosphere as mersault's actions were unpredictable and irrational leaving mersault speechless when asked why he killed the arab. From the moment he pushes the trigger, it is a line which mersault has crossed and can no longer return from. On the other hand, what does it matter if we all are destined to die? This is what Mersault realizes. With all the actions Mersault commits, he never apologizes. Once he pulled the trigger, it was in fact &quot;another loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing&quot; Once Mersaults time comes to face the guillotine, he only wants time to himself when the priest attempts to sympathize Mersault but, Mersault does not want to bother with god and becomes mad while strangling the priest &quot;in a joy of ecstacy and rage&quot;, until the guards push him away and Mersault relaxes and prepares for his fateful end with the guillotine. It's too bad Camus was only with us for a short time. The greats are always gone too soon."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I quote from the original (yup, I know it by heart): &quot;Aujourd'hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-tre hier, je ne sais pas. J'ai reu un t&eacute;l&eacute;gramme de l'asile: 'M&egrave;re deced&eacute;e. Enterrement demain. Sentiments distingu&eacute;s.' Cela ne veut rien dire. C'&eacute;tait peut-tre hier.&quot; At the same time I was gobbling up scifi (check my comments on Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;), I was also delving into the harder stuff; and this opening paragraph just bowled me over. The quality of information those few, dry sentences give on the character, and how they set the tone for the whole book, is simply mind-boggling. To this day, nothing in my reading experience compares to it, not Shakespeare's &quot;winter of our discontent&quot;, not Joyce's &quot;introibo ad altare Dei&quot;, not anything else you can throw at me. Take the time and effort to read it in French (amazingly enough, it's not a hard read). It has a lilting and, yes, musical rhythm (despite its dryness) that no translation can convey. Now, isn't it ironic that this book somehow got mixed up with the Animorph series, whatever that may be ?"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Believe it or not, This book is exactly what Zen life is supposed to be. You eat, sleep, live your ordinary life, and then you die alone. Accepting everything as they are without agreeing or disagreeing, that is the key of this novel."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Well, let's just say it, this book made me shiver. Camus' cold look at society, religion, ethics, and indeed all of humanity is very artfully done. I'm no existentialist, but this book is something everyone ought to read. Camus combines art with content, mirroring the valuelessness and cool indifference of Meursalt with crisp, unornamental writing. I love the novel for its quick insight, its graceful art, and its truthfulness. I even love it for the surprising views presented. If anyone is ever going to prove that life is meaningless, that values are useless, and that there is no objective truth (which no one ever will), Camus has done it."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Albert Camus explores an area of thought that is widely underrated. L'Etranger was not written as a book with a message, instead it explores how we as humans, when confronted with the monotony of daily life, depart from our normal existence to become observers of our own absurd rituals and idiosyncracies. When we look back at our lives, in our most vulnerable hours, we see how ridiculous most things were, and how most of our time was spent on trivial matters. It is the fundamental concept of &quot;If I had it to do over, i would have had more fun,&quot; to be quite simplistic. The beauty of The Stranger is that it provokes thought in every reader. It is not a book to be forgotten quickly upon completion, it delves into the abyss of thought in order to explore our own lives."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I liked The Stranger, although not quite enough to give it a five star rating. It's a short novel and the plot itself is quite simple. I suppose the reason that the novel doesn't warrant five stars (in my humble opinion) is that despite what one reviewer has written, I didn't find it to be especially haunting or challenging. And that's what I want from a literary novel. I want it to get under my skin. I want it to be thought-provoking and insightful and I didn't quite find that with The Stranger (at least not to the degree I would have liked).The Stanger is a fictionalized expression of Camus' philosophy of the absurd. The tale's hero Meursault (or anti-hero if you like) does not conform to societal norms. He lives in the present and is influenced almost exclusively by physical experiences rather than emotional ones. The novel essentially tells us that the choices we make in life are all equally irrelevant and that to try and make sense of the world is simply absurd.I'm not saying that this exploration of absurdist philosophy isn't interesting (certainly it's more engaging than reading essays on the topic). It's just that it's pretty straight-forward. In the end, I was entertained by the novel which I found quite captivating. But it falls short of being truly great (in my mind at least) because it's a little too prescriptive and doesn't allow the reader to interpret the novel and find meaning from it for themselves.If I sound negative, that isn't my intent. I recommend the novel with a healthy enthusiasm. It's very good - it's just not exceptional (and in my opinion - neither haunting nor challenging)."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is another selection assigned to high school students which seems to be a part of the common theme of examining the inner self and its struggle between good and evil. The Stranger has a Stephen King flavor to it when it comes to the main character, Meursalt. Meursalt has no feelings for anything or anyone. At his mother's funeral, he is a blank slate. His nonchalant response is to everything is basically 'I guess'. Then he is put on trial for murder. This lack if feeling for anything continues, even as he heads to the guillotine. I am confused why this is such an important read, but it is still assigned. Camus' style is overly simplistic and repetitive to the point of annoyance. It is not the worst book I have ever read, but I question its value even to high school students who probably won't catch whatever Camus is attempting to say."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This book is a fantastical book. Lovely, lovely, lovely.I too like the handtowels in the morning, when not damp and used."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"After reading this book in high school, I wrote an essay about what it would be like to spend the day with Mersault, the completely unsympathetic, detached main character of this novel. My essay had him doing many of the things he did in the book, going to the beach, eating, messing around with his girlfriend and completely ignoring everyone around him. I understood, sympathized with the character and, to my shock and horror, identified with what Mersault was going through.Are we truly alive if we exist only to please ourselves, if no one else matters to us and we, in turn, matter to no one else? Is empathy a necessary aspect of humanity?In the second half of the book, Mersault's situation teaches him to care for others, to care about how his own actions (primarily the killing of the Arab, which he did because the sun was in his eyes and because he was annoyed) affect the people and the world around him. He learns to weep for himself, as his death approaches he sees how little his life matters, because of the way he conducted it.The first sentence of the novel is key. \\"Maman died today - or maybe yesterday.\\" The sentence speaks to how little anyone, even his own mother, mattered to Mersault. People in his life were just there to provide means to an end. That she's dead is an annoyance, taking him away from other things he'd rather be doing. It's very, very sad.He's a \\"stranger\\" because he doesn't care to know anyone - not because no one knows him."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I had to read this book in French, and while many students copped out and bought the English version, I still read the French. That being said, I must say that this book for all its insights is amazing. The philosophy of Mersault is to be looked on more than the events that take place, since one is a result of the other. I found his ca m'&eacute;tait &eacute;gal ( It's all the same to me) that is repeated throughout the novel to be eerie and fascinating at the same time. This book is not for people who reads fluff. It is about looking at an idea of living and trying to understand it. You may not necessarily agree with it, but you can understand it. I am now reading Le Mythe de Sisyphe in French and plan to read Le Peste. If you don't think and you don't like to think, do not read this book. Once you have read this book though and you understand it, you will want to read more of Camus. I even found some of his short stories quite fascinating ( though read in English)."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"When a friend reccommended The Stranger to me, I thought it would be a bleak display of the human soul, a sad depiction of how everyone and everything is pointless, but then I read it and gained a totally different perspective on Camus' work. The story paints a picture rather than weaves a tale. It blatanty lets you know whats going on without giving everything away, but it doesn't leave you in the dark, either. The senseless murder that the main character commits is totally synonomous with his point of view, and the way that the book is written, and the way that the book is translated, gives you a tough guy image of the character, while letting you find the humanity in him. I read this book thinking that it would be something I would read and never think about again, but it has become a work that I will use as a guide for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus's landmark investigation into the human psyche explores the nuance of morality and the futility of life. A dark and deeply moving story."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"For the first half of the book, I was kind of wondering how this was an existentialist masterpiece. It wasn't bad, it wasn't completely pointless, but it lacked depth. I was too quick to try to clue this book out, I suppose. Eventually, it all tied together and I could see how profound it was.I think this is a book that warrants multiple readings and quite a deal of analysis afterwards. I don't want to go into my own analysis too much partly because I don't think I've completely figured out what I think about it. Do I sympathise with Meursault? Or am I getting sucked into his perspective, his bias in the narrative?In any case, it should stick in your mind for quite a while after reading it, as your brain picks it apart, and I think this makes it well worth reading. It is surprisingly easy to get through anyway. I would, however, like to dust off my French to read the original as I do wonder if the language has been simplified or dulled a little in translation."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"\\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know.\\" This is the voice of Mersault, the main character and narrator. Camus perfectly captures Mersault's detached almost indifferent relation to the world. Not only is Mersault somewhat indifferent to the details of his mother's [Maman's] death, his relationship with his girlfriend is one more of tolerance than attachment, he tends to have acquaintances rather than friends, and, on the whole, has drifted through life. His mother's death sets in action a chain of events that effect a dramatic change in Mersault and, likely, the reader.Mersault has to attend his mother's funeral and there meets several interesting characters, though only one seems truly to mourn the death of Mersault's mother: her elderly fiancee, Perez. And yet, Camus is able to make gently comic use of the pitiable gentleman.\\"We [the funeral procession] got under way. It was then that I noticed that Perez had a slight limp. Little by little, the hearse was picking up speed and the old man was losing ground...I turned around again: Perez seemed to be way back there, fading in the shimmering heat. Then I lost sight of him altogether. I looked around and saw that he'd left the road and cut out across the fields. I also noticed there was a bend in the road up ahead. I realized that Perez, who knew the country, was taking a short cut in order to catch up with us. By the time we rounded the bend, he was back with us. Then we lost him again. He set off cross country once more, and so it went on.\\"This early sketch is but one example of how Camus, through Mersault, comically captures and illustrates the absurdity that is his subject. Among the many memorable characters that populate the plot are the aforementioned Perez, Salamano and his mangy dog, Mersault's neighbor Raymond, Mersault's girlfriend Marie, and the defense attorney. The plot involves, essentially, Mersault's killing of a stranger on the beach and his trial therefore. The killing and the surrounding circumstances are absurd, as is Mersault's trial.Mersault's court-appointed defense attorney is \\"short and chubby, quite young, his hair carefully slicked back.\\" In the first meeting of attorney and client, the attorney focuses primarily on Mersault's apathetic reaction to his mother's death. Mersault does not see the relevance: \\"I pointed out to him that none of this had anything to do with my case, but all he said was that it was obvious I had never had any dealings with the law.\\" To Mersault's chagrin, the attorney leaves in a huff. \\"He didn't understand me, and he was sort of holding it against me. I felt the urge to reassure him that I was like everybody else, just like everybody else.\\"This passage is important, I believe, to a full understanding of the novel and, particularly, the final paragraph.In THE STRANGER, Camus manages to communicate on multiple levels, including the comic, the philosophical, and the psychological. While Camus did surpass this effort with later works, notably THE FALL, this remains his most accessible and, therefore, most widely read novel. Camus manages a great deal in such a short book. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"Camus's The Stranger has often been used as a theme of alienation from society. I often want to teach it as the opposite. The themes and ideas are to show the \\"normal\\" human person who finds themselves in deeply emotional events...but they do not show the appropriate emotions at the appropriate period of time. Is this normal? We have seen people overreact and act overly emotionally to deaths or other situations for base reasons. Does that make them normal? We often know people are faking their reactions at funerals and playing a role. This is normal. The precips of The Stranger tell us that acting a role does not make the emotion real. The protagonist does not bother to act the role that society assigns him and he is JUDGED! This is the crux of this novel. I love this novel because it makes me examine humans as individual creatures...we cannot be encapsulated by one defining theme or idea. Humans are much too confusing and evolving to capture in one defining moment forever. They will be, as in Camus's novel, judged, but it reflects life...and life changes. We all do."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"This is an excellent reading of Matthew Ward's equally excellent translation of Camus' masterpiece. The Ward translation corrects the previous more stilted translation. An example is the famous opening line reciting \\"maman's\\" death. The earlier translation used \\"mother\\", but that did not quite capture the less formal word used by Camus, and Ward chose to use the French word for lack of a good English equivalent.It is important to appreciate that Camus is not Meursault, the book's hero who opens himself up to the \\"benign indifference\\" of the universe. Camus was a progressive who joined the Communist party in the 1930s and who heroically fought in the French resistance during World War II.But Meursault does represent the starting point of Camus' philosophy, which is existentialist in nature, though Camus did not like that term. Meursault never lies; he's a faithful tape recording that accurately recounts the data of various events. Everyone else attemps to inject all sorts of meaning into these events. In the process they sometimes twist the recounting of events into lies, though all for some ironic purpose of higher truth. Meursault rejects efforts to recast events into religious terms. He rejects conventional morality. He seems heartless about maman's death by not wanting to view the body, by leaving right away, and by immediately becoming involved with a girl. Convention required more outward signs of grief and rituals of mourning. Meursault is not indifferent about his mother, but he accepts her death as an accomplished fact and does not see the sense of mourning rituals and conventions. He agrees to marry his girl friend not because he accepts that convention or because he loves her, but because she asks. She seems to inject some meaning into that ritual, so why not accommodate her?All of this unravels when Meursault is involved in a shooting on the beach. Meursault recounts the data surrounding the event, but he refuses to inject it with any meaning. He actually had a very good self defense claim, as the glint of the sun may have given him reasonable cause to believe that the victim was flashing a knife. But he refuses that easy route and, in what the world sees as a bizarre claim, attributes the crime to \\"the sun.\\"Meursault is a great device for demonstrating how meaning is entirely a human construct. Existence itself is meaningless and even absurd. But what makes us human is the never-ending quest to superimpose some meaning and purpose on the world. Camus shares Meursault's appreciation for the absurd and his refusal blindly to accept the conventional meanings we tend to impose on the world. But he does not share Meursault's passivity and is prepared to state a belief and to fight for it. Perhaps even Meursault appreciates this at the end when he accepts his fate and hopes to be greeted with jeers of hate at his own execution. After all, what he did was wrong, and perhaps his life will have some purpose as an object lesson for others.This is a great novel in a great format."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I was a putz throughout my early school years until an English teacher in high school assigned this book. I've read it 2 dozen times since and each time I pick up a little bit more. The opening classic line is a wonderful prelude to existentialism. It also turned my head around enough to take something other than football, drumming and weightlifting serious. It made me want to read and ultimately write. Everybody should read this baby at least a couple times (with a good deal of distance between the reads for full appreciation). Camus turned me on to Sartre (No Exit) and that made me want to write plays ... which lead to waking up from the deep sleep I was in the first 20+ or so years of my life."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"The Stranger by Albert Camus is one of those books that has been on my \\"To Read List\\" as long as I've had a to-do list for reading. I never got around to reading it, and it's only because my Great Books Group is reading it for January that I finally sat down and read it. I confess I don't fully grasp existentialism, and my lack of knowledge often presents itself as a reason for me to avoid reading books closely associated with it. Even the fact that it is only about 120 pages long did not convince me to read it by my own choice.As The Stranger was a Great Books reading assignment, my reasons for avoiding it became moot. I had to read it because we will be discussing it in a few weeks. Here is what I discovered.The Stranger can be read in one sitting -- maybe two. This I promise: read the first page -- no, the first line -- and you'll be hooked. The short, succinct sentences of the first part of the book engrossed me. And the apparent change in writing style for the last part of the book did not deter me. Overall, the plot is keeps the reader engaged to the last word. The Stranger played in my head like a movie.I used the translation from the French to English by Matthew Ward, Vintage Books, Random House. Albert Camus (1913-1960) is the Algerian born, French speaking writer and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Translator Matthew Ward imparts a distinctly American quality to the work, and makes The Stranger very readable while keeping it true to the original.To suggest you will be hooked reading The Stranger is not the same as asserting you will understand the work. (Maybe you will have a complete understanding. I have yet to reach that point!) I enjoyed the experience of reading The Stranger, and yet I will bring to the discussion questions about the motives of Meursault (the main character) and I want to discuss Meursault's \\"inactions\\" as well. You can forget about existentialism when you read this novel; you will not need it to enjoy the book.For your reading experience, try to find a quiet place where you are less likely to be interrupted. (I know, this seems nearly impossible with job, family, etc., but the ability to concentrate uninterrupted will improve your reading experience immensely.) Though The Stranger is only about 120 pages, it contains tightly packed prose that can act as a movie, making you more of an observer than a reader. The Stranger illustrates an important type of literature, one with which I'm intimately familiar: literature that is complex, not easily discernible, and yet provides an exceptionally fulfilling reading experience. This novel, like other classics, will be more admired with subsequent readings.Rating: 4 out of 5Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"I was told by a really good friend of mine to read this book. Looking in a bookstore on vacation, I came across it. It was cheap so I bought it, not really knowing anything about the story or what I was getting into. But I trust my friend's judgment, so I went ahead and read all of 'The Stranger' this afternoon. WOW is all I can say. The language and storytelling is so simple, so effective, that I got wrapped up in the world that Camus was engaging me in.It reads like Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye', at least in my opinion. He tells the story so clearly. It's one of the most concise books I've ever read. It is quite depressing, but you oddly feel sorry for, and relate to the main character. I feel an odd sense of hope after reading it, and for people that hated it, I can't see what they're talking about. The story will engulf you and not let go until the end. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"(This is a review of the Matthew Ward translation; black an dwhite cover)This is a newish translation, done by an American rather than the British translation that had previously been the only English version of this French classic. It seems Camus was heavily influenced by American literature of the period -- Hemmingway, Faulkner and others -- and had written The Stranger, the first half especially, to reflect those stylistic sensibilities. The translator argues in his forward that much of that was lost in the British translation. And so here, it is restored.The result is a matter-of-fact tone more in keeping with our unlikable protagonist, the distant, somewhat bitter Meursault. His almost emotionless life and anti-social tone are stark and ugly, traits that drag him beneath the waves when he is put on trial for murder. As always, The Stranger is compelling reading, but also frustrating, because it is so impossible to care for the main character in the final chapters.Camus' timeless classic remains as essential today as it was when released, while this new translation gets us a bit closer to the stylistic approach he allegedly wanted. Essential reading."},{"Title":"The Stranger","review":"***SPOILER INCLUDED****The story based around the deaths of Meursault's mother, a distant acquaintance of his, and his execution is ludicrous, yet the mindsets of the characters are strikingly real and fitting considering the situations that they are faced with.The plot is just plain ridiculous. Meursault, the protagonist, subsequent to partaking in his mother's funeral, kills a man because the sun gets in his eyes and he blunders, clicking the trigger, and then letting the barrel pop four more times.After spending months in jail awaiting a trial, the magistrate tells Meursault that he can be forgiven for his crime, with the help of God. Meanwhile, the presiding judge believes that Meursault has no soul. Therein lies the theme of the novel: are Meursault's qualities attributed to an underdeveloped way of thinking and expressing himself, or do his actions speak for themselves, proving that he is all but inhuman, a man, or even a spectacle, with no soul? What makes this argument so compelling is that it is easy to identify with Meursault, but his actions take on a role of their own. He is seemingly indifferent to just about everything, with exception to being imprisoned. But even that he gets used to. His carelessness may be due to subconscious depression. Is he hiding his true feelings? There's plenty of evidence to argue this point..When Meursault visits his mother's funeral home, he falls asleep in an abnormal position, possibly so that he doesn't have to deal with his thoughts of his loss. When he arrives at the home, he notices minute details of all of the old men and women there, including those of the caretaker, the funeral home manager, and Mr. Perez. He distracts himself from thinking about his mother. He clearly has feelings for her, however, because later in the novel, when he's in trial, he can't help but be infuriated at himself for not crying on the day of the burial. When Meursault shoots the Arab five times, he envisions knocking on the door of unhappiness with each hit. Is he doing himself in because deep down he thinks he deserves it? Is his crude indifference towards the world mistaken for his open mind and lack of understanding of others, and of himself?On the other hand, may be merciless and hard headed. He doesn't know how old his mother was when she died, or exactly when she died, and he is under the impression that being at her funeral is a bother, because he could be doing other things, and later he admits that he deserves to be killed.Meursault's relationship with his girlfriend, Marie is essential in this novel. Whether Meursault has a soul or not is debatable, but his admiration for Marie is not. He uses love as a distraction from his worries, and the pairing of the couple is perfect fit. Marie appears to be as open minded as Meursault, and while Meursault voices that he doesn't seem to care about much of anything, which might be perceived as an immature viewpoint, Marie demonstrates the same notion through her innocent laughs. But neither Meursault nor Marie are really innocent. Marie wants to be with Meursault in bed, and, like Meursault, doesn't seem to have much else on her mind. Meanwhile, Meursault writes a letter for his friend threatening his friend's girlfriend, and later he hears them fight without intervening. Yet, in a way, the two still are innocent until they face Meursault's prison sentence and execution.Meursault is a criminal, whether or not it was his intention, but he has feelings, just like everyone else. And his thought process makes more sense after his prison sentence than anywhere else in the novel. The reality of his emotions, during the time he spends in lock up, jump out of the page. I don't believe this work would have earned Albert Camus the Nobel Prize without the detail in the final pages. Suddenly, Meursault sees the world in a different light. He had taken his life for granted when he was a free man, wasting time watching passer-bys in the street from his porch, keeping anything important from lingering on his mind. And now the only thing he can think about is his anticipitated death, the most important thing in his life. Why hadn't he learned more about the guillotine? he wondered. Why didn't he read books on escaping prison? Impetuously, Meursault began thinking, but it was too late. Even without knowing his fate, Meursault could have imagined potential decision based outcomes, such as going through with marrying Marie. But he had decided not to think, because he didn't have to. He didn't think when he committed murder. He didn't even have the ability to think about why he did it. Was Meursault gutless and cold hearted or did his thoughtlessness become a danger to himself? The moments leading up to his execution represented a new life for him, as he finally began to think about his previous actions and the tolls they took on himself and everyone who he knew, all of whom testified in court. He was finally able to see the light, but it was too late. Even while seated in the courtroom, where there was no way to see the sun, Meursault was able to sense what time of day it was by the sounds outside. The sun had haunted Meursault throughout the book. Everywhere he went, he was too hot. As he killed the Arab, he was attempting to get out of the sun. But the light is exactly what he needed. And that's the irony of the novel.This is not a novel to read for its story. The plot has little significance in the beauty of \\"The Stranger.\\" In fact, if someone explained every detail of the book before you read it, they wouldn't be giving much away. It's the style of Camus's writing, even after surviving a translation, that captures the mind of his readers. \\"The Stranger\\" is a must read masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"The Named and the Dark were the best books i ever read.Every page had me filled with excitment and had me griping my seat.Marianne Curley is such a wonderful writer.Words cant describe how good all her books are.

I suppose that children below 10 can read it, there's no offensive material in it, just pure action, suspene, romance, and anxiety. I felt so sorry for Arkarian when he said that he couldn't be with Isabel!! And think that Ethan and Rochelle ARE soul mates!Or maybe Ethan and Neriah...Definately buy this book, is all I can say to anyone out there who is hesitant. You can read it time and time again, until you know all the words off by heart, and you will never stop being hooked.Anyone with questions, log onto Ms. Curley's website (marriannecurley.com) and email her.

Half of the time The Named read like a book for little kids, with its words and discriptions, almost like a picture book, and then other times it went into great depth and read like fiction for young adults, you never really knew which side you were going to get.The named deals with time travelers Ethan, and Isabel, who I have to say read like much the same person. Marianne Curley definatly needed to rework her characters, they were to simaler and a keen to the other and it was hard to justifie for the reader. In comparision to Old Magic, which had amazing character destinction, where as this book was rather lacking.All in all The named was a good read through, its fast, and I finished it in about two days. I had read somewhere that the ending had a cliffhanger but I didn't notice one, and had I not known already that their was a another book I never would have suspected a need. Oh well, this book is a intresting read through, even though I think it still needs reworking by the author, we'll see if her next attempt is a little less rusty."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"Like the titles says, its a nice buy, book comes in brand new. the pages are even crisp and u gotta get the pages used to opening.

The organization tries to kill someone that would effect the present (you might recognize the people they hunt in your history books). The book juggles through two main chracters chapter by chapter.

The Order, which is ruled by the dark goddess Chaos, uses disease and death to disturb the natural order of earth, defeating fate. Both the Named, who are the Guardians of Time, and the Order have training in the maritial arts as well as use of supernatural powers including the ability to time-travel.At the heart of the story are Isabel and Ethan, two teenage Guardians. Ethan, a devoted Guardian, has been assigned Isabel, his ex-best friend's sister, as his apprentice. Isabel must learn to use her new powers while maintaining peace at home. Ethan also deals with resistance at home while training Isabel. It becomes the fate of Ethan and Isabel to face Marduke of the Order of Chaos who murdered Ethan's sister twelve years before.Isabel and Ethan are well developed characters and The Named is an interesting read. However, the antagonist, Marduke, a demon with only half a face, is too cartoonish a fiend to be believable even in fantasy. The rules of time are also confusing. When Isabel and Ethan time travel, their souls are only away from their bodies for mere minutes, keeping their parents from suspecting that something is wrong, even when the mission takes days. Yet Isabel and Ethan learn their missions days before acting on them. If time moves more quickly in the past, the Order would have plenty of time to complete their tasks before the Guardians would even know to step in.Though the book is far from flawless, the problems of \\"The Named\\" are minor, and the novel will appeal to preteen and teenage fans of fantasy and supernatural fiction."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"When Ethan was only 4 he witnessed the brutal murder of his sister at the hands of a monster.

I could not put this book down. It's a unique blend, because most fantasy books have little or no romance. The dialouge in most fantasy books also seems more out of the past, while the dialouge in \\"The Named\\" is refreshingly modern. It's like mixing \\"The OC\\" and \\"Lost\\" or \\"Harry Potter\\" and it's fanfiction. And it works well. Crushes, romances, siblings, parents, and jealousy allow teens to identify with the characters in the book. However they (or shall I say we, as I'm a teen myself) are also whisked away into another world full of fantasy and supense. And as the characters must go back in history on their missions, you may actually learn something as well, but don't worry, it's definetely not a schoolbook, and you won't even realize it.

When I saw it at a book store, I bought it, despite its outrageous price. It was absolutely wonderful! I think that the only downside to this book is that it is part of a trilogy. Now, I have nothing against trilogies, as long as all three books are already written, published, and out in paperback. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Once again, I am in the same position as I was originally. However, I am happy to suffer for a while to have the pleasure of reading another one of Marianne Curley's books. Now, to those who have read Old Magic and are about to read this book, I have one piece of advice, \\"Keep an open mind about the story. Don't make up your mind about how the story is going to end. You might be disapointed.\\" Now, I have seen some publicity for a book called The Dark. Is this the sequel? If it is, I'm not sure that I can wait until Semptember. Oh well, I guess that I'll just have to."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"This is the story of Ethan, a member of a secret organization that keeps historical things where they should be, resisting the changes of the order of chaos. Isabel, the other main character is a girl who is just joining the league and Ethan is her tutor and mentor. Together they must stop several dastardly plots to alter history and save the world from an evil mutant man-demon.I picked this book out from the library because I'm running out of books - and because this one was in a trilogy and it looked cool. It was a mistake. The main character, Ethan, was such a pompous jerk! With all his little rituals and his slavish devotion to the leaders, he was utterly disgusting and basically spineless. I want a rebel character, not one that is so devoted to the group that he does anything they think at him. He has his moment of rebellion at the end but it seems like the author threw it in just for fun. And King Richard???? That part was so utterly random I couldn't believe my eyes!The plot was a bit draggy and the alternating point of view was severely annoying. I found that some parts read too much like a military training journal: \\"I can feel my muscles toughening and I am prepared to meet the challenge ahead\\" etc. Possibly the worst part was the seriousness with with the author told her story. It was as if she was documenting a real story and seriousness is good in books but in this one it just seemed a little out of place. Maybe it was seriousness in excess of what is expected or desired.Anyway, I really don't recomend this book. It picks you up and drops you in the middle of this wierd organization without the slightest description! It is not interesting or exciting because all of the climaxes are desperately predictable. It really isn't worth reading and even less worth buying. Take my advice, you're better off without this piece of junk in your collection.

When I first read it, I thought that it didn't have a sequel, so I was kind of disapointed with the end, but then I found out that it was one of a trilogy and that was really exciting. One of my favorite aspects of this book, and series, is how the perspective from which the book is written switches between two different charecters.In this one, Ethan and Isabel.

A real page-turner. I have to admit I haven't read any science fiction book as great as this one since \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Gathering Blue\\" by Lois Lowry or other novels like \\"The Watcher\\". I enjoyed it until the end. Even right now I keep wondering about how the story will unfold between Arkarian and Isabel, is Arkarian's youth retention going to keep him from approaching Isabel (his ****-****)? What will happen to Matt and Rochelle after they are initiated? What are their gifts? (Well at least we know Rochelle is a Truthseer). Are Ethan and Rochelle soul-mates (the whole concept of having a soul-mate is sort of romantic in a depressing kind of way...). Will the mysteries about Arkanian's past be revealed? ...Wait... alright I read over some reviews and two mentioned the \\"trilogy\\"... is that true?

I hope she does, because I'll be ecstatic when the second one is published."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"The first reason I have for giving The Named 4/5 stars is this book had excellent characters. I love how Mr. Carter, (Ehtan's teacher) ends up being one of the named as well as Ethan. It's a really great twist.Another reason I have is becuase of the genius idea Marianne Curley had for this book. In The Named, the main characters, (Ethan, Isabel, Arkarian, Mr. Carter, Jimmy, and Shawn) all have to travel back in time to save the future. The future needs saving because The Order of Chaos, (The antagonists) want to alter the future to their liking by traveling into the past and changing events that were meant to happen. The protagonists, (The main characters) see that The Order's view of the future is corrupt and that's why they mean to fix it.My third and final reason for giving The Named a 4/5 is because this book ended very abruptly. Marianne Curley left many unanswered questions swimming in my head.But I have just recently learned that Marianne Curley has made The Nammed into a series so this problem is solved."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"\\"The Named\\" is the first book in a trilogy of time. One of Marianne Curley's main characters is Ethan, a teenager who lives with his mother and father. *yawns* Ethan's older sister died brutally before his eyes when they were both very young, and Ethan can still vividly recall the violent memories. *shudders* After his sister, Sera, died, his father went into a state of depression, causing Ethan's mother to have significant emotional problems also. *gasps* When Ethan was about four, he was recruited by The Guard to protect time.Isabel lives with her mother and her brother. Her father was violent, and ended up leaving. Ethan is appointed as her trainer, and must teach Isabel all about what it means to be one of the Guard. *sigh* These characters and many more are artfully weaved together in an unforgettable story that will keep you thinking long after you've read the book. *adapts a contemplating composure*I recently gave this book to a friend for her birthday, and would recommend it to the general public *grins evilly*.

The idea of the story itself was what attracted me in the first place. I found the alternating points of view extremely annoying. Because the focus changes from one character to another so quickly, I felt I was only skimming the top of the story. I was also disappointed at how the story ended. She just left the characters hanging at the end of the battle. What happend to their future? I don't recommend this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"Hey. I read the book if you were wondering. I thought it was okay. I almost didn't finish, I was so mad at it. In all truthfullness, I belive its not worth reading. The only reason I finished it is because I had to use my gift certificate that I got for christmas. The true reason I picked it up is because it had an awesome bookcover. The worse part about this book is that it is unbeleiveably predictable. I could predict everything that heppened. I thought the author gave too much of the characters thoughts away. She could have concealed more to make the future more mysterious but she didn't. I also thought the characters were well deloped BUT they were unrealistic. They acted unrealistically and arrived at conclusions unrealistically. There was one point that I just thought \\"How did he possibly come up with that?\\" He had no real logic to his thinking which normal people do. I do not recommend it. I admit that the premise is exciting and there are originol thoughts but i think much of the excitement is lost because everything is predictable and most of it has already been done before. Honestly, if you want a read that wastes your time, this is the book for you. Im not sure if i'll be purchasing the next book. Frankly, I dont care what happens to the charachters enough to find out what happens. Thats another thing, I dont care enough for the characters. Anyway, dont bother getting this book. Truely.

Only then would I have an \\"A\\" in social studies class!"},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"Marianne Curley has without any doubt written a great and gripping story. I read the whole trilogy in two nights (very serious). It was great fun. I am sure kids will love it. I have promptly gifted the three books to my younger cousin after reading.But after reading the story, in hindsight it was completely stupid and as someone mentioned without a consistent plot. I have read various fantasy authors, Tolkien and Jordan are amongst my favorites. A good fantasy may take place in a different world or in our world, but irrespective there are rules.But I have never read of a fantasy novel where all the hidden secret characters in a prophecy to stop the villan belong to the same school, same class and/or same family. The named are rare and posses rare talents and they fight the order who are also rare. But the whole novel plot which threatens univeral and temporal apocalpyse centers in fights between people in the same city and school. I can summarize this novel in \\"Damn who is that enemy or ally, oh he is my classmate and he will now return from the dark side, but the dark side is still gets stronger.\\"or how about \\"I give you this extremely supercool power to the traitor, but also I am too stupid to use it myself and just find out who the traitor is, because if I did that, the novel will be over\\"Further inconsistencies follow in the other novels especially about the tribunal and the goddess of chaos. A whole medley of concepts reduces the plot to outright stupidity. As far some deeper concept is concerned, forget it, she is no Rowling. I still remember \\"The mirror of Erised gives only false dreams, it provides neither knowledge nor wisdom\\". Sadly the same can be said of this book when I compare it with Tolkien, Jordan et al.On the plus side, the writer has an amazing gripping style of writing, it keeps the readers hooked. I loved reading it. Simply put, reading the novel was great fun!!!The plot is imaginative and varied, the creatures fun, the abilities of the characters cool and impressive. The thrill continues with every page. No one can reject this novel as fun the first time.But after it is over, the book is hollow, nothing persuades me to remember it anymore.Still I will give it 3.5 stars. (I gave one here to balance the ratings)As a sidenote for young kids, this is a must read and they will adore it."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"This has got to be one of my favorite books of all!

Doing so protects the present from the Order of Chaos, which feeds off of destruction and attempts to change certain events in history so that they will gain more power. As the story unfolds, Ethan learns that his sister was, in fact, murdered, and that her murder was part of an evil plot that will require those close to him to acquire new roles and responsibilities in order to defend the Guard.At first, I had doubts in the book's excellence when I found the beginning to be slow and unexciting, but I was soon proved to be very wrong. The Named is captivating and addicting--at times I couldn't bring myself to put it down--with a genius, imaginative plot. The story provides unpredictable twists, turns, and surprises that add to the enchantment. However, I was unimpressed with the quality of writing, and felt as though others could have done a better job in the telling of the story. Even so, I am looking forward to reading the remaining two in the trilogy and other books written by this new and creative author."},{"Title":"The Named (The Guardians of Time Trilogy)","review":"Oh, another book review.

Or at least it immediately hooked me. Ethan has this dream about his sister's death and the man who killed her. He has grown up thinking it was just his imagination, how she died, but he will soon learn otherwise.THE NAMED is told in the two different POV's of Ethan and Isabel. Ethan has grown up knowing about the Guard and their duties, and at the beginning of THE NAMED, he finally graduates from Apprenticeship and gets an apprentice of his own. Isabel.Isabel has no idea about the Guard, but then her brother's ex-best friend Ethan starts paying attention to her again and doing inexplicable things during class (like making his pencil spin in circles without touching it). Ethan explains to Isabel about the Guard and the Order of Chaos, two time traveling groups who are battling each other all the time (literally). The Guard is devoted to making sure events in history pan out the way they are meant to, while the Order are trying to change things to create Chaos, which they feed off of.THE NAMED was amazing, to say the least. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy, THE DARK and THE KEY. This first book did a wonderful job of setting up as well as settling problems. The initial problem was solved while the main problem that will most likely appear throughout the rest of the series was set up.The main thing that awed me about THE NAMED was the characters. There was depth there, even with the characters who weren't part of the two-way POV. They are all believable. I loved the love interest in this book. I don't like love triangles in general, and when I figured out who Isabel was gonna end up with, I went on a \\"WHY HIM!?\\" rant because I already had it set in my mind who she was gonna end up with. But with the events of the last couple of chapters, the character REALLY grew on me, and I thought how sweet he was, how sweet what he was doing for her was even if it was misguided. (&lt;--that is vague because I don't want to give away spoilers, Sorry.) And I was very happy with the way it ended up.I will DEFINITELY be finishing this trilogy, hopefully soon.

This is a truly a story of the American Scene in a time when people entertained themselves by gabbing with one another and singing songs together instead of hiding in the basement watching videos. Good old timey values like hucksterism, lying, and cheating face the good natured community of Centerburg and sometimes turn it upside down. Strange things happen in Centerburg, and the curious Homer Price is going to get to the bottom of it.

Stories flow from the oldsters in a steady stream to be devoured and savored by the young listeners, in most cases taken at face value and the veracity of the teller protected deeply. The third story in \\"Centerburg Tales\\" is a parody of this idyllic life, the humor broad brush but illustrative of imagination at work in accordance with the times. The machinations of the children at work to protect one of their favorite story tellers is hidden but implied lending to the humor of the story in its own fashion.The first two stories are examples of the tales told by the children's favorite story teller, the first a comical tale of barrel busting Indians (native Americans now) and the construction of a Rube Goldberg like device to satisfy their craving for thrills, spills, and barrel rides. This tale leads to a further depiction of strength which then leads to complications in maintaining a workable tale in having ice break when subjected to loaded wagon weight but no problem when the weight is supported but a man's back but the man is now supported by the formerly frangible ice so that a load can be transported. The explanation is part of the humor.The second story is a showing of life and expecttions in that time period from a humorous level. The final three stories are further life adventures, mostly expectations versus outcomes, the fourth tale being an inheritance from which great expectations are held but outgo exceeds income, the fifth tale shows the townfolk being swindled due to their lack of knowledge of the story of the emperor's new clothes and the final story is just a tale common to everyone's knowledge, a tune is heard somewhere and the hearer can not seem to get it out of his head. The book ends here with the townspeople tired from their exertions caused by the tune and wary that the next time might have a different outcome.

It makes no distinction between correct and non-standard words, it's pronuciation guide is non-standard, it's emphasis marks are in the wrong place .. it even includes &quot;ain't&quot; without comment. The truth is W3 was really a cost cutting measure. The larger W2 (with it's &quot;Reference History&quot; and other extra material) cost so much to produce that Merriam set about to size the thing down. The result, I am afraid is not as good as where they stared. The old W2, even badly dated as it is, really remains the best dictionary by far. It's all there, but it puts non-standard words below a line across the page. As far as questions about words go, The 2nd settles the matter; the 3rd leaves us wondering. In my opinion, the Merriam 2nd is still the best. Second place goes to the OED, (too big, too expencive, and reaaly just a list of examples anyway) then maybe in 3rd place, the old New World Unabridged. Merriam, (now part of Britanica) really should just bight the bullet, retire the W3 and set about updating W2.

In a comparison between Merriam-Webster's excellent on-line dictionary and their WNID3 software, it took 9 seconds to get a definition of &quot;zoology&quot; on-line, and a whopping 30 seconds to get the same definition using the software. The time delay might be solved by being able to run the dictionary straight from the CD-ROM, but that isn't an available option. Not the ideal choice for professional use, though it's probably just fine for personal reference needs."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"Webster's Third is certainly one of the great dictionaries of the world and the standard reference of American English. But it is showing its age. The major portion consisting of the A-to-Z listing was originally published in 1961. This revision has an addenna of 70 pages listing new words which have come into usage since then. Merriam-Webster has announced that a Fourth Edition should be expected by 2002. Hopefully, they are also looking on publishing a CD-ROM version."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"It bothers me somewhat, as others have noted below, that the main 2662-page text of the Third New International is unchanged from the 1961 original, but the bulk of formal American English has remained surprisingly constant since that time. I had been relying upon an old Seventh New Collegiate by Merriam-Webster until now, and had come to appreciate their particular brand; &quot;the genuine article&quot;, as it were. When I uncrated this book, I realized that it had to have a place of easy access where it could stay opened all the time, for it is so large. I ended up needing to clear a whole shelf, and I installed its own overhead fluorescent lamp. It gets a lot of everyday use, and if I don't find the word, I know I should think twice before continuing to use it in my speech and writings. I only wish the Addendum were integrated with the main portion. I, too, will be interested in their Fourth edition."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"I can understand why so many reviews rebut another because everything is in. Saturn, Jupiter, Abe Lincoln etc. You name it it's ther. Etymology? It's gives the Latin root or first reference &amp; in many cases the various derivations, I am not sure what else you need. The CD has no pictures but so what? I need a word reference/thesaurus not pictorial something which Encarta does that far better but alas fails as a good ole dictionary. The dictionary does have line (black and white) lithographical drawings which hark back to the dictionaries of old. It's a nice touch.For British readers the Cambridge International is better especially if they've newly come over or if they need to know the differences between the original English and American but if you want AMERICAN English and how American should be used, spoken and written then this is the one.Many a rainy afternoon or too hot sunny day can be spent perusing this volume not to mention the word games the CD will help you master (great for the kids or a bored sophisticate).Ah the joy of words!

An excellent tool for all wordsmiths!!!"},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"All dictionaries are out of date when they are published.This is a flaw to some, and a delight to others.Despite what some reviewers here claim, no dictionary in the last 100 years set out to be prescriptive, that is, to include the words considered good and exclude the words considered bad. Prescriptive lexicography went to its grave about the same time as Queen Victoria did (in 1901).People _believe_ that dictionaries are prescriptive, because (despite the inconvenient stuff in the preface that says otherwise) generations of English teachers have browbeaten their charges into writing they way their parents would have done, by saying \\"That's not a word, it's not in The Dictionary.\\"False, on two counts. False first, because the teacher should have said (with a glance at the title verso), not \\"That's not a word\\", but \\"That wasn't a word in 1961.\\" No teacher today would ever say that, of course. Most of them weren't born in 1961. False second, because it is an _argumentum e silentio_, an argument from silence. This is a fallacy because you are assuming the compilers of the dictionary omitted the word on purpose, when in fact, if you read what they said in the preface, they probably omitted it through lack of evidence, or lack of time, or -- most likely -- lack of opportunity.People believe that Websters Second (W2) was prescriptive (=good) and Websters Third (W3) was descriptive (=bad) because W2 more or less ignores informal English, and W3 covers it in detail. But this is not the dictionaries' doing. Lexicographers describe the language they see. And lexicographers glean much of their contemporary language citations from newspapers.What many people do not take into account is the revolution in journalism that took place in the 30s, when the \\"write as you speak\\" movement swept away a whole formal style of writing that now seems to us quaint and stilted. If you turn up a leader column or opinion piece from 75 years ago, you may well find it nearly unreadable. Even many of Ambrose Bierce's funny columns from 100 years ago can now seem as hard to read as something written in 1750.Several reviewers have noted that a Merriam-Webster 4 is long overdue. That is true. If you went around speaking the English that is described in W3, very shortly there would be soft-spoken but burly men in white coats coming to take you away. That dictionary says \\"a video\\" means \\"a tv set\\". That dictionary says that \\"email\\" is \\"a kind of enamel\\".There is no news of a W4, and I believe the publishers are hesitant to spend the vast amounts of money required to produce a modern dictionary. Why should they? Much of Middle America wants a prescriptive dictionary, but no lexicographer of any standing would produce one. Considering the scorn, much of it ignorant, that was heaped on W3 in 1961 (a much more liberal time), it would be a brave, perhaps even foolhardy publisher that would launch a new dictionary on the US market now.W3 is a fine dictionary. Its style of definition writing (consistent throughout) is exemplary, though today it sounds a little stiff. It swept away rubbish contributed by the technical advisers to W2 (such as \\"dord\\"). It is the first dictionary I consult about food (next stop: Larousse Gastronomique).But it does describe American English of 1959, because in those days of manual typesetting and galley proofs it took about 2 years for a dictionary to get from manuscript to book. That makes it a museum-piece. It does not describe the English you speak. It describes the English your parents (or maybe grandparents) were speaking on their first date. That is, of course, what makes it valuable to teachers. If they say \\"Don't say that, it's a horrible slangy word\\", that is a 'value-judgement', which is of course not allowed. But they can say, \\"Don't say that, it's not a word, it's not in the dictionary.\\" That is not a value-judgement, it's an objective criticism, which is allowed. There is slang in W3, but it is 50s slang, and has now entered the standard language or is forgotten, so it doesn't matter.In the absence of a scholarly modern American dictionary, you may have to content yourself with a European one. Europeans tend to complain about contemporary words and senses being left out, whereas Americans almost invariably complain about them being put in. And, despite what you may think, we do know about American spelling. How could we not? it is the majority dialect."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"None of the other Amazon reviewers, even those who only give this book 1 star, seem to mention what was an enormous controversy in literary circles when this book first appeared in 1961 -- that it was \\"descriptive\\" rather than \\"prescriptive.\\"The great Second Edition Webster's Unabridged, originally published around 1930, had set the standard for dictionaries but was unashamedly prescriptive -- it told you clearly what each word meant and which words were correct to use and which words were not. It didn't matter if millions of people used the word \\"ain't\\": it was incorrect usage and that's all there was to it.The Third Edition, of 1961, switched this around. It said that if enough people used a word a certain way, then it was, at the very least, acceptable usage.As I recall, the eminent critic Dwight Macdonald immediately wrote a long, scathing article about the Third Edition in The New Yorker and absolutely trashed the book. Jacques Barzun and others wrote similar reviews. And in a detective novel that followed not long after, that beloved fatty of West 35th Street, Nero Wolfe, sits in front of his fireplace and tears his copy of the dictionary to pieces page by page, feeding them into the flames. Its crime: saying that \\"infer\\" could be used in place of \\"imply.\\"But not to Dwight Macdonald, not to Rex Stout and Nero Wolfe, and not to me, either. I found a used copy of the Second Edition in a bookstore in Harvard Square around 1965 and have carried its enormous bulk around the world with me ever since. If you want to find out the *correct* usage of a word, get the Second Edition -- if you can possibly find it....Note written a year or so later: I've just run across a New Yorker cartoon from the March 24, 1962, issue, cartoon #187 out of 860 for the year, by Alan Dunn. A bearded gentleman with a briefcase is standing in front of a receptionist at a desk. On the wall behind her is a large corporate logo in which \\"C. Merriam, Dictionary Division\\" can be read.

Dr. Gore ain't in.\\""},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"I give Webster's 4 stars instead of 5 because they have not updated since 1961, but they likely never will.

I own this one because, when power goes down, it is accessible, as well as historically accurate. I usually access it online, though, through the internet; which, another reviewer notes, you will not find defined within it. If I want an absolutely up-to-date dictionary, online is the only recourse. [...] That's a specialized purpose, since one would hardly be able to read most of literature with only the most current dictionary -- hence the value of Webster's. Webster's is as \\"Old School\\" as it gets. Wiktionary is as \\"New School\\" as it gets. The world needs both.

Don't get literal-minded here. Word counts sell dictionaries to the overly-literal-minded American. More words --> better dictionary? Not really. In case after case after case even other biggish Websters (big because they ramped up word count) seem to never capture the IDEA of the word. In fact, the dictionaries almost admit it in their preferatory material (a dictionary is about definition, not connotation). If you have NO idea what a word means, MAYBE the definition will help. What all the other dictionaries FAIL to do is answer this: \\"you know, I wonder why I picked that word?\\" This big Webster's Third New International is GUARANTEED TO TELL YOU WHY YOU INSTINCTIVELY PICKED THAT WORD THAT YOU DID. (Obviously I am adressing a native English speaker in this review; non-native speakers: if the weight of this book is not unweildly for you, sure you should get it too.) Today's example: revelatory. I said MathCAD (math software) is motivated by its revelatory aspect. In an Excel spreadsheet all your crazy numbers and formulas can be any kind of stuff -- and noone would be the wiser, but in MathCAD all your computations are made manifest and explicitly disclosed. But the examples are numerous. Just time after time after time I find all other dictionaries dissappointing. It's like I want to add to the entry -- \\"see one uses this word to make a distinction or in these sorts of uses; if you want to emphasize THAT notion instead, this is not the word, THIS is the word.\\" This big Websters International Unabridged has all that stuff that I would add to the entry already there."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"Having all the definitions in one book is really handy.

It's probably the second most comprehensive behind the Oxford English Dictionary. And it's also straight out of 1961 and a total waste of your money.There seems to be two major arguments about this dictionary, both of which miss the point.First, there's the issue of prescriptive vs. descriptive. Most general users want a descriptive dictionary. We all know that, for example, \\"ain't\\" is bad English. But we also know that it's been spoken and written billions of times and thus should not be ignored simply because it offends those who speak or write properly.The far bigger issue here is whether or not you, the consumer, should buy THIS dictionary given that it's the same one they were publishing back in 1961. The primary argument for using this book is that we don't need a dictionary of current English and it's helpful to have something that explains words that might not be found in newer dictionaries. It's true that no one should need to look up \\"Internet\\" or \\"email.\\" However, that doesn't make this dictionary any more valuable.The value of this edition as a tool in using older words is minimal. You can get this edition for a few bucks at a yard sale or a \\"friends of the library sale.\\" If you need a dictionary like this right now, there is at least one alternative that will give you more accurate definitions as well as words you might encounter in your reading, especially older English literature. That dictionary is the Chambers 9th edition which was revised and published as recently as 2003. It has more than 300,000 definitions and goes back all the way to Shakespeare. It is one of the dictionaries of choice for Scrabble users (and that's saying something!) and English majors. While it might be a little smaller than the Webster's Third, it makes up for it in all other ways - including price. It's half the cost!There are countless examples that show why it's helpful to have a dictionary that's both modern and defines older words Take the word \\"negro.\\" This dictionary defines it as an acceptable term for common usage. The Chambers defines it and then explains that it's now considered offensive. Look up \\"anti-Semite\\" - Webster's Third defines it not just as someone who has hostility towards Jews, but also anyone who opposes Zionism or sympathizes with who those who oppose Israel. Talk about a loaded political definition. Chambers, like any other modern English dictionary, defines it essentially (and more accurately) as \\"hatred of Jews.\\" And with Chambers you can still look up a word that hasn't been written in a newspaper for about 100 years (e.g. \\"cark\\") and find the correct definition.You work hard for your money. Save it. If you need a dictionary that gives you definitions of older words buy the Chambers. If you simply must have the Webster's Third you can get it for a few bucks at a library sale."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"A lot of words defined here, but still not complete.

Names of people, such as George W. Bush, places such as Russia, and things, such as the Hope diamond, are not included among its entries. The editors explain that the printed version could not have been contained in a single volume if such encylopedic terms had been included. If you frequently need to reference such terms, you will need to supplement this specialized language reference with a geographical or biographical dictionary, or an encyclopedia.Our reader from Brooklyn is quite correct in his assertion that W3 is dated. Apart from adding new words, this work has not had a major revision since it was first published in 1963. Many of its definitions are dated. The work reflects the mood and spirit of the 1950's more than of the new millenium. Still, its scholarship is unassailable, and the work, as a whole, is still invaluable. Until the folks at Merriam-Webster can update it--no easy task--this dictionary is still the standard for American English. Rumor has it that a new edition is being planned.

Second has much more entries (600,000) than Third (450,000) and is said to be indispensable to the study of 19C American literature. I bought it from an American bookseller: Zephyr Books Inc, Reno, NV. It was shipped on 16th this month and is now heading toward me.--I became the owner of this grand and impressive dictionary yesterday (March 21) at 15:39. I was extremely astonished as it arrived so soon; for I thought it was being carried by ship as I had seen it \\"has already shipped\\" in the bookseller's mail. Contrary to my preconception even such a heavy book as Webster's Second is carried by air nowadays. This is why it arrived at my entrance within a week all the way crossing the Pacific Ocean from Nevada to Japan. There would be no one, I assume, that is not amazed at its mass. It is the only family treasure of mine that I would show first of all if any VIP were to visit my cottage. I must say a miracle has taken place. My Webster's Second was published in 1942, copyright 1934, in 3 vols., 4.to (=quarto: a size of a book, ... , measuring about 9 1/212 1/2 inches [=2431.8cm], as a maximum, ... (Webster's Second), my actual measurement: 23.531cm, 9.5g=21pounds. , civ, 3210pp.+360pp., 7 inches (=18cm) thick with 3 vols. piled up. (Third ed. 1993 (originally issued in Sept. 1961), 1 vol.: 139.73.3 inches, 12.5 pounds, 2816pp., 4 inches thick) I hasten to inform you of my surprise and delight. I am confident of myself being one of the rare owners of Webster's Second, which I'm justly proud of, because I guess this edition didn't sell well on account of its high price and the worldwide disturbances of those days.*Here I'd like to make mention of the two great advantages of Webster's Second: its beauty and richness in contents, the writing of which requires more endeavor of me than usual, so I bought five canned coffee at bargain and smoke several snipes now and then that I gathered on my way to the supermarket (I am a sniper). Firstly W2's beauty. It is probably the last and the most gigantic dictionary printed in type by human beings. \\"moji(letters) o insatsusuru(to print) niwa(in order to), katsuji(printing types) niyoru(by means of) no ga mottomo utsukushii(the most beautiful) insatsubutsu(printed matter) o erareru(can get)\\" [my private translation: \\"Concerning the printing of the alphabets (letters), printing in type produces the most beautiful printed matter,\\"] says the Encyclopaedia Heibonsha, published 1985, in 16 vols., p.440, vol. 3. The rare existence of dimly printed letters in W2, I believe, is the solid proof that it was printed in type ensuring its beauty as a whole, which alone is a sufficient reason for you to be in haste to buy it immediately without hesitation before it runs out of stock at the booksellers. Its gain is beyond description. -- I've just smoked the last snipe and the canned coffee is my last resort. -- Setting aside an idle talk let me tell you W2's richness in contents. I stand by my opinion that W2 is not only precise in definition but also rich in contents, that is to say, it is in possession of a vast fund of information. For example, in its description of \\"typesetting machines\\" are found references even to the inventors from the earliest: Dr. William Church (England, 1822), Etienne Robert Gaudens (England, 1840), and Frederick Rosenberg (America, 1843) to the later: Joseph Thorne ([America] 1880), Ottmar Mergenthaler (Naturalized American from Germany [from Webster's Biographical Dictionary, 1972, I bought from a secondhand bookstore many years ago] 1885: Linotype) and Tolbert Lanston (American, 1885: Monotype). At the beginning is defined \\"Any of various [-ar- printed dimly: evidence of the use of printing types] keyboard machines for automatically composing printers' types\\", which melted away the long years of my wonder why such printing that uses so innumerable, minimum printing types is possible (my preconception was that such work was impossible by human hands taking profit into account) filling me with much gratitude to this massive dictionary. Not a reference to the inventors related is to be seen in Encyclopaedia Heibonsha quoted above (Far from that there is no entry of \\"typesetting machines\\" in it at all to my great astonishment, incredible, but real--a fact that prevents me from getting angry), which perhaps comes from insufficient passion and energy that Noah Webster and the editors that followed had to my disappointment though I'm unwilling to go the length of saying it is due to insufficient intelligence. (Incidentally I looked up \\"love\\", one of the most important words in the Western world. My W2 defines it as \\"A feeling of strong personal attachment induced by that which delights or commands admiration, by sympathetic understanding; by ties of kinship; ardent affection;\\" It is true that this is not wrong, but I feel something lacking. I want it to venture to add \\"A desire, wish, or determination to give happier, longer life or protection to what are important to one, which I believe are the inevitable consequences of having a feeling of strong personal attachment, hence being kind and gentle to them, neither impatient nor angry with them\\", at least. I think such is the case with those who mean what they say setting aside those who only pay lip service by saying \\"I love you.\\") My assertion that Webster's Second is rich in contents is in agreement with Wikipedia's description of Third, i.e. \\"To make room for 100,000 new words, Gove (Philip Babcock Gove, the editor of W3) now made sweeping deletions, dropping 250,000 entries. He eliminated the \\"nonlexical matter\\" that more properly belongs to an encyclopedia, ... The rationale was that, while useful, these are not strictly about language.\\" Gove was a lexicographer different from William Allan Neilson, the editor of Second who was not only a lexicographer but also educator and writer and was president of Smith College between 1917 and 1939. Gove's deletions of entries from W2 were so sweeping that I cannot but conclude he believed that lexicographers were the highest authority on how good dictionaries should be and that he held the power of life and death over the words in W2.*Reading through the reviews on this dictionary is both exciting and thrilling. It seems to be not less authoritative than OED. All the reviewers praise the precision of its definition, which is the most important of the elements of dictionaries and cultivates the intelligence of the users, making Webster the PARAMOUNT. I believe this Webster's precise and excellent definition has contributed to the elevation of the tough Yankees' energetic intelligence. Profuse illustrations are also what I like. What surprises me most, however, is the fact that all reviewers, even the passionate admirers of this dictionary, in unison blame its editorial staff for neglecting its revision. Why on earth don't you people of the most prosperous, powerful, and influential (and intelligent, needless to say) democratized country understand the reason why Webster can do without frequent revisions? I am entirely confident of the fact that it has already reached perfection in its core parts. So far from the object of criticism infrequency of revisions is an exact evidence of confidence in and reliance on it the editorial staff have. To tell the truth now, the edition I have contracted to buy is not 3rd but 2nd. Informed of scarce change in the main parts of this dictionary I had a great joy. Its price is only US$22.50 with shipping: US$95.50 (At first the shipping charge was $18 but later extra charge was required and finally amounted to the present sum due to the heavy weight of the book, to which I gave an instant OK as I knew its real value and amazingly low price. Here in Japan a certain site of used book stores on Net requires for this edition more than four times (even except shipping charges)as much as what I pay to my Bookseller: Zephyr Books Inc, Reno, NV. Why not buy inexpensive used 2nd edition from US booksellers if you are as poor but earnest over the study of English as I leaving the expensive brand-new 3rd edition to the rich? It's a great bargain! After writing this review I happened to come across a sale of 3rd edition on Amazon Japan with half price including postage to my great disappointment. I sent a mail asking the cancellation of the purchase contract anyway but it will be difficult to succeed as the article was probably sent out a few days ago. So I put \\"data fata secutus\\" [obeying the given fates: my private translation from Latin] at the end of my mail. I must manage to find out a smart excuse for having made such a silly purchase to my wife pretty, little, but not a little tough for me. A proverb says \\"Adversity makes a man\\" but I want to be a man without hardships, if possible.I bought another Webster dictionary: Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dict. 10th Rev. ed., which arrived this morning and I immediately compared it with Collins Eng. Dict. I read the definition of \\"intelligence\\" in each and knew that besides the ability for understanding Webster gives \\"the ability to learn and to deal with new or trying situations\\" which Collins does not give. (Here I'd be happy if you listen to my experience I had this afternoon (May 30, 2012) which has something to do with the definition of intelligence in Webster. Asked to pay to a bank by my wife, I stood before the ATM (Automatic teller machine) and then I knew the money in the envelope was just \\\\10,000 less than she told me last night. On my way back home I felt like making sure the sum once more and seeing the sum written on the envelope I realized it was me that was wrong not her. The money in the envelope was not less than needed. Getting back to the ATM I threw in coins into the right-side mouth and just after it was closed I realized I should have used the left-side mouth. I pushed the cancellation button instantly but my coins didn't come out. The female clerk whom I called easily produced my coins from the bottom of the machine. After that I could finish paying the right sum to the ATM this time with much more care. I could manage to \\"deal with a new and trying situation\\" in agreement with the definition of \\"intelligence\\" that Webster gives. Such being the case it may safely be said that I have intelligence if a little regardless of high or low. It's a great pleasure to be able to say W2's definition proved that I have intelligence anyhow. This much for today. \\"intelligence\\" is partly defined at p.1281 of W2 as follows: The capacity for knowledge and understanding, esp. as applied to the handling of novel situations; the power of meeting a novel situation successfully by adjusting one's behavior to the total situation; [continued]) Even the smaller Collegiate is so excellent that I can make myself confident of the excellence of the larger New International, the arrival of which I am now heartily looking forward to. I believe it will have the power to elevate my intelligence with its precise and excellent definition if I read them correctly, intently, and carefully thinking well then. I am determined to make full use of it. I have to retrieve the loss born from my careless and silly purchase.After writing the above there was an unexpected development in my knowledge of Webster's NID by my research into it on Google. My purchase of Second NID, far from a failure, was a great success. It is a different book from Third. Second NID has much more entries (600,000) than Third (450,000) with different editors and is said to be indispensable to the study of 19C American literature. It has even a reprinted edition in Japan published in 1995 that costs more than $830.00. Its greatness is quite clear if compared to Kojien, the most authoritative and representative Japanese dictionary whose entries are only about 200,000 (2nd ed. published in 1969; I don't have the latest ed.) with no etymological descriptions at all. You should be, therefore, very deliberate in choosing the edition of NID, Second or Third, which is a happy choice though. I unconditionally recommend Second to you."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"Were it not for the immediate remedy and response from the seller, there would be no stars at all for this item.

For Merriam Webster, the real dictionary on CD-ROM is Merriam Webster&iexcl;s Collegiate Dictionary Deluxe Audio Edition. It was too bad that the former edition was still non-audio. In my daily use, I usually have difficulty in making the space of 9.125 x 12.875 inches footprint for The Third New International on my desk.

Yes, it lacks a lot of current words. Yes, its illustrations are few and old-fashioned. (If those things are important to you, you'd be better off with Wikipedia or the latest version of the American Heritage Unabridged Dictionary, which is a first-rate product in its own way.) What the MW3 does have going for it are excellent scholarship and thorough definitions.In my experience as an editor and writer, the main advantage of a good unabridged dictionary is not so much that it includes more words, but that it gives fuller definitions of the words it includes. For instance, the definition of \\"imminent\\" in my paperback Oxford American Dictionary is 11 words long, with no examples of usage. The definition of \\"imminent\\" in my Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary is 17 words long and includes one usage example. By contrast, the definition of \\"imminent\\" in the MW3 is 22 words long, with three examples of usage. Simply put, a person using the MW3 will have a better understanding of the various meanings of a word and how it should be used.The publishing world being in a state of disarray, we are unlikely ever to see another unabridged dictionary of American English of the scope and quality of the MW3."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"I am a writer and I was looking for the best dictionary that I could find.

It achieves this primarily by citing historical books and manuscripts, going back in many cases to the dark ages, when the language itself was evolving. Comprising some 22 volumes and requiring more than three feet of shelf space, it is an impressive addition to anyone's library, albeit at a high cost. It is available, again at high cost, on CD ROM.W3 is a single volume about four inches wide. It offers a precise definition of every word you will ever encounter (450,000 are listed) except for slang and jargon, obsolete words, technical vocabularies and recent additions to the language. It is not above providing an occasional literary allusion. It defines the English language.Suppose you want to look up the word &quot;synecdoche.&quot; Which of the following scenarios do you prefer?(1) Find volume 10 of the OED and learn that Wyclif (1338) defined it as &quot;whanne a part is set for al, either al is set for oo par . . .&quot;(2) Start computer, find CD ROM, load CD ROM, go to OED, step through program, find information, unload CD ROM, turn off computer, file CD ROM, go back to what you were doing in the first place.(3) Open W3 and read &quot;a figure of speech by which a part is put for a whole (as fifty sail for fifty ships) . . .&quot;W3 is THE dictionary.

The reviewer highly recommended Websters 3rd New International Dictionary:Unabridged which I purchased instead. The program is very easy to use and easily links to my MS Word.I do have four disappointments - First, I have a real interest in etymology and though the NID:U has an etymology section it is very brief.Second, though the CD is dated 2000 I have wondered just how up-to-date it is. For example, the word &quot;internet&quot; is not found.Third, many of the illustrations in the print version are NOT in the CD version. That is a big disappointment.Fourth, the dictionary does not contain many proper nouns or names. For example, out of the many uses for the word &quot;Lincoln&quot; not one definition lists Abraham as in President; neither is there any listing for Jefferson, either as President or Memorial. Look up Georgia and you will find that it is a state but there is no reference to the now country of Georgia, a former Soviet Republic. Look up any of the planets, Saturn, Venus, Mars, etc. and you find no mention of these words as describing the planets! The more I look the more disappointed I become. It is sold as an &quot;unabridged&quot; dictionary and according to the definition means complete, which the Wester's 3rd New International:Unabridged is not."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"Something tells me you wouldn't be on this page, reading these reviews, unless you shared an acute and probably pedantic interest in words and their meanings. I ain't no different.For about a decade now, I have been using Random House's Unabridged, which is equally weighty and was minted in 1987. I've been looking for something newer, and I thought the time had come when Webster's came out with this monster, late in the fall of 2000.Although I was intent on buying the book, standing in the checkout line, I asked if I might not be permitted to open and examine it, just for larks.Imagine my suprise on discovering that this book was actually printed in 1961, and is in fact almost entirely the same text! The typeset hasn't been touched since then! Folks, it's merely a re-issue of their 1961 edition.Yes, they did add an absorbing \\"Special Addenda Section of New Words\\" toward the front of the dictionary (80-100pp, I'm guessing), but they couldn't be bothered to include these neologisms in the main text, presumably because resetting the 1961 proofs would have been too much work for Webster & co . . . ?And if Webster & Co. couldn't be bothered to alphabetize these news words into the main body of this dictionary, I'm guessing the poor overworked editors were too busy to correct errors and typos in the main text either! Why? What is Webster's doing now? Have they started a chain of hotels or something?I SOOOOO wanted to buy and love this book, and was SOOOOO angry to find it a con. I couldn't believe it!Admittedly, the neologism section was VERY interesting, but you're basically paying all that moolah for that, you should understand. Perhaps you should buy the book, photocopy this section, then return the book for a full refund the next day.Although this would be unethical, it was equally unethical, I feel, for Webster's to have grandly let on like they had drafted a completely new dictionary, when in fact they had done nothing of the kind.Another consideration for the prospective buyer is that ideas about readability (i.e. the use of fonts, boldface, and italics to make the text more negotiable) were a lot more primitive in 1961, and, naturally, nothing has been done about that, either. In other words, the columns are very hard on the eye.Until somebody comes along with another giant dictionary like this, but one that reflects true work and revision, I'm sticking with my old Random House.UPDATE: I've since read (about 2010) that Webster's is in fact working up a newly reworked unabridged dictionary, to be out soon -- of the sort that I was led to believe this was. Maybe you should hold out for that one."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"This review is unavoidably dichotomized: one is for the dictionary and one is for the publisher.As for the dictionary, I have to express my deep admiration for Webster's Third New International Dictionary: it is in my opinion a wondrous dictionary, the best I have ever used. I am a researcher and I extensively use English in writing. For so much time I have rested upon imprecise or unclear dictionaries. When I came across the Webster's Dictionary I found the foremost authority in English dictionaries. The feature I most appreciate of this dictionary is that, unlike the other ones, it is based on multiple concise definitions for most words. That is, it explains meanings by means of two or three (sometimes more) different sentences which are always brief and pellucid (instead of one definition consisting of a long unwieldy sentence). Thus, the reader's cognitive effort in understanding is much smaller. Numerous examples help readers to understand every nuance of the word: the sources are diverse (literature, science, history, philosophy, etc.) and cover a wide range of contexts. Many usage notes provide synonyms and help the reader to distinguish semantically related words.I suggest anyone to buy it at once, and I also suggest to carefully read the guide to the dictionary and to the pronunciation: you will find that the Webster's Dictionary is a very powerful tool, a lot of information is conveyed, more than you might think before reading the guide.As for the publisher, I agree with the review entitled \`\`What a piece of junk'', and I would like to address one word to Merriam-Webster: lazy! You are very lazy. Webster's Dictionary is a petrified dictionary, no revised edtion has been made from 1961. I am astonished, I wonder what you are doing. You keep on publishing reprints and sell them at a very high price. Anyone may find here in Italy the 1993 edition reprinted by Konemann at a very low price. Some time ago I bought it at 27 Euros (about 23 US dollars). It is true that there is an addenda but this is just the evidence that a revision has not been accomplished. A serious publisher would have undertaken a complete revision. Once upon a time you were a prime example of how a publisher should work, currently you are a prime example of how a publisher should not work (are you aware of what Oxford University Press is doing now with its English Dictionary?). Webster's Third New International Dictionary is still the best dictionary (bar Oxford English Dictionary) but you are sitting on your laurels: watch out! If you do not look to your laurels Random House will soon outstrip you.It is obvious that my five star score is for the dictionary as it was compiled by Noah Webster and revised by lexicographers and scholars at Merriam until 1961. Current Merriam deserves no score."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"I just received my copy of Web's 3rd Unabridged Dictionary from Amazon. Overall I am happy and would recommend it to anyone with enough of a love for words and language to take the step up from the standard abridged dictionaries. However, I have one reservation I think is worth pointing out to the readers of this review. Amazon shows this book as an October 2000 release. The included cd appears to be 2000 (I have not yet checked to see whether its a real updated version), but the book itself is 1993. I am disappointed in that date, because I expect it will lack a lot of recent techno-jargon that I would have expected in a 2000 publication."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"I'd owned the Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (3rd Edition) since 1985 and recently I'd also brought the &quot;latest&quot; edition of this dictionary with CD-ROM. What I found the CD-ROM's illustrations were just based on the deluxe edition of their Collegiate Dictionary, therefore the CD-ROM's contents are actually an abridged edition of the original printed edition. If you do not have the deluxe edition you may check their web site (www.m-w.com), an on-line edition is over there. According to the response of Merriam-Webster's staff, it's contents are based on the 1993 edition of the Unabridged Dictionary, actually the 1993 edition is the &quot;latest&quot; of their Unabridged Dictionary. The copyright date 2000 is merely the production date of that CD-ROM!But the CD-ROM is actually very useful to find related words because it has advanced searches and browse function, where I can find related information very easy. And it is not possible in the past when there is only a printed dictionary.Yes, actually this dictionary has it's disadvantage, because it cannot provide explanation in geographical and biographical name etc. If you are looking for more updated and latest unabridged dictionary, I suggest you can buy the Random House Unabridged Dictionary. (They'd published their unabridged dictionary, 2nd edition with CD-ROM as early as 1993)Finally, just give you some interesting facts about the 2nd edition of the Unabridged Dictionary (Merriam-Webster), the total number of words and size is actually larger than the &quot;Unabridged&quot; Dictionary (3rd edition), therefore the word &quot;unabridged&quot; is merely indicate that it is a larger dictionary, but actually cannot really cover &quot;everything&quot;!"},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"Webster's 3rd International is a terrific dictionary, but it becomes even better with this CD-ROM. The software starts up within 2 seconds of clicking the icon, and you can simply start typing the word you want to look up. &quot;Of course,&quot; you say? Well...check out the OED, which I bought and subsequently returned. With that, it takes about 20 seconds to get started (assuming you already have the CD-ROM in your drive--otherwise it will take you longer), and then leaves you with a page full of options to choose. And then...but I digress. Let's just say the software for Webster's is just what you want--click on the icon, type the word, hit RETURN, voila. And you can double click on any word in the definition and you are instantly brought to that word's definition--which is REALLY nice. The software is good enough that it significantly enhances the value of the dictionary. And if you don't believe me, do what I did: buy the OED first, let the world's worst software package frustrate the heck out of you for a week, then return it and buy Webster's 3rd."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"This is in response to the fellow who claims it to be a peice of junk. This is an excellent dictionary. I personally own the Random House dictionary (Unabridged) as well as the American Heritage dictionary and neither of these even come close to the breadth of information in this dictionary. It has many more entries defined and lot more usages explained. It has lots of obscure and interesting words you will not find defined in any other American dictionary besides probably the Websters 2nd international (1934) or Johnson's Dictionary. Granted that it is somewhat old (1961) and some of the definitions are a little outdated, but it's scholarship is unmatched by any other dictionary besides the great oxford English dictionary (20 volumes). If I were given the choice to own only 1 dictionary it would be this one. Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"The Merriam-Webster's dictionaries are supposed to reflect the language as it is not the language as is might be or should be. At least that was what Noah Webster's intentions were. This sequence of dictionaries has gone through 4 major editions: 1890, 1909, 1934 and 1961. (I am excluding the earlier editions which are really quite different than those versions called \\"international\\".) As you can see every 20 years or so, G.C Merriam published a major update. We should have seen the Fourth edition sometime in the Reagan administration. Dictionary enthusiasts would already be saving their pennies for the fifth edition. The main body of the dictionary is out of date. Unlike the 20 vol. OED, this was never meant to be a scholar's dictionary. It is meant to be current. The editions since the late 1960's have all included addenda, but that section does not address the problems with existing entries. It is also quite cumbersome to use.If one wants to see what a well done modern dictionary looks like that does not need a bookcase of it's own, one need only look to the recent editions of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"This review focuses on aspects of the software, not the quality of the dictionary content.The software is fairly usable. When installed onto your hard drive (80 MB) it starts up in 4 seconds. You enter sufficient characters to identify the word and/or choose it from a filtered list. The entry (including stress and pronunciation symbols) is displayed typographically like the printed edition. Illustrations are not included with the entries. Any word in the definition can be double-clicked to jump to its definition. The software supports advanced searches and includes online help.Anything supporting faster lookup would improve usability. This includes faster startup (nearly all of the startup time is spent in the splash screen). Since the program consumes 1--3 MB of RAM, it is reasonable to leave it running. Improved support for looking up words from other programs would be nice. The software includes macros to facilitate lookup from Microsoft Word and WordPerfect, but support for alt-clicking any word (&agrave; la GuruNet/Atomica) would be more useful.The GUI isn't &quot;polished&quot;: Background colors don't abide with your desktop color scheme, window size-position is not retained when restarting the program, old style WinHelp is used instead of the newer HTML-based help, etc. These are simply annoyances; the software is stable and bug-free.The software is an improvement over the online dictionary available at Merriam-Webster's website in that you don't need to be connected to the Internet and that the dictionary is unabridged."},{"Title":"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (CD-ROM 3.0 version)","review":"It has all the listings and pictures of the actual book.

But, it does have some extra features. It allows you to guess at the spelling of word to find it. It has a program to help you solve crosswords. It allows you to copy and paste words (really handy for the difficult words). You can even get a list sorted by nouns, trademarks and such.

Working as a miner in the asteroid belt Senecal becomes mixed up in a plot involving vast riches, political intrigue and a beautiful girl.Given the nature of the story and the protagonists, this book will appeal mostly to late teen and early twenties readers.It is a well written and fast paced story. While not quite in the &quot;read in one sitting&quot; category it is a compelling read. The characters are all fairly well constructed given that the requirements for this type of story are not exactly strict.If you like this book, of course, you should check out the author's other works but also have a look at the novels by Larry Niven. if you want something in the same style but with more substance try the collaborations between Niven and Pournelle."},{"Title":"Exiles To Glory","review":"Pournelle isn't a classic sci-fi author, though he has co-written some fine novels (with Larry Niven).

Then I came upon Exiles to Glory and I thought Pournelle could justify himself.Unfortunate for me and for Pournelle, I thought this book was also a bore. It's pace is written like a golden age sci-fi novel in its \\"fast-paced one-problem/one-solution\\" approach. It was unflavored and the plot was jerky most of the time. It was so jerky that the holes in the plot are pretty easy to piece together yourself.

Micah Clarke, a young, innocent peasant joins forces with other peasants, among the Puritans, to fight for this pathetic duke's cause. Not a subject that would appear to be on the surface to be too exciting, in reality it is enjoyable reading. From the descriptions of the English settings, not unlike some of Thomas Hardy's relaxing paragraphs of the moors, to the gory horrors of the culminating battle, Doyle's writing keeps you turning the pages for more. At the same time, each chapter is so rich in dialogue and setting description, that you feel you can set down the book, and then pick it up the next day, thereby getting your fill of a relaxing, interesting trip into another world. As an aside, Doyle's thoughts on God and organized religion that appear in some of his other literature, are found here too. Through various character's dialogue, he's able to respectfully discuss differing \\"sides\\" of this sensitive subject, while appreciating the plight of all men, whatever their beliefs, church, political party, or economic class.Those who have read Sherlock Holmes should attempt Arthur Conan Doyle's historical fiction, such as Micah Clarke.

More words like \\"soul\\" and \\"spirit\\" were being dropped in each chapter with greater frequency. By the time chapter 4 comes along and the author meets Elisabeth Kubler-Ross all pretence of analysis goes out of the window. There was an unfortunate window in Kubler-Ross' life when she abandoned critical thinking and embraced the teachings of (what appeared to the watching world to be) a charlatan spiritualist. She rejected such nonsense just before she died and the arena of psychology has kindly glossed over this aberration. Dr Cole revels in it.He conflates anecdotal reports or speculative literature as evidence. He reports that a neurosurgeon once had a premonition (not appreciating that a neuro-SCIENTIST could explain these events quite easily). There are studies being conducted at the time of writing to examine the reality of near-death experiences although the results keep being held back (amid complaints of interference).If you are already a believer in spiritualism then go ahead and enjoy this book. If you employ critical thinking then this book will make you so angry it will be thrown across the room at least once a chapter (twice in the latter half of the book)."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives","review":"Dinosaur Systematics: Aproaches and Perspectives edited by Kenneth Carpenter and Philip J.

There is excellent morphological description and taxonomic classifications within the pages of this book.How scientists look at dinosaur fossils has changed, now, including the flora , climatic and other ecological changes affecting the dinosaurs makes for a better overall picture. But this book has excellent comparative anatomy. There are nine sections within this book and each of those section is further divided into chapters making for a very educational read.The sections of the book are as follows: Methods, Sauropodomorpha, Theropoda, Ornithopoda, Pachycephalosauria, Ceratopsia, Stegosauria, Ankylosauria, and Footprints. There is a excellent taxonomic idex at the rear of the book.&quot;Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives gives the reader a very good overview of dinosaur systematics using various examples to explore what species a dinosaur is, hat separates genders in dinosaurs, what morphological changes occur with maturation of a species, and what morophological variations occur within species,This is a very concise yet conprehensive volume which is appointed heavely with excellent illustrations and is intended for students and professionals in the areas of palenotology, evolutionary biology, geology, and vertebrate zoology."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives","review":"A great technical volume (yeah, you might not want this book if you're buying it for your 5th grader who likes dinosaurs) that deals with dinosaurs as they were: living creatures. Included are papers on sexual dimorphism (differences between sexes), behavior, general morphology, and generally very useful papers. I highly recomend this book to anyone who is in/plans on pursuing paleontology. A great volume that is still cited today."},{"Title":"The Talking Cloth","review":"A delightful children's book that explains the West African Adinkra cloth and the meanings of the colors and symbols."},{"Title":"The Talking Cloth","review":"This book is great. I bought it based on the beautiful illustrations and skimming the words, thinking it would be a nice addition to my literacy library for kindergarten. Once I got the book home as usual I first read it to my 2-year-old. Showing a much greater attention span than normal, she listened raptly to the whole thing, viewing pictures, then said, \\"Again!\\" The illustrations in this book indeed are a great highlight. They make a reader feel they can step right into the scenes of the story and talk with the people, feel the cloth. Also, the dialogue between the characters is lively, and the story of the adinkra cloth teaches a whole cultural custom from beginning to end. When Amber dreams of being an Ashanti princess, or sees her whole family wearing the cloths as Ashanti people, her imagination is exciting to children, who begin to imagine themselves in different cultures and contexts as well. I like the way the book connected Amber and her family to their cultural traditions in a way that made for an interesting story, but also, provided knowledge about a custom we may not otherwise know. The only thing I do not like about the story, and which continues to give me pause every time I read it to a new child, is the way Aunt Phoebe and Amber's dad's (Phoebe's brother) relationship is portrayed. Amber's dad makes negative comment after negative comment in the book about Aunt Phoebe's collections of cultural heritage, and we have to wait quite long before we learn he really likes drinking mocha and listening to stories too. And we never really learn why this tension exists, so it is just out of nowhere in an otherwise positive story for young children. I feel sensitive to it because in a story of African Americans, to have the only male, the father, being negative about so much for no contextual reason seems to harken back to criticsms I have read about African American males being portrayed in negative roles in literature and film (Color Purple, Waiting to Exhale). With the latter, I think context was there. In this story, since it is for children and very short, if we can't figure out why Amber's dad is unhappy, maybe that part doesn't need to be in an otherwise enriching, positive, and wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Talking Cloth","review":"In \\"The Talking Cloth,\\" a girl accompanies her family to Aunt Phoebe's. It quickly becomes clear that while the protagonist's family is square, her aunt is hip. The girl looks up to Aunt Phoebe as she is educated, artistic and worldly. While exploring the aunt's neat things, the girl notices an Adinkra cloth. The aunt unwraps the cloth and tells the story of the celebrated cloth. There is a brief description of the colors and symbols. An explanation is given for two popular symbols, Gye Nyame and Obi nka Obie. By the end of the story, the family comes together, united around the cloth. The visit is a warm, heritage friendly experience. The representation of Adrinka is bit odd. Adinkra means \\"separation\\" or \\"farewell\\"' which is why it is typically worn at funerals. Depicted as if it were Kente cloth, it is described as an all-purpose Afrocentric celebration and the darker side of the cloth is only mentioned. In Ghana, one would be hard pressed to find anybody wearing an Adinkra cloth outside of a funeral and the colors are almost always black ink on black cloth or red on black (see the pictures I placed in the image gallery for this product). While Rhonda Mitchell explores the rainbow colors of contemporary cloths, they are typically for tourists. This feedback is mostly nitpicking since \\"The Talking Cloth\\" is for the most part accurate and socially affirmative. The pictures are attractive and the reading level is best for second graders. This is a valuable read given the lack of similar books. So it is especially tragic that the book is out-of-print. At the time of review, some of Amazon's marketplace sellers were offering this book for ridiculous prices but a few copies could still be had for reasonable prices. (I mean really, $224.95 for a used copy?! You can buy an Adrinkra cloth for that much!) On a related side note, the Westerner can watch the making of a cloth on the \\"Arts of Ghana\\" DVD. While Adrinkra literally means farewell, out-of-print has the same meaning, so get \\"The Talking Cloth\\" while you can."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Intelligence Handbook","review":"Peace is just a thought away.

For twenty-two chapters, Fr.

I especially found the 'Spiritual Intelligence Inventory' that begins almost every chapter fun and enlightening. It is very apparent as you work through the book that Fr. Paul has years of experience helping people in a variety of situations. I have read the entire book and then have come back to the individual chapters as I encounter things in my own life. An excellent book with practical advice for living with Spiritual Intelligence!"},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"One of the misconceptions that people who have not read this book apparently have is that the Buckle family is \\"reaping what it's sown\\" by having gotten their farm through illegitimate means (ie. colonialism). This is a very crass attitude grounded in both ignorance and racism.In fact the Buckle family purchased their farm AFTER Zimbabwean independence with the explicit written promise from Mugabe's government that the land would not be targeted for redistribution. The real story here is how a demagogue like Mugabe, who manufactures racial hatred for his own political gain, can be so disrespectful of the very principles that he espoused to obtain power in the first place.For those who think that the land reform issue is a simple matter of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, it may be quite a shock to learn that the only ones benefiting so far from newly acquired farmland are Mugabe's wealthy political cronies. Everyone else is on the verge of starvation due to the inevitable collapse of the economic infrastructure following the demise of the rule of law.The rest of the world stood by and watched it happen. Perhaps someday we'll realize that it's far more humanitarian and cost-efficient to prevent famines before they occur."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"Are, Read this Book! For almost two years, &quot;veterans&quot; of Zimbabwe's (formerly Rhodesia) civil war, many of them too young have actually fought in the war, have been invading farms and ranches, and intimidating, beating, and, in many cases, killing the lawful owners of those properties. Throughout this tortured land, these invaders have succeeded in driving out productive farmers, only to take over land that they themselves don't know how to farm. As a result, uncounted acres lie fallow, livestock are untended and dying, and thousands of farm workers have been thrown out of work. The police will do nothing to help the beleaguered farmers because these thefts are taking place with the approval of Zimbabwe's dictator, Robert Mugabe. African Tears is the heartbreaking story of one woman's efforts to thwart the squatters who invaded her farm, destroyed her property, killed her livestock, and worst of all, tortured and beat her employees. For seven long months, Cathy Buckle made a valiant stand against this lawlessness, only to have to give up when her struggle became too dangerous. Her story is emblematic of what is taking place all across Zimbabwe. Everyone should read this book, so that when famine strikes this suffering nation and Mugabe appeals for international aid on behalf of his starving people, more people will be able to understand his role in their agonies."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"Catherine Buckle's 'African Tears' is a memoir of the violent and bloody Zimbabwean land invasions of 2000. Her story is a tragic account of ignorant 'war veterans' turning her peaceful farm into a blackened garbage dump.I have great sympathy for Buckle and the other white farmers who suffer like her. The complete destruction of a prosperous life's work is a personal tragedy that all readers will empathize with.Buckle's story is mostly devoid of political commentary. She prefers to recount her own experiences during the invasions as a factual representation of Zimbabwe's dilemma. I couldn't help but notice that Buckle's persecutors, the so-called 'war veterans', most of them too young to be veterans at all, were conducting themselves much as they did 2 decades ago. The 'veterans' attack the small farming community and their hard working employees who cannot protect themselves - how brave!'African Tears' is a noble account of a horrendous situation. I hope Catherine Buckle will choose to write again of the place she still calls her home."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"Go to http://africantears.netfirms.com to get African tears and Beyond Tears - to understand what's going on in Zimbabwe, read her books or at least visit her web site."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"A well written book that tells it like it is. Catherine's words provide us with vivid images of the terror and uncertainty that had been ever present in the lives of many Zimbabweans this past year and a half. Her story is the story of many, and it brings home to the rest of us the ultimate price that some people pay for their rights as citizens and as human beings."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"Although not a professional writer and maybe because of it Cathy Buckle gives an insight to the tragedy that is befalling the normal person in Zimbabwe. Mainly due to her own direct involvment in this, is the point brought across that there is a major problem in Zimbabwe of racism. But not racism of whites on blacks as is normally always what is brought to the world's attention by the media. This is Shona racism against anyone who defies Robert Mugabe. And to those of you who apparently read this book, and reviewed it as trash and declined to leave your name, showing the courage of your convictions, I say to you can you actually read? Well done Cathy, a brillaint work done under what must have beem the most trying of circumstances."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"African Tears is a harrowing story of bravery, human decency, and conviction in the face of overwhelming tyranny and cruelty. Ms. Buckle, regardless of her politics, was tormented, intimidated, and lived in fear for her life and that of her family. Her humanity and decency throughout this period is inspiring to behold and again, regardless of her politics, should give us all hope for the future.Her greatest gift in writing this book, is to try and bring to the attention of the world, that this dictator, Mugabe, must be brought to the public's attention and must be stopped.Read this book and take heart. There are still good people left in the world."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"I've been to Zimbabwe and am planning a return trip next year; consequently, I've been searching for anything I can find to read about the former Rhodesia. There's not a lot available, frankly, though I was looking forward to reading Catherine Buckle's book on the recent farm invasions in rural Zimbabwe (invasions that got a little bit of press over here in Japan before vanishing from the news completely). I was a bit put off by the cover, however: a lurid drawing of an enormous sickle slicing open a bloody and red-rimmed Zimbabwe floating on a background of solid black, with a quote below: 'It's not over yet.' What isn't? Buckle's book?The cover alerted me to the dodginess of what lay inside. A more appropriate title for this book would have been 'What Happened to ME When Zimbabwean War Veterans Invaded My Farm.' Buckle's claustrophobic (and poorly edited) writing quickly irritates: there is no balance, no dialogue, no depth, no background, and precious little information. The casual reader will learn very little about Zimbabwe from this book, but will come away with a lot of knowledge about Buckle herself, including a lot of sentimental stories about the lambs and bulls on her farm. Indeed, one learns more about her animals than about the workers she claims to care so much about. Furthermore, page after page is taken up with quotes from various emails, many written by Buckle herself, though there are almost as many written by supporters, who all say essentially the same thing: It's terrible what's happening on your farm, and our hearts are with you, and my, aren't you a good writer. Emails are one thing, and books are another. Or so I thought.To take issue with Buckle's book is not to condone what was done to her and her family (who, like everybody in this book apart from Buckle herself, appear only briefly and who lack all substance) or to detract from the obvious pain and suffering endured by them (and by millions of others in a shattered country). In fact I have nothing but the greatest sympathy for Buckle and all those like her who have suffered under Mugabe's despotism. Nor do I agree with the reviewer above, who trots out the same tired, pat charge of white racism. What has happened in Zimbabwe needs to be told. I only wish a better writer than Catherine Buckle had tackled the job.'African Tears' is a disappointing book that continually trips itself up. Far from being an overview of the land problems in Zimbabwe, it is the self-absorbed story of one victim that fails to throw any light over the country or its current implosion. A dedicated and persistent emailer doesn't necessarily make a good writer. I sympathize with the people of Zimbabwe and hope that, someday soon, for their sake as well as ours, a better informed and more talented writer will tell this story to the world."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"As a member of the white race, I feel it is my duty to pontificate that much is to be said about our fight against tyrannical monstrosities like Mugabe, his many and various degrees notwithstanding. Such is reality. That persons of European descnedentations are superior, intellectually as well as in the careful &amp; proper--and indeed expedient running of a nation--is now beyond any redemption of debate. Unanimous &amp; self-explanatory as it stands the question must be asked: what is to done now. What duties shall we assignate to the many and various tired souls who stand at the brink of a once robust &amp; thrivening nation's ruins laying bare before them? To answer such a question requires unimaginable heights of intellect, greater even than my own. Indeed, perhaps only an extra-terrestial (many of whom have vistited this little nation) would have the capacity for cognisance of the situation that has befallen Zimbabwe and its' peoples. In any case, three cheers for our beloved leader, the Honourable Ian Douglas Smith."},{"Title":"African Tears: The Zimbabwe Land Invasions","review":"Like any sell out of their own, she now cries for protection.

Tough Luck kid, maybe next life you won't sell out."},{"Title":"Psychology of Music, Second Edition (Cognition and Perception)","review":"This Second Edition of Deutsch's seminal work opens with a chapter by John R. Pierce, which provides a whistle-stop tour through nearly every concept important to the perception end of music psychology, touching on major findings in the physics of sound, time resolution of the ear, theories of consonance, pitch perception, Fourier analysis and spectra, the science of singing, speech, timbre, scales and tuning.Schroeder's Chapter 2 describes modern attempts to understand the mathematics of acoustical design. Weinberger's &quot;Music and the auditory system&quot; is an indispensable review of auditory system anatomy, functional organization of the auditory pathway, attention and learning. In Chapter 4, Rasch and Plomp explain that the perception of complex tones can be conceived as a pattern recognition process. Risset &amp; Wessel completely reorganized their chapter on timbre with new sections on global/non-linear synthesis, sampling, controlling musical prosody in Real Time Synthesis, and an expanded section on physical modeling. &quot;The perception of singing&quot; by Sundberg explains that the choice of acoustic characteristic of vowel sounds that singers learn to adopt represents deviations from typical, normal speech for specific requirements of performance and intelligibility.Chapter 7 by Burns comprises an essential treatment of psychophysical and perceptual studies relating to the human perception of pitch and pitch relations. The chapter has been completely reworked, and Burns employs smoothly pellucid prose, making it my favorite chapter of the book (tied with Dowling's). &quot;Absolute pitch&quot; (by Dixon Ward) is an updated, comprehensive overview of 100 years of research, summarizing key theories and a host of methodological traps in the study of this poorly understood ability.Chapter 9 by Deutsch surveys the literature on auditory scene analysis, stream segregation, and the attempts to find auditory correlates to the Gestalt principles of visual grouping. In Chapter 10, Deutsch discusses feature abstraction and its neural substrates, local vs. global processing, hierarchical encoding, memory for music, and a thorough review of the various auditory illusions and paradoxes that Deutsch has been studying for more than 20 years.The third entry new to this edition is Bharucha's &quot;Neural nets, temporal composites, and tonality.&quot; Neural nets have demonstrated (with varying degrees of success) learning of pitch class, chords, keys, and musical style, and provide &quot;a framework in which aspects of cognition can be understood as the result of the neural association of patterns&quot; (p. 413).In &quot;Hierarchical expectation and musical style,&quot; Narmour gives a cogent overview of his implication-realization model enhanced by his more recent ideas about the role in music listening of bottom-up and top-down processing, schemata, and &quot;filling in&quot; of missing (or implied) tonal elements. Eric Clarke's &quot;Rhythm and timing in music&quot; surveys research on rhythmic grouping, meter, perception and production of timing, and the relation between musical timing and movement. Gabrielsson's entry on &quot;Music performance&quot; reviews the literature on performance planning, sight-reading, improvisation, feedback, motor processes, measurements, physical, psychological, and social factors affecting performance, and performance evaluation. In &quot;Development of music perception and cognition&quot; Dowling concludes that there is a converging body of evidence suggesting that &quot;memory for music typically operates in terms of more precise representations of particular stimuli than has been generally thought,&quot; (p. 620) and with this makes an important link to current &quot;multi-trace theories&quot; of memory. Rosamond Shuter-Dyson's contribution on &quot;Musical ability&quot; has improved in organization with reworked sections on concepts, methods, and studies of musical aptitude, achievement, and ability, as well as investigations into correlations between music and other cognitive abilities. Perry and Marin's &quot;Neurological aspects of music perception and performance&quot; is the best single source of information on the topic including discussions of amusia, auditory agnosia and verbal deafness, and the current state of knowledge about functional localization of various component abilities in music perception, understanding, and production. Capping the volume is Edward Carterette and Roger Kendall's, &quot;Comparative music perception and cognition,&quot; which roves across the ethnomusicological landscape with a fairly in-depth treatment of pitch systems (including structural, perceptual, and tonality issues in Indian and other Asian musics).On the other hand ... The book does have its biases which trace their roots to the first edition, and chief among them is that it focuses almost exclusively on the cognitive psychology of music, a bias I can understand given that Deutsch is a cognitive psychologist. As it is, the book is so eminently coherent that it would be a mistake to change it or add to it; but it would have been more accurate to title it &quot;The Cognitive Psychology of Music,&quot; so as not to lure readers interested in topics not covered. In particular, there is minimal coverage of music therapy, personality and individual differences, learning, music education, musical imagery, musical savants, the social psychology of music, or the role of music in people's lives. And not covered at all are the following intrinsically interesting, and potentially important topics: musicogenic epilepsy (e.g., Critchley, 1977; seizures induced by music listening, often by listening to one's favorite song!); memory for music in naturalistic contexts, &aacute; la Wallace and Rubin (1988a; 1988b); the nature of talent (whether musical ability is learned or genetically transmitted, as was insightfully explored by Howe, Davidson &amp; Sloboda, 1998); chromesthesia and other synesthesias (Baron-Cohen &amp; Cytowic, 1989); and theories of musical emotion. After reading the entire book I am no closer to understanding why music moves us; why we like music; or why, as Stewart Hulse (1985) asked in his review of the first edition, yesterday's noise becomes today's musical favorite. I am not faulting the book for this - at 800 pages it is already long enough - I only point this out so that readers (and potential purchasers) will know what to expect. And to be fair, the answers to these last three questions are probably not known, but I would at least have liked to read about the struggle to deal with them. --Daniel J. Levitin, Asst. Professor, Dept. of Psychology McGill University"},{"Title":"Death Valley in 1849: The luck of the gold rush emigrants","review":"Some years back I read several books that dealt with the California Trail that emerged from the Gold Rush of 1849. One of the more fascinating stories that I picked up on was the fate of a a group of travelers that tried a \\"short cut\\" through Death Valley. I noticed that there was a first person account of the ordeal titled \\"Death Valley in 1849\\". I looked it up and found that, if you could get a copy of it, it would probably run upwards of $275.I got to thinking about the book recently and ordered a much less expensive version of the event. \\"Death Valley in 1849\\" by John Southworth turned out to be a recap of the various groups that travelled Death Valley in 1849 and is almost totally focussed on the events in Death Valley itself. Mr. Southworth may have written this book as part of a series of papers on various aspects of Death Valley. Although he gives a brief introduction to the wagon train that took the Death Valley \\"detour\\", the bulk of the book looks at what happened within that specific desert. Once the survivors passed beyond Death Valley, we lose the details and get a brief acknowledgement of who survived. In fact, Mr. Southworth comes across as an apologist for the desert by pointing out such things as how it wasn't the most challenging part of the trip, the weather wasn't that bad that time of the year, and how relatively few of the travelers actually died within the confines of Death Valley. If I were part of a Death Valley Society, I would speak in praise of this book. However, I preferred more of an overview.After reading this perspective of Death Valley in 1849, I looked up Manly's account on Amazon.com and discovered that it is now out in paperback. Thank you John Southworth for a nice enough book with a series of interesting appendices. I believe I'm ready for the real thing now."},{"Title":"The liberty of obedience;: Some thoughts on Christian conduct and service","review":"This is a book about maturity - and about the strange chains which bind any Christian, and prevent his achieving maturity as a person.There seems to be a crossroad - a sort of turning point - when the Christian may decide to play it safe and remain in subservience to manmade custom, or when he may decide to trust God fully, and exert a new kind of courage...to believe that God must interpret His word to His people.If we decide to go on to maturity Mrs. Elliot says \\"We may find ourselves on the wrong side of some man-made fences, but this is a part of the risk of following him without reservation, of doing the truth, and of unconditionally committing our case to God\\".Elisabeth Elliot realized all this when she lived for a silent year with the Auca Indians. During this year when silence, the consequence of lack of knowledge of the language, allowed her to think deeply about the meaning of commitment to Christ, she realized that she must commit a grave error if she merely superimposed onto this primitive culture her Stateside ideas of good and evil.She began to realize that the Christian who has all the answers, the Christian who sees things as all black or all white, just might possibly be the Christian who is so rigid in his obedience, who is permanently bound to a perpetual immaturity."},{"Title":"The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder","review":"I was curious to see if anyone had read and reviewed &quot;The Social Contract&quot;.

There is not one scrap of biographical information in this book.Instead, the book is bland collection of generic praise for Lennon from various musicians and other celebrities (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are glaringly absent). The majority of the entries, many from celebrities such as Bono and Carly Simon, follow a predictable pattern in which the contributor notes Lennon's sharp wit, remembers a small personal kindness and sadly suggests that we could sure use a man like him today. Some have never even met the man, like Nils Lofgren. Some of the recollections have been cut-and-pasted from old interviews, like Elton John's, giving the book a trashy, opportunistic feel. I was dismayed to see Elliot Mintz was included in this book because of his cruel criticism of May Pang - or perhaps that's why he IS included.A lot of the praise for Lennon is devoted his solo hit \\"Imagine.\\" I agree that \\"Imagine\\" was a great song, but Lennon wrote others, didn't he? I assume that Beatles' masterpieces like \\"A Day in the Life,\\" \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" \\"Nowhere Man\\" and others were deemed off-limits for some reason.I admit that I am a Lennon memorabilia collector and I put this book on my wish list before it was even published.

[I have to add at this point that I didn't have any preconceived idea of her. I was given a copy of this book and got my input from that. That inspired me to read more Beatles biographies later.]This was a project so self-serving, so shameless, that it was really quite funny. It gets three stars for entertainment alone, and I think the production process for this book went something like this:[Alicia Keyes and Tori Amos are having lunch at a tea shop in Manhatten.

I'm sure you know me but have been too polite to violate my privacy.Tori: Huh?Alicia: YOKO-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Yoko: I am compiling a book of memories of my late husband, John, whose contribution to art was recognizing mine. Would you like to participate?Tori: But I never met the guy.Yoko: That is immaterial. This is art; what matters is the impression. Write you impressions of me--I mean him, and you can be in a book.Alicia: Wow!![at the next table, a man and his wife have been eavesdropping.]Man: I think the way John treated his first wife is appalling, but has some absurdist potential. Can I write about that?Yoko: [hissing] YOUR input is not necessary, Mr. Woody Allen!Bianca Jagger [at next table] Guess you don't want mine, either.Alicia: I can be in a book! I can be in a book!"},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"Memories Of John Lennon, \\"edited\\" and introduced by Yoko Ono. I put that word in quotes because I'm skeptical that this book was edited at all.A real editor might have reminded contributor and onetime activist Tariq Ali that \\"Revolution\\" was a single, not an album.Ali also writes of the day Lennon died:\\"I think the tribute [John] would have loved was the spontaneous grief in Moscow as kids rushed to the Lenin hills and sang \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\"Yes, if I were John Lennon, I'd love it if people grieved for me by singing a Paul McCartney song, too.Ali shares pride-of-place for ignorance with of all people, Ray Charles, who makes a similar mistake about \\"Yesterday.\\"The book as a whole overflows with gushing, largely unearned sentiment. If it was just another one of those things it would be bad enough but it's also absolute psychic head for Yoko.Person after person: Yoko was the love of John's life; as an artist, Yoko was 30 years ahead of her time; the only possible reason one can be critical of Yoko is if one is racist or sexist or probably both.I'm not saying some of it isn't true. I'm not one of those people who thinks Yoko was the devil (it's just that she couldn't sing). I'm saying it's unseemly for someone to include all that stuff about themselves in a book.When they're not scubbing clean The Perfect Story of John and Yoko, the contributors are rewriting their own personal history as well. Or staking their claims to their own part of The Lennon Story.Jann Wenner tells (again) the story of putting Lennon on the cover of the first Rolling Stone and conducting his lengthy interview with John. What he omits is that Lennon was furious with Wenner when the interview was published as a book against his express wishes.Donovan's piece turns out to be about how, as he remembers it, he taught Lennon to finger-pick...and suggested the design for \\"The White Album.\\"It gets two stars because there are one or two nice things. But for the most part this is more of the revionist, there-is-nothing-nasty-in-John's-life deification of the man that has forced me to the following position:Never trust anyone who says their favorite John Lennon song is \\"Imagine.\\" They're drippy people."},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"I bought this book with happy anticipation. It seemed like a good idea: a collection of essays by different people, remembering John, published 25 years after his untimely death. I had seen a similar collection of statements many years ago, soon after John died, and that one was moving. But I overlooked one important thing: this book was edited by Yoko Ono.Why the 2 star rating? The book itself is good quality and has a few nice pictures. And some of the essays are nice such as the ones by Mick Jagger and Elliot Mintz. However too much of the material is of poor quality for different reasons.The book smacks of one of Yoko's popularist art projects. It appears as if she invited a bunch of people, some who never met John and who probably know little about him, to send in an essay so they can get their name in print. An essay by Alicia Keyes is nice, but she didn't know the man. How could she have a memory of John? As a result, several essays repeat the same unimaginative theme: we liked John because he wrote Imagine. We never met him but we like the song because he sang about brotherhood and peace.Other essays are so short as to be meaningless. Some contributors sent in amateur drawings or poetry. This may be fine for an elementary school project where a teacher tells her 7 year old students \\"write a poem or do a drawing about John Lennon\\" but, to me, this is not worthy of a hardcovered book obstensibly published to honor John Lennon.Another problem with this book is the same problem mentioned by critics of the Lennon Broadway show: the Yoko-fication of the Lennon legacy. While many of the essays address John alone or John as a Beatle, I could not help but notice that many of the essays not only discuss John, but practically deify Yoko. We learn from these essays that Yoko was the love of John's life; that she was a talented artist; that her genius wasn't appreciated years ago, but that Yoko was 30 years ahead of her time; that people did not appreciate Yoko because she married a Beatle; that Yoko did NOT break up the Beatles; that Yoko had a tremendous positive influence on John, etc. Did I mention that Yoko was the editor, and thus had a say in which essays were chosen for publication and which were not? It seems obvious that the \\"deification of Yoko\\" was a factor in choosing certain essays.While I enjoyed the contribution by Elliot Mintz, he goes into great detail about The Lost Weekend, and mentions different people John saw and places John visited. But not one mention of May Pang. No, just like in the Lennon Broadway show, May does not and did not exist. Did I mention that Yoko was the editor of this book?Many different people made contributions to this book, but oddly there is no memory of John essay by Julian, Sean or Yoko herself. One would like to think that John's second wife and sons would have something special to say for this 25th anniversary offering. Not one word.And just in case you've forgotten who the brilliant editor was of this masterpiece, Yoko is mentioned on the front cover, the back flap, wrote an introduction, and has a full paragraph in the back of the book describing her \\"accomplishments\\" as a musician and artist.My suggestion? If you are a fan of Yoko Ono, you will appreciate this book. If you are a Lennon or Beatle fan, you may wish to take it out of your public libary or buy a second hand copy at a discount, but otherwise, skip it."},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"Don't waste your money-this is the least interesting book I have ever read.

Too bad, it could have been great."},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"There is nothing of interest in this book.

Many of them are generic praise from people who never even met the man, really stretching the idea of \\"memories of John Lennon.\\" And a couple of the worst of these essays just stretch on for what feels like an eternity.However, there are some interesting ones sprinkled throughout that justified the purchase for me. The piece by Klaus Voorman was the definite highlight for me; he shares some firsthand memories of the \\"househusband\\" period which has largely remained shrouded in speculation, and shares some great drawings of John."},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"I think it's all very nice to have all these contributors telling us something of their relationship to John Lennon, occasionally something we didn't know before. But what's missing from this picture?What's missing makes for a gigantic gap in the record. And it's a gap only Yoko can fill--with a full-length memoir of the years she and John spent together as lovers, as artists, as parents.... If Yoko is disinclined to write this kind of thing, she should simply hire an editor--a \\"with\\"--to sit down with her and take her back through the years with hundreds of probing questions.Yoko was John's main inspiration for those dozen years, longer than for the Beatles years that preceded Yoko. Listen to John's late Beatles and solo output. Absent Yoko there might not be much at all.A memoir of John Lennon by Yoko would likely be a transAtlantic bestseller. To write it would be a great service to Beatles, Lennon and Yoko fans alike. To die with it still unwritten would be a tremendous DISS-ervice to everyone, including John.How is it even possible that Yoko could think it unnecessary to write this? I don't get it. Granted her own recording work in recent decades has often been excellent. But surely she could make time, and do the right thing by John. Which is to tell the whole truth, warts and all.Yoko is already in her late-70s. She'd better start firing up those \`late 1960s through 1980' memories before they fade to black.What we need is \`John Lennon: a Memoir' by Yoko Ono. The present volume has its merits but is totally inadequate by way of substitute."},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"Like any bottom-sucker, Yoko continues to feed off the legacy of a deeply troubled, yet brilliant, man.

So much vitriol, that it gives one a hint of the type of ugliness that John & Yoko had to deal with simply because they were together. Regardless, this is simply an essential book about John Lennon, providing many candid insights of people who were fortunate to have personal interactions with a man who was an undisputed titan of the 20th century.Thank you so much for compiling this book Yoko. John was fortunate to have found you, his soulmate, during his lifetime. God bless you."},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"Rather than a biography in the traditional sense, this is rather a book of memories from the early sixties right up to and after John Lennon's tragic death.Instead of memories from the individual himself as one would expect, it is a collection of thoughts and anecdotes from almost eighty people, all of whom have something of insight and value to say about John.The introduction by Yoko Ono is moving and informative, giving a glimpse into her attitude towards the memory of her late husband, and also her desire to keep his remembrance as dignified as possible.Each small section dedicated to the writings and pictures of various people give the reader a more extensive layered impression of John Lennon that you would at first think. Far from being superficial, it reveals a far more playful, warm-hearted, considerate and thoughtful individual than one would ever imagine, given his well-known public personae.Each short chapter tells us how deeply he moved people, which in turn is touching by itself.The short contributions from Yoko Ono Lennon reveal the depth of loss, and also to a certain extent, the depth of love she still feels.This was one of the most genuinely affecting reads I've had, speaking purely as an admirer of John Lennon, the man, and also the way he chose to lead his life.This is a book I shall treasure, as despite the bittersweet feelings it conjures up, it is also one of the most uplifting reads. It evokes memories of ideals mostly of days gone by, but also gives a feeling of hope that one associates with the time of The Beatles, and also with John Lennon himself. If anything, that is the legacy of John Lennon.Armchair Interviews says: All in all Memories of John Lennon is a truly moving read.Fr"},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"You might think that after reading 73 intimate descriptions of a man, you'd know him better. The outer person would be stripped away, the inner man revealed. In the case of this carefully sculpted compendium about the outrageously and justifiably famous John Lennon, you'll be left with your cherished memories and your carefully guarded biases intact. But you'll have a good read for your money.John Lennon was a musical and lyrical genius who had the great fortune of colliding with the one other of his own kind on Planet Earth, the lordly Paul McCartney. In their musical prime as half of the Beatles, they synthesized a sound that is classic and unforgettable, tunes and word poems that have already happily survived into another century.Many of the people who write about Lennon in this collection are unsparing in their praise and positive in their comments. Pete Townshend, arguably as grand an old man as Lennon might have become, calls him \\"a genius touched by some revelation.\\" Billy Preston noted that \\"he had the great gift to teach, and he was most generous with it.\\" Music historian Philip Norman notes, \\"he's become a secular saint, which of course he would have thought hilarious.\\"Some of the \\"memories\\" come from people with questionable Lennonesque qualifications. Why, for instance, must we endure a one-sentence offering from Norman Mailer that could have been written by almost anyone? Some of the submissions, embarrassingly, are from sycophantic fellow travelers anxious to demonstrate that they taught the great man something, or that he adulated their accomplishments. Jerry Lee Lewis recounts that Lennon kissed his boots and murmured, \\"Thanks, Killer, for showing me rock 'n' roll.\\" While possibly true, the anecdote seems to belong somewhere else.The most nitty gritty recollections come, not surprisingly, from those whose persona rarely made it to the front pages, but who worked with Lennon over a long period, like media advisor Elliot Mintz, who accompanied John through \\"the lost weekend\\" on the West Coast when he and Yoko had broken up temporarily. (Mintz, it should be noted, has a slightly different version of the Jerry Lee Lewis boot story.) He was close to both Lennon and Ono, and concludes, \\"You can't get a handle on Lennon.\\"The photographs offer as much enlightenment as the text. Whether the photographer was Julie Gold, Bob Gruen or Annie Liebovitz, the images tell a consistent story. Lennon had a strong sensitive face, a penchant for macho gear, and he and Yoko looked like identical twins, often snapped wearing the same glasses, similar (or no) clothes, or having mocked up the same hairstyle (perhaps some of these were Yoko's artistic conceits). Looking at Lennon, and recalling that he died at a time when most professional people are just hitting their stride, it's difficult not to feel a tug of sadness for having missed what might have come after his pointless assassination.Yoko's central contribution to the book is a story about what it felt like to be unpopular when she and John were together, cementing the general impression that she was disliked for causing the breakup of the Beatles and that this negativity bled over into chic New York society and went on pinching long after the celebrated Beatle divorce.Absent from the proceedings are words from those former cut-ups, Paul and Ringo, though they are mentioned in passing by observers of John's rollicking ride through life.There's no need recommending this book. Those of you who are hooked on the Beatles, who have your favorite Lennon songs (\\"Imagine\\" being the one referenced most often in this tome), and who won't let the sweet dream die, will rush to buy it. And there are plenty of you out there.Elliot Mintz put it nicely: \\"I was blessed to have spent the time with him I did and wish you could have done the same. But if the truth be told, you were never that far away.\\"--- Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott"},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"Being a big fan, I have read many books about John and The Beatles. This book really shows you who he really was, with private memories of him. The book is composed of people who have had experiences with John or just were admiring fans. John changed so much. And he changed so many lives.I could barely put this book down. It made me laugh and cry. It is a book to be treasured."},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"Despite some obvious exclusions, this collection of remembrances by friends, collaborators, and fans of John Lennon is solid. Elliot Mintz, longtime confidant of the Lennons, provides the best chapter. His inside knowledge, friendship, and skillful writing hint perhaps at a longer memoir (I hope so). Photographer Bob Gruen's chapter is another highlight, and the photos he contributed are a good touch. Throughout the book are little unexpected nuggets, like the one provided by session drummer Andy Newmark, who worked on the \\"Double Fantasy\\" album. He provides a glimpse into the atmosphere of the recording of the Grammy-winning album, and how John took the reins in the studio and got exactly what he envisioned. I rated this book 4 stars and not 5 for what was missing: memories from Paul, Ringo, George Martin, Julian, and Sean. Would have been nice.Thanks, Yoko, for putting together this book!"},{"Title":"Memories of John Lennon","review":"I'm just astounded by most of the other reviews I saw on here. Are they all members of a conspiracy to bring down Yoko Ono? I would NOT like to meet any of those people in person.This is one of the best books I've ever read. I'm 3/4's of the way done with it, and it has changed me. I cried my eyes out, I laughed, and I learned so much about John and even about life. Not every entry is spectacular, but many of them are, including Julie Gold's, which moved me and my husband to tears. (Someone criticized her in another review.) I suppose if you're a complete cynic and are convinced that Yoko is the devil, you'll be too prejudiced to see what this book really has to offer, which is this: As much as I thought I already knew and understood John and Yoko, I now REALLY understand, as if I'd spent a week with them. John was an outstanding person and artist with no ego. Yoko is an artist with an out-of-this-world whimsical and spiritual viewpoint, and out of the hundreds of women he met, he chose her to be his woman and his teacher. He was not controlled by her. If you think Lennon could be controlled by ANYONE, you don't know the first thing about him. He was his own man more than just about anyone, and he chose and cherished her. They have a connection way beyond this life, and it is this book which FINALLY explains it, if you read it with an open heart. It has honestly changed my life, and I feel dreadfully sorry for those too solid (as in not light and free) and jaded to be able to experience something as pure and truthful and honest and beautiful as this jewel. I thank Yoko from the bottom of my heart.By the way, I'm no goody-goody. I can confront evil, and I know bad literature when I read it. This is goodness and brilliance.

The twelve chapters are really short stories skillfully woven together into a primer on the evils of war. The voices of children from all sides of the war speak through Leah Curtin, trying to explain what happened to them and how they survived with their spirits intact despite the dark brutality of war. Mixing tragedy and triumph, hope and despair, Curtin draws the reader into each child's world. The confusion of sudden flight, panic of separation, terror of capture and the horror of slaughter intermingle with the sweet, exhausting relief of survival throughout this too brief novel.

Ultimately, Sunflowers In The Sand is a testament to the endurance and resilience of these children who survived the loss of home, family, and their own childhood -- all sacrificed on the altar of war created by political and military leaders in the name philosophies, ideologies, and ethnic hatreds.

The rape of women in Croatia during the course of the conflict has been extensively documented and made public.Less well known is the sexual savagery directed toward infants, and the brutal torture to which the old were subjected. I hesitate to repeat one child's account of what he witnessed in a church: elderly people tied to pews, begging to be killed, while soldiers cut out their eyes and forced these innocent people to swallow them.How does one ever forgive such atrocities? Ms. Curtin - a nurse and widely published health ethicist - offers no simple, unrealistic answer. It may not be possible, at least not in these children's lifetimes.How do children heal then? How do they overcome the impulse to hate not only the soldiers who did these things, but their own neighbors who may carry the burden of the enemy's ethnic identity?One of the many virtues of Ms. Curtin's book is her insistent answer: the inner, creative life of the children and the need for adults to honor it, to learn from it, to be changed by it.Just as war is the enemy of art, so art is the antidote for war.

Drawn in the form of a pastiche, it is impossible to separate the head in the drawing from the bombed landscape surrounding it. The boy's eyes are not the eyes of a child, but of one who has been forced to grow up too fast.A boy named Hrovje, whose skull had been badly damaged by a grenade while he was rocked to sleep by his grandmother, has had his story juxtaposed with another child's portrait of a woman holding an infant. The anguished face of the woman is reminiscent of the haunted faces painted by the Norwegian expressionist Edvard Munch.Some of the stories and illustrations leave a lighter, almost whimsical impression. Kristina dreams of being a dancer in Hawaii and hopes that one day she will appear on the American TV program Hawaii Five O. She seems to be perfectly represented in a drawing made by another child recuperating in intensive care at the hospital in Zadar. A hula dancer with a bright red dress and bouffant hairdo seems a long way from these children's scarred childhoods.The most haunting images are perhaps the ones of hearts. In one heart colored orange, there are teeth within the heart and a world outside it where a child is raising her arms to a sky without bombs.

The uniform ed)","review":"After reading this tale about a young man who lost his honour, and who spends the rest of his life trying to reclaim that honour, I felt sad. This is a sad story about a man that we know only as Jim. Jim committed an act of cowardice when he was a mate on a ship. He was only nineteen years of age, and he made a decision to abandon what he thought was a sinking ship and he leaves about 800 passengers to face their fate alone. He can never forgive himself for this, and he personally exiles himself from his own family back in England. This may sound a bit melodramatic, but the book is not. It is beautifully written, rich, evocative and compelling. We see the type of man that Jim becomes as he's trying to get over this big mistake. He appears to be a strong and decisive man but we the readers get glimpses of the chinks in his armour. Until his final ignominious fall - What a waste of a man's life, and what a great story!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Of all the great novelists and writers of English, Joseph Conrad was one of the most pessimistic. His view of human nature was not encouraging or, to use modern jargon, \\"life affirming.\\" Like Shakespeare, he always sought to look under the mask, to remove the polite smile of civilization and expose the red, toothy maw beneath. He often sent his characters into the \\"interior;\\" a jungle always described as a black-green hell, hot and dripping, where man was free to release the bloody and awful God within.\\"Lord Jim\\" follows this pattern to an extent, although in this novel, the character struggles to be honorable and kind. In a nutshell, an English officer - young, handsome and noble - is terribly disgraced and struggles to restore his honor. The storyteller in the novel, Marlowe, is the same character Conrad used to tell \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" It is the relationship between Marlowe and Jim, the young officer, which provides the most fascinating element in the work.Marlowe meets Jim during the latter's military hearing, where Jim is desperate to tell someone the story of his disgrace. Marlowe, a merchant captain coincidentally in port, reluctantly hears him out. This event establishes a deep, psychological bond between the two men that courses through the book. It is through this relationship that Conrad explores some of the fundamental assumptions of human nature: Is man, basically, good and honorable? Is there even such a thing as honor or \\"good,\\" or is every belief we cherish about ourselves a thin chimera, shredded easily by the base nature within?Certainly there are few \\"honorable\\" characters in \\"Lord Jim.\\" One of the great treats of the book is the flotsam of humanity that Conrad skillfully parades before the reader. Take, as an example, the merchant Chester, one of many who offer Jim extremely dubious work once he is in disgrace (in this case overseer of an island that produces tons of bat guano, which has great commercial value) or Chester's right hand man, Captain \\"Holly Terror\\" Robinson, described thusly:\\"The Notorious Robinson. The man who smuggled more opium and bagged more seals in his time than any loose Johnny now alive. They say he used to board the sealing -schooners up Alaska way then the fog was so thick that the Lord God, He alone, could tell one man from another. Holy-Terror Robinson. That's the man. He is with me on this guano thing.\\" He put his lips to my ear. \\"Cannibal? -Well, they used to give him the name years and years ago.\\"Yet, there remains something that makes Marlowe care about Jim, something he is at pains to understand himself. The fascinating thing is that most of the time Marlowe is nearly repulsed or irritated by Jim, made squeamish about shaking his hand, or will cross a street to avoid him. There is a quality in Jim's disgrace that dims Marlowe's own cherished memories of youth and high adventure. Yet, as Marlowe says repeatedly, Jim \\"was one of us.\\" This phrase changes, bit by bit, in the course of the novel. At first it means, primarily, white, English, and of a certain class. As the novel progresses, the phrase begins to take on a much broader meaning, touching something fundamental in all living men.As Marlowe puts it in describing Jim: \\"Woe to the stragglers! We exist only in so far as we hang together. He had straggled in a way; he had not hung on; but he was aware of it with an intensity that made him touching, just as a man's more intense life makes his death more touching than the death of a tree. I happened to be handy, and I happened to be touched. That's all there is to it.\\"Again, like Shakespeare, nothing is obvious and much is open to interpretation. Does Jim succeed in regaining his honor, there in a remote jungle? Did he fail? Or, perhaps, was he aiming his shot at a romantic tendril of air, never really there at all. If you read this great work, you will have the pleasure of deciding for yourself. ---- Mykal Banta"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

Lord Jim the character is very appealing but also appealing are the sea and island settings that Conrad describes so well. Those hard to resist settings as well as the tale itself populated by a host of memorable minor characters all conspire to make this an irresistable yarn. It appeals as an adventure but there is plenty to capture the discerning substantive mind as well. Conrad offers a tale about a young man who wishes to be a hero.(...)"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Conrad was 43 when he wrote this novel, number 4 on the official &quot;A&quot;-List of the Fireside Reading Club. A wonderful book. Very hard to read, requiring great concentration and continuous rereading of certain pages until things become clear. He writes in a very strange manner, with tales within tales, and continually giving the results of actions before we know what the actions are, so that we are forever mistakenly under the impression we've missed something. Nevertheless, a great, solemn and wonderful book with a nicely ambiguous ending. For instance, what would Jim have done if Doramin had turned down the chance to shoot him?It would appear he would have &quot;jumped&quot; once more, starting the chain of self-loathing and guilt all over again, though presumably in not as extreme a manner this time. It's a great novel about guilt, innocence and betrayal, and how betrayal and guilt become easier to handle with time, and innocence can create the breeding ground for both. This of course is a great simplification. Glad I decided to take a break and watch the film version of Lord Jim half way through reading the book, for although the film is not all that faithful to the book, the young Peter O'Toole is absolutely perfect as Jim. I gave a friend a brief synopsis of Lord Jim and she said it sounded like The Red Badge of Courage (which I haven't read, and, since it misses being twentieth century by five years, I probably never will). There appears to be a Dickens connection or two in Lord Jim - Cornelius is very much drawn after Uriah Heep in David Copperfield, and Conrad's habit of breaking up dialogue with dashes is very Dickensian, as well as being highly unnatural. There is also a lot of Buddhism in Conrad, but then again there is in most great novelists, and sometimes even the not-so-great."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"A story of glimpses and rumours, a flight from a shamed past, and the redemption of a brave present. This tale captures the spirit of an age when reputation meant evrything to a man, when the taint of cowardice or failed duty would drive men to the ends of the earth, to hide, or perhaps, to find themselves. Lord Jim follows the advantures of one such man across the far-flung Islands of the Pacific and Indian Ocean. The story conveys the grief of mistakenly following the herd, the despair of recognition of a guilty secret, and the hope of a new life. Conrad manages to convey the reader from the smokey verandahs of tropical colonies where a jaded traveller recounts a story of an almost legendary fugitive, to the sun bleached sands of heavily wooded tropical Islands, where the fugitive must at last face up to the challenge of men who feel no shame. Is the outcome a victory, a chance of redemption, or the passing of a sentence? The prose of Conrad contains classic descriptions, such as &quot;The night came down like a bendiction&quot; to describe the plight of a floundering ship in the blistering heat of the seas near Arabia. The narative crawls with characters of utter evil who are drawn to, and seem to feed from the basic goodness of a man who has lost his way in the world"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

Based in part on an actual event at sea, Jim's moment of truth comes when a ship on which he is a first mate begins taking on water and he believes its fate is sealed. Tragically, he abandons ship on a lifeboat along with the rest of the crew, not alerting the passengers going to Haj.This lengthy yarn is verbally told to an audience (we can assume) through the eyes of Marlow, so we never really know what's going through Jim's mind, although we can well imagine.I was captivated by the story in my youth, and reading it now as an aging adult I can appreciate the romantic notions held by Jim, and to which I once ascribed. Jim redeems himself in a remote jungle village somewhere in Indonesia, where he is called Lord Jim by the locals.Joseph Conrad, who was Polish but lived in Britain, wrote with a flourishing style that was entirely British -- long complex sentences that both captivate the imagination and require attention to detail.

The uniform ed)","review":"Lord Jim is a masterpiece, encompassing almost all that Conrad has ever written. Jim is a young seaman with an exagerated feeling for his own romantic courage. Yet this courage abandons him in the moment he can prove himself, when he and his fellow officer abandon a passanger ship on the sly, believing that it will sink. Yet the ship is rescued and Jim put to trial. His fellow officers all slink away rather than stand trial, while he is stripped of his rank.He tries to flee his own notority, but in vain. Wherever he goes, soon somebody will arrive who knows him and that unfortunate incident. Until finally he escapes to a small Malayan kingdom, where no-one knows him. He becomes the benevolent de-facto ruler of the place. Until one day he commits an error of judgement. This time he faces the consequences of his error. Thus he dies.Conrad leaves no doubt that Jim dies in vain, yet in peace with himself. Conrad does not deliver a final judgement on whether Jims romantic ideals are misguided or not. The book all in all is a great lamento for the lost age of romanticism. Thus the narrator Marlow does not hide his liking of the young man and his romantic desires, yet he does not shy away from also showing the loss and desolation Jim inflicts on others by his decision for sacrifice his life for his honour.The reader is left with these conflicting emotions, there is no clean resolution to the book. And this is what makes it great.Unlike others, I did not find this book to long or to dense. Rather the long descriptive passages give the book this slow pace which is so essential to the unfolding of this narrative.Read this book and you will see the world with other eyes."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery, cowardice,guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities.The narrative can be a bit confusing at times as Marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with Jim. The book reminded very much of Somerset Maugham's THE RAZOR&quot;S EDGE&quot; in style. However I believe that Maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story. Overall LORD JIM is a wonderful classic novel that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

Stick to Heart of Darkness, which contains many of the same themes and literary merit, without what to high school students is over the top \\"wordiness.\\" Lord Jim should be enjoyed at the individual's chosen time and pace."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"That title is a knock-off of Ishmael's description of Captain Ahab in Melville's Moby Dick. My guess is that Joseph Conrad never read Moby Dick. His writing career unfolded during the decades before the rediscovery of Melville. I have no doubt that Conrad would have burst with appreciation if he'd encountered the other \\"greatest\\" writer of sea tales in English or any language. Lord Jim begins to remind me of Moby Dick in chapter four, when the straightforward 3rd person narrative suddenly shifts to Conrad's typically indirect narration in the first person voice of Captain Marlow. Thereafter, Jim's whole adventure is embedded in Marlow's rambling discourse, to the utter despair of high school sophomores and middle-age armchair travelers who \\"just want the story, ma'm.\\"So who is Marlow? Is he just a convenient mask for Conrad? Why is so much text devoted to Marlow's musing about his own \\"peripheral\\" role in the story and his own unresolved understanding of Jim? Does \\"Jim\\" really exist, outside of Marlow's penchant for entertaining friends with bizarre anecdotes? (The last few chapters, cast as a letter from Marlow to a friend, would seem to be intended to 'document' the truth of the tale.) Dear reader, you've better notice that Jim is remarkably inarticulate in Marlow's account; when he speaks, he almost never finishes a sentence, never establishes a discourse on his own terms. The Jim we get to know is as much a projection of Marlow's ego as Jesus of Nazareth was of the Apostle Paul's. And then, of course, we still have to wonder about the invisible author behind the so-obtrusive narrator.What I'm arguing here is that the novel Lord Jim is about as much about the title character as Moby Dick is about the whale. Ahab's quest for ineffable vengeance by death is almost exactly parallel to Jim's quest for redemption by death. Both are ripping good adventure tales that COULD be told in eighty-page novellas or made into films from which the narrative voices are stripped and scattered on the floor of the editing studio. But just as the main character in Moby Dick is Ishmael, Marlow is the heart of obscurity in Lord Jim. To really relish either book, the reader has to take the narrator's epiphanies seriously.Are we on any kind of solid ground in saying that Melville's novel is about a socially orphaned Ishmael projecting his need for a father Ahab? Shall we then risk the notion that Conrad's novel is about a psychologically impotent Marlow projecting his need for a son on Tuan Jim? Hey, reader! If you steal my notion and write a grad seminar paper with it, don't forget to vote \\"helpful\\" on my review!This is an absurdly great novel, a book to read thoughtfully with mounting involvement until you can't attend to anything else before finishing it, a book to read again and again as your life changes perspective on itself. If you have doubts about Conrad's mastery of the English language, listen to this description:\\"... we watched the moon float away above the chasm between the hills like an ascending spirit out of a grave; its sheen descended, cold and pale, like the ghost of dead sunlight. There is something haunting in the light of the moon... It is to our sunshine, which -- say what you like -- is all we have to live by, what the echo is to the sound: misleading and confusing whether the note by mocking or sad.\\" That extended metaphor, to my mind, sets up perfectly the mood and the narrative thrust of Marlow's first long 'confessional' conversation with the disgraced sailor Jim, in which self-mockery and sadness afflict both parties.I'd forgotten, or never realized, how deep this novel is, since I first read it perhaps twenty years ago. I hope I can come upon it with the same freshness and astonishment when I read it again, perhaps twenty years from now."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Everything in this book accords to its content and very message. Joseph Conrad's style, his sentence structure keeps in perfect beat with the events of the narrative. Despite contrary opinions, I hold that the lengthy sentences were the only way to deliver to the reader the full impact of what kind of man Jim was like; Conrad exposes every thought of the man and the emotion haunting it with terrfic and horrifying truth. This book stirred and inspired the romantic side of me, and devestated me whenever I was forced to realize that it was all hopless dreaming in the end. Above all, however, the very sense of honour (a virtue seemingly forgotten in today's culture, or perhaps only in America) in Jim gave me a universal truth and direction; this story of a man that is the truest of them all to himself is the most thought- invoking book I've ever read.To all who are thinking of picking this book up- It is a rich and orientaled lilac egg, with a treasure of meat inside that can only be described as ambrosia to the last great men. It is a voyage on the mysterious and endless sea of black waters; and once the voyage has been finished, the truth of men will be held- if you're ready."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"&quot;Lord Jim&quot; marks the beginning of the modern era of the novel. It breaks away from the linear storytelling mode of the Victorian era and instead shifts back and forth in time, gradually pulling together pieces of the story from different points of view that ultimately form an understanding, but never a clear rendering of &quot;the truth,&quot; which remains elusive and for the reader to discern. It is a deeply psychological novel. The protagonist, who is known to us only as &quot;Jim,&quot; the first mate of a ship in the British merchant marine, struggles with his ultimate decision to abandon, with the rest of the white crew, a seemingly sinking ship, the Patna, which is full of Muslim pilgrims. The ship does not sink after all, and Jim must live with his fateful and enduring decision to &quot;jump&quot; from the Patna.The problem is that Jim does not live with it and reconcile himself to the choice to which he committed; instead, he continues to run away every time his past threatens to catch up with him. Finally, he finds the opportunity to redeem himself, seemingly, on a remote island. But even there, although he can escape gossipy tales of the Patna, he cannot escape himself, and therein he finally meets his resolution.We learn about Jim through the eyes of a fellow sailor, Marlow, who is the narrator of &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; published the year before. Marlow is obsessed with Jim, and it is equally intriguing to probe and to attempt to understand Marlow's fascination as it is to attempt to understand Jim himself.&quot;Lord Jim&quot; is a deeply disconcerting novel that, again departing from the Victorian narrative, doesn't tie up all the ends neatly for us at the end and present a satisfying resolution. It's a haunting story whose questions will linger long after you've finished reading it."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

The uniform ed)","review":"Published in 1900, this story by British contemporary of Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, is a little hard to read. It is &quot;Literature&quot; (though opinion is divided as to its value) because there is much more going on that just a series of events. Like the Stallone movie &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, the central character is traumatized by an incident when he lost his nerve and abandoned ship. An assignment many guilt-ridden years later gives Jim a chance to redeem himself.There are several factors that make this famous novel hard to read: the old-fashioned morals (white man superiority, social acceptability, duty), descriptions of &quot;the mysterious East&quot;, and the use of a narrator (Marlow, no, not the Humphrey Bogart character). At first I found it hard to take Jim's guilt-tripping seriously. The narrator, Marlow, is telling the story to a group of friends at a house one evening after dinner. Although these friends do not figure in the story, we see the glow of their cigars in the dark, and they act as foils for Marlow's narrative: he has to not only tell them the story but also explain how he felt about Jim and why he decided to try and help him. They in turn, together with other characters Marlow meets, comment on Jim. Using Marlow as a narrator also helps to delay the reader's discovery of what actually happened on board the &quot;Patna&quot;. At the end, even the physical Marlow fades away, and the final details of what actually happened to Jim are given in a letter from Marlow to a &quot;privileged reader&quot;, and are made up of what Marlow gleaned from a number of different sources, including the girl Jewel and Jim's manservant/bodyguard Tamb' Itam. The long drawn-out descriptions and the indirect narration allows the reader to ponder what is going on in Jim's mind, and in Marlow's. Although a modern reader will not agree or even understand what Jim did, the mysteries within the human heart remain as fascinating and as unfathomable as ever. How will we act in an emergency: stick to our duty, or save ourselves? And how would we deal with the feelings of guilt or inadequacy? Jim firmly believes that he would do his duty, and never comes to terms with the fact that he saved himself.All this makes for a challenging read. This story reminded me of Kipling's descriptions of &quot;the far-flung corners of Empire&quot;, of Somerset Maugham's stories of the Far East (especially &quot;Before the Party&quot;, a traumatic incident recalled), and of Flaubert's &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, that ironic description of a life ruined by the romantic ideals of the day."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Honour, like virtue, or like reputation, is more easily lost than regained. Such is the premise of Lord Jim. Conrad himself half-admits in his cover note that this is probably his best novel. For more than an absorbing tale of guilt, love, and adventure, it is also a book that asks big and incisive questions. What is honour? Is there such a thing in life as principle? Or rather can one live without principles and, if not, then what if one has to die for them?Jim is young and idealistic, a talented and unafraid sailor, but he has made an early mistake, a lapse that caused him to abandon ship at the wrong time. Relegated to the fringe of the mariners' community, he drifts into in a lost corner of the Indonesian islands. It is there that he becomes Lord Jim, a pacifier, an arbiter among the local folk, a living legend. The lost province of Patusan, besides, is where he finds romance in the person of the smart, attractive, and spirited half-caste Jewel. Yet as strife re-emerges in the shape of a pirate raid on the town, Jim is soon torn between the defence of his patiently rebuilt self-regard and his love and life's salvation.Lord Jim is told in two parts, both drawing minutely and to striking effect from Conrad's personal experience of the sea and the tropics. First comes the strange and paradoxical shipwreck of the Patna, a transport for Meccan pilgrims on which Jim acts as skipper. Then the book follows Jim in his subsequent drift and his reinvention in Patusan. The story is told by sea captain Charles Marlow, the same narrator Conrad has in Heart of Darkness, here however developed as a character at greater length and to greater effect. Finally, for those worried about political correctness, this is no tale of the white man come to rule over the brown, and Conrad's humanistic credentials only come out reinforced. Lord Jim is required reading for fans of Conrad and, capturing the values of a disappearing world like no other, one of the great novels of the turn of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"The end of the year brings so many lists, and Lord Jim has made its share. It's been touted by Modern Library and Le Monde for being in the \\"TOP 100\\" novels of the century. Reading Lord Jim for the first time, I was struck by how pulpy the experience was.First, the book itself, a vintage early 1970s paperback that is of the size and weight to be sold in racks at a drug store magazine aisle in Topeka, Kansas. The cover shows a fierce looking guy glowering, and next to that is a drawing of men cast adrift at sea- perched precariously acrest a wave.No doubt Lord Jim's classic status is over ascribed to the obvious psychological sophistication and under ascribed to the sheer mass market appeal of Conrad's exotic locations and multiple levels of accessibility. Conrad is like a children's tv show that puts in stuff for grown-ups on the sly.Note that Lord Jim was originally published as a magazine serial, a mode of publication that requires popular audience interest. When you are talking about the reaction of an audience to a specific cultural product, it is best to use the term \\"reception\\" to take into the account that there is a critical and popular response to every cultural product which is published.Lord Jim was published in serial the same year Heart of Darkness was published in book form: quite a one-two punch. If you look at Conrad's Bibliography, it's very much the familiar pattern of an Artist achieving critical success early and popular success late. Certainly, Conrad's catalog is not as well established as a Charles Dickens. I would actually say that Heart of Darkness is really, really the only true, lasting hit, but obviously it's a \\"novella\\" so in some sense it must not \\"count.\\"Heart of Darkness relates to Lord Jim exactly the same way an early 7\\" or EP relates to an LP relates for a musician: The first record demonstrates market potential to the audience, the second record fulfills that potential in the market place.

Although he did spend a fair amount of time brooding (that dosen't give anything away) he had good reson. I think that while the guilt for what he did rests in his mind he does manage to get on with it and regain his life. I worry that readers might not fully consider the complexitys of the narrator, Marlo, who is a facinating character in his own right. So to anyone who has yet to read the novel, I would recommend that you make note of Marlo as more than just a narrator as you pass through.

The uniform ed)","review":"This book came as promised in a very timely fashion. It was in good condition."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Lord Jim is Joseph Conrad's most popular novel and possibly his best, which truly says much. A dark tale of human frailty with profound psychological insight, revolutionary narrative techniques, and sublime prose, it is essential for fans of Conrad and classics generally.The most immediate and lasting feature is probably the dense portrayal of the title character, one of literature's most memorable tragic heroes and most fascinating character studies. What makes him so engrossing is that he in many ways has great potential - he certainly has enough strength and determination to be a successful, even admirable leader - yet somehow embarks on a downward spiral leading to bleak death. He is the essence of Conrad's dark vision - average in many respects and extraordinary in some but burdened with a character flaw that leads to his demise. As in much of Conrad, there is a strong fatalistic streak. Jim never would have thought himself capable of the act that led to his ruin, others would have thought it equally impossible, and he is unable to understand it himself while regretting it bitterly - yet it happened. Conrad's real claim seems to be not that it was fated but that humans are inherently frail and that individual flaws will come out in even the most staunch given the right situation - which only the truly lucky avoid. It is easy to condemn Jim, but Conrad was never one to take an obvious moral route, depicting him with characteristically thought-provoking ambivalence. The narrator cannot deny his act's essential despicableness but sees that Jim still has much worth. One of Conrad's great artistic strengths is that he gives much food for proverbial thought but never sinks to the heavy-handedness so common in many other heavy writers and nearly always fatal. Jim is shown from several angles with astounding verisimilitude and piercing psychological perspicuity, but it is up to us to judge him and all he stands for - if we can. Even the harshest cannot deny his essential humanity, which is what makes him so compelling; loathsome as he conventionally is, we recognize the tempestuous darkness beneath his impressive exterior because we have seen it in ourselves. Conrad made a career out of exposing this darkness, and this is a prime example.The ground-breaking and highly influential narrative structure is nearly as notable. The novel began serializing in 1899 and came out in book form in 1900, which is very appropriate since it is in many senses a bridge between the centuries' literature. Elevated language and a historical background tie it to the nineteenth century, but its techniques are distinctly Modernist. Lord is indeed one of Modernist literature's very first examples, far closer in narrative spirit to its wildly experimental novels than to Conrad's Victorian contemporaries. It is told from various perspectives, primarily via a long story by Marlow, familiar from \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and other Conrad works. Nested dialogue abounds, and there is also narrative in letter form as well as other complex methods. This multi-faceted approach is fascinatingly wide, giving a grand view of the proceedings. It can be hard to follow, especially as it is far from linear, but I strongly encourage anyone struggling to persevere. As nearly always in such cases, it becomes easier, and the threads come together in the end - indeed spectacularly, if catastrophically, so. Conrad's deft handling of these complicated devices is truly admirable - a difficult artistic feat pulled off with rare acumen.The novel is notable for many other reasons, not least its intriguing peek into a world of sea adventures that is now near-unimaginable. The glimpse of Eastern cultures nearly unknown in the West even now is particularly noteworthy, and the ongoing contrasts between East/West, white/non-white, etc. are dramatized vividly and skillfully. Those with historical interest in the era or place will be particularly invigorated, but the sociological value is at least as high. We learn much about how Victorian society - and of course Conrad, though his style as ever makes it dangerous to draw sweeping conclusions - thought of such cultures and vice versa. This aspect of Conrad's fiction initially overshadowed more important ones, but we can now appreciate them in proportion.As always with Conrad, the prose is also of great significance. He is one of English's great prose stylists, which is truly incredible considering that it was his third language. This has some of his most lyrical and sublimely beautiful writing, whether describing exotic landscapes or the darkness at humanity's heart. The prose is indeed so great that it is one of many reasons making this often difficult read worthwhile.Neophytes would be better off starting with Conrad's more accessible short stories or relatively approachable novels like The Secret Agent, but anyone alive to his fiction - or great literature of any kind - must stop here eventually."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"I actually started listening to this as an audio book on a road trip with my family. My wife and son couldn't make it through the first hour since they felt like it took forever to describe the key incident in the story. I continued with the book and found that I eventually got used to this style of writing. From a literary point of view, it is a beautiful and impressive style. Conrad paints a very graphic picture with his metaphors that is almost never used in modern writing. Reading this book was an experience I'm glad that I had, though I'm still not sure this is my favorite style. The narrative format also took some getting used to; the jumping back and forth was effective, but took some concentration.As far as the story goes, it explored the effects of guilt in a man. Great novels help us understand key points of human thought and relationships and this book clearly falls in this category. You find yourself understanding the main failings and actions of the key character. I came away from this book with a reinforced understanding of the need of forgiveness, especially for oneself. Obviously it is easier to tell someone to forgive themselves than it is to actually forgive yourself.Overall I recommend this book for those interested in literature; the use of metaphors is incredible. This book is not for everyone, but is worth it for those wanting to experience Conrad at his finest."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

I loved this book back then, but picked it up just recently, maybe wanting to connect with an old friend. Well, what a ride. I somehow wasn't tuned in back in my teens and 20s to how funny many of \\"Marlowe's\\" insights, narratives and commentaries are. Those and others more serious and poetic will have you saying \\"so true\\" to yourself about Conrad's perceptions of certainly the male half of this world....what a global village he describes, too, back then. And Marlowe's concern for Jim takes on more emotional weight now that I'm reading it some decades on, and have a son of my own. Anyway, might be time to put all the professorial interpretations aside and just enjoy this tale."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Lord Jim turned out to be one of the best novels I have read, and I admit around page 180, for the first time I can remember, I was considering not finishing a novel I had started. The first novel I read by Joseph Conrad was Heart of Darkness, which was narrated by Marlow. Lord Jim is also narrated by Marlow, which was an interesting twist. However, it also made the first 180 pages difficult to follow. Instead of reading a story, a story is being told to the reader. But the book is composed of two parts: Marlow telling us the introduction, and Marlow's letter to one who also heard the story the night Marlow told it. I felt this added something to the novel, making it more thrilling. The last 60-80 pages flew by, the conclusion was exciting, and then it was over. I have read three of Conrad's novels, and I like how he finishes them.What happens. Jim is a sailor who dreams of glory, but falters in his first trial. He spends time trying to avoid his past and eventually finds himself the guardian of a people in remote India. When trouble seeks him again, he makes a decision with horrible consequences. But instead of running from the consequences as he had earlier in his life, he faces them. An amazing novel."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"There is no doubt that Conrad is one of the master writers of the previous century, however I tend to find him rather a chore to read. Not that reading is supposed to be &quot;easy&quot; of course, but that's just by way of a warning. In this novel, he not only embarks on epic page-long sentences, but engages in a whole range of innovative (for the time) techniques for telling the tragic tale of Tuan/Lord Jim. These techniques include abrupt shifts and jumps in time, and a great deal story within a story constructions. The bulk of the story is recounted by a seaman named Marlow (who also was narrator for Heart of Darkness), who is often retelling what he heard from another source, or even third-hand. Some may find this a little confusing at first, but it shouldn't be a surprising device for the modern reader. Technique aside, this is an exceedingly dense work, rich in lengthy descriptions, and requiring the reader's utmost attention.Jim is a well-bred young Englishman who takes to the sea, envisioning a series of adventures in which he will prove his mettle and emerge as a well-regarded man. Alas, when a ship carrying a load of Malay pilgrims to Mecca strikes something and seems destined to sink, and his senior officers all abandon ship without rousing the passengers, he experiences fear and abandons ship as well. But when the ship doesn't sink, Jim is the only crewman to step forward and present himself to the maritime court of inquiry, which strips him of his sailing papers. Thereafter, Jim knocks around the South Seas, working as a water clerk in various ports, and departing whenever someone recognizes him. Finally, the narrator Marlow arranges for Jim to be installed as manager of a remote Malaysian trading post. There, he becomes the ruler and protector of the native people.The story is not really of importance though; really, we are meant to be taking a long and careful look at the character of Jim. Some may find him to be a tragic and romantic figure, however I view him as the embodiment of self-absorption and pride. Jim's vision of himself as a brave and true fellow is so key to his ego that he literally can't face his own past actions, even though they are utterly understandable and human. And far from seeking to prove or redeem himself, he seeks to remove himself from the sight of anyone who might recognize him. His self-imposed exile among the Malays allows him to fulfill his dream of being an respected leader, and allows him to avoid introspection. Indeed, had he been even slightly introspective, he might have eventually recognized that his overwhelming adherence to a code of honor has not served him particularly well. Ironically (or maybe predictably), at the end of it all, his misguided sense of honor brings death to him, and destruction to his people. It's not too hard to figure out what Conrad, who spend several decades on the high seas, thought of this ideal of honor. One character gives voice to Conrad's views, by saying that Jim died for &quot;a shred of meaningless honor&quot;."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Lord Jim was published at the very end of the 19th century, just after Joseph Conrad published one of his other classic books: Heart of Darkness. It's about a man who lives on the sea. As a young man he gets a job aboard the Patna and spends much of his time dreaming about one day becoming a hero. It's on this ship that he gets that opportunity. When the ship collides with the wreckage of another boat in the middle of the night, Jim is sent down to determine the extent of the damage. What he sees leads him to believe that the ship's hull is close to breaching and that the Patna will soon sink. The crew decides to abandon ship and to ensure their survival, decides not to wake the sleeping passengers, leaving them behind to go down with the ship. Jim decides that he is too insignificant a member of the crew to go against their decision, and leaves with them.Unfortunately for Jim, the Patna doesn't sink, and its passengers are rescued by another vessel and the crew of the Patna faces a judicial investigation where Jim becomes the scape goat and is the only one punished for the abandonment. Jim's decision to go along with his crew mates haunts him for the rest of his life and it becomes a defining moment for him. The rest of his life is spent running away from anything that reminds him of his experience on the Patna. Eventually he finds success in a fictional region called Patusan where he becomes a leader among the native inhabitants and ultimately finds a measure of redemption when he gives his life in their defense.Lord Jim is a great story. At times it's a little slow and tends to get confusing at times as the narrator jumps back and forth in time, recounting the history of Jim as he had become aware of it through the reports of people he met throughout his life. But the themes in this book are what I think have elevated it to the ranks of classic English Literature."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Conrad is never an easy read. but this challenging tale of failure and redemption is one of his best. Start with &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; if new to Conrad; then read &#34;Lord Jim.&#34;"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) was of Polish noble heritage though he was born in the Ukraine. He spent many years in the British navy and was a naturalized English citizen. Conrad wrote brilliant English novels and short stories; often thought in French and dreamed in Russian! Conrad is one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature.Lord Jim was published to great success in 1900. The story concerns Jim the scion of an English country parsonwho has taken to the salt water world. Jim is a romantic who dreams of doing great deeds of adventure and heroism.The main narrator of the story is Captain Charles Marlow an old sea dog who first meets Jim when the later is earning a meagre living as a water clerk. Marlow relates the tragic story of Jim to a group of listeners. Jim is serving on an old wreck of a ship \\"The Patna\\" captained by a drunk. One surreal night of placidity is destroyed when the boat hits a submerged obstacle. On board are five crew members and 800 Muslim pilgrims from Malaya. In a moment of cowardice, Jim jumps overboard leaving the passengers to their fate. The Naval Board revokes Jim's license as well as that of the other four members of the crew. The events of the trial are told by a French sea captain who converses with Marlowe. Ironically the Patna and her passengers survive the night being brought to port in safety.Marlowe seeks to help the complex Jim find a job despite his disgrace. The young man leaves one job after another as he travels from one remote and filthy seaport after another in Asis and the Dutch East Indies. Marlowe is most successful placing Jim in a job when Stein the respected owner of a trading post on the remote island of Patusan gives Jim a chance for employment. Stein is a brilliant collector of rare butterflies and an intellectual man of means.When Jim arrives on Patusan he is protected from harm by the use he makes of a ring given him by Stein. Doramin the old island chieftan is a friend of Stein; gradually Jim is accepted into Patusan society winning the love ofJewel the daughter of the evil old trader named Cornelius. Jim also becomes the best friend of Dormain's sonDain Warus. The natives admire Jim and dub him \\"Tuan\\" or \\"Lord\\" Jim. He becomes the white leader of the native community. Jim leads the natives in their conquering of a hated rajah; prosperity is returned to the island paradise Jim calls home. He has respect, a good woman's love and the admiration of his fellows. Jim has no desire to return to white society.Big trouble intrudes into paradise with the appearance of the odious pirate Gentleman Brown. Years later a moribund Brown will tell Marlowe the story of Jim's final days. Jim allows Brown to escape and Dain Warus is slain by the pirates. Old Cornelius proves to be a Judas collaborating with Brown in plotting mayhem and murder in the island community. Jim knows he has for the second time in his short life let down his friends! Jim bares his breast to old Doramin who shots and kills the young Englishman. This tragic death was Jim's form of repentance for his misdeeds. Lord Jim may be viewed as a symbol of the Lord Jesus Christ who dies so that others might live.Conrad takes the late Victorian adventure tale and turns it on its head! He uses multiple narrators to tell the story though the chief narrator is Marlowe (who stands in for Conrad). The novel is rich in metaphor (particularly using insect and bird imagery in referring to characters) and the pitiless apathy of nature to the fate of humanity. The godless Conradian cosmos reminds this reader of similar beliefs posited by Thomas Hardy in his many novels. Many of the passages deal with Conrad's thoughts on such topics as: honor; the human community linked in this story by the fellowship of seamen and their craft; death, love and man's place in the scheme of things.Conrad greatly influenced twentieth century ways of telling a story through innovative storytelling methods. Conrad is not an easy writer to read but he was a poet of the pen in exploring the depths of the heart of darkness pumping in the breasts of human beings. Conrad is best enjoyed by mature readers. If you have not read him since your high school English teacher forced you to do so pick up this excellent new edition by Penguin and explore Jim who is one of us!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

The uniform ed)","review":"Lord Jim is one of the few books that one finds it necessary to reread at least every decade or so. I suppose most of us are introduced to the classic Marlow-narrated books when one is quite young. And one feels the same sort of deep ambiguity in reading the novella Youth, the longer Heart of Darkness and the even longer Lord Jim. - Also, one has perhaps begun to doubt the greatness of a writer whose THIRD language was English. - Let it be said: It is always reaffirmed. The \\"unreliable narrator\\" ambiguity herein is the subject of many a dissertation. I'm not covering it here because there is always - it has always struck me - a deeper ambiguity. With whom does the reader identify? Which character captures his/her imagination? It has become almost a truism that one comes to identify with the older Marlow as one ages rather than be captivated by the subjects of his stories: the younger Marlow in Youth, the mad Kurtz or the idealistic Jim. The catch lies, of course, in the fact that this older narrator is himself captivated by his younger doppelganger, in some form. I suppose one might dub it the transitive property of narration. That is to say, you perhaps identify with Marlow now, but Marlow is fascinated with \\"X\\", ergo, you are still fascinated with \\"X,\\" only removed, like Marlowe, by your own life experience.Right. Why is Marlowe, why does the reader become so fascinated with Jim? I think primarily because, as Marlow continually intones throughout the book: \\"I only knew that he was one of us.\\" - Meaning many things, but primarily for the reader, that his soul is a noble tabula rasa embarking on life before experience and defeat have crippled his idealism. It's not as simple as the question of \\"lost illusions\\" - for one thing Jim never loses his - It's more the question of whether they are illusions in the first place. As Stein (my personal favourite character herein) says:\\"A man that is born falls into a dream like a man that falls into the sea.\\"The novel is ultimately asking us what, if anything, is real. Marlow says of his last visit to Jim on Patusa:\\"It was a strange and melancholy illusion, evolved half-consciously like all our illusions, which I suspect only to be visions of some remote unattainable truth, seen dimly.\\"The power of Conrad's writing is nowhere more apparent than when in posing this question:\\"It is when we try to grapple with another man's intimate need that we perceive how incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun. It is as if loneliness were a hard and absolute condition of existence; the envelope of flesh and blood on which our eyes are fixed melts before the outstretched hand, and there remains only the capricious, unconsolable, and elusive spirit that no eye can follow, no hand can grasp.\\"As we stretch out the tendrils of our imagination towards Jim and Marlowe throughout the book, we, like them, are continually dogged by, well, life. Conrad doesn't proffer any answers to the complex issues to which the book gives rise. As Marlow addresses the auditors of his story:\\"You may be able to tell better, since the proverb has it that the onlookers see most of the game.\\"In other words, the reader must find his or her own way on the high narrative seas. But it would be disingenuous of me not to reveal what kept coming back to this reader, as it does to Marlow - Those words of Stein:\\"Ah! He was romantic, romantic.\\""},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"This is a fascinating book.

He draws you in as he slowly unravels his tale of an \\"overly romantic\\" man and his \\"exquisite egoism.\\"While Conrad doesn't quite compare with the great romanticists like Hugo and Dostoevsky, Lord Jim is one of the last great romantic novels, certainly far superior to almost any fiction being written today."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

It is a story of the downfall of a ship's officer after he wimps out at a crucial moment. Where a less sensitive individual may have found the ability to survive, Jim in haunted by his own inner guilt about the incident. He gradually withdraws from white society.The novel tends to digress and sidetrack while developing characters, so it is some way into the story before the reader learns exactly why Jim is before a maritime court, and even farther along before you discover what actually happened to the steamer Patna. Jim had a deep desire to do heroic deeds, but an error in judgement makes him a goat. The balance of the novel is on the life Jim made for himself, and on the people he associates with, as told by a narrator.The novel was first published circa 1900, and reflects the white European attitude towards native populations during that time period."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

It is the voice of Marlowe which sustains that sense of wonder and reflection, and which makes of the character of Jim, and his actions, a mystery that moves us.The story of the young seaman who dreams dreams of glory and in a moment loses nerve, jumps from a ship, marks himself with the sign of cowardice, has a second part in which Jim becomes the leader, the custodian of a people in East India. And there he redeems himself, by his courage and responsibility- though his end too bears with it the ambiguity which seems to mark the questioning tone of the narrator throughout.This is the way Conrad has Marlow describe it.\\"It is when we try to grapple with another man's intimate need that we perceive how incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun.\\"Conrad's greatness as a writer is in the evocation of atmosphere, and in the creation of character.

The uniform ed)","review":"Lord Jim is the novel of one man's fight against his own past and his attempt to prove himself to the world after he has made one terrible error. Like so many of books it is a story of the sea, although it is not a non-fiction story. The story opens with the fated voyage of a vessel, the ship of Eastern pilgrims which are Muslim with the ship called Patna, which Jim the head mate and the rest of the crew leave and abandon with its passengers still on board the Patna. Jim does not wish to act so shameful and dislike his actions but does so in the horror of the moment. Put on trial for his error the young idealistic Jim is stripped of his papers and is left to follow an existence avoiding his own identity and seeking mystery as he travels the entire world. Marlow organizes a meeting at which Jim goes to Patusan, a remote or ancient region. Jim brings order and strength to the area with his strength of character and leadership. The arrival of the two-faced Gentleman Brown shakes the peace Jim has created and his value systems are called into question before the horror of the ending. The horrors of the ending would be when the angry old man shoots Jim and falls dead.I really did not like the novel because simply Jim had abandoned a bunch of Muslim pilgrims aboard a ship which he thought was sinking. Then he soon discovers that the ship is not sinking. After going to trial he escapes and goes to a remote. Jim in this part of the story he had done wrong escaping and not paying his consequences. That is basically why I think this novel isn't great. It would have been efficient if Jim had not escaped and to see what has happened."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Just after the first few pages I was already a little confused. I think just because I don't think I have ever read a book that was told in third person. Eventually you get used to it, and the fact that his descriptions of almost everything is both extremely detailed and long, perhaps a little too long. I think Conrad just wants us, the reader, to know exactly what is going on and to be focused on the story. Most of Jim's story is told by a fellow seaman(a captain) named Marlow who Jim met at a meeting where Jim loses his hopes and dreams of becoming a &quot;hero of the sea&quot;.Jim is a young man who has big plans to become a sea captian, but after pushing through the ranks and becoming chief mate he makes a bad mistake. The ship he was currently boarded, &quot;the Patna&quot;, became damaged and without thinking Jim and the rest of the crew abandoned the ship leaving innocents stranded on the boat. This mistake costs Jim his life as a seaman. This is where he meets Marlow, who seems to take interest in Jim. Marlow assists Jim in finding a new way to live in Patusan, where people begin to look up to Jim as their leader.In my opinion I don't really think we are suppose to think of the story as what is so great but looking at Jim the character as what is. I think Jim is a little to full of himself and everytime the memory of the Patna arises he hides in fear like a coward. He thinks he is superhuman for stopping a bandit in his little town. He needs to realize that heros are only in fairy tales.I rated the book three stars because it was a good story, but the book for me was a little too confusing and way to long of a book to get the story he was telling across to everyone.

There are so many descriptions of the setting, that Conrad necer can find the space to focus on the characters. Like Jim, the main character. I know less about him than I do about a stanger that I could meet on the street."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Many years ago I saw the movie 'Lord Jim' with Peter O'Toole and I thought it was a great flick with a lot of depth and very thought-provoking. It is one of my favorite films. So, I thought I would read the book since I've often found books to be even better than the movie. But, in this case I was sorely disappointed. The book, to me, was very hard to read with exceedingly long sentences and paragraphs and written almost in a 'stream-of-conciousness' mode as told by a third person. I found this to be true of Conrad's 'Nostromo' as well and have to admit that I failed to finish either book because of the cumbersome writing style. Perhaps, I am not smart enough to understand the writing style. In any case, may advice is to watch the movie which I found to be much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size, but Conrad strains to keep the plot going amid the endless descriptions of sea, sky, and the characters' states of mind.

The uniform ed)","review":"I debated whether or not I should write a review. After all, I only read the first 70 pages or so, after which I decided to stop slogging through this tedious novel. However, since I assume most people who would buy and read this book are doing it for their own enjoyment, I felt complelled to chime in, although I'm clearly in the minority. However, I must add in my defense that this book was initially criticized by his contemporaries as a short story that just kept rambling on with no apparent purpose, a criticism I find valid.The premise sounds fascinating - the journey of a young seaman who attempts to reconcile his dishonorable past. It sounded like it would be an interesting tale about the conflict between heroics and harsh reality. However, in the delivery of the story, I lost all interest shortly. The main problem I see is in the vivid descriptions and imagery. This, or course, is usually a good thing. However, Conrad seems to go into such great description of every little detail that it distracts from the main story. It seems that Conrad could have been just as effective by using half of the words. The non-sequitur narrative also makes it a bit more difficult to follow, although I think this could have been effective if the narrative would have been more concise and to the point.However, rather than merely blasting away at \\"Lord Jim,\\" I will at least give one alternative - \\"Heart of Darkness\\", also by Joseph Conrad. Read my take of this in my other reviews. This is a much more interesting and more enjoyable read than \\"Lord Jim\\", and about half its length. Plus, it offers a more poignant picture of Imperialism and its ideals (or lack thereof).Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, but until then I would recommend you give \\"Lord Jim\\" a pass and spend your money and time on another novel, perhaps \\"Heart of Darkness.\\""},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

While I find not much fault with the review, well done actually, the title is wrong, if only by a slim margin.The book is not about guilt at all, but about shame.So let's say: Shame and Redemption.This is Marlow's Third. After Heart of Darkness and Youth, Lord Jim should have become a third long story about Conrad's alter ego's experiences. The Congo, the Indian Ocean, and then the Arab Sea were the locations, but then the Jim story grew out of proportion and became Conrad's longest book so far. One might argue that it is two books in one: the shame of having been caught in a cowardly act (augmented by the shame brought on the white race, as observed by one of the judges in Jim's trial), and the redemption through an act of mad blind courage.Marlow becomes Jim's patron after his disgrace. He wonders about the young man, 'one of us', a British gentleman, who broke the code of conduct and who will not believe that he is to blame. Jim has the guts to face the charges. Or is he too cowardly to do the right thing and disappear terminally? (As his judge does over undisclosed disgraces of his own, when he commits suicide, shockingly in view of his acknowledged superiority as a human specimen.)Marlow helps Jim to find a new footing, and finds new grounds for self-reproach: Jim must be a hero and Marlow knows this was unavoidable and he should have stayed away from interference. Till the end, Marlow will not cease to wonder: was the man a coward?My first picture of Lord Jim was Peter O'Toole. I watched the movie before I knew the name Joseph Conrad. After reading the novel now for the second time, I will try to watch the film again. I have a suspicion that Peter O'Toole, in all his brillance, damaged the spirit of Conrad's Jim. My recollection of an oversensitive sufferer does not quite match with Marlow's Jim, who is robust, impulsive and brooding, but does not have this saintly suffering face and expression.And a word to Mr. John Stape, the Conrad biographer, who wrote the notes, and who may know Conrad well, but who annoyed me in the notes regarding A.R.Wallace and J.W.Goethe.First of all, claiming that Jim's benefactor Stein is modelled on Wallace is nonsense. Stein is a trader who becomes wealthy in the archipelago and who is a hobby zoologist with an experience as an assistant to a famous zoologist in the islands long ago. That man may have been Wallace, but not Stein. Zero similarity of character. And by the way, 'coleoptera' are not a species of winged beetles. Elementary, Watson!And then, Goethe was absolutely not a romantic poet, Mr.Stape; better brush up your lit-history. And to translate the line from Goethe's Tasso: 'in gewissem Sinne mein' as 'unambiguously mine' is horribly misunderstood. Booh, Mr.Stape!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"You have to read till the end of this book, and experience Conrad's utterly masterful craftsmanship of each part of the story, to fully appreciate what a phenomenal piece of work this is. To Conrad, English was his third language, which he didn't begin to speak until he had become a young man, but it is hard to think of someone who was capable of writing more beautiful prose in English. Sure, in this book, the meaning of some of his sentences are, here and there, hard to fathom, which, I think H.L. Mencken suggested, had something to do with English not being his first language. There are, of course, other imperfections in the book. But Conrad's ability to make the scenes he describes seem very real, to make them come alive for the reader, is extraordinary. His description in the last portion of the book,of the physical scenery as well as the danger and emotional tumult of life in the remote Indonesian or Malaysian community of which Jim becomes leader, must rank near the very top of the best writing in the history of fiction."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

My guess is that Joseph Conrad never read Moby Dick. His writing career unfolded during the decades before the rediscovery of Melville. I have no doubt that Conrad would have burst with appreciation if he'd encountered the other \\"greatest\\" writer of sea tales in English or any language. Lord Jim begins to remind me of Moby Dick in chapter four, when the straightforward 3rd person narrative suddenly shifts to Conrad's typically indirect narration in the first person voice of Captain Marlow. Thereafter, Jim's whole adventure is embedded in Marlow's rambling discourse, to the utter despair of high school sophomores and middle-age armchair travelers who \\"just want the story, ma'm.\\"So who is Marlow? Is he just a convenient mask for Conrad? Why is so much text devoted to Marlow's musing about his own \\"peripheral\\" role in the story and his own unresolved understanding of Jim? Does \\"Jim\\" really exist, outside of Marlow's penchant for entertaining friends with bizarre anecdotes? (The last few chapters, cast as a letter from Marlow to a friend, would seem to be intended to 'document' the truth of the tale.) Dear reader, you've better notice that Jim is remarkably inarticulate in Marlow's account; when he speaks, he almost never finishes a sentence, never establishes a discourse on his own terms. The Jim we get to know is as much a projection of Marlow's ego as Jesus of Nazareth was of the Apostle Paul's. And then, of course, we still have to wonder about the invisible author behind the so-obtrusive narrator.What I'm arguing here is that the novel Lord Jim is about as much about the title character as Moby Dick is about the whale. Ahab's quest for ineffable vengeance by death is almost exactly parallel to Jim's quest for redemption by death. Both are ripping good adventure tales that COULD be told in eighty-page novellas or made into films from which the narrative voices are stripped and scattered on the floor of the editing studio. But just as the main character in Moby Dick is Ishmael, Marlow is the heart of obscurity in Lord Jim. To really relish either book, the reader has to take the narrator's epiphanies seriously.Are we on any kind of solid ground in saying that Melville's novel is about a socially orphaned Ishmael projecting his need for a father Ahab? Shall we then risk the notion that Conrad's novel is about a psychologically impotent Marlow projecting his need for a son on Tuan Jim? Hey, reader! If you steal my notion and write a grad seminar paper with it, don't forget to vote \\"helpful\\" on my review!This is an absurdly great novel, a book to read thoughtfully with mounting involvement until you can't attend to anything else before finishing it, a book to read again and again as your life changes perspective on itself. If you have doubts about Conrad's mastery of the English language, listen to this description:\\"... we watched the moon float away above the chasm between the hills like an ascending spirit out of a grave; its sheen descended, cold and pale, like the ghost of dead sunlight. There is something haunting in the light of the moon... It is to our sunshine, which -- say what you like -- is all we have to live by, what the echo is to the sound: misleading and confusing whether the note by mocking or sad.\\" That extended metaphor, to my mind, sets up perfectly the mood and the narrative thrust of Marlow's first long 'confessional' conversation with the disgraced sailor Jim, in which self-mockery and sadness afflict both parties.I'd forgotten, or never realized, how deep this novel is, since I first read it perhaps twenry years ago. I hope I can come upon it with the same freshness and astonishment when I read it again, perhaps twenty years from now."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

He draws you in as he slowly unravels his tale of an \\"overly romantic\\" man and his \\"exquisite egoism.\\"While Conrad doesn't quite compare with the great romanticists like Hugo and Dostoevsky, Lord Jim is one of the last great romantic novels, certainly far superior to almost any fiction being written today."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Of Conrad's style in Lord Jim, I will say simply that it is a shining example of a master craftsman at the height of his art-form. Besides the stylistic triumphs, what makes this novel so wonderful is the central irony which balances itself upon the peak of morality. Is this novel a song of heroic redemption, or the sad dirge of a soul which tortured itself? Conrad certainly made it both. After a life of torturing himself, for his percieved cowardice and shortcomings, Jim recieves a chance at redemption. For his lonely display of honor and bravery, he recieves a bullet in the chest. Yet, what was his other option? He could run from his toubles again and choose life. The reward for this action, another start somewhere else where he would torture himself the rest of his life or until he failed again, and everytime he starts over an even greater weight is placed upon his soul. In the end, Jim had no choice. He was compelled to act because the alternative of the life of escape which he had been living was already worse than the death his actions would invite. In this conflict, Conrad displays the true murderer of Jim. The morality which was forced upon him since birth. Unable to live with the guilt any longer, Jim chooses suicide. Where, does the guilt come from. Who could not see Jim as anything but a relatively &quot;good&quot; man who had his own failings like all of humanity. Did he deserved to be tortured his entire life for them? What does that say about our own morality?"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"This book is so powerful, it had me thinking for days and weeks after reading it. The more I thought about it, the more things I came to discover. One thing you should ask yourself is whether or not Conrad approves of Jim's actions throughout the book, after the Patna incident. Is it worth giving up everything to regain your honour? And is Jim's end really a tryumph? I beg to differ. In fact, I came to the conclusion that Conrad couldn't have approved of Jim's actions (after the Patna incident). (Marlow comments at the end of the book: &quot;He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless wedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct.&quot;) What will confuse many readers is that Marlow appears both as the narrator and as a character in the book. As the narrator, Marlow does not approve of what Jim is doing to himself, and finds the whole idea of honour overrated. On the other hand Marlow-the character does nothing but -contribute- to Jim's destruction. It's quite puzzling to see him in the role of Jim's friend when he does nothing to help Jim spiritually, to bring him back on the right track. He sees Jim torment himself like that and what does he do? At some point he comments: &quot;for a second I wished heartily that the only course left open for me was to pay for his &lt;Jim's&gt; funeral&quot;. Umm, ya, that's a nice friend... By no means will anybody get me to believe that Jim's end is positive, a tryumph over death, the solution to his problem... because it isn't. It isn't 'normal' for a young man to suffer like that, it is not 'normal' for a young man to see death as his only solution. He had his whole life ahead of him and enough opportunities left to regain his honour, even after the pilgrim episode. IMHO. I'd be glad to see more reviews, 'hear' more comments on this."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"LORD JIM is the story of an ordinary man who commits what may or may not be an act of cowardice and spends the rest of his life trying to atone for his sin. What makes this story extraordinary is the difficulty the reader has assessing the nature of the original act and then judging whether Jim has been punished enough. Joseph Conrad does not make it easy to gauge accurately either the man or his act since we can see the act filtered only through the lens of a narrator who is too close to the case to be judged reliable.LORD JIM is a novel of adventure and many read it on that basis, but lurking beneath the surface of a simple act is, as in so much of Conrad's fiction, a bewildering complexity of issues that tap into the deepest recesses of why people do what they do and how others can fairly judge them. Marlow is the narrator who attends the trial of a crewman Jim accused of abandoning his ship during a storm when he thought it was sinking. When all the ship's officers leap into a lifeboat they abandon the more than eight hundred passengers below decks. Jim joins them, and all are later picked up by a French trawler only to learn that their ship did not sink and in fact was safely towed to port. All the officers, except Jim, escape punishment either by running away or pleading illness. Only Jim decides to speak out publicly in his defense, but of course there is none, so he is found guilty and stripped of his seaman's certificate as punishment. Marlow sees the trial and decides to follow Jim around the world to get the truth. These are the bald facts, but what Conrad does with them is to invest them with emotional and psychological issues that resist easy analysis.To begin with, Conrad emphasizes Jim's ordinary state of being, by repeating that Jim is \\"one of us.\\" This statement occurs so often that it becomes a mantra, inviting speculation as to what sense he is one of us. Whoever the \\"us\\" is, Conrad implies that the \\"us\\" must have had a standard of justice in which one size fits all. No one at the board of inquiry seems particularly upset that Jim was merely following the captain's orders to abandon ship nor that his record was otherwise flawless. The board judged Jim by an inflexible code of honor and found him wanting. Conrad, in his description of Jim as a maritime Everyman (no first name, a flat character who no past, present, and now no future), makes it easy to condemn the board's overhasty verdict to condemn Jim for an act that had mitigating circumstances. As Marlow gets to know Jim, he acknowledges that the more he knows, the less he understands. Conrad sets up a straw man in Jim. Because so many people, including Marlow, hold Jim under so many lenses, the images that result are often contradictory. The only constant is Jim himself. During the trial, and later during the climactic encounter with the natives who call him Lord Jim, Jim continues to attempt to see himself in the simplest manner possible. He knows that he cannot possibly be all the Jims floating on everyone's lips, so he determines to be the Jim who should have stayed on board the deck of a sinking ship. This Jim is willing to take responsibility for his actions. When he unwisely allows the dastardly Gentleman Brown to escape his richly deserved fate, he makes a colossal leap of faith: he will pay now for all sins of his past. In his death, Conrad suggests that this leap of faith may be the only trait that distinguishes reprobates like Brown from ordinary men like Jim who may not be so ordinary after all."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

It explores classic themes of honor and courage. Jim is definitely a headstrong figure. To a point. But I actually found Marlow to be the more engaging character in an odd sort of way.Why?Well, it seems from his commentary that Marlow has more or less dedicated his life to following Jim's exploits around the South Seas. It's not normal. I can understand everything Jim does but I can understand very little of what Marlow does.

The uniform ed)","review":"This is one of those books that anybody who has been throughhigh school should have been exposed (or at least exposed to the CliffNotes on the novel). I remember being assigned this book as a junior or senior and bluffing my way through without really reading it. I even got a literature degree without reading it. Finally, after many years, I felt that I should give the novel its due, and picked up a copy.The novel is the story of Jim, an overly romantic seaman, who during a moment of crisis loses his courage. He is first mate on a pilgrim ship bound for Mecca and after the ship collides with an unseen object and is in danger of sinking, he abandons ship leaving the human cargo to fend for its own. He is dogged by his guilt and spends years drifting around the East trying to find the right occasion by which he might redeem himself. Eventually he ends up in the forests of Malaysia where he becomes a god-like protector of the indigenous people and is given the title of &quot;Lord.&quot; But no matter how successful Jim might appear to his followers, and to the omnipresent narrator of the novel, he still cannot forget his moment of weakness. Jim's self-centeredness prevents him from moving forward with his life and condemns him to a life of voluntary exile, all the time proclaiming that he is not good enough to live in the outside world. He is willing to risk all future happiness and fortune to be able to face his demons once again without losing his nerves. Ironically, it is his last &quot;heroic&quot; act that destroys all the good that Jim has painstakingly built up, essentially bringing chaos to his Eden like world.Published at the very beginning of the twentieth century, Lord Jim, in many ways anticipated the experimental writing techniques that would be brought to fruition in the works of Joyce, Faulkner, and others. Conrad is not only interested in telling a tale, he is interested in different points of view, nonlinear narrative techniques, and solving the complexities inherent in a &quot;tale within a tale&quot; formula. Although some readers might find Conrad's prose a little tedious, perseverence and careful reading will reveal passages of unexpected beauty that will cause the reader to pause -- then slowly re-read."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"This is the fifth book I have read by Conrad, and through these readings I have come to deeply appreciate his literary power and the perfection of his stories. Conrad has the skill to border about several similar subjects, without repeating himself. \\"Lord Jim\\" is truly a Shakespearean tragedy, mainly because of the Shakespearean nature of the main character. Jim is a young naval officer with high hopes of heroism and moral superiority, but when he faces his first test of courage, he miserably fails. While 800 Muslim pilgrims are asleep aboard the ship \\"Patna\\", Jim discovers that the boat is about to sink. There are not sufficient lifeboats for everybody. Should he wake them up or not? He gets paralyzed with fear and then sudenly jumps into a boat being set up by the rest of the officers. He is taken to trial and disposessed of his working licence.Ashamed and humiliated, Jim dedicates the rest of his life to two things: escape the memory of that fateful night, and redeem himself. This agonizing quest to recover his dignity in front of his own eyes leads him to hide in a very remote point in the Malayan peninsula, where he will become the hero, the strong man, the wise protector of underdeveloped, humble and ignorant people. Jim finds not only the love of his people, but also the love of a woman who admires him and fears the day when he might leave for good. The narrator, Captain Marlow (the same of \\"Heart of Darkness\\") talks to Jim for the last time in his remote refuge, and then Jim tells him that he has redeemed himself by becoming the people's protector. Oh, but these things are never easy and Jim will face again the specter of failure.Conrad has achieved a great thing by transforming the \\"novel of adventures\\" into the setting for profound and interesting reflections on the moral stature of Man, on courage, guilt, responsibility, and redemption.Just as in \\"Heart of Darkness\\" the question is what kinds of beings we are stripped of cultural, moral and religious conventions; just as in \\"Nostromo\\" the trustworthiness of a supposedly honest man is tested by temptation, in \\"Lord Jim\\" the central subject is dignity and redemption after failure.A great book by one of the best writers."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

The uniform ed)","review":"After reading this book (along with several other of Conrad's books) I am under the impression that Joseph Conrad may very well be my favorite author. Here is another masterpiece, a deeply incisive study of character of the motivation and the ultimate failure of all high-minded ideals. Granted my own personal world view falls directly in line with this realization and therefore prejudices me towards anything the man might write, but, when considering such a lofty title as 'favorite author' one must regard other aspects of the novelist's creation. As with the others, Conrad wins by the power of his stories.Lord Jim is my least favorite of the the four books I have read by Conrad. The story is rather scattered: a righteous young man does something wrong that he holds himself far too accountable for and the public shame the action brought him exaggerates the reality of his failure and makes him believe the rumors swirling around about his so-called cowardice. He spends the remainder of his life trying to reclaim his self-regard, mostly exaggerating his own importance in matters he hardly understands. His goal is to liberate the primitive people of the jungle paradise he inadvertantly finds himself in (due to an effort to escape every particle of the world he once inhabited) and his once high-minded ideals and regard for himself lead him to allow those people to consider him almost a God.Jim likes being a God and considers himself a just and fair one. He treats everyone equally and gives to his people the knowledge of modern science and medicine as well as the everyday archetecture and understanding of trade that those primitive folks would otherwise be years from comprehending.Of course everything ends in failure and misery and of course Jim's restored name will be returned to its demonic status, but the whole point of the novel seems to me that one can not escape their past. Jim, for all his courage in the line of fire has tried to avoid all memory of the once shameful act of his former life and by doing so becomes destined to repeat his mistakes.Lord Jim is far more expansive than the story it sets out to tell, ultimately giving a warning on the nature of history and general humanity that only a writer of Conrad's statue could hope to help us understand.If there is a flaw it is not one to be taken literally. Conrad was a master of structural experimentation and with Lord Jim he starts with a standard third person narrative to relate the background and personalities of his characters and then somehow merges this into a second person narrative of a man, years from the events he is relating, telling of the legend of Jim. It is a brilliant innovation that starts off a little awkward and might lead to confusion in spots as the story verges into its most important parts under the uncertain guidence of a narrator who, for all his insight into others, seems unwilling to relate his personal relevence to the story he is relating.Nevertheless (with a heartfelt refrain), one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

Is he just a convenient mask for Conrad? Why is so much text devoted to Marlow's musing about his own \\"peripheral\\" role in the story and his own unresolved understanding of Jim? Does \\"Jim\\" really exist, outside of Marlow's penchant for entertaining friends with bizarre anecdotes? (The last few chapters, cast as a letter from Marlow to a friend, would seem to be intended to 'document' the truth of the tale.) Dear reader, you've better notice that Jim is remarkably inarticulate in Marlow's account; when he speaks, he almost never finishes a sentence, never establishes a discourse on his own terms. The Jim we get to know is as much a projection of Marlow's ego as Jesus of Nazareth was of the Apostle Paul's. And then, of course, we still have to wonder about the invisible author behind the so-obtrusive narrator.What I'm arguing here is that the novel Lord Jim is about as much about the title character as Moby Dick is about the whale. Ahab's quest for ineffable vengeance by death is almost exactly parallel to Jim's quest for redemption by death. Both are ripping good adventure tales that COULD be told in eighty-page novellas or made into films from which the narrative voices are stripped and scattered on the floor of the editing studio. But just as the main character in Moby Dick is Ishmael, Marlow is the heart of obscurity in Lord Jim. To really relish either book, the reader has to take the narrator's epiphanies seriously.Are we on any kind of solid ground in saying that Melville's novel is about a socially orphaned Ishmael projecting his need for a father Ahab? Shall we then risk the notion that Conrad's novel is about a psychologically impotent Marlow projecting his need for a son on Tuan Jim? Hey, reader! If you steal my notion and write a grad seminar paper with it, don't forget to vote \\"helpful\\" on my review!This is an absurdly great novel, a book to read thoughtfully with mounting involvement until you can't attend to anything else before finishing it, a book to read again and again as your life changes perspective on itself. If you have doubts about Conrad's mastery of the English language, listen to this description:\\"... we watched the moon float away above the chasm between the hills like an ascending spirit out of a grave; its sheen descended, cold and pale, like the ghost of dead sunlight. There is something haunting in the light of the moon... It is to our sunshine, which -- say what you like -- is all we have to live by, what the echo is to the sound: misleading and confusing whether the note by mocking or sad.\\" That extended metaphor, to my mind, sets up perfectly the mood and the narrative thrust of Marlow's first long 'confessional' conversation with the disgraced sailor Jim, in which self-mockery and sadness afflict both parties.I'd forgotten, or never realized, how deep this novel is, since I first read it perhaps twenty years ago. I hope I can come upon it with the same freshness and astonishment when I read it again, perhaps twenty years from now."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Like other reviewers I was introduced to this book at a young age. Although I was too young to understand much, it intrigued me then as it intrigues me now - this prototypical theme about one who leaves the numbing monotony of uninspired domestic life for the romanticism of going to sea and distant lands. Certainly, the romanticism of youth and then the subsequent disillusionment of experience, in this case a bitter twist of fate, was a subject of grave concern for Conrad, and that concern is sounded in the powerful language that comes out through the narrator Marlow. As Marlow relates, \\"There is a magnificent vagueness in the expectations that had driven each of us to sea, such a glorious indefiniteness, such a beautiful greed of adventures... in no other kind of life is the beginning all illusion - the disenchantment more swift - the subjugation more complete\\". Or this: \\"Yet you, too, in your time must have known the intensity of life, that light of glamour created in the shock of trifles, as amazing as the glow of sparks struck from a cold stone - and as short-lived, alas.\\" Stein, the merchant and butterfly collector had an enigmatic answer to this romanticism: \\"in the destructive element submit.\\"Of interest here is the historical context within which this book was written. It appears as if an actual historical incident, the abandonment by the crew of the British ship Jeddah carrying pilgrims bound for Mecca in 1880, serves as a basis for the story. It was during a time when Great Britain had amassed a great overseas empire and had come to dominate the trade routes to the East; and also when racist attitudes abounded, supported by the science of the day. At one point, Marlow pauses in his narrative to wonder if all this enterprise into foreign lands could have arisen solely out of greed, and cannot come up with any other motives other than to benefit loved ones back home.Jim's downfall has a great deal to do with the fringe characters that cross his path. None of the crew of the Patna seem to be anything but self-indulgent and self-serving; exactly the kind of people one would expect to run for their lives rather than face a responsibility for something larger than themselves. It was Jim's fate as a youth to suffer the inaction of being pulled along with these cowards. Marlow went out of his way to extend his sympathy to Jim, seeing in him a different sensibility, as \\"one of us\\". But then again, although it's not exactly clear - \\"obscured in mists\\" as Marlow would say, he had something in common with that crew. He seems to have had his head in the clouds, thinking about his own adventures rather than his duty to the passengers. Later, when he is banished to Patusan and becomes a revered figure to the natives there and is on his way to redeeming himself and finding love - at least in that one corner of the world - he crosses paths with two outcasts, the egomaniac pirate Gentleman Brown and the abject Cornelius.

Unfortunately, to appreciate it (and many other Conrad novels), you need to have a fair bit of experience in life. I tried to read Conrad at 13, then at 20. It seemed boring and I could not quite relate to his heroes, but now, when I am a bit older, I found his books and this one in particular, really interesting. This is not a page turner. I found myself reading pieces of 10-20 pages, then putting the book aside and taking some time to think. All in all, this is a really good book."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Young Jim was probably never meant for the sea. As described by Joseph Conrad, the title character of \\"Lord Jim\\" had no real love for ocean voyage or relish for adventure except when it was inside his own head. His \\"dreams and the success of his imaginary achievements\\" were \\"the best parts of life, its secret truth, its hidden reality.\\" His passage to the Far East was destined to prove a ticket to failure, and so it was, when he abandoned a foundering vessel filled with pilgrims to save himself.Now his shame is the stuff of conversation in every roadstead and harbor between India and Australia. Can the chastened dreamer manage to recover his lost sense of honor in a distant land where no white man will come to tell of his past mistake?\\"Lord Jim\\" may be set in the Pacific, but its ideas are universal, as Conrad takes on the contradictions behind the Western concepts of honor and bravery. Published in 1900, the novel feels like the start of the modern literary era in both its loose, ambling structure and its questioning of the base convictions of right and wrong still girding society today. \\"Lord Jim\\" hasn't lost much of anything in the 105 years since it was published. If anything, it's more relevant than ever.Who is Jim? Is he a hero, a coward, or a victim? Is he all three? Part of the problem pegging him is the fact the fellow doing most of the talking about him, cagey Marlow the narrator, doesn't seem too sure himself. That ambiguity is another way in which the novel is modern. At one point Marlow even seems to suggest Jim is no more than a figment of his imagination.\\"He existed for me, and after all it is only through me that he exists for you,\\" he tells his anonymous group of listeners at one point. It's interesting Marlow is only identified by his last name and Jim by his first. Are they two halves of the same person?While playing with the metaphysics of identity and of right and wrong make \\"Lord Jim\\" vital and important, Conrad's deep engagement in humanity's many odd and nasty facets makes it fun. He creates a myriad of secondary characters inhabiting the backwaters of the West Indies, of varying moral shadings, finding amusement in even the cruelest.One singular nogoodnik tells Marlow he wants the disgraced Jim to work for him on a barren island harvesting guano. It's not much of an offer, he knows, but there is one benefit: \\"Anyhow, I could guarantee the island wouldn't sink under him - and I believe he is a bit particular on that point.\\"\\"Lord Jim\\" is a great book not for its message so much as its lived-in depth, a sense we are really there on Marlow's steamy veranduh amid casuarina trees or aboard a creaking brigantine sailing placid under a crepuscular sky. Conrad really engages you as a reader, and while he plays with the narrative structure, and allows the story to drift quite a bit, often frustrating me and other readers at least the first time through, the book remains engaging and illustrative about both its theme and subject.Dark? Yes, but not oppressively so. In a way, Conrad is taking a humanistic approach to a nihilistic question, asking what good notions of honor and glory really do mankind when most of us aren't fated to join life's immortals. Do we have the right to expect more of ourselves than life itself allows?At one point, when a minor character obsessed with his sense of honor kills himself, Conrad asks a burning question worth keeping in mind: \\"Who can tell what flattering he had induced himself to take of his own suicide?\\""},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Joseph Conrad's tale of Lord Jim is a warning against taking yourself too seriously, expecting too much of yourself, failing to forgive yourself.Jim is such a noble character but is he just another manifestation of Dostoevsky's 'The Idiot' - too honourable to be a survivor. Of course Conrad conspires greatly against Jim. With Jim's first great mistake - the one that, in his eyes, blighted him forever, it is as if God himself pardoned Jim, absolved him of any blame because there were no victims. And yet Jim cannot put the unfortunate aside push on with an effective life. But that's not quite true - eventually he does find a place for himself and the rest was up to Conrad's masterful plotting.I also enjoy immensely the method Conrad uses of telling a tale through the eyes of an observer - Marlowe. While we are all participants in life, we are also very much more observers - if we care to observe.other recommendations:'Victory', 'Chance' - Joseph Conrad'Virgin Soil' - Turgenev"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"From the vantage point of the 21st century, I often wonder about the life of a sailor in the 2nd half of the 19th century, when ports of call existed on every continent, and commercial trade conventions were long established, and far-off exotic locales were familiar places to the peripatetic seaman. How different is the local culture and life of the great seaports than those land locked communities in the heartlands, far from either river or railroad. How many wandering storytellers come to such communities with stories of extreme duress and moral complexity? What do such isolated communities know and understand of the complicated, difficult, and often imperfect ethical conundrums that confront the worldly wise and often, world weary in their wanderings across the seas.Lord Jim is a fascinating, complex psychological character study of someone who bore on his back the burden of absolute, utter disgrace, yet who longed for an opportunity to demonstrate, at least to himself, if no one else, that his one great moral failure should not define the whole of his character. And thus he remained true to himself, to the bitter end. When all his colleagues ran off to avoid standing up and being held accountable, exposed to public scrutiny, public contempt, and public ridicule, Jim alone answered for his actions to the high maritime court. And when he had made that ill-fated bargain with a human devil incarnate, Gentleman Brown, that turned out SO badly, once again, he alone, stood up before the high judge and accepted his responsibility, and the final, inevitable decree. He could have fled, but instead, like Socrates, he saw nothing to flee to. He had acted thusly, he accepted his responsibility, and he held himself accountable to others whom had placed their faith and trust in him.This is NOT a novel about cowardice! It is much more complex than that. Each of us, in the screenplay's of our own lives, tends to write ourselves as the heroic protagonist who always wears the white hat, and we always justify, in one way our another, the actions we take and the decisions we make. But how many of us are truly tested--in the crucible--where the urge and impulse must be weighed against the notion of obligation and duty, and the kind of decision that judges on a high court might make, after hearing all the evidence, after taking the time for proper deliberation--is demanded in the twinkling of an eye. Which of us could always make the right decision, every time, when confronted with such desperate situations--and examining our own characters honestly--where does that leave each one of us. Conrad argues that it should lead us like Marlowe, who has seen much of the world, and is willing to see the good in others who were tried in the balance and found wanting. Marlowe believes in the possibility of redemption, of growth and of hope, and it is his faith alone that finally persuades Jim that his life may yet have some meaning--that he may yet transform his one great failure into a kind of transcendent moral victory. And--alas, it is Jim's striving for moral perfection that, in the end, is his own undoing. For not every one of us is deserving of the kind of faith that Marlowe had in Jim. Faith and trust in a true psychpath like Gentleman Brown would be a bad bet every time. It's like the folklore of the frog and the scorpion--in the end, the scorpion will sting the frog, every time, because it is his nature. But Jim had known desperation, and he knew he had no right to claim any moral high ground, having failed once, himself, and so, he was willing to trust Brown, to take him at his word, as a gentleman. All his companions knew Brown for what he was--but Jim was blind to it--he saw himself in Brown, and was moved to mercy because he himself had been the object of Marlowe's mercy. This is complex stuff! And Conrad wants you to think hard, and seriously about it, for, as Immanuel Kant has written, the only absolute is the Moral Imperative. But the certainty of Moral absolutes is always fleeting--we are ALWAYS crucified on the poles of two competing perspectives-two equally valid and totally opposing propositions--and the real challenge to courage is to chose one, and let it be on YOUR head.So, Jim's failure as a crew member of the ill fated Patna was NOT cowardice--it was simply going along with the others. It was herd behavior. We find this principle expressed in the New Testament in the form of: \\"I have not come to bring peace but a sword! For I have come to set a man against his father... And one's foes will be members of one's own household.\\" It was Jim's going along with the rest of the crew in their abdication of their obligations that was his failure--the crew knew that he did not feel as they--they talked openly of throwing him out of the lifeboat--he stayed awake all night gripping the tiller as a club lest they try it. No, Jim's failure on the Patna was in not saying NO! to the rest of the crew, and staying behind, living up to the duties, and the responsibilities he had agreed to undertake when he signed on. By blindly following the leadership of the herd, he betrayed himself, the Pilgrims, the Ship owners, indeed, all of the civilized world.This book is easily misunderstood if you do not take the time to consider what Conrad is saying, carefully. Any of us is capable of moral failure or corruption, given the right circumstances. And he shows us how even the motivation to never make another mistake of that sort can itself lead to a fatal weakness. In this, he has identified the original Catch-22 long before Joseph Heller. Conrad is one of the deepest, and most profound writers in western literature, and he requires his reader to work a little; but the investment is worth it. The candle is worth the game."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"There should be a Joseph Conrad revival. How this man could write! No less than H. L. Menken, the great critic, essayist, and scholar (of \\"The American Language\\"), of the first quarter of the twentieth Century, said of him: \\"He was the greatest artist who ever wrote a novel\\".Most know of Conrad's Polish origin -- upper middle-class -- Polish being his first language; and that he learned and wrote exquisitely in English.The first part of his life, he spent at sea, working up from seaman to mates, to skipper, in both steam and sail; and the latter part in writing fiction about it all. He was so good, Ford Maddox Ford wanted to collaborate with him, and did.His \\"Lord Jim\\" was emblematic of the White man's superiority -- although Conrad doesn't hammer at it.Jim, presented by Conrad as being in his mid-twenties, was white in everything, including white garb and blond of hair color. And more than once Conrad uses the expression in referring to him that, \\"He was one of us\\". The context here being that he was a white, educated, upper middle-class, Christian, heterosexual, and central European -- in this case English. That is we, who more than any other, ventured out in commercial enterprise and curiosity and hooked the world together.This high adventure tale, \\"Lord Jim\\", is woven by Conrad in a non-linear way, with many back cuts and forward cuts, and jarring story surprises that the author has masterfully teased us with. In the first half Jim gets into some quite serious life difficulty and the second half deals with his redemption.This is one of Conrad's \\"up river\\" stories, and in this case Jim becomes \\"Yuan Jim\\" or Lord Jim to the river people for his bravery, great character and great competence. It shows that this white man from Europe has what it takes to straighten things out among the native Javanese. But Conrad is not Eurocentric here as some of his admirable characters are Indonesians; and of his most despicable, one is a Portuguese. Conrad weighs fairly all races and ethnicities that he has come across and writes about. There is also an interestingly and originally developed \\"love angle\\" in this story.In his other yarns as well, such as Heart of Darkness, The Secret Sharer, Youth, Nostromo, etc., Conrad is not only superb at plot architecture and structure, but at character development as well as conveying the mood of the ambience; and in doing all this with the most striking and sublime -- not necessarily economical -- language.But the most important element in his writing is elusive, is often just beneath the situational surface, and is a profound one. It sometimes seems the action of his high adventure tales may be, in part, a vehicle for conveying in a symbolic way the conflicts of the broader human condition with fate and the resolution of those."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"The experience of reading Lord Jim makes it clear that the writing of the novel was interrupted. It was begun in the summer of 1898 and then taken up again after Joseph Conrad had written Heart of Darkness. The relationship of Lord Jim with Heart of Darkness is very close.The first part of the novel is concerned with the episode on board the Patna in which Jim?s failure to meet an emergency with courage marks him psychologicaly and provokes his desertion from the community of colonists. The second part is less coherently constructed, and is concerned with the adventures of Jim in the remote jungle of Patusan, where he is regarded as Lord Jim among the natives. The story is thus deeply concerned with the question of Jim?s problematic rehabilitation after his moral breach with the community. On the other hand, the novel is a pioneering work of Modernism and as such it traces the ideological and existential origins of the new writing techniques.Edward Said said that the vision of Joseph Conrad was \\"totally dominated by the Atlantic West\\". As such, is he writing technique also to be labelled as Western? Modernism?s concern to address different voices and include extraneous narratives would circumscribe this view.Early on in the novel we are confronted with different notions of spiritual salvation. The Arab pilgrims on board the Patna are said to have left their homes following \\"an exacting belief\\". But Jim is motivated by a sensualist, modernistic interpretation of the world?s hieroglyph. When he meets a storm, he feels that the elements are directed at him. The group of people who the narrative addresses is generally supposed to share Jim?s modernistic conceptions: \\"in our own hearts we trust for our salvation in the men that surround us, in the sights that fill our eyes, in the sounds that fill our ears, a and in the air that fills our lungs.\\" Thus the narrative presupposes a community of modern, Western readers, untroubled by a fixed, Eastern religious conscience. The modernistic mindset of the novel seems to have been in its origins a broadly Western affair.Captain Marlow meets Jim a month or so after the affair on board the ship and sympathises with his case. Marlow is moved by Jim?s apparent English steadfastness, his \\"faith invulnerable to the strength of facts, to the contagion of example, to the solicitation of ideas\\". How can such a perfect constitution have been wayled? What is it in Jim that announced a breaking up in the ideology of the superior white man? In order to discover the reason why this has happened to Jim, Marlow must learn to read the hidden logic behind the apparent delirium of facts. His efforts to narrate Jim?s problematic failure and rehabilitation will go to create a new narrative technique, which is going to be characerised by its slow motion and by the slavery to impressions.The interest of the novel, like at parts the interest of the Court Enquiry, is thus deeply psychological. What matters is \\"the expectation of some essential disclosure as to the strength, the power, the horror, of human emotions\\". The white man is troubled by the necessity to confront the intolerable representation of some unknown force - perhaps embodied in the colonial subject, perhaps alighting in the utmost recesses of his own soul - which might explain that pervading self-doubt casting a ray of darkness on his glorious self-reflection. It is the beginning of the end of the innocent stage of the imperial business. And the way from innocence leads to \\"the horror\\" that will be central to Heart of Darkness too.The enterprise of the empire can only be sustained on the strictest moral grounds, to be specially observed by the British and American colonialists. \\"We aren?t an organised body of men,\\" says Captain Brierly, \\"and the only thing that holds us together is just the name for that kind of decency\\". Without decency, confidence on the good purpose of the empire is lost.The breaking up of the white man?s ideology of empire is shown through Conrad?s ironic technique, which can be handled only from a consistently Western, unified point of view. It is for this reason that Conrad does not include different cultural visions in his writing, his technique does not need them to succeed.The confrontation of the dark recesses of the imperial experience threatens to disrupt established cognitive notions of truth and falsehood, of right and wrong. Jim?s moral rupture is like the crack that threatens to disestablish the whole. The \\"white man?s burden\\" is therefore touched by the tragic. Jim?s passivity at a time when heroic action was called for has nothing short of the malediction in it. Is the Empire... to be cursed? Is Jim really guilty, or has he simply been haunted?Jim?s search for rehabilitation requires no expiation to speak of. Can Jim fairly be judged as a moral agent when he has felt himself to be deprived of his will entirely throughout the affair? The whole episode acquires for him the character of low comedy, of a devilish farce. In Marlow?s retelling: \\"he had preserved through it all a strange illusion of passiveness, as though he had not acted but had suffered himself to be handled by the infernal powers who had selected him for the victim of their practical joke.\\"His story is ultimately one of failure, since for man?s life to become utterance, his life must be part of a community. It does not matter what degree or honour you fulfil, the important thing is to belong. Marlow?s series of confidences, to the reader and to other characters, on the nature of honour, courage, and regret, eventually disclose that Jim?s soul is ultimately haunted by the riddle of being: \\"A man that is born falls into a dream like a man who falls into the sea\\"."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

Conrad himself spent sixteen years at sea in the late 1800s, so this book is to some degree autobiographical. The version of this book that I have even quotes Conrad: \\"Every novel contains an element of autobiography.\\" In this book, the protagonist, Jim, travels to a remote region of the world, far from Victorian England. In this sense, the plot is similar to that in one of Conrad's other famous works, Heart of Darkness. Other than that book, I'm not familiar with Conrad's other works, nor am I an expert in Victorian literature, so I can't place this in its proper historical context. However, it seems like an amazingly well written story in and of itself.

The uniform ed)","review":"Lord Jim has always been on my reading list since I was young. I had read \\"Heart of Darkness\\" three times, \\"Typhoon\\" and \\"The Nigger and the Narcissus.\\" I found the tales and Conrad's abstract way of relating the exploits and thinking processes of simple people (many or whom I could readily identify with) resonating and profound.For me the central tenet of this novel is about moral centre, what it is to a man, society, where action springs from, and how a person can loose such a thing and how ones gets it back. Jim's fall from grace could match any person from any walk of life who finds themselves in precarious circumstances where fate collides with free-will and choice -- in such a case how much does one control and how much does fate decide? If we believe Jim's case, it is not so clear cut at times... sometimes people are forced, despite their best intentions, by events on a course of action that leaves the person reeling, confused and depressed that they may have abandoned their moral wellspring. Even when sure they have not, mane may be haunted by society thinking or judging harshly a person who has been judged as not living up to a certain presumed moral order. (It is easy to see that there were probably some lesser minions in the Enron scandal, some accountants who should have possibly known better, but did not act. There are actions of soldiers in combat, who try to aim for the good, but circumstances may force horrible decisions upon them). Dramatic examples are not really so necessary, because part of the beauty of the book is that it forces common people such as myself to ask continually -- \\"what would I do in such circumstances?\\"Jim, haunted by his loss, retreats to the wilds of Sumatra and establishes a new legacy in a part of the world that does not know his past, but defines him in terms of his acts after he arrives. It is a world of noble savage offerred redemption, it is the comfort or loneliness and the profound strength in the personal knowledge that one has done right. There is no confusing societal filter or ambiguous circumstance. Jim does not make a mistake twice. He proves to society -- and most importantly, to himself -- that he has recovered his moral centre for action.--------------------One honest note for all readers. I would not classify myself as an intellectual, but I do have an abiding interest in just about everything dealing with the love of knowledge. I do not read much contemporary fiction -- narratives and philosophy and science are more my thing -- so there is no reason why the abstruse style of Conrad's writing should be off-putting at times -- but it is! And his switch between direct narration (things he saw or said) to indirect narration (things other people told him and that he now relates) can be a little hard to follow -- you often loose track of the narrative subject... is he talking about Jim? another story teller? Relax for a second and you can at times loose the narrative completely (and I defy any honest teacher of English Literature to edeny this). That is something that stops this \\"yarn\\" from being known to wider audiences. But it must be admitted. Some of the reason is the tenor of the time, it was written in 1900, but I have a lot of literature from the same age and none of it matches Conrad's narrative style for beauty and abstruse description. That is both the strength and the challenge of Conrad's writing.Also if you are not familiar or interested in the lore of the sea, or British Maritime Technology and history (I am a fanatic), then you may have a problem with this book. This edition can be very helpful for you because there is a glossary and you can look up terms such as \\"davit\\" and \\"belay pin\\" and know the difference between a \\"cutter\\" and a \\"barque.\\"In addition, there are significant historical documents in the back of the book relating to the actual historical events surrounding this story (yeah!), and literary reviews (not so hot).One should make an effort to master this text. Like most things in life worth doing, it takes effort, but yields rich results."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"We studied this book in a college literature class and I couldn't wait to finish it - author Joseph Conrad's thick writing made reading this book a real chore. Still, the story contains a decent plot and interesting main character. Lord Jim is an adventurous and charismatic young British sailor who survives a ship disaster in Asian waters, and finds himself blamed for the mishap. Stripped of his seaman's card, he must deal with overwhelming guilt while also seeking full or at least partial redemption. He ends up moving to the remote corners of the Malayan peninsula, where he becomes a trusted protector and helper of underdeveloped natives. Sound interesting? If you don't mind books written in a sluggish Victorian style, you'll probably enjoy LORD JIM. If you demand readability, go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Inasmuch as I prefer not to read reviews that reveal a lot about the details of a story prior to reading it - or of a movie prior to seeing it, for that matter - then I will write only in generalities for those who are like-minded. While some of its characters may be rather one-dimensional, some outright caricatures, and the plot perhaps unlikely (but not at all so by today's often outlandish standards), the book's redeeming qualities make it highly interesting and a joy to read.For me, the prose is rather the point of reading classic literature. Most successful authors today seem to have acquired their strain of expression from Strunk & White's \\"Elements of Style,\\" with the result being concise, clear, coherent and completely lacking artistic merit, and while that may seem a harsh assessment, I am able to temper that somewhat with my admission that sometimes I (we?) prefer an easy read. However, I do not imply that \\"Lord Jim\\" is a particularly difficult one, either; I found it entertaining, reasonably-paced, and difficult to put down, with its prose utterly artistic and delightful in many passages.Those who have not read it should rectify the omission."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"If you have already listened to Ackland's reading of 'Heart of Darkness' you might suspect that it would be impossible for a rendition of a lesser-known work to live up to the impossibly high standards that the extrraordinary combination of writer and reader had set.Let me put your mind at rest, this is, perhaps to my own surprise, if anything, even better still.Ackland makes Conrad's character's voices entirely his own.The words spring to life and build pictures so vividly that TV, movies and even real life experience are all made to seem less memorable and compelling.The emotions and thoughts of the characters seem so convincing that to reflect upon the fact that this is fiction whilst you are listening to it, is to entertain the unimaginable.Like certain collections of music, the recording is unimpaired by endless replaying.If I could only ever have one audio book, it would be this one."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Conrad is not only one of the finest stylists writing in the English language, he is also one of the best to tackle moral issues. A good writer, as we know, does not preach morality, but rather conjures up bits of life that really make us think about who we are. Lord Jim is the story of a man poised to be at the pinnacle of human heroism and ability, who comes face to face with the horror of his weaknesses. Jim is a guy who gives us every sign of being a hero, a reason for pride in the human race, only to take flight at the last moment. Having committed a brutal act of betrayal in a moment of weakness, he sets off to escape his conscience - running away but never quite getting away. No matter how many good things a man can do, Conrad shows us, he can undo in a few seconds.Colonialism figures heavily into the thematic core of the book. We are made to think throughout about the issue of race and racial relations. Does the Western conscience always, if even subconsciously, think itself superior or of more worth to the Eastern? Do we overlook heinous evils in others in favor of tenuous racial connections and conformist attitudes? All of this is explored in the book, as Conrad takes us on an escape from the heart of darkness."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

So I recommend being a bit skeptical about the described book condition when purchasing."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Conrad is like a Zen Master, and while this book is not the shortest introduction to his beliefs, it is one of the most comprehensive. He shows the world as it must be to an idealist, as a sea of competing thoughts, with the highest being the heroic and self-negating that is also world-embracing. He shows how human beings suffer for not having this, and how they rise in their own estimation and thus are capable of great deeds when they have it. A good read for an airplane or other long ordeal, this book seems like rambling Victorian trash until you notice its multilayered symbolism."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Joseph Conrad's novels are ambitious.The main character 'Jim' in this story tries to 'save from the fire his idea of what is his moral identity', after he failed to rescue the life of muslim pilgrims in an apparent shipwreck.He is haunted by the guilt instilled by his father's (the good old parson) religion: 'who once gives way to temptation, in the very instant hazards his total depravity and everlasting ruin.'Jim stands alone and above the 'stupid brutality of crowds', in a world where 'a massacre was a lesson, a retribution - a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our nature, which is not so very far under the surface as we like to think', where 'the Irrational lurks at the bottom of every thought, sentiment, sensation, emotion.'Joseph Conrad's vision of humanity is very pessimistic indeed.Jim's fate constitutes the bankruptcy of all that stays for 'a moral identity'. He is the lonely hero who considers that what he did was 'a more than criminal weakness', not 'honest faith' or the expression of 'the instinct of courage'.He (one of us) stood alone within the bunch of criminal whites (us) and above the innocent savages (them).For Joseph Conrad, his fate is the result of 'the implacable destiny of which we are the victims and the tools.'One of the villains in this book, Brown, foreshadows the main character in Conrad's magisterial novel 'Heart of Darkness'.This book is not without some melodramatic effects (an idyllic love affair) or superlatives ('eyes as immensely deep wells'); however, it is a great novel by an ambitious author."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Each one of us has a personal &quot;ideal&quot;...each different in its contours and each varying in its influence on our actions. For the most part, the ideal is hazy and evolving but there are elements which are distinct and rigid...and a compromise on these core principles strikes at the very root of a person's self concept. Most of us are fortunately flexible enough to &quot;adjust&quot; and carry on. For a few, however, the failure to adhere to one's own ideal is as good as a death sentence. Lord Jim is the extraordinary tale of one such extraordinary person.For me the most interesting character of the novel is the narrator himself. Jim is the focal point, of course, and an exceptional character, but quite predictable. The drama of Jim's life after the incident on the Patna is really orchestrated by Marlowe who recognizes the inevitable doom of his friend even as he tries everything in his power to stall it. It is doubtful whether he really wanted to succeed - It is clear at many points in the narrative, that Marlowe was unable to sign off on Jim's character certificate, even in his conversations with others. He represents, in a way, the conscience of the &quot;western world&quot; - the conscience Jim betrays and attempts to flee from. Jim recognizes that and so does Marlowe...but he also loves Jim...so the dilemma is really his - should he allow his friend to redeem his honour in the only acceptable manner or should he prolong Jim's onerous journey through an unforgiving life by creating an illusion of redemption, which he probably knew Jim's stint in Patusan would. He is, therefore, equally a party to the betrayal and Jim's fatal purging is also, to an extent, his own.A wonderful book and a subject equal to Conrad's literary class. The only thing that left a bad taste was the implied superiority of the Westerner's ethics and character. I guess it has to be judged in the context of a period when the &quot;sun never set on the British Empire&quot;.Vijay"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Reading Joseph Conrad is a true pleasure. His mastery of the language is unparalleled and his sentence structures, although at times dense, as often approach pure poetry. This is even more astounding given the fact that English is a second language for him. This is the story of an untested young English sailor, Jim, who has visualized himself as a man honor and bravery. When he fails miserably at the very first test of his courage, it alters all aspects of his life and his views of himself. Conrad takes us through an intricate retelling of his tale, from the point of his failure forward, through a third party, Marlow - an older sailor who befriends him."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"In the 'Author's Note' Joseph Conrad mentions the account of a friend about the comments made by a lady after having read 'Lord Jim'. She found the book morbid, he said, and Conrad wondered how she could 'have perceived anything morbid in the acute consciousness of lost honour'.While this is the novel's central theme from which flows everything else - remorse, feelings of guilt and inadequacy, the longing for atonement -, Conrad makes use of it to explore concepts of idealism and the fragility of the human psyche in the face of unexpected exigencies and paints a vivid picture of the torments they may cause, in this case for the novel's protagonist, Jim.So, is the tale of Jim's doomed trajectory after his watershed failure morbid, or is it romantic with its emphasis on honour and unfulfillable longings for ideals and purity? I find it interesting that Joseph Conrad thought it necessary to mention that anonymous quote in his opening notes to the book. Morbid? Romantic? Maybe the two sentiments are closer than one thinks in the face of unattainable ideals and the lifes lived out in their shadow.The events and the riveting tale are set in exotic locales and it has been said that Jim becoming the 'Lord' of island natives has a very loose association with real life 19th century English adventurer James Brooke, the \\"White Raja of Sarawak\\".Reading some of the other review, I noticed that this Conrad Classic is often cited as required reading in High Schools. To those who found the novel 'tedious, wordy, boring' or whatever other adjectives used to describe it, may I recommend reading it again a few decades later? Life experience and its accumulated toll will undoubtedly bring Jim's ordeal into much better perspective."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Like most of my modern classic favorites, I first read Lord Jim as a child, it was in an Illustrated Comics issue, he was my first flawed hero. As the book explores and explains more to Jim's character, it's a no-brainer--I love the book!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"\\"Lord Jim\\" is a morality tale and a story of individual redemption - Jim, as a junior officer in the merchant marine disgraces himself in a moment of crisis and spends the rest of his short life running from the resulting odium and attempting to redeem himself. Which he does, in his own eyes anyway, but his attempts to apply an individual code of honor when making decisions on behalf of others ends in tragedy.The first half of the story - the tale of Jim's disgrace and the immediate consequences - is the strongest part of the book, with the second half of the book (and some of the rich descriptive language) slightly drawn out and tedious in comparison. Unlike some reviewers, I did enjoy the technique of Marlowe narrating the long, drawn out tale of Jim to his peers - in my experience, this is the way men left to their own devices tell morality tales about their own craft. I have certainly heard enough similar stories about the failings or virtues of soldiers I have never met during long waits at an LZ or during deathly dull nights on watch (and told a few of my own as well) to appreciate why Marlowe would tell such a 'yarn' in this way, and why it would be so eagerly accepted by his peers.Readers who are only familiar with Conrad'sHeart of Darknessmay find Lord Jim a bit drawn-out by comparison, and it may have been an even better book if only the first half of the story was told. It is still a thought provoking read if you want to give some thought to the meaning and practical application of honor, responsibility and redemption."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Reading 'Lord Jim' I was struck by how similar it was in many ways to Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishment. Conrad published 'Lord Jim' as a serial that straddled the beginning of the 20th century, and seemed to be hellbent on experimenting with form and style. The fractured narrative is buried in letters, conversations, remembered stories, etc. Conrad's style made me think of modernism swallowing a romantic tale. It was likeTreasure Islandbeing eaten by a novel by 'Dostoevesky.' I loved it.It also reminded me of Pynchon's classic problem. Most people are familiar withThe Crying of Lot 49andHeart of Darknessthanks to both being popular books to include when introducing high school students and college freshmen to classic works of modern and contemporary literature. Both Conrad and Pynchon's bigger AND better stuff requires more time and work.This is a fantastic novel, and a regenerative work of art."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","review":"Looking for a ripping yarn about the sea? Don't look here. Conrad seems to go out of his way to limit suspense. He also gives us a protagonist we only know through layers of filtering. He also gives us a rather anti-heroic view of the world. NOT the formula of a bestseller. But that's not what he's trying to do.Contrary to popular opinion, I don't think Lord Jim is about struggling with guilt; it's about struggling with the thought that we don't matter one way or the other.Jim jumps ship and all the passengers live anyway. Jim stays on his island to protect his people and many of them die anyway.Jim can't save the day. Could he even ruin the day if he tried? Does one individual simply not mean much in the complex web of human events which seem ruled by fluke occurrences more than our Honor, Courage, and Duty? Are those romantic ideals like Stein's beautiful butterflies: only good after we've shot them and placed them in cages to admire in a purely clinical way? Jim can't shoot his butterflies and therefore he can't participate in this fallen world for very long.This book is also an attack on imperialism, it would seem. The natives' willing servitude to the white man rests less with the white man's superior intelligence and courage than with their misplaced idealizing of him. They worship Jim for a while because they just don't know him well enough yet. And not knowing people well enough yet is the very foundation imperialism is built upon."},{"Title":"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad.

The crew is rescued. The Patna and its passengers are also saved and the perfidy of the crew is thus exposed. Jim is shamed, both by the public board of inquiry into the incident, and because of his failure to act heroically. At the trial, Jim meets Charles Marlow, a sea captain, who narrates this story and becomes involved in Jim's life after the trial.Jim can never escape the fact of the Patna. Jim changes employment whenever knowledge of the event and his involvement in it overtakes him. Eventually, Jim endeavours to start a new life in a remote island community and ultimately fills his heroic destiny in death.Marlow's involvement in Jim's story is complex. He meets Jim at the trial, tries to piece his story together and then recounts it to acquaintances as an exchange of yarns. However, at the time of Marlow's recounting, Jim's story is not yet complete. The telling of the ending is in a manuscript to one of those who heard the story initially.It seems to me that this novel is very much about the significance, and the tragedy, of human life. Jim cannot change the fact of his involvement in the Patna, and he cannot escape from it. Nor is Jim apparently able to seek or accept any form of redemption. I am not convinced, really, that he is redeemed in death. I may change my mind.I am looking forward to reading other novels by Conrad and rereading this one.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Like many reviewers here, I have also seen the National Geographic Top 100 Adventure list (ranked #3), and the Outdoor Magazine Top 25 Outdoor Literature list (ranked #1), or even the picture of Exupery on French Franc notes (pre-Euro). But it would be narrow to read it for its rank alone. \\"Earth of Men\\" (the French title) is poetic verse, metaphorical contrasts and profound insight on what it means to be alive. Exupery captures it through flight, but planes are \\"only a tool\\" he says, a means to an end, in stars of infinite possibilities."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Fear of flying nowadays mainly involves a strong distaste for the crowded planes, fear of drawing a far too overweight passenger as your next seat companion, the comedy of the search routines prior to boarding, including a fear of more than 3 oz. of water, and the reminders over the loudspeakers about the \\"threat levels\\" to one's existence. \\"Il etait une fois...\\" once upon a time, as Saint Exupery's wonderful, classic book reminds us, there was a fear, but also the thrill of flying, and pioneering new routes for the \\"mail planes\\" of the \`20's and \`30's.The author mastered the technical skills, but also the art of flying. His book captures the sheer exuberance of flight, and the excitement of a nighttime aerial crossing of the Sahara. Likewise, he relates finding passages through the 21,000 ft Andes with a plane whose \\"ceiling\\" is 18,000 ft. Along with his technical skills, and his descriptive powers, he brings the intellect of a philosopher to his writings. Consider his rebuke to the Luddites among us: \\"Numerous, nevertheless, are the moralists who have attacked the machine as the source of all the ills we bear, who, creating a fictitious dichotomy, have denounced the mechanical civilization as the enemy of the spiritual civilization.\\" (p 43) And for those amongst us who have been thrilled to the austere beauty of the desert, including myself: \\"I shall never be able to express clearly whence comes this pleasure men take from aridity, but always and everywhere I have seen men attach themselves more stubbornly to barren land than to any other. Men will die for a calcined, leafless, stony mountain. The nomads will defend to the death their great store of sand as if it were a treasure of gold dust. And we, my comrades and I, we too have loved the desert to the point of feeling that it was there we had lived the best years of our lives.\\" (p84) Or later: \\"...it was here in the desert he possessed his veritable treasures--this prestige of the sand, the night, the silence, this homeland of wind and stars.\\" (p105)A strong theme in this book is the lost potential in each person, the contrast between what they could have become, and what they have settled for, once the routines have hardened. Consider: \\"Nobody grasped you by the shoulder while there was still time. Now the clay of which you were shaped has dried and hardened, and naught in you will ever awaken the sleeping musician, the poet, the astronomer that possibly inhabited you in the beginning.\\" (p11). He ends the book on this theme, writing of the child Mozarts throughout the world: \\"This is a life full of beautiful promise.\\" Saint-Exupery realizes he won't make it to his potential, won't soar among the stars: \\"This little Mozart will be shaped like the rest by the common stamping machine. This little Mozart will love shoddy music in the stench of night dives. This little Mozart is condemned.\\"Saint-Exupery is most famous for his children's classic, also of potential and loss, \\"The Little Prince.\\" This book is a most worthy complement for adults, particularly those who have fought the hardening of their own clay. The author lived as he wrote, perhaps taking one too many chances. His plane crashed in the Mediterranean during WW II, but his mission at the time appeared not to be related to the war, but rather the oldest and most common of peccadilloes, the pleasures of the flesh. The airport in his place of birth, Lyon, is named after him.Overall, an excellent read, even if you are stuck in the middle seat."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"An absolutely brilliant work. Keep in mind that many of the bad reviews here were for a different version/translation of this book. This one is almost twice as long and sticks far better to the author's orginal work.This collection of stories is the perfect bedtime reading. You can finish off each story in an hour or so and drift to sleep with dreams of adventure and travel. The author relates the early days of air travel, when the pilots were quite often taking their lives in their own hands each time they took flight. Crash landings in the Sahara were part of job, and rather commonplace for those daring pilots that dared to carry mail and supplies over the great desert.The author writes in a simple and magical prose that carries all readers to the co-pilot seat on these amazing true adventures.It is rare to find an individual who lived such an amazing life as Saint-Exupery, and rarer still to find one who could write about their experiences with such clarity, beauty and detail.Highly recommended.

They failed utterly to place man within the universe. Saint-Exupery lived through the same depressing times as did Sartre and Camus feeling just as lost as they did but he never gave up on living. Man defines himself by the act of living.One of the most famous passages describes how Henri Guillaumet made his way out of the Andes after a plane crash. Walking several days and nights through the snow, he refuses to stop because he knows his comrades and his wife believe that if he lives, he walks. He fell once and accepted he would die buried in the falling snow. He got up so he could wedge himself on a rock and that way his body would be found in the spring. That way his wife would be able to collect the insurance money without having to wait the statutory seven years after a mere disappearance. When Guillaumet reached the rock, he simply continued walking. \\"What I did , no animal would have done.\\" said Guillaument when found, broken but alive.We read of young peasant girls bursting with joy at caring for a pet and of soldiers fighting because that is their trade, despite knowing war is futile and horrible. Later, when Saint-Ex relates his own crash in the middle of a desert, he goes on the same way Guillaumet went. Dying of thirst, he is not even tempted to use his gun to end his suffering. Living is its own end.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Having just finished this book I feel compelled to write a review. This book is about more than flying and the adventures of the French Airmen of that era. This book is a flight into the author's views of self-fulfillment, discovery, and his opinions on humanity, specifically the willingness of certain individuals to sacrifice themselves for a cause. The author relates tales of near misses with disaster and the feelings of redemption and a renewed sense of appreciation for life. There are also times when he feels himself completely isolated from the world below since he is constantly teetering on the brink (naturally, flying was much more dangerous back then)One theme that is constantly brought up by the author is the value of human relationships and the constant struggle to make them work. The only thing truly valuable we attain in life are hard-earned friendships, especially those that share a common sense of hardship.Overall this is a very insightful book with a lot of truth. Flying is the cover theme, but the pages and words reveal so much more."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"What genre is represented by \\"Wind, Sand and Stars\\"? A memoir, a novel, a moral tale, an essay, a travelogue? It is difficult to put a label on this book, because it has a bit of each genre. Antoine de Saint-Exupery, a pilot and a poet, best known for his beautiful tale \\"The Little Prince\\", which enchanted generations of children and adults, wrote about his experience as a pilot. This is the surface of \\"Wind, Sand and Stars\\". There is much more to it, though.The book was published in 1939. It is hard to believe that on the brink of a great war in Europe, when it was already obvious that the war is inevitable, and many writers created the premonitory visions of doom, Saint-Exupery wrote with great tenderness and faith about the power of humanity.The job and life of the airplane pilot are for the author an occasion for metaphores. The flights require attention and precision in addition to the observations of nature, the rocks, sand or sea underneath, the stars, moon and sun in the sky above. There is a lot of joy in seeing the Earth from above, but the loneliness adds to the philosophical quality of long flights. Because in the 1930's the airplane technology was not very sophisticated, there were many sudden, unexpected accidents. The constant danger and many lurking traps are described with examples: the accidents of the author's colleagues, Guillaumet and Mermoz, as well as his own in Sahara, and their struggle to survive in the snow, mountains, and desert, without water, food, and rest, show humanity in a most beautiful way. As Saint-Exupery says, in the words of his fellow pilot Guillaumet, who survived in the glacier: \\"What I did, no animal would ever do\\".Saint-Exupery believed in the power of human mind and emotion, in the connection between all human beings - which is obvious when he writes about his experience with Beduins, so different and strange for the French pilot, who could not understand their culture, yet living according to equally valid moral principles and helpful in need. He criticized materialism, and although admired technology and civilization, warned against it becoming a goal in itself.Banal? Simple? Maybe, but all of us need such positive, however trivial, life philosophy, once in a while, to escape from our daily life, to reconnect and rethink our purpose."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"I believe this is the greatest book by one of the best authors of all time. To open a St. Exupery book is to think of the spring sun on a cold, cloudy January day. Where does one go from here? To St. Exupery's soliloquy on finding a meteor in the sands of the Sahara? To his tale of surviving the rigors of the desert? To his description of night over the South Atlantic?It is a question that cannot be answered. One should not even try, but should only linger rhapsodized over each description of even the most mundane things by this irresistable wordsmith. Some people never wrote badly, even once.

Although you could validly criticize the book for not providing enough biographical detail (for instance, it's not entirely clear to me how the author ended up in Spain in the middle of a war), these criticisms would really miss the essence of the book - the author's reflections on what it means to be human.For me, this book reminded me of three types of literature:(1) poetic books of wisdom, such as the Book of Proverbs orThe Prophet;(2) classic adventure books when the world was (or seemed to be) a bit larger and mysterious, such asNo Picnic on Mount Kenya: A Daring Escape, A Perilous ClimborArabian Sands (Penguin Classics); and(3) modern adventure books that combine the wilds with tremendous insight and honestly into what it means to be human, such asThe Ledge: An Adventure Story of Friendship and Survival on Mount RainierorBetween a Rock and a Hard Place.I guess the best thing I can say is that I checked this book out of the library and after reading it once I am sure that I will purchase it so I can reread it again."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Wind, Sand and Stars is the most beautifully written book.

The flight adventures are marvelously described with just enough detail to inform the nonpilots without becoming tedious. The experiences in solitude of the Sahara are vividly portrayed - you definitely can feel you are a part of the landscape. In addition to St-Ex's hallmarked &quot;idealism&quot; and childlike perspective, his thoughts on the importance of duty are equally compelling.

He was a good story teller. He had a childish romantic view of the world which is part of the charm.I think if you can't identify with him, then you won't like the story."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"I'd been meaning to read Antoine de Saint-Exupery's 1939 tale of his early flying days for many years. It's only a little book, some 120 pages long, and you can read it easily within a day. Overall, I sort of enjoyed it and the introduction by the English translator. (I read the new 1995 translation published by Penguin Paperbacks).Antoine de Saint-Exupery was an aviation pioneer and he and his friends' many crash survivals are retold in lurid detail. There are tales of fantastic escapes following mountain-side crashes in the Andes. There is also lament for those free-spirited pioneers who never returned. Even so, I wouldn't say this is the classic that many have made it out to be. It's fairly entertaining. His earlier works are supposed to be better and more fluid and I'll give them a go at a later date.But for now, the main problem I found with Wind, Sand and Stars is that it is more a collection of shorts inter-woven with Saint-Exupery's philosophical musings on life and death behind the joy-stick. As such, it isn't a tale that begins, gains momentum and races towards a final frenetic conclusion. It reads more like a series of diary entries with orders to the existential milkman thrown in between.The biggest disappointment for me was the so-called classic account of his miraculous escape from the clutches of the sandy Libyan desert. Try as he might de Saint-Exupery's writing didn't inspire the same dry-mouthed anticipation made marvellous by Camus in his shorter works.Overall, Wind, Sand and Stars is great for a lazy day in the garden when you want a bit of escapism. The world of de Saint-Exupery's, in his early pioneering days, was very different to the cushy world most of us inhabit. Where Saint-Exupery and friends risked life and limb heading off into mountainous terrain in little more than motorised kite, the biggest risk most of us ever take is deciding which stocks to buy to where to go on holiday. For this reason alone, I'd recommend giving Wind, Sand and Stars an afternoon's attention.Three/four stars."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"\\"Very pleased\\". I received the item in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I am very pleased. Thumbs up. Thank you very much."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's beginnings were not auspicious. Born to a distinguished family in turn-of the-century Lyon, Saint-Exup&eacute;ry fell short of most early measures that would define future success. He was a middle sibling to four others. His father, an esteemed count, died of a stroke in his wife's arms on the platform of the La Foux station as the eastbound train discharged its passengers on the platform. Antoine was four.The extended family retreated to a country chateau, Saint Maurice de Remens in Ain. Here, in this \\"secret kingdom\\" the children grew, guided by the nurturing hand of their creative, artistic mother. Their days were alive with exploration, animals, tales, and nighttime excursions onto the chateau's roof, prompting the installation of grills over Antoine's third-storey windows.Dreaming of becoming a naval officer, Saint-Exup&eacute;ry was refused admission to the French Naval Academy after failing prep school exams. He studied architecture. An honorable profession, this was nevertheless a diversion from his family's business roots at a time when Lyon's arrondissements were exploding with commercial and industrial possibility.But a new world opened for Saint-Exup&eacute;ry when he was diverted from architecture by military service, though his initial training was not as an aviator. His fianc&eacute;, future novelist Louise L&eacute;vque de Vilmorin, and her family, urged him to settle into a conventional career in the city, a course he attempted in his early twenties.But the magnetism of flight and adventure was too much to resist. At twenty-six Saint-Exup&eacute;ry had broken the engagement, fled the city, and become one of the pioneering pilots for the France's A&eacute;ropostale Africa service, flying the Toulouse-Casablanca-Dakar route. It was during this period, while stationed in Dakar, that he began to write to relieve his boredom and to capture the romance of flight and the desert.Most of his biographical remains are now widely known: he flew throughout South America, he fled France for America after the Nazi occupation. In America he wrote his most famous work, The Little Prince. When the U.S. entered the war, he joined the American Air Force in North Africa in 1943. In July 1944 he disappeared while on a mission to collect intelligence on German movements in the Rhone Valley. He was never seen again.Saint-Exup&eacute;ry wrote Wind, Sand, and Stars in the 1930s while a professional aviator. Attempting a flight from Canada to Patagonia, he crashed in Guatemala, his airplane overweight with fuel. He was hospitalized for weeks in Guatemala City and Mexico. Then, he convalesced in New York as the guest of Colonel William Donovan (creator of the wartime Office of Strategic Services) while finishing Wind, Sand, and Stars.The book was published in 1939 against the backdrop of a spreading conflagration in Europe and the recent Spanish Civil War, where Saint-Exup&eacute;ry had traveled as a war correspondent. Saint-Exup&eacute;ry saw his book not an adventure story, not a memoir of flight, not a paean to natural beauty - though it is all these things. Rather, he intended it as a exploration and commentary on the human condition against a panorama of the cruelty and beauty of man and nature.Wind, Sand, and Stars is, in fact, an adventure book of the highest order. These qualities deserve special attention. The book ranks third in National Geographic's list of 100 best adventure books for good reason. A fine adventure book is the culmination of an intrepid instinct, an eye for detail, a facility for description, and an appreciation of the technical mechanics of progress under difficulty. Saint-Exup&eacute;ry succeeds in each category, but sensitivity and beautiful prose are the qualities that make Wind, Sand, and Stars so readable and touching.Among the more famous chapters in all his oeuvre, Saint-Exup&eacute;ry describes the struggle of his A&eacute;ropostale colleague Henri Guillaumet in freeing himself from the wintery grip of the Andes after a plane crash. Walking days and nights through icy alps, he is driven on by the certitude that if he stops he will die and that those most beloved to him believe that if he is alive, he is walking. His mind slips. He begins losing precious artifacts: a compass, a knife. He becomes \\"his own enemy.\\" Knowing his wife will lose his pension if his body is undiscovered, Guillaumet struggles to expose his dying self on a crag, but then is impelled forward. He says, \\"What saves a man is to take a step. Then another step. It is always the same step, but you have to take it.\\" He listens to the rhythms of his own failing heart more closely than he ever listened to any airplane motor. He survives, a victory of such uniquely human will that he says, \\"I swear that what I went through, no animal would have gone through.\\"A central incident in the book describes Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's 1935 plane crash in the Libyan Sahara, between Benghazi and Cairo. At night, in zero visibility, he and his mechanic and navigator, Andr&eacute; Pr&eacute;vot, buried their Caudron C-630 Simoun into the side of a pebble-strewn dune at full speed, smashing their craft to smithereens. Miraculously, they survived. Days of torment ensued. After suffering ravages of desert heat, merciless thirst, hallucination, and with the calming certitude of the proximity of death, they are rescued by Bedouins. In the end, it was Guillaumet's example that kept him going. This unbroken chain of example, admiration, and responsibility comprise a delicate thread of dignity and honor stronger than the animal impulse to die.Among his many commentaries of the peculiarities imposed by the savagery of the desert and the influence of this unrelenting domain on its native inhabitants, Saint-Exup&eacute;ry recounts a story of three Moors flown to the French Alps and led to a tremendous waterfall. As they stood, transfixed by this alien and unimaginable cascade, their guide grew impatient.\`\\"That's all there is to see,\\" their guide had said. \\"Come.\\"\\"We must wait.\\"\\"Wait for what?\\"\\"The end.\\"They were waiting for the moment when God would grow weary of His madness. They knew Him to be quick to repent, knew He was miserly.'Despite these marvelous images, Wind, Sand, and Stars is ultimately a work of ideas and ideals. Aristotle and the existentialists would recognize his elegant disquisition on the qualities of a good life and a universe, \\"the empire,\\" created by the thoughts and actions of individuals.What are the essential qualities of struggle and purpose? \\"Prison is not a mere physical horror. It is using a pickaxe to no purpose that makes a prison; the horror resides in the failure to enlist all those who swing the pick in the community of mankind. We all yearn to escape from prison.\\"What is the lodestone of the moral compass? \\"To be a man is, precisely, to be responsible. It is to feel shame at the sight of what seems to be unmerited misery. It is to take pride in a victory won by one's comrades. It is to feel, when setting one's stone, that one is contributing to the building of the world.\\"What is the essential purpose of the human tribe? \\"To set man free it is enough that we help one another to realize that there does exist a goal towards which all mankind is striving. Why should we not strive towards that goal together, since it is what unites us all? Even the shepherd modestly watching his sheep under the stars would discover, once he understood the part he was playing, that he was something more than a servant, was a sentinel. And each sentinel among men is responsible for the whole of the empire.\\"What are the qualities of a human life well-lived? \\"What we feel when we are hungry, when we feel that hunger which...draws a man to a poem, is that the birth of man is not yet accomplished, that we must take stock of ourselves and our universe. We must send forth pontoons into the night.\\"Among his many endearing qualities, perhaps the most poignant and appreciated, is Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's modesty and pragmatism. His images are drawn from an inventory of practical experience among practical men engaged in mundane, commercial pursuits. Ultimately, he finds that purposeful work and comradeship are the font of happiness. These insights are potent and speak for themselves.Only when one has undertaken the task of translating a beautiful and complex text can its technical and aesthetic challenges be fully appreciated, so no review would be complete without a serious and purposeful acknowledgement of the contribution of Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's life-long translator, Lewis Galanti&egrave;re. An American translator of French literature and a notable playwright and journalist of his own reputation, Galanti&egrave;re also worked in Paris from 1920 to 1927. Here he came to know many French and American artists during these golden days of literature. (His correspondents included Steinbeck, Bell, Stein, Cummings, Dos Passos, Hemingway, MacLeish, Mencken, and Madox Ford.)His best known work was as Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's translator. (The archive of their correspondence includes twelve manuscripts bearing the author's and the translator's corrections in confluence.) Galanti&egrave;re delivers a stunning and beautifully poetic English rendering of Wind, Sand, and Stars. His linguistic skills are certainly masterful, but his translation is inspired by intimacy: he knew Saint-Exup&eacute;ry personally and well. Galanti&egrave;re later wrote an essay for the Atlantic [..] on the man and his wartime outlook, which drove him, ultimately, to his death. He also recalls Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's need for reassurance as a writer, remembering that Galanti&egrave;re's wife, who was fond of Saint-Exup&eacute;ry had one complaint against him: he telephoned too often in the middle of the night to read a difficult passage aloud, to work out the snarls and the cadence, and to be reassured.Together, Saint-Exup&eacute;ry and Galanti&egrave;re created a beautiful, inspiring, and accessible book, its expansive trove of joyous things refined into a book that pleases that mind and excites the heart."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"After reading this thrilling autobiographical account of the authors adventures it is easy to understand why this book has been rated by National Geographic as one of the top 10 adventure books of all time.

He looked for it and often found it outside the bounds of quotidian existence. His job as a pilot for Aeropostale, the French air mail service, offered him a unique perspective as he encountered the elements up close and personal in small planes he guided over vast deserts, oceans and mountains, and through fog, storms and, in a memorable account, a cyclone. His survival depended upon a heightened awareness of nature's elements. His was a life lived large and he knew it; he pities the poor bureaucrat's confined existence; he pities even more the child who with the right \\"gardener\\" could become a prince or another Mozart but who is groomed rather to lead a circumscribed life.His narrative never bogs as he connects the concrete elements of nature with abstract sentiments. He renders his adventures vividly, especially the climatic chapter in which he and his mechanic survive a crash in the Sahara with almost no provisions. A year after that, in 1936, he goes off to Spain and the Civil War to learn why it is that mankind reaches the flash point of war and willingly puts itself in harm's way. That experience and the lessons it divulges comprise the last chapter. Among his often surprising observations is the note on how wild geese flying overhead can stir domestic birds below.The author speaks in the idiom of a masculine age and a self-assured European culture. The idiom is noticeable but does not diminish the vision or lyricism of the book. I read the 1967 Harvest edition of the book that offered a translation that preserved the authentic voice of the book."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"It is not exaggeration to say that the reading of four books--one of them \\"The Little Prince\\" by St. Exupery--changed my life.

I can't imagine, as St. Exupery relates in one tale, a world where an enemy Arab army--forced into a very temporary, very awkward alliance with French soldiers--appeals to the French for a resupply of ammunition spent in that defense. And the French officer--in gratitude for that temporary support, yet knowing the ammunition would likely be used against his own men--complied!This past world seems so unreal to me, who reads.

With elegant, nearly poetic writing, he presents a small collection of stories from a lifetime of philosophy and adventure. Saint-Exup?ry was a French pilot who flew for the postal service A?ropostale in the 1920s, a time period when aviation was still a revolutionary and dangerous activity. Any fears he had were shadowed by his absolute love of flying and passion for soaring high above the earth, away from the material desires and violence of society. This endearing relationship between Saint-Exup?ry and his aircraft shows one of the many ways, as Wind, Sand, and Stars documents, that he finds happiness in his everyday life."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Maybe something lost in translation.

Written more as poetry than prose, the author provides reflections on life and death and the reasons that early flight pioneers braved their profession and could not do anything else. While he describes exploits of his friends as those that test the limits of endurance, he describes his own heroic exploits much more matter-of-factly, even regarding his near death after a crash in the deserts of Egypt. The following is a typical reflection:\\"Once again I had found myself in the presence of a truth and had failed to recognize it. Consider what had happened to me: I had thought myself lost, had touched the very bottom of despair; and then, when the spirit of renunciation had filled me, I had known peace. I know now what I was not conscious of at the time - that in such an hour a man feels that he has finally found himself and become his own friend. An essential inner need has been satisfied, and against that satisfaction, that self-fulfillment, no external power can prevail. Bonnafous, I imagine, he who spent his life racing before the wind, was acquainted with this serenity of spirit. Guillaumet, too, in his snows. Never shall I forget that, lying buried to the chin in sand, strangled slowly to death by thirst, my heart was infinitely warm beneath the desert stars.\\"Antoine and his friends flew the early mail routes from and to France, Spain, Africa, and were conjoined to discover workable routes in South America.

He was a mail carrier in Europe, South America and the Sahara in the days when a pilot got his weather report by looking at the sky and found an airport by looking out the window. Flying in those days was truly a adventure and Saint-Exupery tells some exciting tales of storms in Patagonia and a crash in the desert of Libya. All of this is invested with metaphysical musings which would be mundane if he were not such a good writer.Saint-Exupery disappeared during World War II while flying a reconnaissance mission over the Mediterranean.

He wrote The Little Prince, a children's book that sold 200,000 copies in the U.S. alone in one year several years ago, and was also the author of several novels and memoirs, all relating to flying, of which this is one. The author was MIA over his beloved France while flying for the Free French Air Force in 1944 (after having to argue to be allowed to fly in combat; he was considered a national treasure). It appears the site of the wreck was discovered in the water just off the Riviera a couple of years ago, though no one's certain.Wind, Sand and Stars is a recounting of several episodes in Saint-Exupery's life as a pilot, told to illustrate his view of the world, and especially his opinions of what makes life worth living, and who we are or should be. He was a wonderfully insightful individual, and his prose and ideas are the sort of thing you'll carry with you for years. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"The essays and anecdotes in this volume are true gems to be enjoyed slowly, recalled fondly and shared often.Despite the relative infancy of the aviation industry at the time he composed them, Saint-Ex clearly understood that flying - especially the type of long and dangerous kind that he was engaged in - was both a metaphor and a brilliant illumination into the nature of the human condition.Like flying into uncharted territory, our journey through life is fraught with perils, faced mostly alone and with few witnesses to our acts of courage or cowardice. However, instead of facing up to this fact, Saint-Ex points out how &quot;modern&quot; culture consists of ever more elaborate denials of this basic fact: we have been indoctrinated with the goal of spending our lives working solely to achieve the most comfortable, painless, risk-free existence possible. And we continue to do so, much to our detriment.These essays are skillful and evocative arguments that! ! only when we face up to, and acknowledge our tenuous and perilous existence, can we truly appreciate what it means to be alive. Saint-Ex does a wonderful job in writing about what has become important to him: experiencing the majestic beauty and power of the earth and nature, what the existentialists would call &quot;being authentic&quot;, and the friendship and cameraderie of the pilots and people he has met on his journeys.&quot;Men travel side by side for years - each locked up in his own silence... till danger comes.

After reading Wind, Sand and Stars one has a sense that this writer/philosopher, who is probably most well known for his fable The Little Prince, was well prepared for his life to end in this way.In the opening lines of the original French version Saint-Exupery writes:\\"The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books.Because it resists us. Man discovers himself when he measureshimself against the obstacle\\"Wind, Sand and Stars is intensely autobiographical as it tells us of this man's adventures from his beginnings as a pilot with the air mail service over France, Spain and North Africa before World War I, through to his musings as an observer of the Spanish Civil War. But far more than an adventurer, Saint-Exupery writes like a poet and has the heart of a philosopher. This wonderful book (a credit to the translator from the original French) has incredibly rich descriptive passages in which he lays out for the reader the details observed in the natural world and the response that these evoke in his mind, heart and soul.In one section of the book (which a reader familiar with The Little Prince cannot help but conclude was inspirational for that work) Saint-Exupery describes at length his near-death experience after crashing in the Libyan desert, and wandering for days without water or hope:\\"Apart from your suffering, I have no regrets. All in all, it has beena good life. If I got free of this I should start right in again. A mancannot live a decent life in cities, and I need to feel myself live. Iam not thinking of aviation.

But the aeroplane is a means of gettingaway from towns and their book-keeping and coming to grips withreality.\\"Wind, Sand and Stars is not an easy read.

Well worth reading, this book is a delight for anyone who seeks beauty in the written word."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"What is truely remarkable about this book are two things :(a) It provides a vision for mankind which reconciles our need for progress with our (recent!) roots of self sufficiency, community and coexistence with nature. It is a vision desperately in need of voice in these doomed decades of the twighlight of the industrial age. The vision is one of courage to challenge the limits of our secure but meaningless lives and our tamed ambitions. The strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity, when we DARE to challenge ourselves to truely live our lives.Two passages stick out in my mind to illustrate this underlying theme. In the introduction to the text, Exupery recalls flying over the empty landscape of Argentina; each of the lights of the houses, he recalls, clung to the fragile earth, is a &quot;miracle of consciousness&quot;. In the second, he describes his comrades' desperate five day walk to safety after crashing in the wilderness of Patagonia. On reaching safety he said, &quot;no animal would have gone through what I have have been through&quot; (paraphrase). A sentence which returned things to their true heirarchy, adds Exupery.A vision of man's ascendancy of the beast; a challenge to man to not live as caged animal in robot cities.(b) The other thing, of course, and more important perhaps, is the beauty of the prose. Full of pronouncements and insights (unlike any other book!) it still flows as a story, full of emotion. In particular in the desert scenes, each sentence transports you in time and space and impacts upon your every feeling. For sections of the book, page after page, each and every sentence has a resonance which brings waves euphoria and despair. To drink water, after reading the desert chapters, is to experience the joy of life!"},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"We usually assume that in order to appreciate literature we must read it in the original, but somehow St. Exupery translates as genuine poetry. This book, written in 1941, shortly before his disappearance, is an essential background text for both *The Little Prince* and *Night Flight.* St.Exupery is to the air what Joseph Conrad is to the sea: an explicator for a world that most of us never enter. As a pioneer aviator, St. Exupery experienced the &quot;man confronts the elements&quot; of nascent aviation; as a writer, he makes a gift those experiences, processed through the blender of his own intelligence and sensitivity, to the reader. *Wind, Sand and Stars* is not only about aviation; it's about life. &quot;There are two hundred million men in Europe whose existence has no meaning and who yearn to come alive,&quot; St.Exupery writes. &quot;Industry has torn them from the idiom of their peasant lineage and has locked them in those enormous ghettos that are like railway yards heaped with blackened trucks. Out of the depths of their slums these men yearn to be awakened.&quot; Are we so different today? The philosophy of *Wind, Sand and Stars* is as applicable now as it was then and, because it is philosophical, because the author not only perceives a different world but delves, analyzes it and divulges its meaning, the book remains a classic for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"&quot;The airplane has unveiled for us the true face of the earth,&quot; writes Saint-Exupery; this book unveils for the reader the true face of man. The grim heat of the desert, the stench of diesel, the surreal terror of night and storms, and the elation of flight: his prose evokes all of these with shimmering fluidity.Just as the most rudimentary of charcoal sketches often manage to capture the very essence of its subject in a few deft strokes, so too do the struggles and joys of pilots in North Africa and South America manage to capture the essence of man, of his relationship with machine, with nature, and with himself in this taut narrative..Non-pilots will feel that they have been inducted into a world vibrantly unique yet achingly familiar, pilots will recall afresh the sensations of defying gravity with steel, wires, and bravery; all readers, however, will find themselves murmuring &quot;yes, that's it exactly.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"As an office worker I often find myself escaping to books of adventure and travel. Amongst such books the works of Antoine de Saint-Exupery are amongst the finest. Saint-Exupery was a pilot in the fledgling airline industry in the 1920's and 1930's flying mail routes in exotic locales such as Spain, France's African Colonies and South America and then an officer in the French and Free French Air Force during World War Two. But equally importantly Saint-Exupery was an amazing storyteller and philosopher who between tales of plane crashes and amazing escapes reflects on questions such as why do men put their life at risk, when can we say that we truly experience what it means to be alive and what is mans relationship with technology and progress.If you are interested in the 1920's, aviation or simple want to read the thoughts of a man who led an extraordinary life, you will enjoy Wind, Sand and Stars."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"This is my first time reading a book from Antoine de Saint Exupery, and I am glad to say that it was a fantastic experience. I chose this book for an english assignment, and was pleased to find that it was a good choice! However, as I am a High School Junior, some aspects of the book kind of flew over my head. I chose the book looking for a good adventure novel, and the aspect of flying got me very interested. I also liked how Exupery laid out the book. By sectioning off the different ideas, it made the concepts a little more easy to grasp. As interesting as the novel was, however, it took me forever to actually get into the text. The introduction, and begining points seemed to drag on, and I was tempted to skip the begining in order to get into the action. All in all, I eventually got into the book, and started to enjoy it. After reading Wind, Sand and Stars, I am tempted to go out and read some of his other works."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"As one of France's premier authors of the 20th century, Antoine de Saint-Exupery's \\"Wind, Sand, and Stars\\" is arguably his greatest work among the several outstanding pieces of literature that he managed to publish before losing his life during a reconnaissance mission in WWII.Having served as a mail pilot whose routes took him across the Mediterranean to the African continent & later across the Atlantic to South America, Saint-Exupery demonstrates how aviation ---a profession that often allows for long periods of solitude and contemplation--- led him to make his most formidable discoveries of the enigma that we call \\"life.\\" Here, we see through the eyes of a pilot as he remembers not only his perilous travels, but his observations about duty, courage, love, war, sacrifice, death, and other fundamental issues that we encounter during our existence on this planet."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Back in the fifties and early sixties, this book was part of my high school curriculum. At first students had a hard time with the vocabulary but that was overcome by the understandings they gained. This book talks about what it is to be a human, not necessarily a man. These are very modest heroes who do their job without complaint, without wheedling, without excuses. They do these incredible things: fly lonely routes of exploration, survive desert crashes because they know their colleagues expect them to survive. This is about men who ask for nothing, no favors, only to do their jobs. It is a beautifully written book that todays youth can never understand because it is about dedication, and endurance, about getting the job done no matter the cost because others are depending on you. The fact they know this that can rely on you is what makes an individual a hero."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Antoine clearly expresses the true and connecting value of our humanity, uncovers for us what is just below the surface, and UNITES US all with clear examples of self truths that we have missed all along the way. This is one of the most powerful and interesting books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"As a fan of history and a lover of aviation, I very much enjoyed the reflective word that has stood the test of time. I would consider this a staple read up there with Ernest Gaan."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"I HAVE QUOTED PORTIONS OF THIS BOOK (ALWAYS WITH THE CREDIT DUE) IN SPEECHES GIVEN OVER THE YEARS,,,AND HAVE QUOTED FROM &#34;WIND, SAND AND STARS&#34; IN MY BOOK, &#34;A COACHES JOURNEY,&#34; ABOUT THE KIDS SITTING AROUND ME ON &#34;THIS OLD (OMNIBUS) SCHOOL BUS.&#34; THIS BOOK IS, FOR ME, A MIND STRETCHING READ!"},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"This is my book that I read, re-read, and sometimes memorize passages from--and since it is my favorite book, I've noticed how often quotes from it appear in a botanical garden, along a desert trail, or in another author's work. It is eloquent and timeless. It tells of a man's thoughts as he journeys in a military plane over hostile territory during war when flying was a new adventure. His writing captures the beauty of the desert, his thoughts alone at night, and his anticipation for another day of flight. He shares with us the essence of his life."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"I read The Little Prince and didn't like it, so was leery about reading this book by Saint-Exupery. But this is a memoir for grownups and is fascinating. I try to imagine what it must have been like to fly over the Sahara in the 1920s and can't do it. In fact, I'm not sure I would have had the guts to do it then. But if I had, I hope I would have paid attention and appreciated every facet of flight the way he did. Flying gives you a sense of the world that you don't get on the ground and Saint-Exupery appreciated that."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"This is a book that gives you a sense of serenity and yet it is filled with action and tough drama, a real classic."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"This is one of literature's great observations of life, by someone with the adventure to live it, the insight to see it, and and the skill to write it down. Saint-Exupery flew in the early days of aviation, something that took courage in itself. Then he compounded the adventure by flying in Africa, which was by its nature hostile terrain with many hostile inhabitants. Yet he took the time to live what he was doing and to observe the beauty and absurdity of his vocation. Even in English it's a beautiful study of man and flight -- and a great collection of stories to boot."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Wind, Sand and Stars is very well written, in a style that helps the reader visualize the great adventures these early pilots experienced. I enjoyed the stories about his fellow pilots, flying in storms, being in Africa, etc. I wondered if they missed home at all, but decided having the vantage point of being airborne, the earth became home."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Though not quite as charming as \\"The Little Prince\\", this book is an interesting read, filled with oft-quoted bits of philosophy. In it Saint-Ex describes his earliest days flying the mail from France to west coast of Africa, and his affection for the desert. The last chapter, about the Spanish Civil War in 1936, seems out of place and somewhat incongruous, as it barely mentioned either Africa or flying."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"I can't believe this book is rated so highly! I though it was awful and found the writing very boring. I would read several pages and completely forget what I just read. There were a few good parts, but every time the author would start to draw you in so you feel involved with a character he would stop and completely change subjects. Don't bother with this book. I would highly recommend &quot;West With The Night&quot; instead if you're interested in pilot stories of this era."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"Perhaps the translation was bad? After all, the book won a big prize in France. But for me the prose was pedestrian when not purple. The tone was basically puffery for being a pilot. This is the sort of book that would likely excite a schoolboy or girl who is full of romance for adventure. But not for the mature."},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"I thought the book was horrible cuz it was nothing that i thought was exciting and also cuz it was very hard to read i hated it but that is my opinion but everyone i asked said they thought the same thing i just said!!!"},{"Title":"Wind, Sand and Stars","review":"I absolutely felt lifted above the earth, into the French author's big world view of 1936, as he spoke of his adventures and thoughts about life from the vantage point of an early aviator.
